The company had activities in electric motors and other power electrical equipment, industrial controls and automation, hydraulic pumps, and included equipment for the nuclear industry. In 1986 the company divested its loss making railway traction activities to Alsthom. The group's telephony business, unsuccessful in comparison to Matra, was sold to Bosch in 1988. In 1992 the activities of Jeumont-Schneider Industrie relating to nuclear power were taken over by Framatome.

In 1898 a new church was built, and in 1908 St John's became a separate parish. It was decided to build a new church, the foundation stone of which was laid on 27 May 1911. It was designed by the architects Austin and Paley of Lancaster. The new church was consecrated on 1 October 1912 by the Rt Revd Edmund Knox, bishop of Manchester. There had been plans to build a west tower but, when the funds were raised for this in the 1950s, it was discovered that the foundations were inadequate, and a new northwest porch was built instead. This was opened in 1961. The church was declared redundant on 1 March 2006, and was demolished in 2009. Its reredos was moved to St Margaret's Church, Oldham. Architecture The church was constructed in stone, its architectural style being late Perpendicular.

Treganza (March 24, 1876 in Colorado - July 18, 1944 in San Diego, California), was an American architect and ornithologist in the early 19th century. Architectural career Treganza trained at a technical school in Healdsburg, California and then took architectural classes under William S. Hebbard. He was later employed in San Diego, California for Hebbard's firm he had formed with Irving Gill (Hebbard & Gill) where he learned contemporary architectural styles, including modern, craftsman and prairie school styles. He moved to Salt Lake City in 1900 and formed Ware & Treganza with Walter E. Ware, a partnership that continued for 25 years from 1901 to 1926. Treganza and Ware were prolific designers during a building boom in Utah. One of his first works was designing the home of an artist and friend John Hafen, which still stands in Springville, Utah and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as John Hafen House. Treganza has many of his architectural designs listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places with his design partner Ware. In 1926 he moved with his family to Florida for a short time before returning to Lemon Grove, California. In California, Treganza continued to design many civic buildings and homes in the Spanish revival style such as the MacGregor house in Lemon Grove and the former San Diego Police Department in San Diego. Treganza was a member of the American Institute of Architects from 1921 until his death in 1944. Ornithology Treganza was an avid birder throughout his life. The subspecies Ardea herodias treganzai, commonly known as the \\"Treganza blue heron\\" was discovered by Treganza on Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake in 1907. Treganza, with his family amassed a collection of 30,000 bird eggs from around the world that have since been portioned out into various museums. Treganza and his second wife, Antwonet Kaufman, were both active members of the Cooper Ornithological Club and she wrote a weekly birding column in the San Diego Union for many years between 1926 and 1940. Personal life Treganza married Alma Stevens, who died at the age of 34 in San Diego in 1910. They were the parents of Mary E. and Josephine E. Treganza. He later remarried to Antwonet Kaufman and they were the parents of Dr. Amorita Treganza a noted pediatric optometrist in San Diego (and who the Annual Treganza Essay Contest in Lemon Grove is named after), Ad√°n Treganza a well known anthropologist at San Francisco State University who the Treganza Anthropology Museum is named after, and Adalaida Maria Treganza a mother of four and an accomplished elementary school educator who taught in East San Diego County for twenty-five years. Treganza also founded the Lion's Club in Salt Lake City in 1922.

The Bathgate Ward gained an additional seat for the 2012 elections. JAMAL The election saw Labour remain the largest party on the Council as they gained 2 seats. The Scottish National Party also made 2 net gains and significantly increased their vote share, outpolling Labour in terms of votes cast. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party retained their single seat on the Council and so to did the Independents. The Action to Save St. John's Hospital group were completely wiped out from the authority losing all of their 3 seats. Following the election the Labour formed a minority administration with the support of the Conservative and Independent Councillors. This replaced the SNP minority administration which had been supported by the Conservative and Action to Save St. John's Hospital group Councillors from 2007-2012.

He was the first Chairman of Committees of the Legislative Council. Born in England to Scottish parents, he had a military career spanning 23 years before arriving in New Zealand. Early life The Cliffs in Nelson, 1878 watercolour, possibly showing Richmond's house Richmond was born in 1801 in Salisbury, England. His father was Major Richmond from Kilmarnock, Scotland, and he served with the Royal Scots Greys. He was educated at the Royal Military College from 1814 and had a total of 23 years of active army service. He joined the Cape Corps in South Africa in 1817. From the following year, he served with the 11th Regiment of Foot, where he gained the rank of a Captain in 1826. He served in Portugal in 1828‚Äì1829 before he went to the Ionian Islands as an administrator from 1829 to 1838, where he lived on Paxos. In 1838 or 1839, he was Deputy Judge Advocate in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, for the 96th Regiment of Foot. He went with the regiment to New South Wales in 1839. Richmond married Mary Smith in 1830. They had one daughter and one son, Andrew Richmond. Life in New Zealand The family came out to New Zealand in 1840 for Richmond to investigate land claims as a commissioner. The family lived in Wellington for some time and used Douglas Mary McKain for their health needs. During the time of the Wairau Affray, he managed to maintain order in Wellington together with Arthur Edward McDonogh. However, McDonogh swore in volunteers as special constables and supported the installations of defences. This resulted in Richmond succeeding McDonogh as Chief Police Magistrate for the Southern District in mid-1843, as the government regarded McDonogh actions as \\"extremely injudicious\\". Richmond was further promoted to become Superintendent in early 1844. The Southern District was the area to the south of Cape Egmont. In his role, he was only responsible to the Governor (first Robert FitzRoy and then George Grey) and the Colonial Secretary (Andrew Sinclair) in Auckland. With the arrival of Edward John Eyre as Governor of New Munster, Richmond became resident magistrate at Nelson. From 1853 to 1858, Richmond was Commissioner of Crown Lands in Nelson. He lived at The Cliffs in Nelson. Richmond was appointed by George Grey to the New Zealand Legislative Council on 23 June 1853. He retained his membership until his death. From 1865 until 1879, he was the first Chairman of Committees. In 1860, he was awarded Companionship of the Order of the Bath (CB) for his military services. He died on 5 March 1887 aged 86 at his home in Nelson following a long illness and having been unconscious for the previous five days. He was buried at Wakapuaka Cemetery.

Description A relatively small, mainly black spider wasp with yellowish tinged wings, which have a variable amount of dark colour at the tips. Females are around 6.0-8.8mm in length, males 3.5 -5.6mm. In females there is an orange-red band on the pronotum and this reduces in extent as one move southwards in New Zealand, until it is barely visible in specimens from latitude 42¬∞S, other coloured parts of the female such as the antennae bases also reduce in coloration the further south the specimen is obtained. Males are far less variable. This pattern appears to be an example of Allen's rule and is seen in other New Zealand Pompilids but is less marked in E. insularis due to its greater extent of sexual dimorphism with the males always being more uniformly dark. Biology E. insularis females hunt, usually in sunshine for retreat-making spiders in the concealed places where female spiders retreat to, such as rolled dead leaves; hollow plant stems; flax bushes; dead rolled fronds of tree-ferns; the abandoned cocoons of the bag- moth Liothula omnivora; deserted galleries of wood-boring beetles; and even the empty hatched galls of the moth Morova subfasciata in Muehlenbeckia australis and beneath loose bark on tree trunks. When she finds a female prey spider the female E. insularis runs at it and as the spider lifts its legs to adopt a defensive posture she stings it and lays her egg before moving away. The paralysis is light and the host usually recovers quickly and resumes movement. E. insularis does not normally build a nest but the host is usually parasitised on or near its retreat or some time after being parasitised spins its own retreat, the wasp larva being quite tolerant of the host spider's movement. If the host was gravid any eggs laid may be eaten by the wasp larva as well as the host herself. Prey species are known to come from a number of genera of spiders including Trite and Clubiona. Taxonomy E. insularis was placed by Evans in the subgenus Epipompiloides due to the structure of the male's subgenital plate which is very similar to that of E. bushi. of southern Australia but Evans (1972) stated that the subgenera of the Australian and Papuan Epipompilus are of dubious validity.Evans H.E. 1972 Revision of the Australian and New Guinean Species of Epipompilus (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae) Pacific Insects 14 (1) : 101-131 E. australis is the type species of the genus Epipompilus.

Some examples of general classes are listed below: = Medicine = * Amino acids * Biopharmaceuticals * Cytokines * Fusion proteins * Growth factors * Monoclonal antibodies * Vaccines = Food and beverage = * Amino acids * Enzymes * Protein supplements = Industrial applications that employ cells and/or enzymes = * Biocementation * Bioremediation * Detergents * Plastics Unit operations A partial listing of unit operations utilized during biomanufacturing includes the following: * Blood plasma fractionation * Cell culture * Cell separation, such as filtration and centrifugation * Fermentation * Homogenization * Column chromatography * Ultrafiltration and/or diafiltration * Clarification, such as filtration * Formulation * Filling vials or syringes for injectable medicines Equipment and facilities Equipment and facility requirements are dictated by the product(s) being manufactured. Process equipment is typically constructed of stainless steel or plastic. Stainless steel equipment can be cleaned and reused. Some plastic equipment is disposed of after a single use. Stainless Steel Bioreactors Products manufactured for medical or food use must be produced in facilities designed and operated according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations. Cleanrooms are often required to control the levels of particulates and microorganisms. Sterilization and aseptic processing equipment are required for production of injectable products. Employment Skilled professionals are required for positions throughout the life cycle of a biomanufacturing product, which includes: * Research * Product development * Process development * Preclinical evaluation * Clinical trials * Engineering * Production * Supply Chain Management * Validation * Quality Control * Quality Assurance * Materials Management * Sales Details for some of these positions are listed in ‚ÄúThe Model Employee,‚Äù published by the North Carolina Biotechnology Center. In addition, the North Carolina Association for Biomedical Research (NCABR) maintains the website About Bioscience that offers free online videos on various careers. Education and training Several academic institutions have developed curricula and built facilities to provide education and training in biomanufacturing to students from community colleges, universities, and/or industry. NCBioImpact, established in 2004, is an example of a comprehensive state-wide training network. Member institutions Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC) at North Carolina State University, (BRITE) at North Carolina Central University, and North Carolina Community College System‚Äôs BioNetwork operate multidisciplinary centers dedicated to workforce development for the biomanufacturing industry. MiraCosta College and Solano College in California developed the first bachelor of science degree in biomanufacturing. The degree is largely lab- based and is built on a contextualized science and statistics backbone. The upper division classes recognize the unique environment of biological production where the process sciences and technology thrive in partnership with quality and regulatory compliance.

Once the outer shell of concrete and insulation had hardened, the balloon was removed. The Double Bubble House consisted of two single units joined by a conventional single- story structure. Each Bubble House contained two bedrooms and one bath, a kitchen, living room, pantry with refrigerator, and patio. All four houses, intended as \\"alternative wartime housing\\", were similar to the twelve Neff- designed bubble houses, ten doubles and two singles, previously built by Case in Falls Church, Virginia. The houses were the subject of a 1944 Architectural Record article.Airform House for a Desert Colony, Architectural Record, July 1944, pp. 81‚Äì83.

O. Scanlan; 1937 ‚Äì 2 May 2017) was an Irish circuit theorist and electronic engineering professor.https://www.leeds.ac.uk/secretariat/obituaries/2017/scanlan_sean.html Biography After receiving the BE degree in Electrical Engineering from University College Dublin (UCD) in 1959, Scanlan worked for a number of years in the U.K. at Mullard, Redhill, a leading industrial research laboratory, and received his PhD from the University of Leeds in 1966. He soon acquired a formidable reputation as a scholar of the highest standing and in 1968 was appointed to the Chair of Electronic Engineering at the University of Leeds at the age of 31. He left Leeds to take up the newly created Chair of Electronic Engineering at UCD in 1973, and later became Head of the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering. He retired from this position in 2002 and was then an Emeritus Professor at UCD. Throughout his career Scanlan solved some of the most important circuit theoretic challenges of the time. Initially he contributed to the theory of high frequency transistor amplifiers and oscillators, and that of tunnel diode amplifiers. After making a number of fundamental contributions to the synthesis of lumped networks, he turned to the synthesis of distributed circuits, then exercising the minds of the leading circuit theorists, and working with David Rhodes produced what remain the most important results in distributed circuit synthesis. These methods continue to be central to the design of microwave filters for the most challenging applications. He also made important contributions to the fields of digital filters and switched-capacitor filters, where he proved the existence of an exact synthesis for switched-capacitor state-variable filters with arbitrary attenuation characteristics, previously thought impossible. Scanlan founded the successful International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications and served as Editor from 1973 until 2006, and was later an Honorary Editor for many years. He was also one of the founders of the biannual European Conferences on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD) and served as the Chairman of the first ECCTD in 1972. These conferences have provided an important vehicle for international scientific collaboration within the field; this was particularly significant at a time when collaboration within Europe was not as straight forward as it later became. Like the journal, the conferences have become ever broader in the scope of the applications represented. Sean Scanlan was a former President of the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) (1993‚Äì1996), a life fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and was a recipient of the Golden Jubilee Medal of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, and of a RIA Gold Medal.

Les Whitten (February 21, 1928 ‚Äì December 2, 2017) was an American investigative reporter at the Washington Merry-Go-Round under Jack Anderson, as well as translator of French poetry by Baudelaire and influential novelist of Horror and Science Fiction books..  Background  Leslie Hunter Whitten, Jr., was born on February 21, 1928, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father was an electrical engineer and executive with the manufacturer Graybar. His mother was a Latin teacher. He grew up in Washington, DC, and attended the Woodrow Wilson High School. \\"From the time I was 18, I wanted to be a poet,\\" Whitten said later in life. Whitten started at Lehigh University by majoring in civil engineering. After three semesters he left school, did a stint in the U.S. Army, and moved to Paris to become a poet. Returning to Lehigh, he changed his major to English and Journalism, became the editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, and graduated magna cum laude in 1950..  Career  = Journalism = Whitten worked for Radio Free Europe in Munich (here, showing before and after images of bomb damage to Munich's Altstadt during World War II) Whitten then moved to Mexico and again to Paris, continuing to try to be a writer, before shifting back to journalism in order to support his new family. He then joined the Munich office of Radio Free Europe in 1951 (or 1952), where he worked until 1957. Between 1957 and 1969, he worked for International News Service and United Press International and covered wars in the Dominican Republic and Vietnam.  Washington Merry-Go-Round  In the 1960s, Whitten worked for Jack Anderson, who took over the Washington Merry-Go-Round from founder Drew Pearson in 1969 (here, Pearson stands left with U.S. President Lyndon Johnson in 1964) By 1969, Whitten, now an investigative reporter, had worked for Washington Post and Hearst newspapers and joined the Washington Merry-Go-Round under Jack Anderson, following the death of Anderson's business partner and the column's founder, Drew Pearson. Staff included Brit Hume (later a Fox News anchor) and Jon Lee Anderson (later staff writer for The New Yorker). Coverage by the Washington Merry-Go-Round included a CIA plot to assassinate Fidel Castro and Nixon's secret foreign policy shift to Pakistan from India. Whitten's specific assignments included investigating the private lives of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and top aide Clyde Tolson.  Watergate  During Watergate, Mark Feldstein‚Äîauthor of \\"Poisoning the Press: Richard Nixon, Jack Anderson and the Rise of Washington's Scandal Culture.\\"‚Äîclaimed that Whitten was known to have threatened at least one of his sources by saying \\"If you don't give this to me, I'll say it came from you, but, if you give it to me, we'll have lunch and I'll say it came from 'a source near the White House'.\\"  \\"Aspirin Roulette\\"  The Nixon administration had the CIA trail Whitten and Anderson. G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt even plotted to assassinate Anderson by using LSD (described by Liddy as \\"Aspirin Roulette\\"). Later, Liddy recalled in memoirs, they rejected the placing of poisoned aspirin in Anderson's medicine cabinet for two reasons: it might endanger family members ‚Äì and might take months to work.  \\"Free Les Whitten\\"  In 1973, FBI agents arrested Whitten and Hank Adams as they helped load stolen government documents into his car, earlier taken from the Bureau of Indian Affairs by Native American activists after the Trail of Broken Treaties protest and occupation of the BIA offices. Whitten faced indictment in a First Amendment and ten years in jail. Reporter in Washington wore \\"Free Les Whitten\\" buttons; Herblock drew a political cartoon about him. To secure a government witness for Whitten, Jack Anderson asked Interior Secretary Rogers Morton to \\"slip me some confidential memos on what you've done\\" against Native Americans. Secretary Morton complied: Anderson told Whitten, \\"If this ever comes to trial we're going to have a heck of a witness for your defense.\\"  The National Suggestion Box  In 1975, Whitten and Anderson started another project, called \\"The National Suggestion Box\\", headed by Marty Devolites. From offices in Washington, DC, it conducted on the ground research on topics suggested by the general public then investigated by researchers on staff including Joanne Patti Munisteri. Reports were culled from its research for short spots on the Good Morning America TV show and other media Anderson was responsible for in print, radio and TV. = Writing = Whitten translated into English the poems of Charles Baudelaire (here, photo by √âtienne Carjat, 1863) Whitten wrote nearly a dozen novels‚Äìpolitical thrillers, horror, and science fiction ‚Äì and translated poetry by Baudelaire from French into English. In 1976, his book Conflict of Interest met with such success that by 1978 he had stepped away from journalism to concentrate on his own writing.. A review of Whitten's book The Lost Disciple, this article also includes some biographical detail about Whitten. He wrote multiple novels, as well as other books including a children's book, a biography of lawyer F. Lee Bailey, and a translation of French poet Charles Baudelaire, in his spare time while working as a journalist and then full-time later. His 1967 Gothic horror novel Moon of the Wolf became a made-for-television film, also called Moon of the Wolf, broadcast in 1972..  Personal and death  On November 11, 1951, Whitten married Phyllis Webber (born August 6, 1928) in Paris. The couple had three sons. The Whittens were active in the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, DC. They also supported the arts, including ballet and opera. Whitten died age 89 on December 1, 2017, of sepsis in a hospital in Adelphi, Maryland. = Phyllis Webber = Phyllis Webber, who hailed from Schefferstown, PA, earned a degree in Education from Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and worked with preschool children at the Henry Street Settlement in New York City. When the couple moved to Washington, DC, in 1959, she continued to work in education. In 1973, she became director of the Suburban Nursery School of Bethesda, Maryland, until her retirement in 1993. In 1996, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Maryland Council of Parent Participant Nursery Schools. She died on January 11, 2017.  Legacy  Whitten's The Progeny of the Adder (1965) appears on Stephen King's list of essential horror novels in his non-fiction book Danse Macabre (here, King in 2007) In 1978, Jack Anderson called Whitten \\"the best reporter in the country\\" and said that Whitten had worked on nearly all stories for a decade at the Washington Merry- Go-Round. New York Times journalist Tom Buckley once called him Jack Anderson's \\"senior ferret\\". The Weekly Standard credits Whitten for having \\"reinvented Horror and Science Fiction\\" book genres. The newspaper relates that the vampire horror story The Progeny of the Adder (1965) influenced the 1970s television series Kolchak: The Night Stalker, which in turn influenced the 1990s television series The X-Files. Stephen King listed it among essential horror novels in his non-fiction book Danse Macabre.  Works  Fiction: * Progeny of the Adder (Crime Club by Doubleday, 1965).

He designed numerous buildings of diverse styles and functions that remain standing, many of which are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Training Ware received the majority of his training working at the Union Pacific railroad's Omaha drafting office between 1880 and 1888. He also did some early architectural work in Denver, Colorado. Career Ware arrived in Salt Lake City in 1889 and began designing mostly residential architecture but quickly became involved in large civic projects. In 1901, Ware began one of the region's first architectural firms (Ware & Treganza) with Alberto O. Treganza as partner. Together they designed many residences, civic buildings, churches and carnegie libraries throughout Utah, Nevada and Wyoming until 1926, when the partnership ended. From 1938-1949, Ware joined with Lloyd W. McClenahan to form Ware & McClenahan. Together with his partners, Ware trained many draftsman and future architects. Ware was a member of the American Institute of Architects and in 1940, Ware became the first Fellow from the Utah Chapter. Personal life Walter Ellsworth Ware was born to inventor Elijah Ware and Martha A. Reed in Needham, Massachusetts. Elijah Ware made important contributions to steam engine technology such as the Ware Steam Wagon. Walter married Jennie Hartley on July 14, 1890 in Laramie, Wyoming. Their daughter Florence E.

The pair are notable for the survival and character of the love-letters which they wrote to each other. Life Margaret Tyndal was born into an Essex gentry family: her father Sir John Tyndal was a Master of the Court of Chancery, and her mother Anne Egerton was related to several of the leading Puritan clergy of the time; Anne was the sister of Stephen Egerton, who in turn married Sarah, daughter of Thomas Crooke. Both Egerton and Crooke belonged to \\"the Godly elite\\", the predominant Puritan faction in the 1570s and 1580s. Margaret was taught to read and write, and encouraged to habits of study and piety.Francis J. Bremer, 'Winthrop, Margaret Tyndal', in Francis J. Bremer & Tom Webster, eds., Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia, Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2006, pp.284-5 Her aunt Sarah, widow of Stephen Egerton, left her ¬£100, a very considerable sum at the time, when she died in 1624. Margaret married John Winthrop at Great Maplestead in Essex on 29 April 1618, becoming his third wife.

It was written by Meghan McCarthy and directed by series director James Wootton. The episode first aired in the United States on February 11, 2012 on The Hub. The episode was viewed by an estimated audience of 316,000, and became the second-highest rated program to ever air on The Hub. In this Valentine's Day-themed episode, The Cutie Mark Crusaders, composed of Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle, attempt to create a relationship between their schoolteacher Cheerilee and Apple Bloom's older brother Big McIntosh for Hearts and Hooves Day with a love potion. However, when they discover that their potion's recipe was connected to a terrible event in Equestrian history, they must find a way to reverse its effects. Plot The Cutie Mark Crusaders - Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle - discover that their teacher Cheerilee lacks a \\"very special somepony\\" to be with on Hearts and Hooves Day. They set off to seek a potential partner for her, eventually settling on Apple Bloom's older brother, Big McIntosh. They initially set up a romantic meeting between the two, using false pretenses to bring the two together, but this proves unsuccessful. The three happen across Twilight Sparkle, reading a book about Hearts and Hooves Day, including the recipe for a potion purportedly able to make a couple fall in love. Borrowing the book, the Crusaders create the potion, and again lure Cheerilee and Big McIntosh to a romantic setting. The older ponies drink the concoction, and magically fall in love with each other, forgetting about everything else beyond being with each other. Though initially pleased, the Crusaders realize this is not the desired result, and upon consulting the book, learn that the potion caused Equestria to fall into chaos centuries ago when the prince and princess who drank it were too lovestruck to rule their kingdom. Fortunately, there is a remedy: the two love-struck ponies must be kept out of eyesight of each other for one hour to break the spell. The three convince Cheerilee to look for a wedding dress and Big McIntosh to select a wedding jewel, forcing the two to separate. Sweetie Belle is able to barricade Cheerilee within the Carousel Boutique, but Apple Bloom and Scootaloo lose track of Big McIntosh at the jewelry store. As he races back toward the Boutique, Apple Bloom tries and fails to slow him down. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo are able to dig a giant pit in Big McIntosh's path, but when he falls in, his cries alert Cheerilee to his presence, and she bursts out of the Boutique. The Crusaders attempt a final stand with only moments before the hour is up as Cheerilee jumps into the pit, knocking them aside. As they all recover, the Crusaders are relieved to find the spell has worn off, though Cheerilee and Big McIntosh question what has happened. The Crusaders explain that the events that led up to this were because of their misguided efforts to make them fall in love with each other, and apologize for the ordeal. Cheerilee punishes the trio by assigning them to do Big McIntosh's chores at Sweet Apple Acres for the day, and she and Big McIntosh walk off together with a teasing ambiguity about the state of their actual relationship. Reception =Ratings= \\"Hearts and Hooves Day\\" aired on February 11, 2012 and was viewed by an estimated 316,000 children between the ages of 2 and 11. The episode managed to become the second-highest program ever broadcast by The Hub at the time of its airing. Leading up to the episode's premiere, the network hosted a My Little Pony Fan Favorites Mare-A- Thon that made large gains in the audience. The marathon helped the network \\"significantly\\" outperform its 2011 year-ago ratings, making gains among kids between the ages of 6-11 by over 165%, kids aged 2‚Äì11 by over 160%, women aged 18‚Äì49 by over 233%, adults aged 18‚Äì49 by over 168%, and households by over 178%. An encore presentation of the episode, on February 14, was viewed by over 11,000 kids aged 6‚Äì11 and was watched in over 61,000 households. =Reviews= The episode received largely positive reviews from critics. Raymond Gallant from Freakin Awesome Network awarded the episode a rating of 8.5 out of 10, and called it \\"another quality episode of a quality season.\\" He cited the \\"entertaining and hilarious\\" qualities of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and he praised the quality of the episode's writing. However, Gallant did comment on the na√Øvety of Twilight Sparkle, writing, \\"While the show has had Twilight suffer from being overly na√Øve at times, it really hadn‚Äôt happened for a while until now, and it feels really out of place.\\" A review from Republibot noted that \\"Romantic episodes of non-romantic shows are tough to do, doubly so when it's a kid's show. They did a good job here, with the real emphasis being on the importance of one's responsibilities, and not interfering with others' relationships.\\" The review praised the episode, and wrote that \\"The animation continues to be fantastic.\\" Home media release \\"Hearts and Hooves Day\\" was released on the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic - Royal Pony Wedding DVD, along with both parts of \\"A Canterlot Wedding\\" (Season 2, Episodes 25 and 26), \\"Sweet and Elite\\" (Season 2, Episode 9), and \\"The Best Night Ever\\" (Season 1, Episode 26), on August 7, 2012.

Originally activated at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, the unit has been active and inactive at several different bases over the last 55 years. The unit was most recently activated as the first ever Air Force-Air National Guard RED HORSE associate unit at Malmstrom on 1 June 1997. The unit is ready at all times to fully deploy to anywhere in the world and remain stationed for an indefinite amount of time. The squadron's most notable deployment was in Vietnam, where it received numerous awards for its work during the war. Mission The 819th Squadron's mission is to \\"rapidly mobilize people, equipment, and heavy construction vehicles to anywhere in the world where air power must be employed.\\" The squadron specifically trains to be able to rapidly deploy and remain self-sufficient for an indefinite length of time. During wartime, the main responsibility for the squadron is to do heavy repairs on Air Force facilities, including runway systems. The squadron also provides support on weapon systems used to guard a base in hostile environments. In non-wartime, the unit is responsible for training to be ready for wartime responsibilities. To do this, the unit participates in training competitions, humanitarian programs, as well as base renovations and construction. History Originally in Abilene, Texas, and later at Dyess AFB, the 819th RED HORSE squadron was first known as the 819th installations squadron on 15 June 1956. It was designated the 819th Civil Engineering Squadron before it was inactivated at Dyess on 25 June 1961. The unit was activated and re-designated again at Forbes AFB as the 819th Civil Engineering Squadron (Heavy Repair). The unit was moved to Thailand to organize and then deployed to Ph√π C√°t Air Base, South Vietnam, in May 1966. The unit was responsible for heavy construction at the base, completing much of the base and its facilities. The unit installed more than of aircraft revetments along with moving over of earth. The unit remained at Ph√π C√°t until 1970, when it was moved to Tuy Hoa AB, Vietnam to close the base. The unit returned from Vietnam in April 1970 to Westover AFB until it was assigned to McConnell AFB in 1973. In 1979, the unit was stationed at RAF Wethersfield, UK, to be in charge of runway repairs for US forces in Europe and also its original job as a heavy repair unit. The unit was inactivated in August 1990 and would remain inactive until 1 June 1997, when it was activated at Malmstrom AFB as the first ever Air Force-Air National Guard RED HORSE associate unit. =Vietnam= The 819th RED HORSE squadron was stationed at Phu Cat AB and was responsible for building facilities in the former Viet Cong training area. The 819th unit was the only unit at the base to operate and maintain heavy equipment. The men from the squadron were responsible for the installment of T-17 membrane and AM 2 matting along with all the earth moving required to build revetments. To build all the buildings and roads for the base, the 819th had to move over of earth. The operation and base construction went very smoothly because the 819th made sure that all equipment was operating properly along with preemptive maintenance. Daily maintenance was required for all machinery. This upkeep made it possible to complete the mission quickly and effectively. One of the largest challenges for the Logistics section was the acquisition of materials and food because the base was at the end of the supply line. In a single year, the 819th Civil Engineering Squadron was incredibly productive: \\"They had moved 1.659 million cubic yards of earth, poured 15,500 cubic yards of concrete, and constructed buildings totaling 633,000 square feet. In addition, they had placed 2.1 million square feet of AM-2 matting, finished over 50,000 linear feet of utility lines, fences and storm drainage facilities, erected more than 5,000 linear feet of aircraft revetments and completed more than 5 miles of road\\". From the Phu Cat A.B. the 819th deployed unit 1 to Pleiku A.B. in the Central Highlands.Detached Unit 1 constructed barracks, buildings, laid runway matting and erected aircraft revetments. Typical duties included, hands on construction work, supervision of Vietnamese civilian workers. Much of the mission in 1967-1968-1969 involved repairing damage from 122MM Rocket and 82MM Mortar attacks due to constant Vietcong and NVA activity in the area. The unit members routinely ran convoys off base under their own security for supplies and to safely pick up and return civilian employees. Members worked 14 hour days with Sundays off. =Recent History= In recent years, the 819th RED HORSE squadron has been active in non-war zones to improve infrastructure and provide support to bases around the world. In November 1998, the 819th along with members of the 820th, went to Central America to repair damages to infrastructure done by Hurricane Mitch. In October 2000, the 819th deployed to Prince Sultan Air base to pave a dirt munitions road. The road was making travel difficult, so the unit paved over a mile of road. By February 2003, the 819th established an airborne capability by training with the U.S. Army and Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency. The unit trained to establish MARES so that they could work on airfields around the world. After training, the 819th completed several projects in Southwest Asia, and supported Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom by participating in large construction projects at several bases. In 2014 the 819th RHS was targeted for downsizing and possible closure or relocated to Guam and be combined with the 554th RHS. The downsizing never took place but the 819th RED HORSE took a major hit to its manpower.

It is about learning concepts from nature and applying them to the design of real-world engineered systems. More specifically, this field is about making robots that are inspired by biological systems. Biomimicry and bio-inspired design are sometimes confused. Biomimicry is copying from nature while bio-inspired design is learning from nature and making a mechanism that is simpler and more effective than the system observed in nature. Biomimicry has led to the development of a different branch of robotics called soft robotics. The biological systems have been optimized for specific tasks according to their habitat. However, they are multifunctional and are not designed for only one specific functionality. Bio-inspired robotics is about studying biological systems, and look for the mechanisms that may solve a problem in the engineering field. The designer should then try to simplify and enhance that mechanism for the specific task of interest. Bio-inspired roboticists are usually interested in biosensors (e.g. eye), bioactuators (e.g. muscle), or biomaterials (e.g. spider silk). Most of the robots have some type of locomotion system. Thus, in this article different modes of animal locomotion and few examples of the corresponding bio-inspired robots are introduced.

We will discuss legged and limbless locomotion in this section as well as climbing and jumping. Anchoring the feet is fundamental to locomotion on land. The ability to increase traction is important for slip-free motion on surfaces such as smooth rock faces and ice, and is especially critical for moving uphill. Numerous biological mechanisms exist for providing purchase: claws rely upon friction-based mechanisms; gecko feet upon van der walls forces; and some insect feet upon fluid-mediated adhesive forces.R.

One of the main advantages of using legs instead of wheels is moving on uneven environment more effectively. Bipedal, quadrupedal, and hexapedal locomotion are among the most favorite types of legged locomotion in the field of bio-inspired robotics. Rhex, a Reliable Hexapedal robotU. Saranli, M.

IEEE International Conference on, vol. 4, pp. 3643‚Äì3649, 2001. This robot can run up to 15 body length per second and can achieve speeds of up to 2.3 m/s. The original version of this robot was pneumatically driven while the new generation uses a single electric motor for locomotion.S. Kim, J. Clark, and M. Cutkosky, \\"isprawl: Design and tuning for high-speed autonomous open-loop running,\\" The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 25, no. 9, pp. 903‚Äì 912, 2006. =Limbless locomotion= Terrain involving topography over a range of length scales can be challenging for most organisms and biomimetic robots. Such terrain are easily passed over by limbless organisms such as snakes. Several animals and insects including worms, snails, caterpillars, and snakes are capable of limbless locomotion. A review of snake-like robots is presented by Hirose et al.S. Hirose, P. Cave, and C. Goulden, Biologically inspired robots: snake- like locomotors and manipulators, vol. 64. Oxford University Press Oxford, UK, 1993 These robots can be categorized as robots with passive or active wheels, robots with active treads, and undulating robots using vertical waves or linear expansions. Most snake-like robots use wheels, which are high in friction when moving side to side but low in friction when rolling forward (and can be prevented from rolling backward). The majority of snake-like robots use either lateral undulation or rectilinear locomotion and have difficulty climbing vertically. Choset has recently developed a modular robot that can mimic several snake gaits, but it cannot perform concertina motion.R. Hatton and H. Choset, \\"Generating gaits for snake robots: annealed chain fitting and keyframe wave extraction,\\" Autonomous Robots, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 271‚Äì281, 2010. Researchers at Georgia Tech have recently developed two snake- like robots called Scalybot. The focus of these robots is on the role of snake ventral scales on adjusting the frictional properties in different directions. These robots can actively control their scales to modify their frictional properties and move on a variety of surfaces efficiently.H. Marvi, G. Meyers, G. Russell, D. Hu, \\"Scalybot: a Snake-inspired Robot with Active Frictional Anisotropy,\\" ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference, Arlington, VA, 2011. Researchers at CMU have developed both scaledSNAKELIKE SKIN GIVES A ROBOT THE POWER TO CRAWL and conventional actuated snake-like robots.THIS ROBOT SNAKE MEANS YOU NO HARM, REALLY =Climbing= Climbing is an especially difficult task because mistakes made by the climber may cause the climber to lose its grip and fall. Most robots have been built around a single functionality observed in their biological counterparts. GeckobotsO. Unver, A. Uneri, A. Aydemir, and M. Sitti, \\"Geckobot: a gecko inspired climbing robot using elastomer adhesives,\\" in International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2329‚Äì2335, 2006. typically use van der waals forces that work only on smooth surfaces.

Legged climbing robots have several limitations. They cannot handle large obstacles since they are not flexible and they require a wide space for moving. They usually cannot climb both smooth and rough surfaces or handle vertical to horizontal transitions as well. =Jumping= One of the tasks commonly performed by a variety of living organisms is jumping. Bharal, hares, kangaroo, grasshopper, flea, and locust are among the best jumping animals. A miniature 7g jumping robot inspired by locust has been developed at EPFL that can jump up to 138 cm.M. Kovac, M. Fuchs, A. Guignard, J. Zufferey, and D. Floreano, \\"A miniature 7g jumping robot,\\" in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 373‚Äì378, 2008. The jump event is induced by releasing the tension of a spring. The highest jumping miniature robot is inspired by the locust, weighs 23 grams with its highest jump to 365 cm is \\"TAUB\\" (Tel-Aviv University and Braude College of engineering).V. Zaitsev, O. Gvirsman, U. Ben Hanan, A. Weiss, A. Ayali and G. Kosa, \\"A locust-inspired miniature jumping robot,\\" in Bioinspiration & biomimetics, 10(6), p.066012. It uses torsion springs as energy storage and includes a wire and latch mechanism to compress and release the springs. ETH Zurich has reported a soft jumping robot based on the combustion of methane and laughing gas.M. Loepfe, C.M. Schumacher, U.B. Lustenberger, and W.J. Stark, \\"An Untethered, Jumping Roly- Poly Soft Robot Driven by Combustion,\\" Soft Robotics, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 33-41, 2015. The thermal gas expansion inside the soft combustion chamber drastically increases the chamber volume. This causes the 2 kg robot to jump up to 20 cm. The soft robot inspired by a roly-poly toy then reorientates itself into an upright position after landing. Behavioral classification (aquatic locomotion) = Swimming (piscine) = It is calculated that when swimming some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than 90%. Furthermore, they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man-made boat or submarine, and produce less noise and water disturbance. Therefore, many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion. Notable examples are the Essex University Computer Science Robotic Fish G9, and the Robot Tuna built by the Institute of Field Robotics, to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion. The Aqua Penguin,youtube.com designed and built by Festo of Germany, copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front \\"flippers\\" of penguins. Festo have also built the Aqua Ray and Aqua Jelly, which emulate the locomotion of manta ray, and jellyfish, respectively. Robotic Fish: iSplash-II In 2014 iSplash-II was developed by PhD student Richard James Clapham and Prof. Huosheng Hu at Essex University. It was the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity (measured in body lengths/ second) and endurance, the duration that top speed is maintained. This build attained swimming speeds of 11.6BL/s (i.e. 3.7 m/s). The first build, iSplash-I (2014) was the first robotic platform to apply a full-body length carangiform swimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by 27% over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform. Morphological classification =Modular= Honda Asimo: A Humanoid robot The modular robots are typically capable of performing several tasks and are specifically useful for search and rescue or exploratory missions. Some of the featured robots in this category include a salamander inspired robot developed at EPFL that can walk and swim,A. J. Ijspeert, A. Crespi, D. Ryczko and J.-M. Cabelguen, \\"From swimming to walking with a salamander robot driven by a spinal cord model,\\" Science, vol. 315, num. 5817, p. 1416-1420, 2007. a snake inspired robot developed at Carnegie-Mellon University that has four different modes of terrestrial locomotion, and a cockroach inspired robot can run and climb on a variety of complex terrain. =Humanoid= Humanoid robots are robots that look human-like or are inspired by the human form. There are many different types of humanoid robots for applications such as personal assistance, reception, work at industries, or companionship. These type of robots are used for research purposes as well and were originally developed to build better orthosis and prosthesis for human beings. Petman is one of the first and most advanced humanoid robots developed at Boston Dynamics. Some of the humanoid robots such as Honda Asimo are over actuated.K. Hirer, M. Hirose, Y. Haikawa, and T. Takenaka, \\"The development of honda humanoid robot,\\" in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, vol. 2, pp. 1321‚Äì1326, 1998. On the other hand, there are some humanoid robots like the robot developed at Cornell University that do not have any actuators and walk passively descending a shallow slope.S. Collins, M. Wisse, and A. Ruina, \\"A three-dimensional passive-dynamic walking robot with two legs and knees,\\" The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 20, no. 7, pp. 607‚Äì615, 2001. =Swarming= The collective behavior of animals has been of interest to researchers for several years. Ants can make structures like rafts to survive on the rivers. Fish can sense their environment more effectively in large groups. Swarm robotics is a fairly new field and the goal is to make robots that can work together and transfer the data, make structures as a group, etc.E.

Such robots are flexible enough to move in very limited spaces (such as in the human body). The first multigait soft robots was developed in 2011R. Shepherd, F. Ilievski, W. Choi, S. Morin, A.

An interventionist reporting style aims at influencing public opinion. Moreover, \\"journalism cultures that follow an interventionist approach may act on behalf of the socially disadvantaged or as mouthpiece of a political party and other groups whose interest are at stake\\".Hanitzsch 2007a, 373  Range of journalistic interventionism  Journalistic interventionism takes place in politics such as in election campaigns, and in peace journalism. Thomas Hanitzsch, associate professor of Communication Studies and Media Research at the University of Munich, proposes a continuum on which the degree of interventionism is measured. \\"The intervention pole of the continuum becomes manifest in role models like the 'participant', 'advocate', and 'missionary'\\" with journalists taking a more active role in their reporting.Hanitzsch 2007a, 373 There are two factors that interrelate interventionism and journalistic culture: Distance to power holders and market orientation. Journalists with distance to power holders are expected to be more skeptical whereas journalists with close proximity to power holders tend to be more defensive of them and do not intervene as much as the skeptical journalist.Hanitzsch 2007a, 374 Journalists in a market-oriented news culture, on the other hand, perceive citizens as consumers. In contrast, journalists in a public-interest culture are less market-oriented and regard their audience as citizens rather than consumers. They \\"produce news in regard to the democratic needs of society\\" and are less interventionist.Esser 2008, 403 The \\"critical change agent\\", one of the four professional journalistic milieus that Hanitzsch suggests, tends to \\"emphasize the importance of advocating social change, influencing public opinion and setting the political agenda\\" and serves as an example of an interventionist reporting style.Hanitzsch 2011, 485 The degree of interventionism in journalistic reporting varies across different countries. In a study conducted by Hanitzsch et al. that interviewed 2100 professional journalists from 18 countries, it turned out that journalists from non-western contexts tend to be more interventionist in their role perceptions and more flexible in their ethical views. According to this study, 73% of the Egyptian journalists and 68% of the Turkish journalists regard themselves as \\"critical change agent\\" and thus as rather interventionist. In Germany, only 10% and in the USA 21% of the journalists regard themselves as \\"critical change agent\\".worldsofjournalism.org, 2012 Generally, \\"high interventionism is found in a journalistic culture that is labeled 'pragmatic'\\".Esser 2008, 403 In a pragmatic news culture, only political material with a high news value will be included into news programs whereas other political material will be excluded. Moreover, candidates' statements are used as raw material out of which the journalist then constructs his or her own story.Esser 2008, 403 = Interventionism in election campaigns = In the broadcasting of election campaigns, journalists intervene in the process of political change when they, for instance, navigate the politician's amount of speech. Generally, journalistic interventionism is most likely to occur in a political communication culture that is media-oriented.Pfetsch 2004, 353 Here, politicians or political spokespersons \\"have to accept the maxims of media production as their own rules if they are to be in any position at all to communicate their messages\\".Pfetsch 2004, 353-354 As a consequence, there emerges a tendency towards a \\"personalization of politics, a preference for political human-touch aspects, and a predilection for visual and (television) dramaturgical infotainment formats\\".Pfetsch 2004, 359 Frank Esser, professor of International and Comparative Media at the University of Zurich, conducted a research about the length of sound and image bites (short quotations and visual images of politicians on television news) in order to analyze journalistic intervention. Esser shows in his work which factors influence journalistic intervention in the broadcasting of election campaigns (in different national contexts). In professional journalism, the media structure as well as the political structure have influence on the extent of journalistic interventionism.Esser 2008, 404 According to this model, interventionism occurs in a political culture in which public opinion is distrustful of political institutions. Generally, interventionism most likely occurs when the media has achieved a high status of independence, especially from political control.Esser 2008, 404 As a result, the sound bites of politicians in an interventionist report tend to be rather short whereas those from the journalists tend to be longer. High interventionism in an election campaign also leads to \\"a smaller amount of election news coverage in general\\".Esser 2008, 405 In an interventionist reporting style, journalism becomes more focused on journalists instead on the politicians or the subject they report about, and thus journalists \\"increase their influence, authority, and prestige\\".Esser 2008, 403 Thus, media interventionism is high when journalists convey the content of election campaigns in their own words.Str√∂mb√§ck, Dimitrova 2008, 35 Jesper Str√∂mb√§ck, professor of Media and Communication at the Mid Sweden University and Daniela V. Dimitrova, assistant professor at the Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication at the Iowa State University, developed indicators with which the degree of journalistic interventionism can be measured in, for instance, election campaigns.Str√∂mb√§ck, Dimitrova 2008, 35 They found the following indicators relevant: # The length of the politician's speech parts (determined by the journalist). # The degree of the journalist's visibility: \\"The more journalists are visible ‚Äì for example through stand-ups or anchors interviewing reporters live or in studio ‚Äì the more they insert themselves between viewers and that which the news content is ostensibly about\\".Str√∂mb√§ck, Dimitrova 2008, 35 # The extent to which politicians are granted the wrap-up, this means the concluding speech part. # Lip flaps; that means that the journalists voice drowns the politician's voice and thus \\"is in effect silencing the politicians\\".Str√∂mb√§ck 2008, 35 # The framing of a canvass as a strategic game or a horse race through journalist's reporting style. # The degree to which news content is mediatized; that means the dependence of a political system on mass media; is related to the journalistic style of news reports.Asp 1986, 359 Interpretative and descriptive reporting styles are opposed.Str√∂mb√§ck 2008, 43 The interpretative style attempts to go beyond the obvious and provides analysis or context. This style gives journalists more control over the message and is thus more interventionist since the journalist has the power to shape the story.Donsbach 2000, 250 With the help of these indicators, the degree of journalistic interventionism in political news report can be measured. = Interventionism in peace journalism = Peace journalism is inherently interventionist since it actively promotes peace through public communication (Hanitzsch 2007b, 2). Furthermore, \\"Peace Journalism combines journalism with peace as an external aim\\".Kempf 2008, 17 Journalists who advocate for peace are no longer neutral observers but report selectively. \\"Peace journalism is when editors and reporters make choices ‚Äì of what stories to report, and how to report them\\".Lynch and McGoldrick 2005, 5 Hanitzsch claims that peace journalists understand their audience as passive which needs to be enlightened by their journalistic work.Hanitzsch 2007b, 1 It is a journalistic form which functions beyond the values of objectivity, neutrality, and detachment.Hanitzsch 2007b, 2 \\"Peace journalism inherits a normative impetus; it prioritizes peace as its central value and analytical starting point\\".Hanitzsch 2007b, 2 It is interventionist since its primary goal is not to report neutrally but it creates reality, sets examples and calls for change.Becker 2002, 14 It regards itself as a vehicle for the advocacy of peace and non-violent conflict resolutions.Hanitzsch 2007b, 7  Reasons for an interventionist reporting style  One reason for the development of an interventional journalism in news report about politics is for instance the commercialization of journalism.Hallin and Mancini 2004, 37 Commercialization shifts the power from the politicians to the news media, and media becomes more central in the political communication and thus gains power to shape political news content.Hallin and Mancini 2004, 37 In a commercialized broadcasting system and a \\"pluralistic, internally autonomous press with high degree of political autonomy\\", political communication is dominated by the media.Pfetsch 2004, 359 Additionally, in a culture in which public opinion is rather distrustful of political institutions, adversarial ‚Äì and thus interventionist journalism ‚Äì is socially accepted.Esser 2008, 404 Furthermore, in an independent, highly professionalized journalistic culture, \\"the development of autonomous and distinctively journalistic criteria\\" leads to \\"proactive, party-distant\\" and thus also interventionist journalistic style.Esser 2008, 405  Criticism  Interventional journalism is a non- neutral form of reporting and deviates from the general journalistic values to report objectively. However, it is difficult to determine at which point a journalistic contribution is interventionist. \\"It is exceedingly difficult to determine, for example, whether negative or positive coverage of a politician or issue is a result of partisan bias, the nature of events, or other factors\\".Donsbach and Patterson 2004, 257 Also in terms of political news content, it is difficult to \\"find a yardstick for 'appropriate' proximity or distance to political spokespersons and journalists\\".Pfetsch 2004, 352 Thus, it is difficult to determine whether ‚Äì and to which degree ‚Äì a journalist acts as an interventionist. Generally, it is hard to classify interventionism as a journalistic style as merely positive or negative. The discussion about journalistic interventionism mirrors the general debate about what professional journalism is, and how it can be defined, also in different countries.

The NATO missile defense system is a missile defense system being constructed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in several member states and around the Mediterranean Sea. Plans for this system have changed several times since first studied in 2002, including as a response to Russian opposition. Background A missile defence feasibility study was launched after the 2002 Prague Summit. The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) and NATO's Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) were also involved in negotiations. The study concluded that missile defence is technically feasible, and it provided a technical basis for ongoing political and military discussions regarding the desirability of a NATO missile defence system. The United States negotiated with Poland and the Czech Republic over the course of several years after on the deployment of interceptor missiles and a radar tracking system in the two countries. Both countries' governments indicated that they would allow the deployment. In April 2007, NATO's European allies called for a NATO missile defence system which would complement the American national missile defense system to protect Europe from missile attacks and NATO's decision-making North Atlantic Council held consultations on missile defence in the first meeting on the topic at such a senior level. In response, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin claimed that such a deployment could lead to a new arms race and could enhance the likelihood of mutual destruction. He also suggested that his country would freeze its compliance with the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)‚Äîwhich limits military deployments across the continent‚Äîuntil all NATO countries had ratified the adapted CFE treaty. Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer claimed the system would not affect strategic balance or threaten Russia, as the plan is to base only ten interceptor missiles in Poland with an associated radar in the Czech Republic. On 14 July 2007, Russia gave notice of its intention to suspend the CFE treaty, effective 150 days later.Y. Zarakhovich, \\"Why Putin Pulled Out of a Key Treaty\\" in Time, 14 July 2007 On 14 August 2008, the United States and Poland came to an agreement to place a base with ten interceptor missiles with associated MIM-104 Patriot air defence systems in Poland. This came at a time when tension was high between Russia and most of NATO and resulted in a nuclear threat on Poland by Russia if the building of the missile defences went ahead. On 20 August 2008 the United States and Poland signed the agreement, while Russia sent word to Norway that it was suspending ties with NATO. During the 2008 Bucharest Summit, the alliance further discussed the technical details as well as the political and military implications of the proposed elements of the US missile defence system in Europe. Allied leaders recognized that the planned deployment of European- based US missile defence assets would help protect many Allies, and agreed that this capability should be an integral part of any future NATO-wide missile defence architecture. In August 2008, Poland and the United States signed a preliminary deal to place part of the missile defence shield in Poland that would be linked to air-defence radar in the Czech Republic. More than 130,000 Czechs signed a petition for a referendum on the base. On 20 March 2015 Russia's ambassador to Denmark wrote a letter to the editor of Jyllandsposten warning the Danes that their participation in this merge of assets would make their warships targets of Russian nuclear missiles. Denmark's former Minister for Foreign Affairs Holger K. Nielsen commented that if there's a war, Danish warships will be targets in any case. Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defence On 17 September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that the planned deployment of long-range missile defence interceptors and equipment in Poland and the Czech Republic was not to go forward, and that a defence against short- and medium-range missiles using AEGIS warships would be deployed instead. Following the change in plans, Russian President Dimitri Medvedev announced that a proposed Russian Iskander surface to surface missile deployment in nearby Kaliningrad would also not go ahead. The two deployment cancellation announcements were later followed with a statement by newly named NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen calling for a strategic partnership between Russia and the Alliance, explicitly involving technological cooperation of the two parties' missile defence systems. According to a September 2009 White House Factsheet entitled \\"Fact Sheet on U.S. Missile Defense Policy - A \\"Phased, Adaptive Approach\\" for Missile Defense in Europe\\" contains the following four phases: * Phase One (in the 2011 timeframe) ‚Äì Deploy current and proven missile defense systems available in the next two years, including the sea-based Aegis Weapon System, the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptor (Block IA), and sensors such as the forward-based Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance system (AN/TPY-2), to address regional ballistic missile threats to Europe and our deployed personnel and their families; * Phase Two (in the 2015 timeframe) ‚Äì After appropriate testing, deploy a more capable version of the SM-3 interceptor (Block IB) in both sea- and land-based configurations, and more advanced sensors, to expand the defended area against short- and medium-range missile threats; * Phase Three (in the 2018 timeframe) ‚Äì After development and testing are complete, deploy the more advanced SM-3 Block IIA variant under development, to counter short-, medium-, and intermediate-range missile threats; and * Phase Four (in the 2020 timeframe) ‚Äì After development and testing are complete, deploy the SM-3 Block IIB to help better cope with medium- and intermediate-range missiles and the potential future ICBM threat to the United States. The deployment of warships equipped with the Aegis RIM-161 SM-3 missile began after Obama's speech in September 2009. These missiles complement the Patriot missile systems already deployed by American units. Though initially supportive of the plan, once was actually deployed to the Black Sea, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement voicing concern about the deployment.Vergakis, Brock. \\"USS Monterey returns to US after missile defense.\\" AP, 1 November 2011. On February 4, 2010, Romania agreed to host the SM-3 missiles starting in 2015 at Deveselu. The first element of this revised system, an early warning radar station in Malatya, Turkey, went operational on 16 January 2012. The BMD component in Romania is undergoing an upgrade in May 2019; in the interim a THAAD unit, B Battery (THAAD), 62nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, has emplaced in NSF Deveselu, Romania;Sgt. 1st Class Jason Epperson (May 22, 2019) US deploys THAAD anti-missile system in first deployment to Romania the upgrade was completed August 9, 2019 and the THAAD battery has returned to its home station. August 12/19: Romanian Repair Finished Other parts of the missile defence system are planned to be built in Portugal, Poland, Romania and Spain. In September 2011, NATO invited India to be a partner in its ballistic missile defence system. V. K. Saraswat, the architect of Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Program, subsequently told the press, \\"We are analysing the report. It is under consideration.\\" Also in September 2011, the White House released a Factsheet that reports on the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). With respect to EPAA's implementation as part of the NATO missile defense in Europe the factsheet notes the four phases outlined above: * Phase One (2011 timeframe) will address short- and medium-range ballistic missile threats by deploying current and proven missile defense systems. It calls for the deployment of Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD)-capable ships equipped with proven SM-3 Block IA interceptors. In March of this year the USS Monterey was the first in a sustained rotation of ships to deploy to the Mediterranean Sea in support of EPAA. Phase One also calls for deploying a land-based early warning radar, which Turkey agreed to host as part of the NATO missile defense plan. * Phase Two (2015 timeframe) will expand coverage against short- and medium-range threats with the fielding of a land-based SM-3 missile defense interceptor site in Romania and the deployment of a more capable SM-3 interceptor (the Block IB). On September 13, the United States and Romania signed the U.S.-Romanian Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement. Once ratified, it will allow the United States to build, maintain, and operate the land-based BMD site in Romania. The missile defense system in Deveselu became operational on 18 December 2015.http://www.janes.com/article/56773/nato-activates-bmd- facility-in-romania * Phase Three (2018 timeframe) will improve coverage against medium- and intermediate-range missile threats with an additional land-based SM-3 site in Poland and the deployment of a more advanced SM-3 interceptor (the Block IIA). Poland agreed to host the interceptor site in October 2009, and today, with the Polish ratification process complete, this agreement has entered into force. * Phase Four (2020 timeframe) will enhance the ability to counter medium- and intermediate-range missiles and potential future inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) threats to the United States from the Middle East, through the deployment of the SM-3 Block IIB interceptor. Each phase will include upgrades to the missile defense command and control system. During its 2012 Chicago Summit NATO leaders declared that the NATO missile defence system has reached interim capability. Interim capability means that a basic command and control capability has been tested and installed at NATOs Headquarters Allied Air Command in Ramstein, Germany, while NATO Allies provide sensors and interceptors to connect to the system. It also means that US ships with anti-missile interceptors in the Mediterranean Sea and a Turkey-based radar system have been put under NATO command in the German base. \\"Our system will link together missile defence assets from different Allies ‚Äì satellites, ships, radars and interceptors ‚Äì under NATO command and control. It will allow us to defend against threats from outside the Euro-Atlantic area,\\" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. NATO long-term goal is to merge missile defence assets provided by individual Allies into a coherent defence system so that full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory and forces against the threats posed by proliferation of ballistic missiles is ensured. This goal is expected to be released sometime between the end of the 2010s and the beginning of the 2020s. To this end Spain will host four US Aegis warships at its port in Rota while Poland and Romania have agreed to host US land-based SM-3 missiles in the coming years. According to a State Department official Frank A. Rose, the United States has \\"offered EPAA assets to the Alliance\\" as an \\"interim BMD capability\\", including the AN/TPY-2 radar deployed in Turkey, which is \\"under NATO operational control\\". Rose also said that \\"In addition, U.S. BMD-capable Aegis ships in Europe are also now able to operate under NATO operational control when threat conditions warrant.\\"United States Department of State In 2020, the Aegis Ashore site in Poland had not yet been completed, due to incomplete auxiliary controls for heating, power, and cooling.PAUL MCLEARY (February 12, 2020) Stalled Polish Missile Defense Site Needs Extra $96M, 2 Years Missile Defense Agency's Vice Admiral Jon Hill will announce in February 2020 whether another contractor will be required. The Aegis SM-3 Block IB missiles for Poland are already on-site; the Romanian site is operational. A 2012 GAO report found that the phase four interceptors may be poorly placed and of the wrong type to defend the United States.\\"Pentagon study: U.S. defense shield against Iran missiles is seriously flawed.\\" This capability was planned to be in place by 2020, but this has \\"been delayed to at least 2022 due to cuts in congressional funding.\\"\\"Alaska‚Äôs Ground Based Interceptors to Pivot US Defenses Against North Korea.\\" Some republicans including Mitt Romney, Dick Cheney and John McCain have called Obama's changes from the system Bush proposed a \\"gift\\" to Vladimir Putin, but Gates wrote in Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War that the change was made to ensure a more effective defense for Europe.

An architectural rarity, it is one of a small group of churches in the Prairie School style of architecture. with Designed primarily in the Prairie style with some eclectic touches by architect William L. Steele, its horizontal lines are emphasized by Roman brick and crisp rectilinear forms. Somewhat at variance are the distinctive dome and the prominent round heads on the windows. Interior view of the now-sealed dome showing its stained glass, which originally flooded the sanctuary with light. Fresh from his triumph with the Woodbury County Courthouse in collaboration with George Grant Elmslie, and drawing on lessons learned during that collaboration, Steele built the church in 1916‚Äì1918. This church and the courthouse are the only two Prairie style buildings that are known to have a dome. It was built for a Congregational church that had been established in Sioux City back in 1857, replacing a more traditional church that had burned down in 1916. In 1966, that congregation built a new structure on Hamilton Boulevard. First Congregational Church sold the building to Sioux City Baptist Church c. 1968. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 under that name. In 2009, Sioux City Baptist Church acquired a building on Viking Drive. Most recently, the building has become the Iglesia Evangelica Pentecostes Principe de Paz (Evangelical Pentecostal Church of the Prince of Peace), with services in Spanish aimed at the local Hispanic community. Due to the need for extensive building restoration and maintenance, the structure has been named to endangered building lists by at least two historic preservation groups. See also *William L.

In May 2010, Benjamin briefly summarized his experiences in a TED talk. Overview African American journalist Rich Benjamin documents his journeys to find out why more and more white Americans move to small towns and areas that are, for the most part, white, and to explain why Whitopias are growing and what it means for the United States. Benjamin mounted a two-year tour of the United States, covering 26,907 miles (43,303 km), looking for \\"Whitopias\\", which he defined as: *an area which has experienced at least 6% growth rate since 2000; *the great majority of that growth consists of white persons; *the area has a pleasant look, feel, ambiance, or charm. He spent several months in three such areas: St. George, Utah, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and Forsyth County, Georgia. In each case, he generated a master plan to thoroughly immerse himself in the community's core, with lists of the power brokers, the important groups, and the significant events. He tried to volunteer or involve himself with those people and groups. Author's experiences In St. George, Benjamin rented a house over the telephone in a gated community, La Entrada. He took up golfing, fishing, and Texas Hold 'Em. He was generally welcomed in every instance, and learned that the dominant topic in St. George was illegal immigration; a local group had been organized to fight immigration, and they held regular rallies. In Idaho, Benjamin rented a resort cabin at Lake Coeur d'Alene. He found a significant number of retired LAPD officers living there, and also found a significant number of gun owners where he learned to shoot a pistol at the local gun range. He spent time at a retreat, the only non-white journalist in the group, at the Council of Aryan Nations compound. He was told that the group is not \\"white-supremacy\\"; they are \\"white-segregation\\" - they merely don't want to live in close proximity to non-white people. He noted the preponderance of Confederate flags. In Georgia he found the predominant cultural activity revolved around a mega-church, so he involved himself in its activities. He felt the most comfortable in this situation, since both blacks and whites in this area are used to seeing the other - as contrasted to the first two sites, where a black person is still a rarity.

The peninsula is named after the settlements of Shotley and Shotley Gate which are situated near its south-eastern tip. Other villages on the peninsula include Chelmondiston, Erwarton (Arwarton), Freston, Harkstead, Holbrook, Stutton, Tattingstone, Wherstead and Woolverstone. The population was 10,310 according to the 2001 Census, approximately 12.4% of the total population of Babergh District.  Geography  Shotley peninsula The rivers Stour and Orwell meet at Shotley Gate and merge to join with the North Sea in Harwich Harbour. The Stour and Orwell is a designated Special Protection Area, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Ramsar site for wetland habitats. The landscape is predominantly ancient estate farmlands, with salt marshes and intertidal mudflats. The mudflats are an important winter feeding area for estuary birds, wild fowl and waders. The wetlands and estuaries are home to otters and water voles. There are significant areas of woodland, parkland and hedgerows with dormouse and stag beetle populations. Trips to places of local interest can be arranged through Shotley Peninsula Tours The main crops farmed on the peninsula are winter wheat, winter and spring barley, potatoes and sugar beet. The climate and soil on the peninsula are also suitable for viticulture and a small vineyard occupies the valley below St. Mary's church, Shotley, but is currently not being used. Footpaths on the peninsula shoreline are at risk of coastal erosion, which is being mitigated by the efforts of the local community. In light of climate change and the risk of rising sea levels, a farm in Shotley has been planning to breach the sea wall in a managed retreat (or coastal realignment) to create new habitats and landscapes, supporting tourism in the region. The Shotley peninsular experiences a maritime climate with a narrow range of temperature and rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. The nearest weather station for which data is available is East Bergholt, 7 miles west of Holbrook. See Ipswich Climate data.  History and archaeology  There is archaeological evidence of Bronze Age barrows, and late Iron Age or Roman field enclosures. Several groups of Iron Age coins and a small group of late Saxon finds have been discovered on the peninsula. In 1995, an Anglo-Saxon fish trap dating from between 650AD and 1050AD was found on the mudflats at Holbrook Bay. Several settlements on the peninsula are mentioned in the Domesday survey of 1068. The peninsula lies within the historic Samford Hundred. Deposits of clay along the shoreline were used by brick works in the 19th and early 20th centuries at Holbrook Creek, Shotley, Hare's Creek (Shotley) and Bourne Hill in Wherstead.  Leisure activities and places of interest  Main entrance to H.M.S. Ganges ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 1247889 The peninsula lies within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and there are many rights of way. The Stour and Orwell Walk is a coastal footpath that starts from the Orwell Bridge and extends around the peninsula to Cattawade, providing links with the Essex Way. Towards the tip of the peninsula there are extensive views of the Port of Felixstowe, Landguard Fort, the town of Harwich and Harwich International Port. The dense marine traffic criss-crossing the deep-water channels to the Haven ports comprises container ships, cruise ships, pleasure craft and sailboats. The attractive riverside hamlet of Pin Mill and marinas at Woolverstone and Shotley Gate make the peninsula a popular sailing destination. Alton Water is a reservoir that offers a variety of activities such as birdwatching, sailing, windsurfing, walking and cycling. The Old Hall at Shotley is a 16th-century grade II listed building, with evidence of a medieval moat. Erwarton Hall, Crowe Hall (Stutton) and Stutton Hall are substantial Tudor and Jacobean houses that overlook the Stour estuary to the south. The Royal Hospital School at Holbrook is a significant landmark on the peninsula, as is the mast of the former Royal Navy Training Establishment (HMS Ganges) at Shotley Gate.  Transport  Shotley ‚Äì rolling fields ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 1120722 The local transport network is limited, with the B1456, B1080 and a number of minor roads linking the settlements, no rail station and restricted bus services. The B1456 road is periodically at risk of temporary flooding along the Strand near the Orwell bridge. In the summer months a foot and cycle ferry service licensed to carry up to 12 passengers operates between Shotley Marina, Harwich and Felixstowe. The South Suffolk Cycle Route crosses the peninsula, and there is a campaign to create a dedicated traffic-free cycling route between Shotley Gate and Bourne Bridge, Ipswich.

One of the radomes is visible. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station () was a satellite ground station located nearby Ny-√Ölesund in Svalbard, Norway. It was used between 1967 and 1974 as one of the four initial ground stations which were part of the European Space Tracking Network (ESTRACK) serving the European Space Research Organization's (ESRO) first generation of satellites. The station provided radio tracking, telemetry and commanding services as well as data download. Although owned by ESRO, the facilities were constructed and operated by the Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (NTNF). Plans for the station's construction started in the early 1960s and negotiations between ESRO and Norwegian authorities started in 1964, despite Norway's lack of membership in ESRO. An initial disagreement of whether to locate the facility by Ny-√Ölesund or Longyearbyen was overcome, and an agreement was signed on 14 December 1964. However, it was followed up by numerous protests from the Soviet Union, which claimed the installation would violate the demilitarized zone clause of the Svalbard Treaty, as the station had the potential to be used for military satellites and intelligence. The protests were rejected by Norwegian authorities, and construction started in May 1965. The Soviet Union attempted several inspections; one resulted in the crash of a Soviet helicopter. Operations commenced in 1967, but the facility was closed in 1974 as the facility was not suitable for new satellites with higher orbits. History =Background= Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was located in Ny-√Ölesund The first official inquiries into establishing ionosphere research in Svalbard was taken by Leiv Harang, then head of the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), in October 1950. Two similar facilities, a completed one at Kjeller and one under construction in Troms√∏, had already been initiated. The proposal, regarded by Harang as primarily a military project, was initially issued to the United States. It was considered by US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who saw it as a possible excuse to populate Spitsbergen as a counter-measure to the Soviet mining communities. However, nothing came of the plans before the International Geophysical Year in 1957‚Äì58, when an ionosphere research station was established as Isfjord Radio and moved to Ny-√Ölesund in 1963. Although unrelated to the telemetry station, this was the initiation of technology services in Ny-√Ölesund.Tamnes (1992): 57 In 1960, Norway entered a cooperation with the United States, which resulted in the construction of the Norwegian Space Centre at And√∏ya.Tamnes (1992): 56 In 1964, ESRO was established as a Western European reaction to the rapidly developing Soviet and American space programs. Norway chose to only join as an observer, partially because of the close cooperation with the US and partially because of the cost. However, Norwegian space research scientists participated in ESRO programs.Tamnes (1992): 58 Preliminary work in the planning of ESRO operations concluded that the ESTRACK network would initially consist of four radio tracking and telemetry stations and three optical tracking stations.Kriege and Russo (2000): 53 In addition to Svalbard, tracking and telemetry stations were built on the Falkland Islands, in Fairbanks, Alaska and in Redu, Belgium. France actively opposed the Svalbard location, as Norway was not a member of ESRO. The ESRO secretariat wanted to quicken the location decision, as it was necessary to have all four in operation before the launch of the ESRO-1 and ESRO-2 satellites.Kriege and Russo (2000): 59 The initial proposal had called for locating the station in Ny-√Ölesund due to its topographical advantage.Tamnes (1992): 60 In January 1964, ESRO started informal discussions with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who stated that they had no initial objections.Tamnes (1992): 59 By then, supported by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, ESRO instead proposed situating the station at Longyearbyen because it was less remote and would incur lower costs.R√∏dberg and Collett (2004): 14 This was opposed by Norwegian authorities; mining in Ny-√Ölesund had ceased after the 1963 Kings Bay Affair and the authorities wanted permanent activity in the town. An official request was made by ESRO in February, and in May, official political support for the project was awarded. The main motivation was to establish a permanent space technology center in Norway that could stimulate further scientific growth. =Soviet protests= The Svalbard Treaty establishes Svalbard as both a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone, allowing a Soviet presence but hindering Norway from installing military fortifications.Ulfstein (1995): 352 The Soviet Union objected to the creation of the telemetry program and threatened to establish a counter-station. The basis was that the ground station was seen as having a military potential, that most ESRO members were also members of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and that Norway lacked sufficient competence to control whether or not military activities would take place at the station.Ulfstein (1995): 355 Norwegian authorities responded that the installation was to be used for scientific and peaceful activities under Norwegian control. Further, because of treaty only prohibited fortifications and not military activity as such, Norway held the right to conduct military scientific research and operate intelligence operations on the archipelago.Ulfstein (1995): 356 To minimize Soviet opposition, Norway attempted to move the debate from the political to the specialist scene, while at the same time establishing a protocol for Norwegian control and operation of the facility. To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection procedure to insure that the facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility.Tamnes (1992): 61 The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.Tamnes (1992): 62 In the Norwegian Government's internal evaluation, FFI stated that as long as regular inspections were carried out, there was little chance of military use of the installations, in particular because of the limited technical equipment which would be installed. The Norwegian Intelligence Service held a different opinion, and stated that if the right equipment was installed, the ground station could be used to listen to information from Soviet satellites in the area and that it would require a very competent inspector to find such equipment.Tamnes (1992): 64 Allowing Soviet inspectors access to the station was discussed politically, but this was quickly discarded as it would establish an unwanted precedent and would undermine the Norwegian sovereignty of the archipelago.Tamnes (1992): 65 Discussions between ESRO and Norwegian authorities continued, with ESRO pressing for a quick decision, while Norway was stalling the negotiations. This was carried out to allow time to develop solid counter-policy against the Soviet Union as well as to gain support for the installation to be located at Kongsfjorden outside Ny- √Ölesund. On the other hand, ESRO threatened to instead build the installation in northern Sweden and northern Canada and abandon the Svalbard plans. An agreement was reached between ESRO, Norwegian authorities and NTNF was on 14 December 1964. It established both the location and that NTNF would be Norway's party. The agreement allowed the station to be located in Ny-√Ölesund in exchange for Norwegian authorities building and operating the facility. While ESRO accepted NTNF as the Norwegian party, they wanted to receive a guarantee from the Norwegian authorities. However, to minimize Soviet criticism, the ministry was not interested in giving direct guarantees and asked that ESRO solely negotiate with NTNF. The official Soviet protest was issued on 17 February 1965 in a letter to the Norwegian government. Specifically, it stated that Norway would be violating Article 9 of the Svalbard Treaty, that the installation could be used for intelligence assessment and that Norway should have consulted the Soviet Union before making the decision. The issue was discussed by the Norwegian Cabinet of State six days later. Minister of Justice and acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Oscar Christian Gundersen regarded the protest as moderate and that it fell into a series of Soviet protests against any activity on Svalbard that could remotely be considered a potential cover-up for military activity. An official response was sent on 23 March, which rejected all the Soviet objections. It stated that Norwegian authorities had made agreements with ESRO that Norway would make sufficient inspections to insure that Article 9 was followed, it pointed out the open and civil nature of ESRO and rejected the Soviet claims that they had the right to be consulted in advance.Tamnes (1992): 63 Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen visited the Soviet Union in May 1965, in which Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin warned against the installation and stated that the Soviet Union would build a counter-station. In June, the Soviet Consul in Barentsburg came on an inspection to the installation, and on 2 July a Soviet helicopter crashed at the construction site after having, presumably unintentionally, touched a mast. Soviet demands to have permanent Soviet inspectors of the facility were rejected. The Svalbard Treaty does not include any verification procedure, and as such no signatories have the right to conduct inspections.Ulfstein (1995): 357 After the station opened, Soviet protests persisted. The issue was raised at official visits to the Soviet Union by Norwegian politicians in 1966, 1967 and 1968. The Soviet Consul in Barentsburg visited Ny-√Ölesund in 1968 and attempted to make inspections of the installation. On 28 August 1968, Norway and the Soviet Union agreed for a one-time, two-day Soviet inspection of the station. The last protest against the installation was made in April 1969.Tamnes (1992): 66 =Construction and operation= The agreement with ESRO was approved by the Parliament of Norway on 9 July 1965 and the final contract was signed on 13 August. It included clauses that secured non-members access to use the station if there was sufficient capacity, that Norwegian authorities were granted all necessary information about the installation's use, and that NTNF would approve all auxiliary installations. For NTNF, the establishment brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, the operations of installations had been placed with FFI. As FFI was a branch of the military, this structure could not be used in Svalbard. Thus NTNF had to organize an operative branch for the ground station.R√∏dberg and Collett (2004): 15 The responsibility for operating the telecommunications facilities was awarded to the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. The ground station needed a computer. FFI offered to deliver a Simulation for Automatic Machinery, while the alternative was to purchase a PDP-8 computer from Digital Equipment Corporation. As NTNF was responsible for the country's technological development, they chose to award the contract to FFI on the condition that they pay for a PDP-8 if they were not able to deliver a computer themselves.Nj√∏lstad and Wicken (1997): 260 Construction started in May 1965 and NTNF planned to use as much of the mining company Kings Bay's facilities as they could. NTNF was allowed to use buildings as needed for free. In exchange, NTNF maintained the entire village and paid insurance on the buildings they used. Movable property used by NTNF was bought for a moderate price. NTNF had to build several new buildings in addition to utilities such as power cables and water, sewer and heating pipes.Hanoa: 183 The new pipes had to be installed after the previous pipes, installed in 1956, had been subject to frost burst. Instead of building the pipes in a culvert, they were instead placed in wooded boxes above ground.Hanoa: 184 During the summer of 1965, 65 people were working on construction, although it fell to between 40 and 45 during the winter. The following winter, only five people overwintered. To allow ease of access and in case of emergencies, an ad hoc airport was built. Originally, Ny-√Ölesund Airport, Hamnerabben was simply a section of the road between the radomes and the settlement which was long and wide. The gravel was bound with waste oil and with gates at each end. To allow traffic to operate as usual during use, a small bypass road was also built.Hanoa: 185 A royal decree on 26 October 1967 established an Oslo-based chief inspector who was to inspect the facility at least once per year, and a local inspector who would inspect the facility at least once per week. The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of radio technology, Per Mortensen, was appointed chief inspector, while the manager of Ny- √Ölesund's coast radio station was appointed assistant inspector.√òvregard (1996): 330 The ground station and auxiliary facilities were ready for operation in 1967. Through its history, the station had five managers: Henning Nielsen (1965‚Äì67), Roald S√∏fteland (1967‚Äì68), Ewald √òyen (1968‚Äì70), Einar Enderud (1970‚Äì72) and Kristian Sneltvedt (1972‚Äì74). After the initial ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards satellites with a higher orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-√Ölesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, the size of the antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program,Kriege and Russo (2000): 142 and the facility was closed in 1974. Since the closing of the mines in 1963, the mining company Kings Bay had been working to establish Ny-√Ölesund as a research town. The telemetry station acted as an important stepping stone for research activity, and the plans for development of Ny-√Ölesund as a permanent research community continued past 1974. In 1997, Svalbard Satellite Station opened in Longyearbyen, which is among other stations used by ESTRACK. Facilities The ground station was located at Rabben, also known as Hamnerabben, a hill west of the settlement in Ny-√Ölesund, at the far end of the airport. It consisted of a one-story operations center and two antennas. The largest antenna, used for sending, had a diameter of , while the receiving antenna had a diameter of . Each was placed on a cubed, concrete foundation and surrounded with a plastic radome. Both antennas were automated to ensure that they were aimed at the satellite when they were in use. The receiving antenna was used both to download information about the satellites' condition and surroundings, as well as data download, which was stored on magnetic tape. The uplink was used to give the satellites orders. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station constituted one of the four initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and telemetry communication with ESRO's low Earth orbit satellites. The ground station communicated with the satellites in the 136‚Äì137 MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, allowed for a small antenna dish but gave a low bit rate. The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances. The facility had a Simulation for Automatic Machinery computer built by FFI which allowed for real-time operations with the data. Telecommunications systems were operated by the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration, which established a two-way radio station at Ny-√Ölesund. Communication from the satellites was relayed by radio to Ski and onwards with a leased line to the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Return information was relayed via a radio station at Jel√∏y. Magnetic tapes were sent to Darmstadt every other week, first via aircraft to Longyearbyen and then onwards to Germany.Hanoa: 186 NTNF hired a nurse and had the Amundsen House refitted as a clinic for the duration of the telemetry station's operation.Hanoa: 188 References ;Bibliography   * ;Notes Category:Earth stations in Norway Category:Science and technology in Svalbard Category:Ny-√Ölesund Category:1967 establishments in Norway Category:European Space Agency Category:Norway‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:Politics of Svalbard Category:Cold War history of Norway ","title":"Kongsfjord Telemetry Station"},{"id":"35440343","text":"The Archdeacon of Croydon is a senior ecclesiastical officer within the Diocese of Southwark.Diocesan web site As such the deacon is responsible for the disciplinary supervision of the clergy \\"ABCD: a basic church dictionary\\" Meakin, T: Norwich, Canterbury Press, 2001 within its five rural deaneries: Croydon Addington, Croydon Central, Croydon North, Croydon South and Sutton.Crockford's on line accessed Tuesday 10 April 2012 20:50GMT History The archdeaconry was created in the Diocese of Canterbury from the Archdeaconry of Maidstone by Order in Council on 1 April 1930 and transferred to the Diocese of Southwark on 1 January 1985.Podmore, Colin ‚Äì Aspects of Anglican Identity, p84 (Google Books) (Accessed 23 February 2013) List of archdeacons *19301937 (res.): Edward Woods, Bishop suffragan of Croydon *19301942 (res.): William Anderson, Bishop suffragan of Croydon *19421946 (res.): Harold Bradfield *19461947 (res.): Maurice Harland (also Bishop suffragan of Croydon since 1942) *194827 March 1957 (d.): Charles Tonks *19571967 (res.): Jesse Clayson *19671977 (ret.): John Hughes (also Bishop suffragan of Croydon since 1956) *19781993 (res.): Frederick Hazell :The archdeaconry was transferred to Southwark diocese on 1 January 1985. *199417 September 2011 (ret.): Tony Davies (afterwards archdeacon emeritus) *20111 February 2013 (ret.): Barry Goodwin (Acting) *14 April 201329 February 2020 (ret.): Chris Skilton *15 March 2020present: Rosemarie Mallett References Category:1930 establishments in England ","title":"Archdeacon of Croydon"},{"id":"35440385","title":"List of Romanian records in swimming"},{"id":"35440580","text":"Arthur Kelly may refer to: * Arthur Kelly (rugby) (1886‚Äì1965), New Zealand rugby footballer * Arthur D.

Horace Logo Traubel (1858-1919) was an American essayist, poet, magazine publisher, author, and Georgist. Traubel was closely associated with the Arts and Crafts movement in the United States and published a monthly literary magazine called The Conservator from 1890 until the time of his death. Although a poet of note in his own right, Traubel is best remembered as the literary executor and biographer of his friend, poet Walt Whitman, with whom he transcribed and compiled nine volumes of daily conversations, entitled With Walt Whitman in Camden. Biography =Early years= Horace L. Traubel was born in Camden, New Jersey on December 19, 1858, the son of an ethnic Jewish father and an ethnic German mother.Mildred Bain, Horace Traubel. New York: Albert and Charles Boni, 1913; pg. 11. His father, Maurice Traubel, had been born in Germany before emigrating to the United States as a young man, where he settled in Philadelphia and learned the trade of lithography. His mother, the former Katherine Grunder, was met by Maurice after his arrival. Horace was the fifth child of seven born to the couple. He left school at an early age, going to work at the age of 12 as a paperboy before working variously as a printers' assistant, lithographer, cub reporter at a newspaper, and bank clerk. Early in his life he came to know Walt Whitman, whose volume of poetry Leaves of Grass was the subject of much hostile commentary among the literary critics of the day.\\"Traubel, Socialist Poet, Dies in Ontario: Wife and Daughter Survive Writer, Who Was Active Thirty Years in the Radical Movement,\\" New York Call, vol. 12, no. 252 (Sept. 9, 1919), pg. 1. Traubel married in 1891. He and his wife Anne had two children ‚Äî a daughter who survived him and a son who died at the age of 5. The family moved from Philadelphia to neighboring Camden, New Jersey, but Traubel maintained an office across the Delaware River in the big city for years afterwards.Bain, Horace Traubel, pg. 12. =Career= Traubel began to write himself in the late 1880s, specializing in literary criticism and poetry. In 1890 Traubel founded a literary journal, The Conservator, a monthly publication which he continued until the time of his death nearly three decades later. While the publication never attained a mass readership, it was well regarded for its quality and spirit by literary aficionados of the day. Traubel signed most his later work in the journal \\"T.\\", previously \\"H. T.\\" and \\"H. L. T.\\" During the years 1903 to 1907 Traubel was associated with another literary magazine, The Artsman, which he edited along with Will Price and Hawley McLanahan. The Artsman was associated with the Rose Valley Association, part of the international Arts and Crafts movement of the day. Traubel was a dedicated socialist and was among the founders of The Worker, a socialist weekly newspaper in New York City which was later transformed into the Socialist daily New York Call. Traubel was the author of many unsigned editorials in early issues of that paper and contributed a daily essay, often dealing with a spiritual topic. Many of Traubel's essays from The Worker were eventually collected into hard covers as a book entitled Chants Communal. Traubel was a regular correspondent of a number of leading political radicals of his day, including Socialist Party leader Eugene V. Debs, anarchist Emma Goldman, and California novelist Upton Sinclair. A close personal friend and literary heir of Walt Whitman, Traubel was a key figure in memorializing the great American poet. During his own life Traubel managed to see into print three volumes on Whitman's life and philosophy during his final years. Six additional volumes of Traubel's Walt Whitman in Camden were published posthumously, bringing the total length of the work to nine volumes.\\"Horace L. Traubel,\\" The Walt Whitman Archive, www.whitmanarchive.org/ =Death and legacy= During his last few years of life Traubel's health failed him. He suffered a stroke in the summer of 1918 which paralyzed his left leg and impacted his vision.David Karsner, Horace Traubel: His Life and Work. New York: Egmont Arens, 1919; pp. 17-18. That fall he moved with his wife to stay with a friend in Norwich, Connecticut, but there his health became steadily worse.Karsner, Horace Traubel, pg. 19. In April 1919 Traubel moved to New York City staying at the apartment of his biographer, David Karsner.Karsner, Horace Traubel, pg. 20. There he suffered a series of debilitating heart attacks from which he never fully recovered. Although critically weak in his last days, Traubel decided to set out on one last trip at the end of the summer of 1919, setting out for Canada. He died early in September 1919 at Bon Echo, Ontario, near the city of Toronto. He was 60 years old at the time of his death. Traubel's funeral, held Thursday, September 11, 1919, was interrupted when the church at which it was to be held, located at 34th Street and Park Avenue in New York City, burst into flames just as the hearse containing Traubel's body rolled up outside the building.\\"Church of Messiah Burns; Funeral of Horace Traubel Moves to People's House,\\" New York Call, vol. 12, no. 255 (Sept. 12, 1919), pp. 1-2. About 1,000 people gathered at the scene, most of whom were present to attend the service, and a quick decision was made to relocate the funeral to the so-called \\"People's House,\\" home of the Rand School of Social Science, located at 7 East 15th Street. When the gathering finally reassembled, several of Traubel's poems from Optimos were read in tribute, with Dr. Percival G. Wiksell of Boston presiding. Traubel was buried in Harleigh Cemetery in Camden, New Jersey, close to Walt Whitman's tomb.

Cho ªlpon was one of Central Asia's most popular poets during the first half of the 20th century. He was also the first person to translate William Shakespeare's plays into the Uzbek language. Cho ªlpon's works had a major impact on the works of other Uzbek writers. He was one of the first authors to introduce realism into Uzbek literature. Cho ªlpon was executed during the Great Purge under the leadership of Joseph Stalin.  Life  Abdulhamid Sulaymon o ªg ªli Yunusov was born in 1893 in Andijan. His father, Sulaymonqul Mulla Muhammad Yunus o ªg ªli, was a learned man. Cho ªlpon first studied at a madrasa. Later he enrolled in a Russian tuzem school (), an elementary school for non-Russians in Turkestan. From 1919 until 1920, Cho ªlpon worked as editor-in-chief of the newspaper TurkROSTA. He also worked on the editorial board of many other publications, such as Ishtirokiyun, Qizil bayroq (The Red Flag), Turkiston (Turkestan), Buxoro axbori (Bukhara News), and Darhon. Like many Uzbek authors of his time, such as Abdulla Qodiriy and Abdulrauf Fitrat, Cho ªlpon was executed during the Great Purge under the leadership of Joseph Stalin. He was arrested as \\"enemy of the people\\" in 1937 and was killed on 4 October 1938.  Work  Cho ªlpon's first poems were published in O ªzbek yosh shoirlari (Young Uzbek Poets), a collection of poems by young Uzbek poets, in 1922. His three collections of poems, namely, Uyg ªonish (The Awakening) (1922), Buloqlar (The Springs) (1924), and Tong sirlari (The Secrets of Dawn) (1926) were published during his lifetime. Cho ªlpon's novel Kecha va kunduz (Night and Day) is one of the most highly acclaimed novels in Uzbek literature. Cho ªlpon's works had a major impact on the works of other Uzbek writers. He was one of the first authors to introduce realism into Uzbek literature. Cho ªlpon used clear and straightforward language in his works. He appealed to Uzbek national identity in some of his works and because of it was criticized as a bourgeois nationalist in Soviet sources. He was finally rehabilitated during glasnost. In addition to writing numerous poems, plays, and short stories, Cho ªlpon translated the works of many famous foreign writers, such as Alexander Pushkin, Maxim Gorky, and William Shakespeare into the Uzbek language. In particular, he translated Shakespeare's Hamlet into Uzbek. He also translated Boris Godunov and Dubrovsky of Pushkin.

Cassiday, Sr. (April 12, 1892 ‚Äì January 21, 1967) was one of the leading Congressional bootleggers during National Prohibition. Known as ‚Äúthe man in the green hat,‚Äù he sold liquor for ten years to congressmen and senators. In October 1930, he came forward and told his story in six front-page articles in the Washington Post. The articles pointed out Congressional hypocrisy and made the public even more jaded about Prohibition. His admission made both national news and an impact on the midterm Congressional elections just a week later.  History  Born in 1892 to a Methodist and WCTU family in Wheeling, West Virginia, Cassiday (pronounced ‚ÄúCass-i-dee'‚Äù) fought in World War I and founded the Irish War Veterans association. When he couldn‚Äôt qualify for his pre-war job working for the Pennsylvania Railroad, he came to bootlegging almost by accident. ‚ÄúA friend of mine told me that liquor was bringing better prices on Capitol Hill than anywhere else in Washington and that a living could be made supplying the demand,‚Äù he wrote in the Post. His first customers were two southern congressmen, both of whom had voted for the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. Cassiday operated out of the Cannon House Office Building from 1920‚Äì1925, then shifted to the Russell Senate Office Building after his 1925 arrest, as he noted that senators were more discreet. After his final arrest in February 1930, Cassiday agreed to stop bootlegging. That fall, he agreed to write a series of six articles for The Washington Post. With the exception of naming names, he told his entire story, including how he got his start, where he bought the booze, how he smuggled it in, and how Congress gave him an office to work out of. The series ran October 24‚Äì29, 1930 (the Post ran an introductory article on October 23). The final article ran exactly one week before the midterm election day. Cassiday met most members of Congress during his ten years bootlegging. He wrote, ‚ÄúAs the result of my experience on Capitol Hill since prohibition went into effect I would say that four out of five senators and congressmen consume liquor either at their offices or their homes.‚Äù Cassiday concluded his article series by declaring that he was giving up bootlegging. He accepted responsibility, but said that Congress was likewise culpable. ‚ÄúConsidering that I took the risk and did the leg work from 1920 to 1930, I am more than willing to let the general public decide how I stack up with the senator or representative who ordered the stuff and consumed it on the premises or transported it to his home.‚Äù Cassiday‚Äôs articles in The Washington Post were a contributing factor to the Republican defeat in the 1930 midterm election. The dry Republican majority was ousted, and replaced by a wet Democratic majority that supported the repeal of Prohibition. After his 1930 arrest, Cassiday was convicted of a felony and sentenced to eighteen months in jail. He never spent a night in prison, as he was allowed to sign out every night and sign back in the next morning. He went on to work in a shoe factory and several hotels in the Washington area. He died in 1967 at age 74. Cassiday‚Äôs second wife destroyed the ‚Äúblack book‚Äù that Cassiday used to keep track of customers and their purchases. He never revealed who his customers were ‚Äì beyond admitting that it was most of Congress. In 2012, the first post-Prohibition distillery in Washington, DC, New Columbia Distillers, launched Green Hat Gin named after George Cassiday.

Neurobiology Much of the early work that Kuniyoshi collaborated on deals with the brain in relation to humans and apes. He has stated that the brain is much like a movie in that it gathers a string of stimuli and delivers them to the brain, which then encodes them into a memory. Language Some of the focus of Kuniyoshi's research is related to language acquisition. In an online article published by ScienceNOW in which rewiring of the brain is emphasized, Kuniyoshi comments on human uniqueness of the brain compared to apes. The articles states that through evolutionary time, language has become more specialized due to a rewiring in the brain through the arcuate fasciculus. Human Uniqueness is related to the Design Features of Language proposed by Charles Hockett. Kuniyoshi also has composed research on the brain and reading written language relating to words and sentences. Kuniyoshi's work has shown the different area of the brain that work when reading individual words and when reading sentences.

The Land of Carchemish Project has benefited from the funding and sponsorship of the Council for British Research in the Levant, and continued with funding from the British Academy, and for the 2010 field season from the Global Heritage Fund. It was designed with the aim of redressing the imbalance in archaeological survey work which has resulted from the large number of rescue excavations instigated as a result of the creation of dams on the Euphrates. The Project aimed to provide a broader landscape context to the ancient major site of Carchemish, investigating the terrain away from the river. It has demonstrated that the area was well settled throughout the Holocene period and that the seemingly dense settlement of the Euphrates Valley continues away from the river valley towards the west. Consequently, the ‚Äòabundant pasture lands‚Äô posited as a requirement of the models of tribal states need to be fitted within a landscape of settlement, and presumably control, by a number of local communities. Although there is some attenuation into the uplands, the presence of dense settlement in relatively minor valleys such as the Nahr al Amarna as well as on the upland plains to the west, provides a counterweight to the better known spreads of settlement along the Euphrates.

He was ordained as Priest by Bishop William Vaughan of Plymouth in 1890. Because at that time there were no monasteries in Swabia, Boniface made periodic trips to that province to recruit novices for the Buckfast community.

Dr Macnamara of Torquay presented the Abbot with a donation of ¬£1000 to begin the rebuilding and work began on the West front of the Abbey. Boniface was also responsible for the restoration of the statue of Our Lady of Buckfast, which had been damaged at the time of the Reformation. This ancient statue, recovered by the Community, still retained some fragments of colour and gilding. The statue was blessed in the temporary church at Buckfast on 24 May 1903.

Modern scholars often classify it as a \\"Matter of England\\" romance, because it deals entirely with English settings and characters. It is mainly written in twelve-line stanzas rhyming AABCCBDDBEEB, though the poet occasionally varies his meter with stanzas of eight, six, or four lines. The poem survives in only one manuscript, the early 15th century Gonville and Caius MS 175, which also includes the romances Richard Coer de Lyon, Sir Isumbras and Beves of Hamtoun. It has no title there. Athelston was first printed in 1829, when C. H. Hartshorne included it in his Ancient Metrical Tales.  Synopsis  Four messengers meet by chance in a forest and swear an oath of brotherhood to each other. Their names are Wymound, Egeland, Alryke and Athelston, cousin to the king of England. Athelston succeeds to the throne, and takes the opportunity to make Wymound and Egeland earls, and Alryke archbishop of Canterbury. He also marries his sister Edyff to Egeland. Wymound responds to his sworn brother's good fortune by going to the king and accusing Egeland of treachery. Athelston imprisons Egeland, Edyff and their sons, and resolves to kill them. However the archbishop, Alryke, arrives on the scene having been summoned by Athelston's wife. Athelston threatens to banish Alryke, and Alryke threatens to excommunicate Athelston. The people side with the archbishop, and Athelston is forced to offer the accused parties the chance to clear themselves by undergoing the ordeal by fire. They pass the test, and Athelston responds by naming Egeland and Edyff's son St. Edmund as his own heir. Wymound fails a similar ordeal and is executed.  Identity of Athelston  Several legends about the historical √Üthelstan, grandson of Alfred the Great, were current in the later Middle Ages, but it is disputed whether this poem should be included among them. Little of the romance's plot resembles anything in the known history of √Üthelstan's reign, and it has been pointed out that there were other √Üthelstans in Anglo-Saxon history who could have suggested the name. However Athelston's family in the poem does call the facts of 10th century royal genealogy to mind, in so far as √Üthelstan had a sister called Edith, and was succeeded by an Edmund, son of a different Edith. There is also a story, reported by the chronicler William of Malmesbury, that king √Üthelstan sentenced his brother Eadwine to an almost certain death because of a false accusation that Eadwine was conspiring against him, and that, repenting too late, √Üthelstan had the accuser executed.

Work =The Dancers Series= The complete collection of the Dancers Series was exhibited for the first time as part of the programme of the Varna International Ballet Competition in 2008, in a joint exhibition with Paola's father, the sculptor Ivan Minekov. The exhibition was opened by the organisers of the Competition, covered by the Bulgarian National Television and attended by √âlisabeth Platel. The Dancers paintings received critical acclaim by Prof. Dr. V. V. Vanslov, Director of the Research Institute of Theory and History of Fine Art at The Russian Academy of Arts, Moscow who also attended the exhibition. In 2010 Paola created 3 additional paintings for a Charity Ballet Gala in the Britten Theatre, Royal College of Music in London. The paintings are based on sketches of Celisa Diuana, a dancer from The Royal Ballet and dancers from the Ballet Black Dance Company. In the audience were Dame Vivienne Westwood, Clemency Burton-Hill, Monica Mason & Maina Gielgud. Description: Great bold strokes uncover composite figures, enveloped in the soft light of the stage. The figure here is just a silhouette, without outlines, and the stroke of colour alone creates the form. The soft gentle tones impart an almost physical sense of light, dispersing and contrasting in the ballet costumes. =The Undercurrents Series= The Undercurrents Series explores the feminine perspective of relationships between lovers, friends and family members. In 2007 the painting Everywoman became the symbol of a research into the psychological impact of genetic breast and ovarian cancer at the Leiden University Medical Centre. In 2011 Everywoman was used on the cover of the research publication. In 2011-2012 Paola collaborated with art critic and author Claudia Moscovici, creating The Seducer painting, inspired by Moscovici's research and novel by the same name, to raise awareness of psychopathic seduction and domestic abuse of women. =The Faberge Big Egg Hunt= In 2012 Paola created Colourful World, one of the 200 giant fibreglass eggs hidden across London as part of The Big Egg Hunt. She was inspired to paint the globe as an interlocking jigsaw, using primary colours to suggest a playful childlike simplicity which contrasts with the complex reality of geopolitics. The egg was featured in numerous publications in the UK and Bulgaria. It sold at auction for ¬£4350.

The election used the 7 wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with 23 councillors elected. The election saw Labour regain their previous position as the largest party on the council as they regained 3 of the seats they had lost in the 2007 Local Elections while also significantly increasing their vote share. The Scottish National Party also increased their representation and remained in second place on the authority with 2 net gains. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party increased their representation to 3 seats while Independents retained their single seat on the authority. The Scottish Liberal Democrats were decimated, losing all their six seats although two members had defected after 2007 and one of these councillors was re-elected as a Scottish Nationalist, the other failed to be re-elected as a Scottish Nationalist. Following the election the Labour Party formed a coalition with the Conservative Party, with Councillor Willie Innes of the Labour Party becoming leader of the council and experienced Conservative Councillor Ludovic Broun- Lindsay becoming provost, resigning as leader of the Conservatives on the council to hold the provost role in a non-partisan and non-party political way, with new councillor Michael Veitch becoming leader of the Conservative group. This new coalition replaced the previous SNP - Lib Dem coalition administration, which had existed from 2007 to 2012. Background The previous elections in 2007 had returned no one party with enough councillors to create majority single-party governance as there had been in East Lothian up until that point. The SNP and Labour both returned 7 councillors to the chamber, the Liberal Democrats won 6, the Conservatives 2 and a sole independent candidate was elected as councillor. After the election, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition, throwing the Labour out of office, having previously controlled the council with a large majority for many years before that. The 2012 election was the first since Councillor David Berry had fallen only 151 votes short of winning East Lothian for the SNP in the 2011 Scottish Parliament Elections a major coup due to the seat being considered a traditional Labour stronghold seat and it being the seat of then leader of Scottish Labour, Iain Gray. While nationally at that election the SNP was the first party to gain an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. With this result still fresh in the mind, the SNP predicted major gains, including taking overall majority control of many councils including East Lothian. The Labour Party, in many aspects still reeling from national electoral annihilation on a national level during the previous year's election, had come into the election with the hope of gaining seats, with a slim hope gaining a majority control of the council. The Liberal Democrats had struggled during the previous five years of leadership on the council with the SNP. They had suffered the defection of wife-and-husband councillor duo of Ruth and Stuart Currie on 11 August 2009 to their coalition partners, the SNP, due to \\"personal disagreements\\" with fellow Liberal Democrat councillors. This reduced their representation on the council from 6 to 4, weakening their hand in the rule coalition. It also had the effect of damaging the morale and effectiveness of the local party. This was also the Scottish Liberal Democrats' second election since the entering coalition with the Conservative Party in the UK Parliament. The party had suffered badly at the 2011 Scottish Parliament Election, and it was expected that this would continue in the 2012 local elections. For the Scottish Conservatives, it was the first election since the election of Ruth Davidson as leader of the party in Scotland. On a local the Conservatives entered the election in East Lothian with a realistic hope of a gain in the election through Michael Veitch, who was the Conservative candidate in the 2010 general election in East Lothian, in the Dunbar and East Linton ward. Previously the Conservatives had come second in the 2010 General Election, a very good result. The party locally believed that it would be able to hold the balance of power in the new makeup of the council with the opinion of working with either the Labour Party or the SNP on a local level. Independent John Caldwell had first been elected in 2007, and the local media felt that he would keep his seat during this election. There was little chance of this changing due to him being considered an effective local politician by the majority of the public. He was joined by 3 other independent candidates who were standing in other wards, none of whom, it was felt, who stood a realistic chance of being elected. Two minor parties also took part in the election, UKIP and Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, each standing 2 and 1 candidates respectively. This was the first time that both of these parties were standing candidates in the East Lothian Council elections since the introduction of the current voting system. Since the election in 2012 Councillor David Berry has left the SNP and now sits as an Independent Nationalist councillor. In April 2013 Councillor Stuart Currie replaced Councillor Paul McLennan as SNP Group Leader and Leader of the Opposition. Election result Note: \\"Votes\\" are the first preference votes. The net gain/loss and percentage changes relate to the result of the previous Scottish local elections on 3 May 2007. This may differ from other published sources showing gain/loss relative to seats held at dissolution of Scotland's councils.

They were formed in 1985 by Marco Ant√¥nio, Val√©rio Exterminator and Rodrigo dos Anjos. To date they have released five records through Cogumelo Records. They have been described by the journalist Eduardo Rivadavia as \\"Quite possibly the most controversial Brazilian heavy metal band ever\\". History Holocausto were formed in 1985 by Marco Ant√¥nio (bass), Val√©rio Exterminator (vocals and guitar) and Rodrigo dos Anjos (guitar). After recording a demo (Massacre, 1985) and contributing to Cogumelo's Warfare Noise I, the band caused controversy with their 1987 debut record, Campo de Exterm√≠nio. Whilst previous South American bands, such as Sepultura, Vulcano and Sarc√≥fago had toyed with anti-Christian sentiment and Satanism, Holocausto used vivid descriptions of Nazi atrocities in the concentration camps, leading to accusations of antisemitism. The band have claimed that they were \\"only trying to expose the horrors of the Holocaust in all its gruesome detail\\" and \\"that the album's shocking and unflinching descriptions were simply meant to show their own revulsion to the events that had inspired their name\\". The band continued with numerous line-up changes, releasing a series of albums through Cogumelo Records, without capitalizing on their early notoriety. 1988's Blocked Minds and 1990's Negatives were thrash-oriented and stylistically similar to Voivod's music, while 1993's Tozago as Deismno carried an industrial influence. These albums proved a lack of success for the band, that has been ascribed to their line-up difficulties and their late adoption of English lyrics and the subject matter of their debut. They did however reform in 2004, releasing a new hardcore-tinged album (De Volta ao Front) in 2005. On April 1, 2017, Holocausto released an extended play titled War Metal Massacre, returning to their black metal origins. The band's sixth studio album, Di√°rio de Guerra, was released on July 31, 2019.

MediaPortal MediaPortal is free and open-source software media center written for Microsoft Windows that is initially based on forked XBMC source code by Erwin Beckers (a.k.a. Frodo, who was also one of the original founders of XBMC) in February 2004. The reason for this fork to Microsoft Windows was to get away from hardware and software platform limitations of the Xbox game-console platform that XBMC development started on, mainly because of the Xbox inability to support TV-tuner adapters natively as Erwin wanted PVR functionality. Now after several years and innumerable feature changes there has been almost a complete re-design of the source code, however the skinning engine of MediaPortal 1.X.X still remains very similar to that of the original XBMC software making it relatively easy for people to port skins/themes back and forth between the two projects, something that is done quite frequently.

Designed as a hybrid integration between Kodi/XBMC media center software and Dreambox's Enigma2 PVR software scripts, running on an OpenPLi forked from PLi git (which in turn is based on OpenEmbedded Linux operating system for embedded systems), it is as such also fully compatible with PLi plugins and coding infrastructure. The project was first announced on 25 May 2015, and is maintained by the Black Hole Team, a team of independent developers of long popular community driven firmware images for Vu+-based set top-boxes, however these Open Black Hole project images is completely separate from the original Black Hole image for Vu+.http://git.vuplus-community.net/ Open Black Hole git source code repository OpenELEC Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Center (OpenELEC) is a free and open-source embedded operating system providing a complete media center software suite that comes with a pre- configured version of XBMC and third-party addons with retro video game console emulators and digital video recorder (PVR/DVR) plugins. OpenELEC is a very small and fast booting Linux-based distribution, mainly designed to boot from flash memory card such as CompactFlash or a solid-state drive, similar to that of the XBMC Live distribution, but designed to a minimum set-top box hardware setup based on ARM system on a chip SoC's or Intel x86 processor and graphics. Over the years OpenELEC have had partnerships and sponsor deals with several media player manufacturers and home theater PC media center system integrates as OEM firmware developers, with OpenELEC maintaining the operating-systems on their hardware. OpenPCTV OpenPCTV is a XBMC-based open source Linux distribution for personal computers and embedded system to be used as DVR/PVR set-top boxes and media player appliance boxes. Just like E2BMC, OpenPCTV is also designed as a hybrid integration between XBMC and Dreambox's Enigma2 PVR software scripts, using Video Disk Recorder (VDR) as the TV tuner backend server and OpenBricks based Linux operating system images for embedded systems.

Feingold said that he would still try to collaborate with most Team-XBMC members behind the scenes and at least try to keep Plex skinning engine compatible with XBMC skins. While Plex began as a free software hobby project, since 2010 it is commercial software (freeware) that is today owned and developed by one for-profit startup company, Plex, Inc., and today parts of what Plex offers is closed source proprietary software. The Linux, Macintosh, and Windows servers and clients are free, and offer their Android and iOS clients for a small one-time charge. Feingold was the Team-XBMC member who first initiated the Mac OS X port of XBMC, but soon after he left the original XBMC project due to what was arguably a falling-out with rest of Team-XBMC's developer members over the team's priorities feeling that the XBMC project should aim for strict adherence to the GPL and always keep to an open-source software mindset. This disagreement is claimed to be one of the main factors that led Elan to leave the XBMC project and create the Plex fork. PrismCube by Marusys PrismCube by Marusys is a DVB-S2 Twin-Tuner high-definition DVR/PVR set top box with true Digital Satellite Equipment Control (DiSEqC) support running native XBMC as its main media center GUI interface atop Linux for embedded systems.http://www.prismcube.com/ PrismCubehttp://prismcube.org PrismCube.org Community Released in October 2013, this first hardware model is marketed as \\"PrismCube Ruby\\" in Europe, North Africa, and Middle East, and it is also sold under different brand names such as \\"Kasys Prismcube Ruby\\", \\"AB IPBox Prismcube Ruby\\", and \\"Openbox Prismcube Ruby\\".http://linux-tv.com/receiver/ab- ipbox-prismcube-ruby/ Prismcube Ruby Review - XBMC Satellite Receiver - Linux- TV.com PrismCube Ruby firmware image is based on OpenEmbedded-Linux, and uses Marusys's own PVR backend software that integrated itself into XBMC's GUI, so currently the PVR front-end GUI functions and features on PrismCube are not part of native XBMC core code, though they use the same skin texture elements to achieve some what similar look and feel interface, a ported fork which Marusys calls \\"XBMC4STB\\" (XBMC for Set-Top-Boxes), which is the same name that Vu+ have given to their XBMC port too.http://www.astrasat.nl/digitale- ontvangers/prismcube-xbmc-mediaplayer.html PrismCube XBMC mediaplayerhttp://digitalt.tv/prismcube-set-top-box-baseret-pa-xbmc/ Prismcube ‚Äì Set Top PVR Box baseret p√• XBMChttp://volpefirm.com/tech-review-i-hbbtv- linux-a-cool-box/ Tech Review HbbTV, Linux & a Cool Box Third-party firmware images for PrismCube Ruby is also being developed by the Black Hole Team, a team of independent developers of long popular community driven firmware images for Vu+-based set top-boxes.https://www.facebook.com/BlackHoleTeam Black Hole Teamhttp://www.prismcube-community.net PrismCube-Community.Net Qt Media Hub Qt Media Hub, also termed QtMediaHub or Qt MediaHub, by Nokia, is a proof of concept port of XBMC to QML and Qt framework on ARM platforms for the MeeGo, Maemo, and Mer projects, to demonstrate the power and flexibility of using Qt/QML, and also to show the best practices when using Qt/QML.http://sf2011.meego.com/program/sessions/qtmediahub-implementation- xbmc-inspired-media-player-qml QtMediaHub - The implementation of a XBMC inspired media player in QMLhttp://projects.developer.nokia.com/qtmediahub Qt Media Hub - Nokia Developerhttp://qt-project.org/wiki/QtMediaHub Qt MediaHub - Qt Developer Networkhttp://gitorious.org/qtmediahub#more qtmediahub on Gitorioushttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZXV4J0d_nE Qt Media Hub in actionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ellvo0r8cAY QtMediaHub Demo by Aamlogichttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZrGWKXdjkg QtMediaHub (Delphin skin)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjsxKEacIkU Qtmediahub on trimslice RasPlex RasPlex is a Plex for Linux-based OS distribution designed and optimized for the Raspberry Pi so ARM CPU, like Plex it is a forked version of XBMC.https://github.com/RasPlex/plex-home-theatre RasPlex Plex Home Theatre forked from XBMC RasPlex's has the look and feel like Plex Home Theater.

It is designed for both first-party (i.e., media player devices from Rippl-TV Electronics) and also licensed to third- parties (OEM/ODM) and other commercial partners for branding. Marketed as a \\"entertainment ecosystem\\" derived from XBMC Media Center, that builds atop an underlying custom Android operating system. Rippl-TV platform consists of \\"XBMC Rippl-TV Edition\\" which is a fork of XBMC, and the current version of \\"UtilOS\\" is a fork of Android 4.4 (KitKat) firmware. Seebo MAXX Seebo MAXX, or MAXX by Seebo, is a DVB-S2 Twin-Tuner high-definition DVR/PVR and IPTV set-top-box running a forked version of XBMC as its main media center GUI interface atop native Linux for embedded systems. Released in October 2014, and initially targeting the Australian market, the hardware specification of the first model includes an Intel Atom dual-core processor, NVIDIA GeForce GT218 graphics, and 500 GB harddrive for storage. SPMC SPMC by SemperPax is a fork of XBMC media center software for Android that is mainly maintained by Christian Browet (a.k.a. Koying), who is also a developer on Team-XBMC of the official XBMC for Android. SPMC is basically a plain fork of XBMC 13.x (Gotham), with some minor tweaks specific to various Android devices.http://spmc.semperpax.com SPMC by Koying The main difference between SPMC and the official upstream XBMC is that SPMC is available to download directly from most Android app stores, such as Google Play,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.semperpax.spmc SPMC by SemperPax on Google Play Store Amazon Appstore,https://www.amazon.com/Semperpax-SPMC/dp/B00MK49LL8 SPMC by SemperPax on Amazon Appstore and Ouya App Store. Thus SPMC does not have to be side- loaded like the official upstream XBMC, yet the signature is different from the XBMC one, so both can co-exist on the same device, with separate userdata. TOFU Media Center by Pivos TOFU Media Platform by Pivos Technology Group, Inc., is a development framework and software platform based on XBMC for Android, designed for both first-parties (i.e., media player devices from Pivos) and licensed to third parties (OEM) and other commercial partners. Marked as an \\"entertainment ecosystem\\" derived from XBMC Media Center, that builds atop underlying embedded operating systems such as Android or Linux variants. TOFU Media Platform consists of TOFU Media Center which is a fork of XBMC, and the current version of TOFU Media OS is a fork of Android 4.2 (Jellybean). The first commercial third-party device to have official ToFu Media Center (Android version) application support was the GameStick video game console developed by PlayJam. Pivos's own first device that comes with the complete TOFU Media Platform (TOFU Media OS and TOFU Media Center) preloaded is their Pivos XIOS XS media player. VidOn Media Center by VidOn.me VidOn.me, or VidOnMe, is a company that maintains a commercial fork and derivative of XBMC media center software, named VidOn Media Center (formerly VidOn XBMChttp://www.vidon.me/vidon_xbmc.htm VidOn XBMC),http://androidcommunity.com/vidon-box-runs-a-custom-version-of-android- xbmc-20140822/ VidOn Box runs a custom version of Android XBMC and other than offering non-XBMC based media player software for iOS and Android, they also sell set-top boxes and Mini PCs with Android 4.x that comes with XBMC pre- installed re-branded under the VidOn.me name. They also offer iOS and Android remote control apps for their VidOn.me media player software, both which the company claim to be fully cross-compatible with remote control apps designed for XBMC and vice versa. VidOn.me is also one of the official sponsors of the XBMC Foundation with annual donation.http://xbmc.org/about/friends-and- sponsors/ Voddler Voddler is a commercial video-on-demand service and client software streaming movies and television programming, similar to Spotify and Grooveshark, but for video. From its first release at 1 July 2009 up until 24 February 2010, Voddler's media player software was initially based on a fork of the XBMC open source code. Voddler violated the license for XBMC's source code by neglecting to release all of their modifications that they used in their application as required per the GPL, and they have been publicly criticized for this. Voddler's newer media player software is since 8 March 2010 now instead based on the Adobe Air closed-source application platform. XBMC4STB project by Vu+ Vu+, or VuPlus, is made by a Korean multimedia vendor, which is a manufacturer of Linux-based Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) Satellite (DVB-S), and Terrestrial (DVB-T), digital television receivers (set-top box) with true Digital Satellite Equipment Control (DiSEqC) support that all currently are MIPS-based and uses Enigma2 toolkit software atop a Linux-based operating system as firmware.http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/01/17/linux-based-vu-dvb-set-top- boxes-now-support-xbmckodi/ Linux based Vu+ DVB Set-top Boxes Now Support XBMC/Kodi In September 2011, Vu+ Day in Amsterdam it was first publicly announced that the next-generation Vu+ DVB satellite receivers to be released publicly in the end of 2012 will be ARM-powered and use XBMC Media Center software for its main GUI, an OpenEmbedded-based development-project that they call XBMC for Set-Top-Boxes (XBMC4STB), with beta releases of both the software and new hardware said to be made available to XBMC developers before they are released to the public. It took however two more years before a native source port of XBMC was available to use on the newer Vu+ (VuPlus) based set-top box models which are Vu+ Solo SE, Vu+ Solo 2, and Vu+ Duo 2, (and no XBMC will not be made available for older Vu+ set-top boxes due to hardware limitations with missing OpenGL graphics acceleration).http://www.satnigmo.com/2787/xbmc-kodi-vu-coming-soon/ XBMC (Kodi) for Vu+ coming soon!

Modelled on the American TV show The Hills, the production company describe the series as a reality show version of soap opera Home and Away. The final episode was shown on Monday 10 September 2012.The Shire Axed From Channel 10 - Final Show Announced!

TV blogger Steven Molk wrote \\"As a first episode, The Shire ticked all the boxes. It established the characters well (in that we all know what to expect from them in future episodes), set out the premise of the show quickly and offered tidbits of insight into the relationships between the key players.\\" Pedestrian TV's review was favourable noting, \\"While Sophie and Vernesa are frontrunners as my early favourites, I was also quite taken with the character Rif-Raf... Reality television is a genre that shouldn't be confused with documentary television... I think The Shire is just great.\\" John Birmingham of the Brisbane Times also gave a favourable review, \\"Lest you judge me, before I have a chance to get judgey, just let me say I loved this TV train wreck. I loved it like a diabetic loves that last, choc-dipped fudge brownie that sends him hurtling towards surgery for the emergency amputation of his gangrenous toes.\\" A less favourable review was given by Michael Idato of The Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Does Ten have a hit on its hands? The answer is nearly, but not quite. It needs to be doing modest business on the good side of the million-viewer watermark for that. But it's a noisy nearly-hit, and in a room where everyone's talking, silence is death. The fact that most people will kick the show doesn't mean much; the \\"reality\\" genre is engineered to create conversation, not adoration. And a hater, in commercial terms, is probably worth one and a half genuine fans.\\" According to the official OzTAM ratings data the premiere episode of The Shire received 941,000 (1.01M with +7 data) viewers while the second episode grew to 1.06M. The total viewers for the third episode decreased due to the scheduling of the London Olympic Games however the series consistently maintained healthy ratings throughout its run. The show has also been sold internationally and is currently available on the US online platform Hulu. Controversy The pilot episode generated significant controversy in Australian media and has been described as \\"edgy\\" and \\"offensive\\". Following a clip leaked in March 2012, local residents were angry that the area and residents would be portrayed negatively. The Mayor of Sutherland Shire Carol Provan vowed to take \\"any means possible\\" to stop the production crews filming in the area. The local council reportedly put forward a motion at a council meeting on 19 March saying they did \\"not approve the filming of The Shire and [would] not co- operate in any way with the production\\". The mayor urged locals not to cooperate with the makers of the program. Network Ten defied critics and pushed ahead with production. Controversy also arose after it was revealed that several of the stars were not actually Shire natives.http://news.ninemsn.com.au/entertainment/8500787/the-shire-characters- are-not-locals See also *WAG Nation *The Hills References Category:Network 10 original programming Category:2012 Australian television series debuts Category:2012 Australian television series endings Category:Australian reality television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in Sydney ","title":"The Shire (TV series)"},{"id":"35442894","text":"Kharabeesh logo Kharabeesh ( ) is a Jordan-based company that produces Arabic- language animated cartoons, music videos and talk shows that generally tackle political issues in the Arab world.

Their aim was to produce satirical animated videos and distribute them solely through new media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.http://www.gilimag.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=143:kharabeesh&catid;=34:fun&Itemid;=53 Attili traces the genesis of the idea for Kharabeesh to 2005-2006, when the founders felt that there was ‚Äúa lack and a need for Arabic content‚Äù in the world of social media and online videos. Initially operating out of a small office in Jabal Amman, Amman, Kharabeesh has now grown to become an open space where illustrators, animators, designers work collaboratively. A profile of Kharabeesh and Attili in the magazine Jordan Business writes that \\"Attili brought together his college buddies, who were all struggling to manage their own slew of start-ups in the web industry, and decided to form Kharabeesh.\\" http://www.jordan-business.net/images/stories/May%202011/Kharabeesh.pdf The founders of Kharabeesh originally decided to orient their content along political themes that are salient for most Arabs, as opposed to cultural and social issues that are distinct to each individual country. The Kharabeesh founders also felt that the internet and online media were the ideal platforms on which to tackle these issues, offering more freedom of expression than was available in traditional print media, in which the \\"ceiling of freedom\\" is much lower. When it was initially launched, Kharabeesh, and in order to create a sustainable group of companies to be able to serve each other and form a new concept of partnership in the Arab world, each partner merged their own start- ups in the tech and web fields to create a mother company called Think Arabia with other two partners, Firas Otaibi and Shaher Otaibi. In doing so, Kharabeesh was able to outsource its web and graphic design services to the sister companies in order that each company would in turn assist the others' financial viability. http://www.jordan- business.net/images/stories/May%202011/Kharabeesh.pdf =Arab Spring= Although Kharabeesh was active before the Arab Spring, the popularity of their political videos during the wave of revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere in the Arab world pushed the company to a new level of recognition. The popularity of the political cartoons in particular was such that a Tunisian television channel volunteered to translate a video about the flight of deposed Tunisian President Ben Ali from Arabic to Spanish.http://www.gilimag.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=143:kharabeesh&catid;=34:fun&Itemid;=53 =Mission= Currently Kharabeesh CEO, Attili has said that the Kharabeesh script-writing and animation team draws ‚Äúinspiration from our personal, everyday experiences ... using them to power our sketches and cartoons ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what makes them so appealing to people.‚Äùhttp://twofour54.com/creativelab/en/article/inspire/kharabeesh-the- process-of-creativity.html Attili is one of Jordan's longest-active bloggers, having begun blogging in 2005. http://www.jordan- business.net/images/stories/May%202011/Kharabeesh.pdf Attili maintains that Kharabeesh was built out of the idea that ‚Äúa new creative industry was emerging in the Arab world,\\" and that secret of Kharabeesh's success lies in its emphasis on creativity rather than profit. Although the company sometimes takes individual commissions from clients, most of its work is generated in- house and involves testing the success of ideas in order to determine if potential buyers are interested. According to Attili, creation and execution come before business and funding, saying that the company values ‚Äúnew, funny and edgy mini-cartoon shows designed specifically for the wed audience.‚Äù http://www.jordan-business.net/images/stories/May%202011/Kharabeesh.pdf Recent features and animations Kharabeesh's cartoons have been compared to JibJab,https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/conversation-kharabeesh- cartoons-13265449 not only because of their political nature but also their animation style and technique.

In the first animated video of the series, which as of April 8, 2012 has over 1,800,000 views on YouTube, Housni Mubarak addresses the Egyptian people in Egyptian Colloquial Arabic, a clear departure from the public speeches he had recently given at the time, which were noted to have been delivered solely in Modern Standard Arabic. The caricatured Mubarak offers trivial solutions to the Egyptian people and pledges not to leave his position, before punched off his podium by a fist representing \\"the People.\\" In the second video of the series, Mubarak addresses an angry mob, ignoring their chants demanding that he step down. A week later, Kharabeesh launched the third and final video of the series, which shows Mubarak receiving phone calls of congratulations from his counterparts abroad.

At some point Swart summoned his attorney and ordered him to write down Swart's 28-page suicide statement after setting his own car on fire and hiking 10 miles to his farm house. Swart was confronted by a police constable in the early hours of 6 May at his home with a warrant for Swart to give himself up. Swart replied that he simply wanted an oak coffin and wanted it to be zinc- lined, and he would shoot anyone who came through the road running near his property after 6:00 pm. The alarmed constable immediately started to gather a posse of a dozen policemen led by inspector Ashman to arrest Swart the next day. Swart killed five officers (including Ashman) and wounded another near his farm, taking the inspector's revolver and horse. He went to a nearby house to tell his neighbour that he intended to go into Charlestown to kill three more people before going to Volkrust to kill himself. The neighbour departed to warn police of Swart's coming. His neighbour, Swanepoel, when nearing Mount Prospect, was approached by a black person with a note from Swart saying he would return to kill him after he completed his \\"mission\\". By now Swart had killed two more people on the road, Fannie Knight, his step-daughter, and G. Roets. They had testified against him for incest for which he had been convicted and sentenced to several months in prison. Swart arrived in Charlestown across from the train station at a house where his estranged wife was living. Swart gunned down his wife, then rode his stolen horse to the edge of town and fired at a passing automobile, wounding the driver and a passenger. At this point police all over the district had been notified and had formed a posse of local farmers along with police to hunt him down. Swart was spotted diving into a ditch after an officer fired at him. A final shot was heard, as Swart killed himself with the stolen Webley Revolver. Victims =Policemen= * Inspector Gerald C.

He is currently editor-in-chief of Al Tahrir, which he co-founded in July 2011. Early life and education Ibrahim Eissa was born in November 1965 in Quesna in the Monufia Governorate in Egypt. His father was an Arabic teacher. At 11 years old, he published his first magazine, Al Haqiqa, which he arranged to print himself and distributed by hand to local schools and newsstands. When he was 17, during his first year at the Cairo University School of Journalism, Eissa began working for the magazine Rose al-Y≈´suf, becoming its youngest editorial secretary. Although a state-run magazine, it was reputed for its openness to normally taboo topics as well as its leftist and nationalist opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gamaa Islamiyya. However, when Eissa refused to support the 1990 Iraqi invasion, he was forced to resign within a year from his political editorship and assume the literary editor position. Career =Al-Dustour and Aala Al Qahwa= A private publisher named Essam Fahmi Ismail approached Eissa's coworker Adel Hammouda about starting a journalistic enterprise of some kind but was rebuffed. He then approached Eissa and the two created the weekly newspaper Al-Dustour under a foreign license in 1995. The paper took a critical approach towards the Egyptian regime that was unique at the time, particularly in its focus on government corruption, quality of governance, and Egypt's relationship with Israel. The paper contained contributions from all ends of the political and religious spectrum, including Marxists, Nationalists, and Nasserists. As editor-in-chief, Ibrahim Eissa was a big part of the controversy that arose as a result. The paper was also known for being colloquial, provocative, and illustrated with cartoons. The paper was very influential in the evolution of Egyptian press--it became popular for other papers to \\"destourize\\" their pieces (the word \\"destourize\\" itself was used) by taking a stronger stance. Its circulation reached around 150,000 copies per week. Eissa stated that the reason for its popularity was how the paper spoke to its core audience, the youth. The paper was shut down in February 1998 after it published a death threat from the Gamaa Islamiyya against three Coptic businessmen. Prior to its shutdown, three issues had been confiscated for their controversial nature. According to Eissa, the paper was shut down after a personal appeal to President Hosni Mubarak by Naguib Sawiris, who complained about the paper's publication of the death threat. After Al-Dustour was shut down, Eissa tried nine times to open another newspaper. Each of his attempts was rejected, under both party and foreign licenses, and for both political and cultural publications. He tried to write under a pseudonym for the People's Democratic Party, but his efforts were met with government intervention. Nevertheless, he slowly reintroduced himself as a writer in the non-political arena. When Dream TV was started in 2001, Eissa was called on to host the current affairs show, Aala Al Qahwa (At the Cafe). By 2003, the network was forced to drop Eissa due to the controversial nature of his program. During this period Eissa also wrote the first of a number of novels, entitled Maqtal Al Rajul Al Kabeer (The Assassination of the Big Man). None of his novels were received well by critics, and this one in particular was banned and confiscated by the government. = Reopening of Al-Dustour and trials= In 2004, Eissa was offered two jobs. The first was as editor-in-chief of the El-Ghad Party's newspaper. Ayman Nour, the party's leader at that time, wanted to hire Eissa because his popularity would build a larger base for the party. At the same time, he was approached by Essam Fahmi about restarting Al-Dustour. Although Eissa chose to work with the El-Ghad Party, the move was blocked when the security services made Mostafa Moussa fire Eissa during 2005 while Ayman Nour was in prison. Eissa fell back on his second choice and became editor in chief at Al-Dustour. In 2005, he took over Fahmi's other newspaper, Sawt Al-Umma, and made regular appearances on the TV show Min Awul Sadr. In June 2006, Eissa was convicted of defaming Hosni Mubarak in a piece that described a lawyer's attempt to take the president and his family to court for corruption. He was sentenced to a year in prison, alongside his lawyer Said Abdullah. The ruling was overturned in February 2007, and Eissa instead had to pay a $3,950 fine. The suit was filed on behalf of Mubarak by a private citizen and proceeded quickly, in contravention of Egyptian judicial norms. On 5 December 2007, Eissa faced trial in Algalaa' Court after he published an article about Mubarak's health problems. On 31 March 2008, he was found guilty of damaging the national economy after the Central Bank testified that $350 million in investments left Egypt in the days after the article was published. On 28 September 2008, the Boulak Abul Ela Appeals Court upheld the guilty verdict, but reduced Eissa's sentence to two months in prison, charging Eissa with reporting and publishing false information. The appeal was originally brought by state security prosecutors, who argued that the six-month term was too light. Eissa was quoted saying, \\"This sentence opens the gates of hell for the Egyptian press.\\" NGOs such as Amnesty International and the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information denounced the verdict. On 8 October 2008, Eissa's sentence was pardoned by Mubarak. On 5 October 2010, Ibrahim Eissa was fired from his position at Al-Dustour after the paper was purchased by Sayyid Badawi, a businessman and member of the Egyptian Wafd party. According to Eissa, Badawi's takeover of the paper was engineered specifically to stop him from writing. The immediate reason was his desire to publish a piece by Mohamed El Baradei who opposed President Mubarak and was a potential presidential candidate. Earlier in the same year, Eissa was fired from his position as host of Baladna bel Masry, an ONTV political talk show. =Post- Mubarak media projects= Since the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, Eissa has been involved with two media projects. The first is the launch of a private satellite television channel titled Al Tahrir TV Channel in February 2011, and the second is the launch of a daily newspaper, Al Tahrir, in July 2011. Though carrying the same name, the television channel and the newspaper are separate media projects. Al Tahrir TV channel Al Tahrir TV Channel was the first television channel in Egypt to be launched following the resignation of Mubarak. It was launched in February 2011. The channel's slogan is \\"The People Want To Liberate The Minds\\". Ibrahim was one of three owners of the channel, along with Ahmed Abu-Haiba and Mohamed Morad. However, in October 2011, following serious financial challenges, Eissa sold his share of the channel to two businessmen who co-owned Eissa's share, Nabil Kamel and Dr. Said Tawfiq. Ibrahim Eissa continued working with the channel, serving as a television reporter for the show Fil Midan. However, in February 2012 he quit the show and is now no longer associated with the channel. In December 2011, Tawfiq sold his share to businessman Suleiman Amer, who now owns 84% of the channel's shares. The channel was widely criticized by its top television reporters, including Eissa, under speculations that the new channel's administration was serving the interests of the Egyptian state. Al Tahrir newspaper The newspaper Al Tahrir was launched in July 2011. It was the second to be launched following Mubarak's resignation, following the publication of the previously weekly periodical Youm 7. Like Al Tahrir TV, the newspaper is named after Tahrir Square. The ownership of the newspaper is divided between Eissa and publisher Ibrahim al-Moalem, who also works with another daily independent newspaper, Al-Shorouk, as its chairperson. Eissa is currently the editor-in- chief of the newspaper. When the newspaper was first launched, it had the same tone as Eissa's previous newspaper Al-Dustour, which was dominated by satire and opinion pieces. The newspapers executive editor claimed that in addition to news reporting, Al Tahrir aimed to provide insights and analysis of news events. The newspaper has also sought to redeem the importance of print media, particularly in the eyes of the youth who have resorted to new social media for their information. =Post-Mubarak death threats= In December 2011, sources indicated that Eissa and other prominent individuals working in various media outlets had received death threats because of the controversial stories they covered. Mubarak trial testimony Eissa has been criticized by activists for shifting his testimony during Mubarak's 2011 trial and 2014 retrial. Eissa originally accused police forces of shooting protesters, but said in the retrial he did not witness shootings. He also stated in the retrial that Mubarak was a patriotic president who neither ordered the use of force against protesters or the cutting of phone and internet lines, and only called on security authorities to use necessary measures to contain chaos. Awards In 2008, Eissa was given the Gebran Tueni Award in Lebanon. In March 2011, Eissa was awarded an Index on Censorship‚Äôs 2010 Freedom of Expression Award. The award has been described as commemorating the many who put their lives at risk for their right to express their opinions. Eissa was characterized as a \\"one-man barometer of Egypt's struggle for political and civic freedom\\". He dedicated the award to Tahrir Square. In April 2011, Eissa was also awarded the International Journalist of the Year 2010 award by a British institution called the Society of Editors. This award similarly recognized journalists‚Äô commitment to the freedom of expression and the press and bravery against threats. Eissa was specifically awarded as a result of his insistence on democracy, and as a result of his journalistic position and opinions against Mubarak's toppled regime. His novel, Our Master, was shortlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2013.

It has been broadly defined as the \\"psychological forces that determine the direction of a person's behavior in an organisation, a person's level of effort and a person's level of persistence\\". Also, \\"Motivation can be thought of as the willingness to expend energy to achieve a goal or a reward. Motivation at work has been defined as 'the sum of the processes that influence the arousal, direction, and maintenance of behaviors relevant to work settings'.\\" Motivated employees are essential to the success of an organization as motivated employees are generally more productive at the work place. Motivational techniques Motivation is the impulse that an individual has in a job or activity to reaching an end goal. There are multiple theories of how best to motivate workers, but all agree that a well-motivated work force means a more productive work force. = Taylorism = Fredrick Winslow Taylor was one of the first theorist to attempt to understand employee motivation. His theory of scientific management, also referred to as Taylorism, analyzes the productivity of the workforce. Taylor's basic theory of motivation, is that workers are motivated by money. He viewed employees not as individuals, but as pieces of a larger workforce; in doing so his theory stresses that giving employee's individual tasks, supplying them with the best tools and paying them based on their productivity was the best way to motivate them. Taylor's theory developed in the late 1890s and can still be seen today in industrial engineering and manufacturing industries. = Hawthorne effect = In the mid 1920s another theorist, Elton Mayo along with Fritz Roethlisberger and William Dickson from the Harvard Business School, began studying the workforce. His study of the Hawthorne Works, lead him to his discovery of the Hawthorne effect. The Hawthorne effect is the idea that people change their behavior as a reaction to being observed. Mayo found that employee's productivity increased when they knew they were being watched. He also found that employees were more motivated when they were allowed to give input on their working conditions and that input was valued. Mayo's research and motivational theories were the start of the Human Relations school of management. Job design The design of an employee's job can have a significant effect on their job motivation. Job design includes designing jobs that create both a challenging and interesting task for the employee and is effective and efficient for getting the job done. Four approaches to job design are: # Job Simplification: The goal of this job design approach is to standardize and specialize tasks.[higheredbcs.wiley.com/legacy/college/schermerhorn/.../ch06.pptpublisher=Wiley] This approach does not always lead to increased motivation because the jobs can become mundane over time. # Job Enlargement: The goal of this job design approach is to combine tasks to give the employee a greater variety of work. # Job Rotation: The goal of this job design approach is to move workers to different tasks periodically. # Job Enrichment: The key to job design employee motivation, this approach aims to enhance the actual job by building up the employee through motivational factors. Several studies validate the effectiveness of using job design techniques to increase employee motivation. A study conducted by Campion and Thayer used a job design questionnaire to determine how job designs fostering motivation affected employees. Campion and Thayer found that jobs with more motivational features have lower effort requirements, a better well-being, and fewer health complaints. The study also found that jobs scoring high on the motivational subscale of the questionnaire contained employees who were more satisfied and motivated, had a higher rating pertaining to job performance, and had fewer absences. Hackman. conducted a study pertaining to work redesign and how redesigning work could improve productivity and motivation through job enlargement or enrichment. The study's results found that redesigning a job can improve the quality of the product or service that is provided, increase the quantity of work, and can increase work satisfaction and motivation. The last study on job design was conducted by Dunham, who wanted to determine if there was a relationship between job design characteristics and job ability and compensation requirements. Dunham believed organizations were overlooking job ability requirements and compensation when they enlarged or enriched employee's jobs. The study found that organizations were not taking into account the increased job ability requirements that job enrichments or enlargements entail nor were the organizations increasing compensation for employees who were given extra tasks and/or more complex tasks. =Rewards= Using rewards as motivators divides employee motivation into two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic rewards are internal, psychological rewards such as a sense of accomplishment or doing something because it makes one feel good. Extrinsic rewards are rewards that other people give to you such as a money, compliments, bonuses, or trophies. This applies to Douglas McGregor's Scientific Theory that formed Theory X, which applies to the extrinsic wants of employees. The basis for the motivation is supervision structure and money. Scientific Theory is based on the grounds that employees don't want to work so they have to be forced to do their job, and enticed with monetary compensation.Theory Y, also derived from McGregor's theory, says that employees are motivated by intrinsic or personal reward. With this theory different factors can be used to heighten the intrinsic benefit that employees are receiving at their job.\\" Many studies have been conducted concerning how motivation is affected by rewards resulting in conflicting and inconsistent outcomes. Pierce, Cameron, Banko, and So conducted a study to examine how extrinsic rewards affect people's intrinsic motivation when the rewards are based on increasingly higher performance criteria. Pierce et al. found that rewarding people for meeting a graded level of performance, which got increasingly more difficult, spent more time on the study's activities and experienced an increase in intrinsic motivation. Participants who were not rewarded at all or only rewarded for maintaining a constant level of performance experienced less intrinsic motivation. Another study that examined the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation was conducted by Wiersma. Wiersma conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the inconsistent results of past studies. The meta-analysis by Wiersma concluded that when extrinsic rewards are given by chance, they reduce intrinsic motivation. This result is supported when task behavior is measured during a free-time period. However, it is not supported when task performance is measured when the extrinsic reward is in effect. Wiersma also found that these results cannot be generalized to all situations. A study conducted by Earn also examined the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. Earn wanted to know if extrinsic rewards affected a person's intrinsic motivation based on the subject's locus of control. Earn found that pay increases decreased intrinsic motivation for subjects with an external locus of control whereas pay increases increased intrinsic motivation for subjects with an internal locus of control. The study also found that when the controlling aspect of the extrinsic reward was made pertinent by making pay dependent on a certain amount of performance, higher pay undermined the intrinsic motivation of subjects and their locus of control was not relevant. Intrinsic rewards: Job Characteristics Model The Job Characteristics Model (JCM), as designed by Hackman and Oldham attempts to use job design to improve employee intrinsic motivation. They show that any job can be described in terms of five key job characteristics:J.R. Hackman and G.R. Oldham. Work Redesign. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Pearson Education, Inc., 1980; pp 78-80.Katz, Ralph. Motivating Technical Professionals Today. IEEE Engineering Management Review, Vol. 41, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 28-38 # Skill Variety - the degree to which the job requires the use of different skills and talents # Task Identity - the degree to which the job has contributed to a clearly identifiable larger project # Task Significance - the degree to which the job affects the lives or work of other people # Autonomy - the degree to which the employee has independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job # Task Feedback - the degree to which the employee is provided with clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance The JCM links the core job dimensions listed above to critical psychological states which results in increased employee intrinsic motivation. This forms the basis of this \\"employee growth-need strength.\\" The core dimensions listed above can be combined into a single predictive index, called the Motivating Potential Score. =Employee participation= 1\\\\. Increase employee participation by implementing quality control \\"circles\\". Quality control circles involve a group of five to ten problem solving employees that come together to solve work-related problems such as reducing costs, solving quality problems, and improving production methods. Other benefits from quality control circles include an improved employee-management relationship, increased individual commitment, and more opportunities for employee expression and self- development. A study by Marks et al. focused on assessing the effect that quality circles had on participating employees and found that the attitudes of employees who participated in quality circles were influenced in the areas concerning participation, decision making, and group communication. Although group communication was influenced, communication through the organization as a whole was not and neither was employee's personal responsibility for their work. The results of this study suggest that quality circles can provide employees with informational and social support that can help increase their motivation. 2\\\\. Increase motivation through employee participation by using open-book management. Open-book management is when a company shares important financial data with employees. Sharing the information empowers employees by putting trust into them. Employees become personally and meaningfully involved with the organization beyond just doing their assigned tasks, which increases their motivation and production Open book management is a four-step process. The first step involves employers sharing financial data with their employees. Employees need to know how the company, as a whole, is doing financially. Next, employers must teach their employees how to read and interpret the financial data. Employees can look at all the data a company gives them; however, to understand the data, they must know how to interpret the numbers. Third, employees have to be empowered to make necessary changes and decisions for the success of the organization. Employers should treat their employees like partners to promote increased employee motivation. The last step involves employers paying their employees a fair share of profits through bonuses and incentives. Bonus numbers must be attached to numbers that employees see regularly and can influence the financial data. With these steps in mind, the friction between employees and between employee/management can be drastically reduced. Four factors must exist for any employee participation program to be successful: * Have a profit-sharing or gain-sharing plan where both the employer and employee benefit * Implement a long-term employment relationship to instill job security * Make a concerted effort to build and maintain group cohesiveness * Provide protection of the individual employee's rights \\"Work motivation is a set of energetic forces that originate both within as well as beyond an individual‚Äôs being, to initiate work-related behavior and to determine its form, direction, intensity, and duration‚Äù (Pinder, 1998, p. 11).Pinder C. (1998). Work Motivation in Organizational Behavior. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall =Quality-of-work-life programs= Work-life balance is an employee's perception of how a proper balance between personal time, family care, and work are maintained with minimal conflict. Employers can use work-life balance as a motivational technique by implementing quality-of-work- life programs. Examples of such programs include flextime, workplace wellness, and family support. Flexible work schedules can allow an employee to work whenever they can as long as a certain number of hours are worked each week and some employers allow their employees to work from home. Sometimes employers utilize flextime schedules that allow employees to arrive to work when they choose within specified limits. A wellness program can involve having an exercise facility, offering counseling, or even having programs set up to help employees lose weight or stop smoking cigarettes. Family support programs involve help with parenting, childcare, and some programs allow employees to leave for family purposes. One study found that men often identify themselves with their career and work roles while women often identified themselves with the roles of mother, wife, friend, and daughter. The Sloan Foundation found that even though women enjoy working as much as men, women prefer to work nights and weekends if time needs to be made up instead of cutting their hours. A study conducted by the Alliance for Work- Life Progress surveyed employees to find out the type of workplace flexibility employees say they would like to use in the following year. Burrus et al. found that 71 percent of people want an occasional opportunity to adjust their schedule, 57 percent want to work from a location other than their office, 73 percent want to make their work-life flexibility arrangement official, and 12 percent want to work fewer hours. Employee Engagement A motivated employee becomes engaged in their workplace. Employee engagement is an important part of an organization's success. Research has found that organizations with engaged employees have three times higher profit margins compared to organizations with disengaged employees. Shareholder returns, operating income, and revenue growth have also had higher financial performance in employee engaged organizations. In addition, employee engagement is linked to lower absenteeism within an organization. Employers who practice employee motivation and engagement techniques in their organization will likely see an increase in overall business performance. Motivational theories = Maslow's hierarchy of needs= Abraham Maslow viewed motivation as being based on a hierarchy of needs, of which a person cannot move to the next level of needs without satisfying the previous level. Maslow's hierarchy starts at the lowest level of needs, basic physiological needs. Basic physiological needs include air, water, and food. Employers who pay at least a minimal living wage will meet these basic employee needs The next level of needs is referred to as safety and security needs. This level includes needs such as having a place to live and knowing one is safe. Employers can meet these needs by ensuring employees are safe from physical, verbal and/or emotional hazards and have a sense of job security. The third level of needs is social affiliation and belonging. This is the need to be social, have friends, and feel like one belongs and is loved. Implementing employee participation programs can help fulfill the need to belong. Rewards such as acknowledging an employee's contributions can also satisfy these social and love needs. The fourth level on the hierarchy is esteem needs. This level is described as feeling good about one's self and knowing that their life is meaningful, valuable, and has a purpose. Employers should use the job design technique to create jobs that are important to and cherished by the employee. These first four needs, Maslow called D-Needs (deficient). The last level Maslow described is called self- actualization. Maslow called this the B-Need (being). This level refers to people reaching their potential states of well-being. An employer who ensures that an employee is in the right job and has all other needs met will help the employee realize this highest need. \\"Maslow further expanded self- actualization into four needs: cognitive, aesthetic, self-actualization, and self-transcendence.\\" =Herzberg's two-factor theory= Frederick Herzberg developed the two-factor theory of motivation based on satisfiers and dissatisfiers. Satisfiers are motivators associated with job satisfaction while dissatisfiers are motivators associated with hygiene or maintenance. Satisfiers include achievement, responsibility, advancement, and recognition. Satisfiers are all intrinsic motivators that are directly related to rewards attainable from work performance and even the nature of the work itself. Dissatisfiers are extrinsic motivators based on the work environment, and include a company's policies and administration such as supervision, peers, working conditions, and salary. Herzberg believed providing for hygiene and maintenance needs could prevent dissatisfaction but not contribute to satisfaction. Herzberg also believed that satisfiers hold the greatest potential for increased work performance. Work-life programs are a form of satisfier that recognizes the employee's life outside of work which, in turn, helps motivate the employee. Improving a job to make it more interesting can improve the overall satisfaction an employee is experiencing on the job. A dissatisfier looked at by employees is how relationships form with colleagues. Colleagues play an important role of the workplace as they are all interacting daily. Forming high quality relationships with peers can extrinsically improve employee motivation. =Vroom's expectancy theory= The expectancy theory of motivation was established by Victor Vroom with the belief that motivation is based on the expectation of desired outcomes. The theory is based on four concepts: valence, expectancy, instrumentality and force. Valence is the attractiveness of potential rewards, outcomes, or incentives. Expectancy is a person's belief that they will or will not be able to reach the desired outcome. Instrumentality is the belief that a strong performance will be well rewarded. Force is a person's motivation to perform. In general, people will work hard when they think that it is likely to lead to desired organizational rewards. Vroom thought that people are motivated to work toward a goal if they believe the goal is worthwhile and if they perceive that their efforts will contribute to the achievement of that goal. Force = Valence x Expectancy x Instrumentality =Locke's goal theory= As Human Relations management took hold, increasing intrinsic motivation and attending to individuals became a larger concern for employers. Increasing intrinsic motivation could be achieved through the Goal Setting Theory by Edwin A. Locke. Employers that set realistic and challenging goals for their employees create employee motivation. By allowing employees to engage in their job, and achieve satisfaction when reaching a goal it can entice them to want to keep setting new goals to reach new successes and yield superior performance. The theory is logical because employees are going to set more difficult goals but the goals will be attainable with increased effort. Once in the pattern of setting goals, employees can also develop goal commitment, where they are more likely to stick to jobs until they are finished. Employees that work alongside their employers in the goal-setting process have the intrinsic benefit of participating in decisions, which can lead to higher motivation as they are empowered in their workplace. As employees reach these personally set goals, management can reinforce those efforts by showing recognition toward their success. = Locke and Latham's five goal setting principles = Dr. Gary Latham collaborated with Edwin Locke to expand upon his goal setting theory of motivation with five key principles designed to motivate the accomplishment and completion of a particular objective. These five key principles align closely around the SMART goal setting strategy designed to define objectivity and achievability. The five key principles are: # Clarity: Clear goals are measurable and not ambiguous which gives clear definition as to the expectations of the objective. # Challenge: People are often motivated by the anticipated significance upon successful completion of the particular task. # Commitment: There is a direct correlation between employees motivation to complete an objective and their involvement in establishing the goal and its boundaries. # Feedback: Consistent feedback during the objective completion process provides clarity of expectations, ability to adjust difficulty, and the opportunity to gain recognition. # Complexity: People in a highly demanding environment typically already have a high level of motivation, but it is important that the goal does not overwhelm the individual to maintain motivation See also * Work motivation * Suggestion system * Employee offboarding References Category:Employee relations Category:Motivation ","title":"Employee motivation"},{"id":"35443143","text":"Sericocarpus rigidus is a species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common name Columbian whitetop aster.

Several years later he becomes good friends with a French fur-trapper called Gabriel Dupre. Meanwhile, a corrupt trading post manager plots to get rid of Dupre and steal Dupre's sweetheart. The Wolf-Dog runs away after being falsely accused of attacking a baby, but his name is ultimately cleared and Dupre brings him back. Ultimately, the Wolf-Dog kills the villainous manager. Cast *Claire Adams as Felice McTavish *Rin Tin Tin as The Wolf-Dog *Walter McGrail as Gabriel Dupre *Pat Hartigan as Shad Galloway *Myrtle Owen as Marie *Charles Stevens as 'The Fox' *Fred Huntley as Scotty McTavish Production Warner Brothers decided to invest $100,000 in producing the screenplay as written by Rin Tin Tin's owner and trainer, Lee Duncan. Director Chester M. Franklin shot the film's exterior scenes in Canada but he stayed too long and shot too much footage, spending more than the budget. The negatives were processed in Hollywood and the Warner executives saw that the movie was wandering off script, with too much beautiful scenery and not enough plot development. Warner hired a second director, Millard Webb, to shoot the story in parallel with Franklin's effort. Editor Lewis Milestone recalled that he noticed unworkable continuity mistakes between the two directors such as actor Walter McGrail shot in two different locations but at the same time in the script. Milestone tried to avoid editing what he saw as a doomed film, but producer Harry Rapf insisted he finish it. Milestone stipulated that writer Julien Josephson join him in the cutting room; the two men spent months watching and memorizing all the film footage, and they rewrote and assembled the film in a documentary fashion, letting the available film elements tell the story. Warner executives previewed the finished film but indicated sweeping changes before it was to be released. Milestone resisted this; he felt it worked well as it was. Milestone suggested to Rapf that the film be previewed locally with a test audience. Accordingly, the film was shown while the Warner executives waited outside; the response was very positive. Duncan and Rin Tin Tin were present at the theater's entrance greeting theatergoers as they left. The Warner executives asked Duncan if he knew the audience members and he said yes, he lived in the neighborhood. The test screening was thus considered flawed because of the likelihood of a sympathetic audience. Another screening was arranged in another location, without Duncan and the dog. This second test was a great success and the film was put in distribution exactly as Milestone and Josephson had reworked it. Box office According to Warner Bros records the film earned $396,000 domestically and $45,000 foreign.

This alleged hybrid ape species has been reported in Africa as early as the mid 19th century. No empirical evidence has been found to substantiate the existence of the creature. The Koolakamba was referenced in the mid-19th century in French work by Franquet (1852, as cited by Shea, 1984) and in some descriptive work of Paul Du Chaillu from 1860, 1861, 1867, and 1899, some of which was republished in 1969 (Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa).  Origins of the name  DuChaillu refers to the ape as Koolakamba based upon his description of words used by the indigenous peoples (Commi, Goumbi, and Bakalai[sic]) in the region of the Ovengi River of West Central Africa, modernly the areas of Cameroon and Gabon. The people allegedly referred to the ape as \\"Kooloo\\" because that is what its unique vocalization, quite unlike the vocalizations of other apes in the region, sounded like to them. \\"Kamba\\", according to DuChaillu, is a Commi word meaning \\"to speak\\" (DuChaillu, 1899).  Description and distinguishing features  The Koolakamba is believed to be larger, flatter-faced, larger-skulled and more bipedal than a chimp; though, it may also be a mutation. According to DuChaillu (1861 and 1869), the physical characteristics described for Koolakamba include a short and broad pelvic structure, large supraorbital ridge, high zygomatic ridges, less prominent \\"muzzle\\", dentition in which the upper and lower incisors meet squarely forming a grinding surface, and a larger cranial capacity than that of the common chimpanzee. Much of what DuChaillu records is essentially ethnographic. He includes the indigenous names and lore relevant to the ape, descriptive text, and presumably accurate illustrations, but limited quantitative (mostly anthropometric) data.  Discussion  Although there has not been a documented sighting of the Koolakamba or proof of its existence in modern times, in 1881 Koppenfelds claimed that it did indeed exist: ‚ÄúI believe it is proved that there are crosses between the male Troglodytes gorilla and the female Troglodytes niger, but for reasons easily understood, there are none in the opposite direction. I have in my possession positive proof of this. This settles all the questions about the gorilla, chimpanzee, Kooloo Kamba,....etc.‚Äù In November 1996, a picture of an unusual ape (taken by Peter Jenkins and Liza Gadsby at the Yaounde Zoo, Cameroon) was featured in the Newsletter of the Internal Primate Protection League (IPPL). This picture showed a seemingly hybrid ape with wider face and a larger skull than that of a chimpanzee and smaller than that of a gorilla. The ape in the picture had features that seemed to belong to both the gorilla and the chimpanzee. Scientifically, it has not been determined if the Koolakamba is a subspecies of chimpanzee, a gorilla- chimpanzee hybrid, or perhaps simply a product of individual variation. Yerkes reported several \\"unclassifiable apes\\" with features intermediate between chimpanzee and gorilla in his 1929 book \\"A Study of Anthropoid Life\\".It is believed that these are regional races of chimpanzee classified as separate species by over-enthusiastic scientists.

Main Street, Washington, Indiana. Built in 1926, it features period architecture, ornate molded plaster capitols, decorated beams, a full featured stage, period sconce lighting, a full service concession area, large lobby, and, above all, a rich heritage including hosting many golden age and silver age screen stars. In November 2011, an informal preservation group, The Friends of the Indiana Theater, was formed to try to purchase the property and preserve it. The group began to incorporate in March, 2012 as a 501C3. Future intent is to develop and operate as a not-for-profit with the mission of reopening the building as a cultural center providing a venue for live entertainment in the form of musical performances, stage plays, informal dining, training facility, exposition center, and or public meeting place. The more general mission is to promote downtown Washington, its businesses, culture, and the rich historical heritage of Washington and Daviess County. Originally opened in 1928 as a one screen stage theater featuring a balcony, this building was eventually \\"twinned\\" (the balcony becoming the second auditorium) and after sitting empty for 4 years has now undergone a substantial upgrade to include All Digital Projection & 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.

Control methods at the top of graphic are potentially more effective and protective than those at the bottom. Following this hierarchy normally leads to the implementation of inherently safer systems, where the risk of illness or injury has been substantially reduced.275x275px Hierarchy of hazard control is a system used in industry to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards.MANUAL HANDLING HIERARCHY OF CONTROLS It is a widely accepted system promoted by numerous safety organizations. This concept is taught to managers in industry, to be promoted as standard practice in the workplace. Various illustrations are used to depict this system, most commonly a triangle. The hazard controls in the hierarchy are, in order of decreasing effectiveness: * Elimination * Substitution * Engineering controls * Administrative controls * Personal protective equipment Components of the hierarchy =Elimination= Physical removal of the hazard is the most effective hazard control. For example, if employees must work high above the ground, the hazard can be eliminated by moving the piece they are working on to ground level to eliminate the need to work at heights. =Substitution= This pesticide contains DDT, an effective substitution would be to replace it with a green pesticide. Substitution, the second most effective hazard control, involves replacing something that produces a hazard with something that does not produce a hazard or produces a lesser hazard‚Äîfor example, replacing lead-based paint with titanium white. To be an effective control, the new product must not produce unintended consequences. Because airborne dust can be hazardous, if a product can be purchased with a larger particle size, the smaller product may effectively be substituted with the larger product. =Engineering controls= The third most effective means of controlling hazards is engineered controls. These do not eliminate hazards, but rather isolate people from hazards. Capital costs of engineered controls tend to be higher than less effective controls in the hierarchy, however they may reduce future costs. For example, a crew might build a work platform rather than purchase, replace, and maintain fall arrest equipment. \\"Enclosure and isolation\\" creates a physical barrier between personnel and hazards, such as using remotely controlled equipment. Fume hoods can remove airborne contaminants as a means of engineered control. =Administrative controls= Walker Lake, however it cannot prevent people from swimming in it.thumbright Administrative controls are changes to the way people work. Examples of administrative controls include procedure changes, employee training, and installation of signs and warning labels (such as those in the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System). Administrative controls do not remove hazards, but limit or prevent people's exposure to the hazards, such as completing road construction at night when fewer people are driving. =Personal protective equipment= Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes gloves, Nomex clothing, overalls, Tyvek suits, respirators, hard hats, safety glasses, high-visibility clothing, and safety footwear. PPE is the least effective means of controlling hazards because of the high potential for damage to render PPE ineffective. Additionally, some PPE, such as respirators, increase physiological effort to complete a task and, therefore, may require medical examinations to ensure workers can use the PPE without risking their health.  Role in Prevention through Design  The hierarchy of controls is a core component of Prevention through Design, the concept of applying methods to minimize occupational hazards early in the design process. Prevention through Design emphasizes addressing hazards at the top of the hierarchy of controls (mainly through elimination and substitution) at the earliest stages of project development.

KsiƒÖ≈ºki -> apokryfy -> Biblioteka XXI wieku -> Komentarz Lema at Lem's official website Some of the reviews are lighthearted, concentrating mostly on the story; others, however, read more like serious, academic reviews. Some of the reviews are parodies, or the books being reviewed are parodies or complete impossibilities, others are quite serious and can be seen almost as drafts for novels that Lem never got around to write. Lem wrote: \\"With years passing a great impatience grew in me. It would be a hard work to convert ideas into narration, and that was one of the main reasons I went for such cruel abridgements of the books\\". Lem was not alone in passing through this kind of crisis: examples abound of works planned by literary celebrities, but never completed.\\"APOKRYFY LEMA\\" , an afterword of Lem also remarked that he was eventually convinced that writing summaries and introductions enabled him to save time on producing things of importance, namely, his modeling experiments, compared to full-blown literary efforts, most of which would have constituted mundane craftsmanship. A Perfect Vacuum A Perfect Vacuum () is a 1971 book by Polish author Stanis≈Çaw Lem, the largest and best known collection of Stanislaw Lem's fictitious criticism of nonexistent books. It was translated into English by Michael Kandel.Stanis≈Çaw Lem, A Perfect Vacuum, Northwestern University Press, 1999, Some of the reviews remind the reader of drafts of his science-fiction novels, some read like philosophical pieces across scientific topics, from cosmology to the pervasiveness of computers, finally others satirise and parody everything from the nouveau roman to pornography, Ulysses, \\"authorless writing\\", and Dostoevsky. The 2008 edition of the book printed by Agora SA contained a supplement by Jacek Dukaj titled Who Wrote Stanis≈Çaw Lem?, nominated for the 2009 Janusz A. Zajdel Award. It is a faux review of a book published in 2071, the book being a discussion of the activities of artificial intelligences which simulated Stanis≈Çaw Lem. In fact, Dukaj maintained a column of faux reviews, Alternative Bookstore () in Polish magazine Science Fiction (from #14 (04/2002) to #33 (12/2003)). In an interview he claimed that it was not an intended continuation of Lem's work; rather he had a number of ideas he didn't have time to develop in full.\\"Kiedy temat bierze pisarza za gard≈Ço\\" , an interview with Jacek Dukaj originally appeared in magazine Lampa, no. 25, 04/2006 Some critics asserted that the latter reason was behind Lem's pseudepigraphy as well. When this opinion was brought to Lem's attention, he denied that.Peter Swirski, Stanislaw Lem: Philosopher of the Future, p.45 The Agora SA edition also contained the \\"Glossary of Lem's Terminology\\" (\\"S≈Çownik termin√≥w Lemowskich\\") based on the book Co to sƒÖ sepulki? Wszystko o Lemie (2007) by Wojciech Orli≈Ñski.  Imaginary Magnitude  In 1973 Lem published a book , a collection of introductions to books supposedly to be written in the future, in the 21st century. One of those Lem eventually developed into a book by itself: Golem XIV is a lengthy essay on the nature of intelligence, delivered by the eponymous US military computer. In 1985 Wielko≈õƒá Urojona was published in English by Harvest Books under the title Imaginary Magnitude, a literal mistranslation of the Polish term which actually means \\"delusion of grandeur\\", to which Lem himself did not object. The translation book included the complete Golem XIV.Peter Swirski, Stanislaw Lem: Philosopher of the Future, p.46 Imaginary Magnitude differed from the previous book, A Perfect Vacuum, by a more serious tone, and probably therefore did not enjoy the same kind of enthusiasm from the readers.

Stupidity as the Driving Force of History In a 1991 interview Lem mentioned a possible title of a nonexistent book, Stupidity as the Driving Force of History. The idea is that stupidity in an ordinary man is basically harmless for humankind. However stupidity of a major historical person has a tragic effect on the course of human history. And this, in Lem's view, can be observed at the roots of many tragic events of the past.

It was founded in 1920, and has grown as an industry group, promoting art directors' work through exhibitions and awards, including the annual DESI award for design excellence. History The Art Directors Club of New York (sometimes referred to as the \\"ADC\\") was founded in 1920 by Louis Pedlar and Earnest Elmo Calkins. With Fred Lamb, Calkins had organized the first advertising art exhibits in New York City in 1908, and saw a need for an organization that would ‚Äúdignify the field of business art in the eyes of artists‚Äù, emphasizing his belief that ‚Äúartistic excellence is vitally necessary to successful advertising‚Äù. By 1947, the Club's work was being credited with a gradual increase in advertising art standards throughout the United States. In 1921, the club hosted their first juried exhibition with original work from over 250 contributors. The exhibition organized by Calkins and opened with an inaugural dinner on March 2, 1921. The awards that evening went to: Fred R. Cruger for black and white illustration; W.E. Hoitland for painting; and Rene Clark for poster design. The Art Directors Club was restrictive in its membership during its early years. Women were not admitted until 1942. George Olden, an art director with the Columbia Broadcasting Company, was the first African-American member, having been elected to the Club in 1952. The Art Directors' Club includes art directors working in film and New media. = Logo = The first logo was an interpretation of Albrecht D√ºrer‚Äôs signature. In 2009, ADC rebranded with the help of Trollb√§ck + Company. The new logo moved away from a monogram and introducing a word mark in bold hues. In 2014, they updated their logo with a monogram created by Sid Lee that references historical ADC monograms. Awards = ADC Annual Awards = Earnest Elmo Calkins organized the first juried exhibition in 1921. The ADC evolved this exhibition into its ADC Annual Awards that receives up to 11,000 entries from around the world. Several awards are given out annually to recognize industry excellence internationally. The Award for Design Excellence is known as the \\"DESI\\" award. The main categories for the award, as of 2012, are: Advertising; Design; Illustration; Integrated; Interactive; Motion; Photography; and Special Awards. = ADC Young Guns = In 1991, ADC created the Young Guns award. ADC Young Guns are annual international awards given out to promising art directors under the age of 30. ADC GrandMasters recognizes experienced educators in art direction who have created a notable legacy in the industry. = ADC Hall of Fame = In 1971, ADC established their Hall of Fame. Those chosen for the Hall of Fame have made significant contributions throughout their lifetime to the graphic design profession.

Religiosity and personality traits both relate to one's feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. However, unlike for personality, one's level of religiosity is often measured by the presence or lack of belief in and relationship with a higher power, certain lifestyles or behaviors adopted for a higher power, and a sense of belonging with other followers of one's religion. Additionally, personality traits tend to follow a normal distribution, such that the majority of individuals' scores for a personality trait will be concentrated towards the middle, rather than being extremely high or low. Distributions for religiosity, however, follow a non-normal distribution, such that there are more individuals who score particularly high or low on religiosity scales. Examining religiosity as it relates to personality characteristics could provide an empirical way to study a difficult concept. Over time, the act of being religious has been a consistent behavior across almost every culture, which could suggest that personality is related to religiosity. With the use of modern, empirically tested personality measures, researchers can look for links and obtain quantitative results to provide insight into how and why religion is such an important element of being human. However, more research is needed to definitively say that there is a correlation between certain personality characteristics and religion. Overall, when the research on religiosity and personality is summarized, there doesn't appear to be a strong link between the two. While there is research to suggest that there is a modest relationship between mental ability and religiosity, mental ability is not considered an aspect of personality. It appears that, rather than by personality, religiosity is better explained by environment and upbringing, such that people are likely to maintain the beliefs of the household they grew up in. Research on religiosity is also limited in that much psychological research is biased to Western populations, and therefore research on religiosity and personality may also be skewed towards Western religions. Five-factor model of personality The five- factor model of personality is currently accepted as a comprehensive model of personality. The five-factor model (FFM) identifies five broad traits (the Big Five) underlying the many, narrower traits that together can be used to describe personality. The identified traits are: * Extraversion ‚Äî outgoing, talkative, and sociable vs. reserved, shy, and withdrawn. * Neuroticism ‚Äî anxious, moody, and sensitive vs. relaxed and stable. * Conscientiousness ‚Äî organized, thorough, and precise vs. disorderly, careless, and unreliable. * Agreeableness ‚Äî cooperative, kind, and gentle vs. rude, harsh, and cold. * Openness to Experience ‚Äî unconventional, innovative, and complex vs. shallow, uninquisitive, and simple. The Big Five are good for correlating with religiosity, because each trait is orthogonal, or completely independent from one another. In having the ability to separate each essential trait from the other, it is possible to study each personality characteristic and how it relates to religiosity. Studying the psychology of religion through as it relates to personality is not a new idea, however. There has been research to both support and refute the ability of personality traits to explain religious or spiritual involvement. Research using Eysenck's model has found that religiosity in general is associated with low Openness to Experience, as well as low psychoticism, a factor associated inversely with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. A review of studies examined the relations between the FFM and measures of religiosity, spiritual maturity, religious fundamentalism, and extrinsic religion. General religiosity was mainly related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness of the Big Five traits. The same was found in a second review, which also noted that the relationship was consistent across different dimensions of religiosity, different cultures, and different measures of the Big Five. The relationship, however, appeared to be weaker in young adults than the rest of the adult population. Additionally, there was a weak positive correlation with Extraversion, and a very small but significant relationship with low Openness to Experience. This same study also found that the two different concepts of religiosity and spirituality both involve an overall compassionate attitude towards others and positively correlates with Agreeableness. Open, mature religiosity and spirituality were associated with high Openness to Experience, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, and with low Neuroticism. Religious fundamentalism was associated with higher Agreeableness, and lower Neuroticism and lower Openness to Experience. Because of these findings, those with higher religiosity scores seemed to be more altruistic and more well behaved. However, this correlation is pretty small. It is not known if religious people tend to be better behaved or if better behaved people are more attracted to religion. Extrinsic religiosity was associated with higher Neuroticism but unrelated to the other personality factors. Levels of Neuroticism among religiousness vary, with European samples exhibiting higher levels than in the United States, which was speculated to be due to the dominance of Catholicism in European samples. =Strengths and weaknesses= As previously stated, one of the major strengths for using the FFM to study religiosity in people is that it is empirically tested and considered a reliable and valid measure. Another strength is that the Big Five is laid out simply, making it easier to use for examining potential links between personality and religiosity. While this is a huge strength, some research argues that its downfall lies in that it is solely a personality indicator, and is not compatible with religious or spiritual matters. For example, in another study that investigated the correlation between religiosity and the FFM, a conclusion was drawn that religiosity and/or spirituality should be made into a sixth personality factor in order to truly make research using this model accurate. Additionally, many of the relationships between personality and religion were small. Religiousness has also been correlated with other personality traits not encompassed by the FFM. Therefore, more research is needed to determine if the FFM is an accurate way to examine relationships between personality and religiosity and to determine if there are significant relationships.  HEXACO model  While the Big Five is the most commonly used model of personality, newer personality research suggests that the HEXACO model may be an improvement on the Big Five. The HEXACO model makes slight modification to the factors of the Big Five traits, but most notably it adds a sixth trait Honesty-Humility, which captures an individual's tendency towards honesty, humility, sincerity, greed-avoidance, and modesty. Religiosity has been positively correlated to Honesty-Humility, such that individuals who score higher on religiousness were also likely to score higher for Honesty-Humility. It is unclear, however, if these results would be replicated in other studies.  Other personality traits related to religiosity  While some traits from the Big Five and the HEXACO model have been correlated with religiosity, these models do not encompass all known personality traits. Traits such as femininity and conservatism have both been linked to religiosity, such that those who scored higher on religiousness were likely to also score higher for femininity and conservatism. Religiosity was negatively correlated with traits relating to sexual expression, such as eroticism, sexiness, and sensuality, such that individuals who scored higher on religiosity tended to score lower on these factors of sexuality. Humour has also been negatively correlated with religiosity, such that individuals who scored higher on religiousness tended to score lower on humour. Many of the links between traits and religiosity have not been looked at on a larger scale like traits from the Five Factor Model have. Therefore, these results may not replicate in future research and may not be accurate. Attachment theory Attachment Theory is another example of a personality indicator with the ability to help researchers understand religiosity and spirituality. The basic premise of attachment theory is that infants form relationships with their caregivers, and the type of attachment influences an individual's personality and future relationships. It is thought that these future relationships could be with the particular god or higher power. In attachment theory, there have been four attachment styles identified: * secure attachment ‚Äî confidence in the availability of caregiver during times of need. * anxious-avoidant attachment ‚Äî avoidance and ignoring of caregiver, due to insecurity and lack of trust in the ability of others to care for one's needs. * anxious-ambivalent attachment ‚Äî a mixture of seeking behaviors and ambivalence towards caregiver, due to the caregiver's unpredictable responses. * disorganized/disoriented attachment ‚Äî mixed, contradictory behaviors towards caregiver, often including displays of fear. Secure attachment styles are believed to have positive outcomes for individuals' personality and future relationships, while disrupted attachment styles are believed to be related to disordered personalities, antisocial behaviors, and life-course persistent criminal behaviors. Attachment theory is also thought to be related to religiosity, because a relationship with God can mirror relationships with an adult attachment figure. Additionally, much like Attachment Theory describes with separation from caregivers, a sense of separation from God has been reported to invoke similar distress. The research varies in explaining which types of attachment style might yield a particular relationship with God. For example, in one study, a secure relationship with one's parents was associated with a secure attachment to God. One theory, the correspondence pathway theory, suggests that individual differences in attachment style lead to differences in religious beliefs, such that an individual with an insecure attachment could be lead to either agnosticism and atheism or they could develop an emotional, dependent relationship with God. However, other research has shown a compensatory effect, such that individuals feel the need to make up for something that is lacking. For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn have a very secure, confident relationship with God to compensate for what their parents did not sufficiently provide them. =Strengths and weaknesses= While some research suggests that there could be links between attachment styles and religiosity, as well as between attachment styles and personality outcomes, it is not yet clear the precise mechanisms behind either and there doesn't yet appear to be a general consensus across studies. Additionally, more research is needed to determine any links between attachment theory, religiosity, and personality. Object relations theory Object relations theory describes how children relate or associate different emotions with different people (objects). The theory says that children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them. For example, kids might associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals. In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply. One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association. In this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God. =Strengths and weaknesses= An important aspect to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical. This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus may not be reliable or valid. As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject. That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study. By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.  Religious struggles and personality  Research has shown that struggling with religion correlates to some basic personality traits. Studies on the Big Five, as well as factors such as entitlement, self-esteem, and self-compassion suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality. People who are high in Neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. Several studies have also suggested that people higher in Neuroticism tend to have a more negative relationship with God. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Both Agreeableness and Conscientiousness have been associated with lower levels of anger with God, whereas Neuroticism has been linked with higher levels of anger with God. Extraversion, however, has not been found to correlate with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that Openness to Experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in Openness to Experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in Openness to Experience. Even when controlling for the Big Five, there is evidence to suggest that entitlement, self-esteem, and self-compassion might be able to predict religious struggles. A reason for divine struggles of entitled people is possibly due to their tendency to feel victimized and angry, thus they may not have a positive relationship with God. High levels of self-esteem and self- compassion may have a link with positive spiritual well-being. Over time, this should translate to less moral and religious struggles. However, lower levels of self-esteem and compassion have been associated with more religious struggles. While certain findings have indicated that personality may predispose some individuals to religious struggles, the findings are weak. There is also no research on how personality is affected by religion over time.  Religion and life satisfaction  Research done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life. Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impact one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community. Those who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however, the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself. It is likely people who are religiously conflicted show a decline in health, compared to religious people, due to a lack of community support or ability to manage stress. Since a religious community can offer psychological, social, or financial support, it may help buffer stress or help individuals recover from hardship. Not only can religious people benefit from the community, but they can possibly benefit from prayer or meditation. Although, more research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it affects one's personality.  Religion and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator  The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the \\"judging\\" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants. ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other types. ENFJs are more attracted to becoming ministers of liberal denominations, while ESFJs are more interested in becoming ministers in conservative denominations. The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator, although popular, is flawed. Therefore, correlations between MBTI types and religiosity may not be valid and reliable.  Religiosity and paranormal beliefs  Most religions are based around a belief in some sort of supernatural being. This may lead some to believe that religiosity would relate in someway to the belief in other paranormal beings. According to Thalbourne, evidence suggests that people who are religious tend to have paranormal beliefs. One possible explanation for this is to try to reduce anxiety about dying. Other research conducted by Thalbourne, Dunbar, and Delin, found Conscientiousness and Neuroticism may be a predictor of paranormal beliefs. Furthermore, Aarnio and Lindeman conducted research to confirm the relationship between religion and paranormal beliefs. One of their findings was that individuals who were believers were more neurotic than skeptics. However, it is possible this is due to the type of religion an individual belongs to. Nevertheless, multiple studies have found little correlation between these two beliefs. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil.  Religion as a personality characteristic  While there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example, has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that are developed by religion: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.

A pioneer in the film industry of Puerto Rico, he was the first Puerto Rican to produce commercially successful films in the island. In 1934, he produced and directed Romance Tropical, the first Puerto Rican film with sound.40 A≈àos de Cine Puertorique≈ào Vigui√© produced films for Path√©, Fox Film Corporation, Movietone and MGM. He also produced many documentaries for the Puerto Rican and U.S. governments, and private industries. Early years Vigui√©'s ( birth name: Juan Emilio Vigui√© Cajas ) parents were headed to Panama where his father, a French national, was to work on the construction of the Panama Canal. The couple had to make an emergency stop in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where his mother, a native of Ecuador, gave birth to Vigui√©. His father continued on his journey, leaving his wife behind. His mother died shortly after giving birth to Vigui√© and his father died in a construction accident while working on the canal.Historia del Cine en Puerto RicoBiographies Vigui√© was adopted by a Ponce municipal judge surnamed Caballer. Caballer raised Vigui√© and sent him to the Miguel Pou Academy in Ponce where he studied visual arts and painting under the guidance of Puerto Rican artist Miguel Pou. Vigui√©'s first silent film Path√© silent movie projector, probably from the 1920s. Vigui√©'s interest in the motion picture industry came about in 1901, after viewing the first silent film, an Eduardo Hervet presentation, exhibited in Teatro La Perla in Ponce. During a trip to Paris, France, he witnessed Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re's first public motion picture exhibition at the Caf-Les Capucinos. Upon his return to Puerto Rico he found a job as a movie projectionist at the Teatro Habana in his hometown. Vigui√© was inspired by what he saw and decided that he would like to make movies himself. In 1911, he sent one of his friends to France to purchase a Pathe camera with the money that he had earned. The Puerto Rican motion picture industry was born in 1912, when Rafael Colorado D'Assoy recorded the first non-documentary film titled Un Drama en Puerto Rico (A Drama in Puerto Rico). After Vigui√©'s friend returned with the camera, Vigui√© purchased two movie projectors from a French circus visiting Ponce and established a movie house in the town of Adjuntas. Vigui√© filmed his first documentary Escenas de Ponce (Scenes of Ponce) which consisted of various scenes of Ponce. He also included a scene of a hurricane and exhibited his work at Teatro Habana. The public became interested in his work and soon the Teatro Habana and his movie house in Adjuntas became popular public reunion centers. The hurricane scene in his documentary was shown in the United States by the American (U.S.) news media.\\"Hispanic Firsts\\"; by Nicolas Kanellos; Publisher: Visible Ink Press; In 1916, Colorado and Antonio Capella Mart√≠nez created the Film Industrial Society of Puerto Rico, producing their first silent film titled Por la Hembra y el Gallo (For the Girl and the Rooster). That same year Vigui√© traveled to New York City, where he took a course at the New York Institute of Photography at Columbia University. During his stay there, he joined the United States Army and served in World War I. After his discharge, he went to work for Universal and later for Paramount. He made many connections in the film industry in the years that he worked for the movie studios in the United States. He also invested most of his earnings in filming equipment. Pioneer in the film industry of Puerto Rico In 1919, Vigui√© returned to Puerto Rico, and in his native Ponce began work on a film based on the life of Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresi. The film was to be titled El Tesoro de Roberto Cofresi (Roberto Cofresi's Treasure), however the project did not proceed because of the lack of funds. Vigui√© then went to work as a cameraman for \\"Porto Rico Photoplays,\\" a film company established in Hato Rey. Even though the company was financed by local Puerto Rican businessmen, none of its members, with the exception of Vigui√©, was Puerto Rican or Hispanic. Amongst the main staff of the company were Reginald Denny, Ralph Ince and Ruth Clifford, who were involved in constant quarrels. In 1921, the company produced a film for Paramount titled \\"Tropical Love.\\" The movie was filmed in Loiza and San Juan, but without any participation from, or outreach to, any of the local residents. The film was conceived and executed exclusively by, and for, the U.S. Anglo population. This myopic production philosophy, and the chronic bickering amongst the directors, led to the company's closure. Noticieros Vigui√© (Vigui√© News) Vigui√© made use of the situation and purchased the company's film equipment. In 1922, he then founded his own company Noticieros Vigui√© (Vigui√© News). He collaborated as a cinematographer for various U.S. film companies that went to Puerto Rico to film their movies. \\"Vigui√© News\\" made a positive impression on the public with a documentary Vigui√© filmed, regarding the elaboration of tobacco. As a result, he was offered numerous contracts to make documentaries for the Puerto Rico Department of Health, the government of the Dominican Republic and the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1924, Vigui√© experimented with a new technique called Technicolor which yielded vivid, highly saturated levels of color to his film images. He used this technique in a documentary about the Malaria disease, and it gained him worldwide recognition. In 1926, Vigui√© was hired by the producers of the movie Aloma of the South Seas to film the movie scenes in the location of Pi√±onesManual Para El Productor de Cine Local Vigui√©'s international fame continued to grow, with his documentaries about Charles Lindbergh's 1928 visit to Puerto Rico, and the devastation caused that same year by \\"Hurricane San Felipe Segundo\\" (known in the U.S. as \\"Okeechobee Hurricane\\"). Fox News paid him well for the use of both documentaries, Vigui√© signed contracts with both MGM and Fox News, and both networks served as international outlets for his work. Synchronized film dialogue became possible in the late 1920s, with the perfection of the audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. Thus, the era of the silent movie came to an end. Vigui√© incorporated the new sound technology into his documentaries, and in the interviews he conducted with political and entertainment celebrities. Romance Tropical Romance Tropical was the first Puerto Rican film with sound and the world's second Hispanic film with sound. In 1931, Vigui√© together with his son Juan Vigui√©, Jr. and journalist Manuel R. Navas, founded \\"Vigui√© Film Productions.\\" That same year, Santa, a Mexican production and the first Spanish movie with sound, was presented in theaters throughout the island. After viewing Santa., Vigui√© was inspired to make his own movie with sound. With a loan of $10,000 and a screenplay written by Luis Pales Matos, Vigui√© produced and directed in 1934, Romance Tropical the first Puerto Rican movie with sound and the second Spanish movie with sound in the world. The movies' theme dealt with the romance between a poor boy and a rich girl. The cast of actors included Jorge Rodr√≠guez, Raquel and Ernestina Canino (daughters of San Juan lawyer and film investor Manuel Canino), Sixto Chevremont, C√°ndido de Lorenzo and Lotty Tischer. Vigui√©'s wife Mar√≠a was in charge of the costumes and the musical score was under the direction of composer Rafael Mu√±oz. Romance Tropical, which was distributed in theaters throughout Puerto Rico and New York by MGM, was an astounding success. MGM was ready to sign Vigui√© with a contract for four more movies and Frank Z. Clemente, MGM's Director of Latin productions, was going to establish his central offices in Puerto Rico. However, a copyright dispute over the movie erupted between the Canino family and Vigui√©. One of the results of the disputes was that MGM canceled its contracts with Vigui√©. The whereabouts of the original reels of the film is a mystery. In 2017, eighty-three years after its release, a copy of the film was found at the UCLA, Film & Television Archive, where its director Jan-Cristopher Horak, in conjunction with the Puerto Rico Culture Institute, confirmed its authenticity.Aparece La Primera Pelicula Puertorriquena ‚ÄúHow to Find a Lost Film‚Äù Disillusioned, Vigui√© discontinued making commercial films.

Legacy By 1951, Vigui√© Film Productions, presided by his son, Juan Vigui√©, Jr. had become the largest film producing company in Puerto Rico. The company was renamed \\"Guastella Film Producers\\" in 1971. Vigui√© was also a pioneer in the transmission of news via television. In 1954, television arrived in Puerto Rico.

This species is native to the Indian subcontinent and is more commonly known as East Indian arrowroot or narrow- leaved turmeric in English, and is called \\"yaipan\\" in Manipuri, \\"Aipah\\" in Thadou-Kuki, \\"tikhur\\" in Hindi, and \\"Koova\\" ‡¥ï‡µÇ‡¥µ in Malayalam, and is called \\"Kutupah\\" in Poula. In the Eastern hemisphere, the plant plays an integral role in many cultures. Description Curcuma angustifolia is rhizomatous herb. It is a perennial and a flowering plant, with modest and small spiked inflorescences of three or four yellow, funnel-shaped flowers within tufts of pink terminal bracts (coma bracts). The bracts are boat-shaped and encase the entire perianth of the flower. As is common to the genus, the flowers of C. angustifolia have double anthers, a slender style, and a globular stigma. Flowers are usually seen at the beginning of the monsoon (rainy) season from July to August, before the leaves have had the chance to fully develop, and they continue to flower even after the leaves have fully developed. The calyx of the flower is usually long and very hairy, with 3 lobes that may appear to be triangular or obtuse. The corolla is white, and usually grows to be about long with glabrous lobes that are also hairy. Seeds are a reddish-brown color. Leaves are typically simple, green, glabrous, and lanceolate, with margins that are entire. They appear in an opposite arrangement and are deciduous. They display fine parallel venation off of a central midrib. The upper surface of the leaves are usually a darker shade of green than the lower surfaces. Leaves may grow to about length and in width. The leaves also smell and taste similar to turmeric. Of great significance to C. angustifolia is its strong rhizome, which can grow to be up to in length. The rhizome of this plant is the primary source of its nutritive and medicinal properties. C. angustifolia also uses its rhizome to reproduce asexually via vegetative propagation. The plant in its entirety typically grows to be from in height. Distribution C. angustifolia is most commonly found growing wild in India, especially in the northeast and western coastal plains and hills. Such areas include the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa (Odisha), Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. This species can also be found in Burma, Laos, Nepal, and Pakistan. Cultivation Curcuma angustifolia requires temperatures at or above . It prefers shady areas and grows best in moist soil that is sandy, pebbly, or loamy.\\"Hortipedia: The GardenInfoPortal\\"> C. angustifolia is often found at the edges or in the clearings of forests. Common uses While commonplace in Eastern culture and medicine, C. angustifolia has only recently earned the attention of the Western scientific community. =Food uses= This species of plant has nutritional value as a source of starch for Indian foods. The rhizomes of C. angustifolia are typically ground into a flour which can then be mixed together with milk or water to form a nutritious meal. This flour was a common commercial crop in the 1800s. Most importantly, the West has begun to notice its potential as a source of nutrition and as a non-irritating diet for patients suffering from specific chronic ailments, recovering from fevers, or experiencing irritations of the gastrointestinal tract, the lungs, or the excretory system. A drink including C. angustifolia as an ingredient is also used as a replacement of breast-milk, or as a nutritional supplement for babies a short while after weaning. It is found as a primary ingredient in cakes, fruit preserves, biscuits, and puddings. =Medicinal uses= The rhizomes of C. angustifolia are used to soothe coughs and as such is used to treat bronchitis. Essential oils from C. angustifolia have been extracted and are used in antifungal medications. Compounds in the leaves of this plant have also been shown to have potential as antibacterial agents.

In Brathwaite's History of the Voice (1984), he discusses the prominence of pentameter in English poetic tradition, claiming that since the time of Chaucer, and with a few notable exceptions, pentameter has been the prevailing rhythm of English poetry. Brathwaite suggests that such imported literary forms may not be suitable to express the Caribbean experience. He writes, \\"The hurricane does not roar in pentameters.\\" It is here that nation language becomes of use to the Caribbean poet: Brathwaite describes reading an article by the Martinician poet and critic √âdouard Glissant, in which Glissant describes nation language as a \\"forced poetics\\" because it was used strategically by slaves in order to both disguise and maintain their culture.

He was given asylum in Bolivia, but after becoming politically active in that country, protesting the governments of both Fidel Castro and Evo Morales, was deported. He now lives in Norway. On January 9, 2007, Samartino, a Cuban refugee who had been a resident of Bolivia since 2000, was expelled from that country after having been held for seventeen days for criticizing the Bolivian and Cuban governments. According to a report by the Human Rights Foundation (HFR), \\"Samartino was subjected to numerous human rights violations, including wrongful imprisonment, arbitrary detainment, forced exile, due process abuse, and undue restriction of free speech.\\" He arrived in Colombia on the night of January 8. Thor Halvorssen, president of HRF, said: \\"Amauris Samartino‚Äôs case is a scandal and it reveals that the government of Bolivia will stop at nothing to silence dissent.\\" History Samartino left Cuba in 1999 in a homemade raft along with eleven other dissidents. A U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat picked him up and took him to the Guantanamo military base. He remained there for some months until the International Organization for Migration arranged asylum for him in Bolivia. He arrived in Bolivia on October 24, 2000. According to a Catholic priest, Fernando Rojas Silva, Samartino and the other dissidents were ‚Äúbrought to Santa Cruz by the U.S. Embassy, given a few dollars for their survival and a paper certifying that the Bolivian government would provide the paperwork necessary to remain in the country. Months passed and nothing happened. They ran out of dollars and moved to the capital,‚Äù where they began ‚Äúknocking on doors of official institutions and the Embassy.‚Äù Finally, in desperation, they held ‚Äúa hunger strike...outside the U.S. Embassy,‚Äù whereupon ‚Äúthe representative of UNHCR requested the intervention of mediators.‚Äù Eventually Samartino was certified as a political refugee in Bolivia, and later he became a permanent legal resident. It was in Santa Cruz that he met his wife, Normina Ch√°vez, and, according to the British medical journal The Lancet, ‚Äúworked as a supervisor in natural gas operations.‚Äù Samartino became politically active ‚Äúafter Evo Morales, a socialist and a close ideological ally of both Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez and Cuba's President Fidel Castro, was elected Bolivia's president in 2005 and Cuban doctors began arriving. Samartino said he feared Bolivia was going to be turned into a second Cuba so he began speaking out in the media about the Communist island's human rights violations and helping Cuban medics who wanted to defect.‚Äù The Lancet paraphrased Samartino as saying that ‚ÄúCuba's overseas medical programme is more political than humanitarian,‚Äù and as noting that ‚ÄúCuba has sent many more medical personnel to oil-rich Venezuela, ruled by a close ally, than to Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest nation, and which is wracked by an AIDS epidemic.‚Äù In 2006, Samartino spoke out in the Bolivian media against violations of human rights by the Cuban regime and lamented Castro's influence on Morales. In July of that year, according to HRF, Samartino ‚Äúannounced that he had assisted thirty dissident Cuban doctors, who were visiting Bolivia in a cooperative exchange program, in defecting to Brazil and to the United States.‚Äù =Arrest= On December 23, 2006, Samartino, while walking with his wife on a street in Santa Cruz, was stopped by five armed men who, although dressed in civilian clothes, said that they were police, though they did not produce identification. They handcuffed Samartino, put him in a car, and drove him away without explanation. Samartino's wife and family friends then sought to find out where he was and why he had been arrested. It turned out that he had been placed in a cell at the La Paz headquarters of the Special Crime Fighting Forces, where he was told that he was about to be sent back to Cuba for having criticized both the Cuban and Bolivian governments. On December 26 of that year, the Partido Republicano de Cuba declared its solidarity with Samartino. Samartino's arrest was ordered by Bolivian cabinet member Alicia Mu√±oz on the grounds that he had violated a 1996 immigration law prohibiting the involvement of foreigners in Bolivia's internal political affairs ‚Äì a law that had been declared unconstitutional in 2001 on the grounds that it violated free-speech rights. On December 27, the Bolivian office of the Defender of the People maintained that there were no legal grounds on which Bolivia could return Samartino to Cuba. Samartino stated that deportation to Cuba would mean execution for him. His lawyer, Rodolfo T√©llez, expressed the same concern. During this time, Cuba's ambassador to Bolivia, Rafael Dauza, who wanted Samartino returned to Cuba, met with Bolivian officials; on December 27, Dauza called Samartino a criminal, accused him of fraud, and described him as ‚Äúanti- Castro, an alcoholic, a fraudster, and thief.‚Äù A Bolivian senator accused Samartino of planning violent protests, while a spokesman for Evo Morales said Samartino had ‚Äúdenigrated‚Äù Castro. On December 28, it was reported that Judge Rene Delgado had ordered Samartino's return to the place from which he had arrived in Bolivia ‚Äì namely, the U.S. base at Guant√°namo Bay. On February 2, 2007, the Bolivian Constitutional Court ruled that the detention and expulsion of Samartino was arbitrary and illegal. HRF had filed an amicus curiae brief explaining delineating that Samartino's arrest and detention violated Bolivian law as well as four international treaties of which Bolivia was a signatory. Bolivian Vice President √Ålvaro Garc√≠a Linera refused, however, to obey the court's ruling. After Samartino's case drew the attention of the Bolivian media, the Bolivian government apparently changed its plan, announcing that it would attempt to deport Samartino to some country other than Cuba. Although the Constitutional Court had clearly found the laws unconstitutional under which Bolivia was attempting to expel Samartino, Judge Ren√© Delgado said that those laws remained in effect. =Aftermath= On January 9, 2007, after being held illegally for 17 days, Samartino was expelled from Bolivia without due process of law. He was taken into custody by UN refugee officials, who flew him to Bogot√°, Colombia. He was later granted asylum in Norway. ‚ÄúAlthough my home is Bolivia,‚Äù said Samartino, ‚ÄúI am overjoyed that Norway is willing to be a safe harbor for those with the temerity to express themselves freely. Bolivia is no longer a safe place for those who disagree, no matter how peacefully, with the government of Evo Morales.‚Äù On November 24, 2009, Samartino sent an open letter to then U.S. Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart, asking him to help Cuban doctors in Bolivia who were being denied asylum and travel visas. In January 2011, the website of the Norwegian state media organization, NRK, featured a major article about the Cuban medical system based largely on Samartino's testimony. Entitled ‚ÄúBehind the facade, there is only misery,‚Äù the article quoted Samartino as saying that Cuba's ‚Äúlow infant- mortality rate is a lie,‚Äù that patients in many Cuban hospitals have to supply their own food and bedsheets, and that it health personnel routinely falsify statistics.

The extant Liberal and Country Party was the actual Victorian division of the Liberal Party. The party was formed from the Electoral Reform League, a political group formed by Hollway after his expulsion from the Liberal and Country Party, with the goal of re-distributing Victoria's electoral boundaries, which Hollway and his supporters saw as mal- apportioned in favour of the Country Party. With electoral reform implemented by John Cain's Labor government, the group became known as the \\"Hollway group\\". On 27 October 1954, the Speaker informed the assembly that Hollway's group had formally become an Opposition party. Hollway told reporters that he had attempted to unify opposition against the Labor Party, but that the Liberal and Country Party had rejected his overtures, leaving him no option but to form a \\"separate political entity\\". He stated that the VLP had been formed to bring \\"the true principles of liberalism to the Parliament\\". In December 1954 Hollway issued an ultimatum to the Cain government, demanding it remove price controls or his party would use its two votes in the Victorian Legislative Council to defeat the Price Control Extension Bill, which would have extended government control of prices a further twelve months from its expiration date of 31 December. The government ignored the ultimatum, and the bill was defeated in the upper house, but Cain came to an agreement with Hollway to maintain supply. The party ceased to exist in 1955 when all four members of the party (Hollway, Alexander Dennett, John Don and Ray Tovell) lost their seats in the Legislative Assembly at the 1955 state election.

The crime was orchestrated by his 20-year-old daughter, Clara Jane Schwartz, as part of a fantasy role-playing game. Clara was convicted of first-degree murder in her father's death. The case made national headlines due to Schwartz's prominence in the scientific community and for claims that his murder was related to role-playing games and the occult. Background Robert Schwartz was a nationally renowned scientist in the field of biometrics and DNA research. In 1978, he was co-author with Margaret Dayhoff of a key paper in Science providing the first experimental evidence of Lynn Margulis' theory of the symbiogenetic origin of cellular mitochondria and chloroplasts. In 1992, Schwartz was a founding member of the Virginia Biotechnology Association. He was the father of three children: Catherine Michele, Jesse, and Clara Jane. Murder On December 8, 2001, Schwartz was stabbed to death with a sword by Kyle Hulbert at his Leesburg, Virginia, farmhouse. His body was discovered two days later. =Investigation= On December 11, 2001, 19-year-old Katherine Inglis made statements to the police implicating Schwartz's daughter Clara in his murder, claiming that Clara discussed the murder with her boyfriend, 21-year-old Michael Pfohl, and 18-year-old Kyle Hulbert. Inglis stated that the motive for the murder was that Schwartz had hit Clara and she believed that he tried to poison her. Clara, who was a sophomore at James Madison University at the time of the murder, was charged on February 2, 2002. Clara was formally indicted for the murder, as well as conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation of murder charges, on March 31, 2002. Inglis, Pfohl, and Hulbert had all been indicted previously for Schwartz's murder. =Trial= Clara was the first of the four co-defendants to go on trial in October 2002. The prosecutors portrayed her as a manipulative young woman who used her role-playing game, Underworld, to convince her friends to kill her father. Prosecutor Jennifer Wexton argued that \\"Clara Schwartz wanted her father dead; she had hated her father for a long time\\", and that after failing to enlist a friend named Patrick to kill her father, Clara became desperate. The defense argued that the man who had committed the murder, Kyle Hulbert, had taken Clara's directives to kill her father out of the context of their role-playing game. Clara's attorney persisted that Clara \\"never intended for any person to kill her father.\\" However, Patrick, testifying for the prosecution, stated that Clara spoke increasingly about killing Schwartz and had researched herbal poisons in order to make his death appear natural. Patrick also testified that Clara spoke of how much money she stood to inherit if Schwartz died, and her concerns that he would cut her out of his will. He stated that Clara became increasingly frustrated because he was not carrying out her wishes, and later found a willing participant in Hulbert. =Aftermath= On October 16, 2002, the jury convicted Clara of first-degree murder. On February 10, 2003, she was sentenced to serve 48 years in prison. She is currently being housed at the Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women near Troy, Virginia, and has a tentative release date of November 2, 2043. Clara has made many unsuccessful attempts to appeal her conviction, which was most recently affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on March 9, 2010. For their roles in the murder, Hulbert was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, serving his sentence at River North Correctional Center; Pfohl was sentenced to eighteen years. Inglis served a one-year sentence for conspiracy to commit murder. =In the media= * The case was featured on a 2012 episode of the Oxygen Network program Snapped; an episode of the Investigation Discovery program Fatal Encounters; the 2013 episode \\"Souls of Stone\\" of the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women; and an episode of Occult Crimes. * The true crime book I'd Kill For You by M.

Jinnahs have played an important role in the Pakistan Movement for creation of Pakistan, a separate country for Muslims of India. The family held the leadership of All- India Muslim League, and its successor, Muslim League, until it dissolved in 1958 by martial law. Originally from a Gujarati background, they moved to Karachi from Kathiawar, Gujarat in the 19th century. Jinnah's paternal grandfather was from Paneli Moti village in Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat, India). Jinnah was the eldest of seven children of Jinnahbhai Poonja, a prosperous merchant, and his wife, Mithibai. His family was a member of the Khoja caste (formerly Dhudhi Rajputs), Hindus who had converted to Islam centuries earlier and who were followers of the Aga Khan. Although born a Khoja(noble) family who were disciples of the Ismaili Aga Khan, Jinnah moved towards the Shia sect early in life. There is evidence later, given by his relatives and associates in court, to establish that he was firmly a Sufi Shia Muslim. Muhammad Ali Jinnah (also referred to as only Jinnah) and Fatima Jinnah, have been important figures in the history of Pakistan. Jinnah is considered as the founder of Pakistan and he served as the first Governor General of Pakistan upon independence, while Fatima played an important role in the struggle for Pakistan Movement and was the founding mother of Pakistan.

It was the first archeological site associated with the Yope people to be excavated, in the 2000s. The site is on a hill surrounded by mountains, which were worshipped by the Yope. Four marked the cardinal directions and one, Compuerta, was used to mark solar events such as equinoxes and solstices as the sun rose behind it. Tehuacalco was occupied as a ceremonial site from about 400CE to about 1100CE. The site was opened to the public in 2008. Location The Palace with the Compuerta mountain behind it The site is located in state of Guerrero, near the state capital of Chilpancingo, near the Mexico City-Acapulco highway. The closest communities are La Haciendita, Camizal de la V√≠a, El Potrero and Garrapatas, which belong to the Camizal de la V√≠a ejidos, with the largest nearby community being Tierra Colorada. The environment of the area is deciduous tropical forest, whose trees lose most of their leaves during the dry season in the fall and winter. History Rock with etchings called the \\"Giant's footprints\\" The name of the site comes from the Nahuatl phrase ‚Äútehuacalli‚Äù which refers to holes bored into stones to be used for ritual purposes. It can be interpreted various ways such as ‚Äúplace of the stone box,‚Äù ‚Äúhouse of priests‚Äù or ‚Äúhouse of the sacred water.‚Äù While mostly associated with the Yopes, it is not completely certain. There may have been Yopime or even Tlapaneca settlements here as well. Occupation of the site began around 400CE with its height between 650 and 1100CE. At this time, the population center covered about eighty hectares and the ceremonial center covered twelve. Most of the structures were built when the Toltecs were at the height of their influence. The Yopes of Tehuacalco were sedentary farmers with different social classes with classes of rulers and priests on top, followed by warriors, merchants and artisans. The diet consists of meat from hunting and corn. The Yopes thought of the mountains as repositories of water and seeds. These mountains were worshipped as a way to ensure good harvests. The sun was thought to be devoured by a monster at the end of the day and had to fight in the underworld to arise the next morning. It was considered obligatory to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the sun to help it return. The Palace at Tehuacalco The area around the site was named Yopitzingo in Nahuatl, and it was one of the few areas that the Aztecs could not conquer in the late Post Classic period even though by then the Yopes had become semi nomadic practicing intermittent agriculture. However, after the Spanish Conquest, the Yope were decimated by European diseases. They did not submit completely to Spanish rule and had one major rebellion. However, this was crushed with the Spanish scattering the remaining Yopes to other settlements. Tehuacalco is the first site related to the Yope to be extensively explored, which was done in the 2000s. Nineteen structures have been discovered so far, mostly by field work performed in 2006 and 2007. Afterwards, forty million pesos were spent to ready the site for tourism and it was opened to the public in 2008. It is one of twelve sites opened to the public during the Calderon administration from 2006 to 2012. There is a welcome center with explanations about the site in Spanish, but the explanatory signs on the site are in Spanish and English. Composition of the site The Mesoamerican ball court The site is located on a hill surrounded by taller mountains. Four of these mountains, Compuerta, Capul√≠n, Tierra Colorada and Gavilpan, mark the cardinal directions. The site hill was considered to be a ‚Äúfifth‚Äù direction, where power was concentrated. The site has four aspects, areas with rock etchings, the surrounding mountain terrain, pyramidal structures and caves in the hills with offerings. The rock etchings include the Piedra de los Pies Pintados, with markings of feet and Monument W which has circular patterns used to counts lunar cycles. Fifty seven caves on the sides of Compuerta have been explored with findings of offerings such as braziers and incense burners. These caves were related to the worship of the sun. The site possesses various characteristics related to archaeoastronomy . The site is oriented towards the Compuerta Mountain. This mountain and smaller peaks on each side were used to mark equinoxes and solstices, as the sun rose from behind them. The site was a ceremonial center with a plaza surrounded by various pyramid bases and other structures. The site has a distinct construction style, which consists of boulders with spaces between them filled in with layers of flat rock and red clay. This allows the structures to withstand earthquakes. Of the discovered structures, eight are considered major complexes with the rest minor. The most import of these is four large pyramidal structures and a Mesoamerican ball court. Some of the pyramid bases are in unusually good condition. The four main structures are Encinera or Main Temple, the Palace, the Templo del Espejo de Agua and Platform W. The Palace, also denominated as Building Five, is the largest on the site, with a base that measures eighty meters on each side. It has sunken patios and various courts. The La Encinera is twenty meters tall and was the site for various rituals performed by priests and rulers. The ball court measures 37.8 meters long. Platform W had residences for the elite with internal patios and drainage systems. However, the most sacred part of the site is a hill dedicated as sanctuary for the worship of water and rain. Some of the minor structures include the Templo Verde, the Templo Rojo and La Anona. The last two form the Solar Group.

The owners describe the cuisine as ‚ÄúBocusian-Lyonnaise cuisine du march√© (French market cuisine).‚Äù Its located at 2491 Notre Dame Street West in the neighbourhood of Little Burgundy, located in the borough of Le Sud Ouest. History Joe Beef was opened on September 19, 2005 by David McMillan, Frederic Morin, and Allison Cunningham with financial guidance and investment by Jeff Baikowitz and David Lisbona. The restaurant took over the location of Caf√© Miguel. The restaurant's name is a homage to Montreal's infamous Joe Beef, an alias for Charles McKiernan. McKiernan, who owned a tavern that served many lower class laborers in Montreal, ‚Äúdied in his canteen of a heart attack at the age of 54.‚Äù McKiernan's generosity and gluttony may have inspired the concept of Joe Beef restaurant, which challenges the conventions of fine French dining.  Controversies   Alcoholism, Substance Abuse & Mental Health  McMillan, one of the founders and original chefs of Joe Beef, claimed in an interview with Bon Appetit that he and Morin were indulging in the gluttonous lifestyle they were providing for others through their restaurant, including alcohol. McMillan's peers at the restaurant staged an intervention to combat his alcoholism. Additionally, during the building of the restaurant, McMillan said that he was unable to feel joy about his new business and was not able to fulfill his role as a new restaurant owner and a father. McMillan has since tried to change his lifestyle by attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, which has influenced his partner, Morin, to do the same. Sexual Assault Allegations A transgender Joe Beef busser came forward on Instagram that, in 2016, after the chef de cuisine ‚Äúgroped their genitals.‚Äù They allegedly quit their job after complaining to an unresponsive manager. In an interview, McMillan confirmed allegations and stated that chef de cuisine was ‚Äúextremely remorseful‚Äù, but has taken no action to rectify. McMillan blamed his alcoholism, which he says distracted him from focusing on his career. McMillan has been criticized before for covering for his Chef de Cuisine, ‚ÄúMcMillan was pointing fingers at one alleged abuser, while ‚Äúhe employs and supports‚Äù another.‚Äù claims an ex-employees in a tweet, referring to the crusade McMillan underwent when decided to publicly out winemaker Norman Hardie of inappropriate workplace behavior, dubbed as Sexual assault. The article, written by opinion/feminist Toronto-based reporter Ivy Knight, with accounts from ‚Äúfriends or acquaintances of Ms. Knight‚Äôs‚Äù,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-winemaker- norman-hardie-accused-of-sexual-misconduct/ brought criticism toward McMillan for importing and selling Norman Hardie wines in Qu√©bec until the article was made public.  Offerings  Spaghetti lobster, a popular dish at Joe Beef The menu at Joe Beef changes every dinner service, usually according to the produce sourced from Atwater Market and other local suppliers. The menu is displayed on a wall-to-wall chalkboard. The lobster spaghetti, foie gras torchon, and oysters are some of the most popular and consistent offerings.  Products  Federic Morin and David McMillan, along with Meredith Erickson, have released two cookbooks: The Art of Living According to Joe Beef: A Cookbook of Sorts and Joe Beef: Surviving the Apocalypse: Another Cookbook of Sorts, which won Gold at the 2019 Taste Canada Awards.

Five of his books are still published today (all republished within the last five years from 2007 to 2010) as standard texts for students of Pathology. Career Horst Oertel was born in Dresden, Germany. His parents emigrated to New York City when he was fourteen. He studied Medicine at Yale University, graduating in 1894. His postgraduate studies in pathology were undertaken at the universities of Berlin, Leipzig and W√ºrzburg. In Germany, he became greatly influenced by Rudolf Virchow. In 1907, Oertel returned to the United States when he was appointed director and chief pathologist of the Russell Sage Institute of Pathology in New York City. He later undertook a period of study at Guy's Hospital, London. Oertel came to McGill University in 1914 on the recommendation of John George Adami, and was appointed acting Chair of Pathology in 1918 in consequence of Adami's continuing war service as Inspector of Canadian Hospitals in France. Oertel succeeded Adami as Professor and head of department in 1919, an election which created much publicity due to his German origins, but despite strong opposition he received a strong vote of confidence from McGill and Adami alike. In the 1880s, McGill's pathology department had secured an international reputation of excellence under Sir William Osler, who appointed Adami to succeed him. But by the end of the First World War, the discipline and its faculties were ready for major developments, for which Oertel was brought in. In 1924, despite Maude Abbott's objections, he reorganized the Pathology Department and its Museum in time to coincide with their transfer from the Strathcona Medical Building to the newly constructed Pathological Institute. Oertel continued to direct the pathology department with distinction, and continued until four years past the normal retirement age as Chancellor Sir Edward Beatty thought so highly of him that he would not hear of his being retired until 1938.McGill University for the Advancement of Learning 1895-1971 Reputation Oertel excelled in teaching, bringing together his superior knowledge of Pathology, Philosophy and Humanities to his lectures. He was held in great respect by his students, but he was unpopular with staff internists and surgeons as he strongly believed that pathology was not the handmaiden of medicine and surgery.McGill Medicine (1885-1936) His life centred on McGill University, and yet strangely he did not feel obliged to help his fellow staff members if it did not suit him, particularly when it involved cooperation with the research interests of the clinicians. He befriended Sir Vincent Meredith, President of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, and in the early 1920s defended Meredith's arbitrary appointments that were in the interests of the Royal Vic and not McGill. He was compliant in the Sir Henry Gray affair and later refused to help Wilder Penfield when he was looking for laboratory space for his neuropathology interests. Neither of these events endeared Oertel to his associates. As a Pathologist, Oertel's first class reputation remains to this day. No less than five of his books are standard texts for students of Pathology and still published today (all republished within the last five years from 2007 to 2010), seventy years after his retirement from McGill and fifty years after his death. He lived between his apartments at the University Club and the Ritz-Carlton Montreal.McGill Medicine (1885-1936) He died a bachelor in London, England.Montreal Gazette, January 18, 1956 Bibliography * General Pathology: An Introduction to the Study of Medicine; Being a Discussion of the Development (last republished, 2009) * The Anatomic Histological Process of Bright's Disease (last republished 2009) * General Pathology: An Introduction to the Study of Medicine; Being a Discussion of the Development and Nature of Processes of Disease (last republished 2007) * General Pathology (last republished 2010) * The Anatomic Histological Process of Bright's Disease and Their Relation to the Functional Changes: Lectures Delivered in the Russell Sage Institute of Pathology at City Hospital New York, 1909 (last republished 2010) * The problems, methods and aims of pathology in their past, present and future aspects,: The two introductory lectures to the course in general pathology at McGill university (1929) * Outlines of Pathology (1927) * The Pancreas and Diabetic Metabolism (1924) * The centennial of Rudolf Virchow, 1821-1921 (1921) * On universities and university methods of instruction and study;: An address before the Medical Ungraduate Society of McGill University, Nov. 17th, 1919 * On the Mechanism of Cancer Development * The Position of the Circulation in Nephritus References External links * Category:Canadian pathologists Category:McGill University faculty Category:1871 births Category:1956 deaths ","title":"Horst Oertel"},{"id":"35446047","text":"Thomas Dowd (born 11 September 1970) is a Canadian Bishop of the Roman Catholic Church.

Lemieux medal from Concordia University in 2018. = Investigation of Brian Boucher and aftermath = On March 27, 2019, it was reported that Dowd had played a key role in the investigation of Brian Boucher, a priest who was sentenced to 8 years in prison for sexually abusing two young boys. Through his investigation Dowd discovered one of the two victims, who Dowd accompanied to the Montr√©al police. Dowd also turned over his 250-page report to assist in the police investigation. Justice Patricia Compagnone, who presided Boucher's trial, applauded the church's involvement. In a statement immediately after the sentencing on March 25, 2019, Dowd thanked the victims, the police, the crown prosecutor and the judge, and also condemned the actions of Brian Boucher. He also revealed that the investigation had led him to a time of depression and burnout, but pledged to strive to bring justice and healing should he encounter similar situations in the future. Dowd spoke about his own childhood experiences of abuse at a lay-run summer camp in subsequent interviews. The noted Vaticanologist John Allen offered some subsequent analysis of Dowd's work after being prompted to do so by an abuse victim. On April 3, 2019, one of the victims of Brian Boucher (identified only as A.B. due to a publication ban) applied for authorization for a class action against the archdiocese of Montreal. On June 20, 2019, CBC Montreal published an investigative report: \\"Montreal sexual abuse victim says Catholic clergy interrogated him, looking for inconsistencies in his story.\\" A.B. was asked by Dowd to attend a meeting in late 2016 concerning his experiences with Brian Boucher. According to the article, A.B. was grilled for several hours by 9 members of the clergy, some dressed in full church regalia, in the same place where he had been molested. The Archdiocese has not responded to the article, citing the legal proceedings already underway. Dowd was part of a small group of bishops that attended a screening of the film Prey in September 2019, where he and the other bishops had a chance to dialogue with survivors of clergy sexual abuse. On October 1, 2019, he participated in the radio show Ottawa Morning with Robyn Bresnahan as a follow up. On November 16, 2019, the Catholic Register published an opinion piece written by Dowd about the experiences of watching the film.

Prostitution has increased within the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. UNAIDS estimate there are 14,100 female sex workers in Tajikistan. Government official figures for 2015 were 1,777 prostitutes and 194 brothels. Prostitution occurs on the streets and in bars, restaurants, nightclubs and saunas, and HIV prevalence is 3.5% amongst sex workers. Previously, as soliciting is an administrative offence, arrested prostitutes are given a nominal fine and released, while those procuring are prosecuted, potentially being punished by up to eight years in jail. In 2015 a new law was passed that doubled the fine for solicitation and added 15 days of home arrest to the punishment. Being the poorest country to emerge from the Soviet Union, economic hardship is a primary reason women in the country enter prostitution. Sex trafficking is a problem in the country. Sex tourism Tajikistan is a sex tourism destination for Afghans. The more liberal regime in Tajikistan, the poverty of the country and a similar language make it attractive to Afghans, even if a Tajik visa may cost $500. Tajikistan has such a bad reputation in Afghanistan that men going to the country may tell their wives they are going to India. Sex trafficking Tajikistan is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and children from Tajikistan are subjected to sex trafficking primarily in Turkey, UAE, and Russia, and also in Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan, as well as within Tajikistan. Women and minors are increasingly vulnerable to trafficking. In some cases, migrant laborers abandon their families, making women more vulnerable to trafficking as sole providers for their families. Some women who travelled to Syria or Iraq with promises of marriage were instead sold into sexual slavery. Tajik women and girls are transported to Afghanistan for the purpose of forced marriage, which can lead to sex trafficking. Tajik children are subjected to sex trafficking in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Article 130.1 of the 2003 criminal code, amended in 2004 and 2008, prohibits all forms of trafficking, including the use of force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of sexual exploitation and forced labour. The article prescribes penalties of five to 15 years imprisonment. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Tajikistan as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country. 2014 crackdown In June 2014, the Interior Minister, Ramazon Rahimov, expressed concerns about the growth of ‚Äúimmoral crimes,‚Äù and ordered a crackdown on prostitution. Brothels were to be raided and sex workers arrested and forcibly tested for HIV and other STIs. 505 sex workers were detained in the capital, Dushanbe, the first few days, of these 450 had an STI according to a statement issued by the minister. 30 of the women were fined. Sex workers reported that this led to rape, sexual humiliation and police officers demanding sex to release the sex workers from detention.

The Framework has incorporated feedback from an extensive consultation process, including two national symposiums, national public consultation forums, focus groups, an online forum and case-study trials. The Early Years Learning Framework Professional Learning Program (EYLF PLP), was developed for the Australian Government by Early Childhood Australia in 2009, to provide ongoing professional support to services as they engage in the EYLF implementation process.

The NQS PLP has all the features of the EYLF PLP, along with a new focus to assist services to meet the National Quality Standard. Description The EYLF consists of three parts, that outlines the world that educators in Australia should shape around children: # Principles, the first part, are goals for the care, e.g. \\"Secure, respectful and reciprocal relationships\\"; # Practices are guidelines for how to achieve the goals set out in the principles, the document EYLF document includes several hands-on examples; # Outcomes is a list of 5 overall goals, each with 2-5 sub-goals.

It has been extirpated from Kansas and Tennessee and it is rare throughout most of the rest of its range. It may be most prevalent in Missouri. The main threat to the species is the loss of habitat to agricultural use. Its native prairie habitat has been reduced so that now the plant mainly grows on roadsides and rights-of-way.

The town is regularly visited by fossickers, seeking sapphires, garnets, zircons and gold. Its name is derived from an Aboriginal term meaning \\"small waters\\", and was chosen due to the numerous small streams in the area, which feed into the Lachlan River. Built in the early 1800s, Grabben Gullen hosts St Mary's Catholic Church, a post office opened on 16 December 1891, and a pub named The Albion. The church is of gothic style. Designed by an architect named Mr. Gordon in historical records, it lies approximately 4.5 kilometres from the village centre and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2013. Grabben Gullen is now a tourist attraction in the Upper Lachlan region, and hosts a monthly produce market.

For nine months the residents received no response, and the matter was set aside for about three months. At the expiration of that time an answer was received that a police station would be established.

He founded Rosen Hotels & Resorts in 1974, and serves as the company's president and chief operating officer. Rosen is widely known in the Central Florida area for his philanthropy, and was named the Orlando Sentinels Central Floridian of the Year in 2011. Early life and education Rosen was born in 1939 in Manhattan to Jack and Lee Rosen.http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2009-08-27/news/JEWISH_1_new-campus- jewish-community-southwest-orlando He attended Cornell University, earning a Bachelor of Science degree from their School of Hotel Administration. He then served in the United States Army for three years in Germany and South Korea. Career Rosen began his career at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City as a convention salesman. He also worked at other hotels including various Hilton Hotels and the New Yorker Hotel. Rosen eventually joined the Walt Disney Company as director of hotel planning. During the height of the 1973 oil crisis, Rosen left Disney and purchased his first hotel, a Quality Inn on International Drive in Southwest Orlando (Orange County; now Rosen Inn International). To market his hotel during this period, Rosen hitchhiked to New England and met with several motor coach companies to gain their Central Florida business. (At the end of one trip, one company offered him a return trip ride with a couple traveling to Florida, if he would provide them accommodations there). That purchase marked the beginning of Rosen Hotels & Resorts. In 2006, Rosen opened the 1501-room Rosen Shingle Creek, an AAA Four Diamond hotel, his first resort. In October 2017, Rosen purchased the Clarion International Drive and the Red Roof Inn International Drive. The next year, he consolidated both hotels under the Midpointe Hotel name, bringing the total number of hotels owned to currently (2019) eight, all in Orlando. The company's other hotels include: the 1334-room Rosen Centre and the 800-room Rosen Plaza, both connected to the Orange County Convention Center's West Building, Rosen Inn closest to Universal, Rosen Inn at Pointe Orlando, and Rosen Inn International. All are located on International Drive. The Clarion Inn Lake Buena Vista is located next to Walt Disney World. Rosen Hotels & Resorts owns and operates eight hotels and resorts in the Orlando metropolitan area. The company administers 6,694 guestrooms, has 4,500 employees, and is valued at over $500 million. Philanthropy Rosen's philanthropic efforts began in 1993, when he created the Tangelo Park Program to benefit an impoverished Orlando community of the same name. The three-pronged program includes his promise of college scholarships (including room, board, books and tuition) for members of the community who are accepted to vocational school, college or university in the state of Florida. The program includes a parent resource center and ten neighborhood preschools. As of 2016, more than 200 college degrees have been awarded through this program. For more than ten years, Rosen has funded an alternative spring break for about a dozen Cornell students who wish to spend their vacation in Orlando, staying in one of his hotels and mentoring students who live in Tangelo Park. In the spring of 2016, Rosen announced a program similar to the Tangelo Park Program, albeit five times as large, to benefit the Parramore District near downtown Orlando. The program started with Parramore residents who graduated high school in 2016. In addition, Rosen funded the building and maintenance of a 24-room preschool housed at the Orange County Public Schools Academic Center for Excellence in Parramore which opened in August 2017. Rosen is funding 48 teachers' and aides' salaries, as well as the salaries of two directors. In November 2017, Rosen announced a partnership with Rollins College, a private, liberal arts college in Winter Park, to provide three annual scholarships to the school to be shared by Tangelo Park and Parramore high school graduates. In 2002, Rosen donated $18 million to the University of Central Florida to develop the Rosen College of Hospitality Management. He funds hundreds of scholarships annually to students attending the Rosen College. For years, Rosen has funded sending medical supplies and personal hygiene items to Haiti. In 2006, he hosted the Water for Haiti gala at Rosen Plaza which funded more than 200 water filtration devices. He has also committed to rebuilding hurricane damaged homes‚Äîmore than 100‚Äîwhich were completed in December 2017. In 2016, Rosen was awarded the Bob Graham Center for Public Service Citizen of the Year award for his work with Tangelo Park. And was also named the most influential person in tourism in Orlando by Orlando magazine. In November 2017, Rosen was honored by the Orlando Business Journal as the Philanthropist of the Year. The International Drive Chamber of Commerce also named an award in Rosen's name‚ÄîThe Harris Rosen Philanthropy Award‚Äîwhich he received in November 2017.

Casimir Gregory Stapko was born in Milwaukee to Polish immigrants. At 13, he was apprenticed to various church painters, who taught him to restore frescoes, imitate marble and wood, paint murals and apply gold leaf.

In addition to portrait painting and copying assignments, Stapko restored damaged paintings, taught oil painting, did gold-leaf work for churches, built furniture and crafted copies of old frames to go with copied paintings. He also copied paintings for publishers of illustrated art books. Stapko‚Äôs copying genius led to a new gallery rule requiring that all copies had to be done at least two inches smaller than the original and labeled on the back with paint that would stand out under X-rays long after the color had faded.

Candi Bahal, also known as Biaro Bahal (biaro, derived from vihara, a monastery) or Candi Portibi (Batak portibi, derived from prithivi, \\"earth\\") is Vajrayana Buddhist candi complex in Bahal village, Padang Bolak, Portibi, Padang Lawas Regency, North Sumatra, Indonesia. It is located about three hours journey with car from Padangsidempuan or 400 km from Medan. The complex includes three candis: Candi Bahal I, Candi Bahal II, and Candi Bahal III. The temple site is linked to Pannai Kingdom circa 11th to 13th century CE.  History  Buddha Amitabha bronze statue found at Si Pamatung in Barumun Tengah district Candi Bahal are one of a group of temples discovered in Padang Lawas. Padang Lawas (Minangkabau \\"broad plain\\") is a grassy flat plain located between the Barisan Mountains and the highlands of northern Sumatra. The plain is kept free of tall vegetation by the prevailing dry winds sweeping through the gap between the two highlands. There were no major settlements in Padang Lawas, but the area provided a strategic route for people moving between the east and west coast of Sumatra. The flow of people in the area might provide the reason for the establishment of 11th and 13th century shrines found in the area. At least 25 brick shrines have been discovered in the plain of Padang Lawas, including Candi Pulo, Candi Barumun, Candi Singkilon, Candi Sipamutung, Candi Aloban, Candi Rondaman Dolok, Candi Bara, Candi Magaledang, Candi Sitopayan and Candi Nagasaribu. No kingdoms were associated with these temples, at least according to inscriptions discovered in the site, however the religion is identical to that practiced by Adityawarman. Candi Bahal are the only temples that has been fully restored, the other were still in ruins. Construction of the temples of Padang Lawas were estimated to be between the 11th to 13th century CE. They were possibly linked with Pannai Kingdom, one of the trading ports on the coast of Strait of Malacca under Srivijayan mandala. Restoration of Candi Bahal I occurred in 1977-1978 and 1982-1983. Candi Bahal II has been restored between 1991-1992. Temple Complex The three temples of Bahal are separated by a distance of about 500 meter. The complex of the temple is known locally as biaro (from vihara or monastery), possibly indicating a clue to its original use. The names of three of the Bahal temples indicate connections with Nepal and Sri Lanka. Bahal is a term still used in Nepal to refer the two-storied temples of the Vajrayana, a major sect which influenced Buddhism in Indonesia. Rampant lions carved flanking the temple of Biaro Bahal I was similar to carvings at Polonaruva, the 11th-century capital of Sri Lanka. The complex is the largest in North Sumatra. All three temples of Bahal were constructed of red bricks, while the sculptures were constructed of sand stones. Each temple are surrounded with a perimeter red brick wall about 1 meter thick and 1 meter tall. A gate on the eastern wall provide entrance gateway into the temple; the gate is extended outward with 60 cm tall walls in both sides. The main temple of each complexes is located in the center. The architecture of this temple is similar to Jabung temple located in Probolinggo, East Java. Despite its rich archaeological value, unlike the popular temples of Java, the Padang Lawas temples are mostly neglected and in the state of ruins, partly due to its isolated location. There are some attempts to promote the temples as a tourism attraction, however because of its remote location and poor infrastructure, promotion and tourism activity is limited.

It is much less common than in neighbouring Thailand. Soliciting for prostitution takes place mainly in the city's bars and clubs, although street prostitution also takes place. The visibility of prostitution in Laos belies the practice's illegality. UNAIDS estimates there to be 13,400 prostitutes in the country. Most prostitutes in Laos are from poor rural Laotian families and the country's ethnic minorities. In addition to these, there are many prostitutes in Laos from China and Vietnam, while some Laotian women go to Thailand to work as sex workers. Laos has been identified as a source country for women and girls trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation in Thailand. Many female sex workers in Laos are at high risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and disease. They often have limited access to treatment and services due to cultural sensitivity regarding sexuality and pre-marital sex. History The establishment of the French Protectorate of Laos in 1893 resulted in the arrival of French civil servants who took \\"local wives\\" while posted in the country. Prostitution increased during the First Indochina War and the Vietnam War as a result of the presence of foreign troops in Laos. At this time prostitutes came from Thailand to work in the nightclubs and bars of the capital city Vientiane. During the 1960s and 1970s the country's involvement in the Vietnam War led to Vientiane becoming famous for its brothels and ping pong show bars. As early as the 1950s, prostitution was discouraged by the Lao government as a social evil. When the Lao People's Democratic Republic was established in 1975, prostitution was criminalised. Brothels were prohibited by law and disappeared from the country. Prostitutes were initially interned in rehabilitation camps called don nang (\\"women's island\\"), though this practice was later discontinued. In the 1990s, tourism and nightclubs returned to the country and with them prostitution became evident again. Causes Poverty in Laos is a cause of increased prostitution in the country, with the sex industry in neighbouring Thailand attracting sex workers from Laos. Research published in 2012 indicated that sex workers considered the profession to be \\"an easy and good source of income compared to other jobs\\". They also said that it had the advantage of being \\"suitable for a low-educated person because working in a bar does not require formal training or skills and is quickly learned.\\" Locations Brothels are prohibited by Lao law. Female sex workers in Laos are often employed as hostesses in places of entertainment, such as beer bars, \\"drinkshops\\", karaoke bars, nightclubs, guest houses and restaurants. They serve beer and snacks and provide conversation as well as selling sex. Pimps are sometimes used to find clients. Sexual services are provided in guest houses, hotels, or the client's room, which are usually attached to places of entertainment. Otherwise they tend to take place in remote areas. The country's Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in Bokeo Province has been called \\"a mecca of gambling, prostitution and illicit trade\\".  The Khmu  By 2011, changing socio-economic conditions in rural Laos had resulted in Laotian women from the Khmu ethnic minority becoming predominant at the lower end of the Laotian sex industry. The Khmu are a minority ethnic group that reside mostly in isolated and mountainous areas in the Upper Mekong region of Laos. They are the second largest ethnic group after the lowland Lao and make up more than 10 percent of the 6.2 million population. There are a significant number of Khmu women in northern Laos that are involved in the commercial sex industry. Many of these women voluntarily leave their villages due to the very poor living conditions there. The Khmu women mostly move to border areas around the upper Mekong where there is more infrastructure, including bars, restaurants, and casinos. In addition, \\"Chinese sex workers at both casinos and local commercial sex venues increasingly host itinerant laborers and gamblers. Meanwhile, as a nod to promised development assistance, Chinese casino managers promote 'ethnic tourism' by supporting beauty contests in neighboring villages\\".  Sexual health  Research conducted into female sex workers published in 2011 indicated that while 99 percent of them reported using condoms, 26 percent had had an abortion. Of those who had been pregnant in the last six months, 89.4 percent had had an abortion. Abortions in Laos are not only illegal, but also are generally performed in unsafe conditions by untrained practitioners. In 2016, only 42 percent of all births were attended by skilled health professionals. In 2004, infection rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea were 33 and 18 percent. The Lao government implemented a national strategic and action plan in 2005, aimed at expanding universal access to treatment, support, and care. The primary target groups included female sex workers, mobile populations, and drug users. However, the plan has not had much of an impact due to the quality of STI services being relatively limited in Laos. = Cultural issues = Access to information and treatment regarding AIDS/HIV/STIs remains limited in Laos due to a conservative culture and sensitivity towards sexuality. Many individuals reported a fear of going to health facilities for treatment due to social discrimination regarding pre- marital sex and \\"clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'\\". A general lack of knowledge exists in Laos regarding RTI/STIs. The main sources of information are radio and television. However, access to health information is difficult in rural areas. One study suggested that providers of contraceptive information and supplies are influenced by Lao norms, which disapprove of pre-marital sex, and stigmatize women who seek contraceptive services. =HIV/AIDS= In 2004, between 0.8 percent and 4.2 percent of female sex workers in Laos were estimated to be infected with HIV/AIDS. In 2015 the HIV prevalence for the total Laos population was 0.2 percent with 1096 new infections and 128 AIDS related deaths. In 2016, an estimated 4,900 women aged 15 and up were living with HIV. Sex trafficking Laos is a source and, to a lesser extent, a transit and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Lao trafficking victims, especially from the southern region of the country, are often migrants seeking opportunities abroad who then experience sexual exploitation in destination countries, most often Thailand, as well as Vietnam, Malaysia, China, Taiwan, and Japan. Some migrate with the assistance of brokers charging fees, while others move independently through Laos‚Äô 23 official border crossings using valid travel documents. Traffickers take advantage of this migration, and the steady movement of Lao population through the country's 50 unofficial and infrequently-monitored border crossings, to facilitate the trafficking of Lao individuals in neighboring countries. Traffickers in rural communities often lure acquaintances and relatives with false promises of legitimate work opportunities in neighboring countries, then subject them to sex trafficking. A large number of victims, particularly women and girls, are exploited in Thailand's commercial sex industry. Some number of women and girls from Laos are sold as brides in China and subjected to sex trafficking. Some local officials reportedly contributed to trafficking vulnerabilities by accepting payments to facilitate the immigration of girls to China. Laos is reportedly a transit country for some Vietnamese and Chinese women and girls who are subjected to sex trafficking in neighboring countries, particularly Thailand. Chinese women and girls are also subjected to sex trafficking within Laos. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Laos as a 'Tier 3' country.

In his book Indian Traffic, Parama Roy noted that the book differed from other biographies of Vivekananda in that it \\"[touched] upon the agonistic, conflictual nature of the guru-disciple relationship\\" and showed \\"reticence about his corporeality\\".

Because dieting is usually accompanied by reduced resting metabolic rate, obese persons may benefit from using 7-oxo-DHEA when dieting due to increased metabolic rate. 7-Keto-DHEA is not directly converted to testosterone or estrogen, and has thus been investigated as a potentially more useful relative of DHEA.

A widely quoted 2007 Ecojustice Canada report showed those large industrial facilities located within 25 km of Sarnia, Ontario, Canada emitted more than 131,000 tonnes of air pollution in 2005, a toxic load of more than 1,800 kilograms per resident. Particulate Matter Aamjiwnaang Resource Centre adjoining Dow Chemical in Chemical Valley, specifically INEOS Styrolution (formerly Nova) In January 2011, the Sarnia Observer noted \\"Sarnia had by far the highest levels of fine particulate matter recorded at any of the province's 40 monitoring stations, with significantly sootier air than Windsor, Hamilton, Kingston, and Chatham\\". In September 2011, the World Health Organization reported that \\"While Canada ranks third in the world when it comes to air quality, Sarnia was ranked the worst city in the country, with the most particulate matter per cubic metre of air.\\" Pamela Calvert's 2006 documentary on the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, The Beloved Community, details the startling revelation that the Aamjiwmnaang birth rate of males to females is 1 to 2, the lowest live male birth rate in Canada. In addition to the detrimental effect on birth rates among the First Nation peoples of the area, there is also correlation between Sarnia and cancer rates among men‚Äî34% higher overall cancer rate than the provincial average, a lung cancer rate that is 50% higher, a mesothelioma rate five times higher and an asbestosis rate nine times higher. On a positive note, however, the Observer also stated in the January 2011 article that, \\"despite having what has been described as the 'dirtiest air in the province,' Sarnia has reduced its nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide problems by 30% in the last three years\\" and \\"Environment Minister John Wilkinson said it's the first time in the report's 39-year history pollutants have not exceeded provincial monitoring standards. That translated into a record low of three smog advisories and five smog days in 2009.\\" Additionally, a Lambton County document indicates that in 2005, up to fifty-five percent of ground level ozone and fine particulate matter emissions come from neighboring US facilities. In fact, the 2005 study \\"Transboundary Air Pollution in Ontario\\" states that \\"Long-range transport and transboundary flow of air pollutants play a significant role in air quality considerations on a regional scale.\\" Imperial Oil Refinery Esso holding tanks which are part of the Imperial Oil Refinery Water Pollution Water pollution is a serious concern in Sarnia. A June 2003 Ryerson University study concluded that the main source of water pollution in the St. Clair River occurs at the Sarnia Water Pollution Control Centre (WPCC) due to chemical spills and ship emissions. The study goes on to say that \\"A significant reduction of the pollution to the St. Clair River will only be achieved by improving the quality of the Sarnia WPCC effluent.\\" In 2008, the city resolved to replace the aging sewer pumps that controlled the effluent. Minutes of a meeting between Mayor Mike Bradley and Sarnia City Council state \\"The cost of repairing the raw sewage pumps is a significant portion of purchasing a new unit. However based on the performance of the existing units over the past 8 years, City staff prefers to look at other manufacturers for replacing the existing Fairbanks-Morse pumps as they require their second rebuilding.\\" In 2010, though, the Water Distribution Report indicated that \\"no filter effluent turbidity exceeded the prescribed test result for adverse reporting...\\" Further, the Water Distribution Report concluded that \\"Note- No inorganic or organic parameters exceeded half the standard prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standards.\\" Plans for Pollution Improvement As a city, Sarnia is committed to the improvement of its pollution, both air and water. The following statements from City of Sarnia Website succinctly establish this position: \\"As part of the City's commitment to monitoring and improving the environment, the City Council has established a number of committees to advise Council as well as appointing City representatives to outside committees who have an interest in the environment and the preservation of habitats\\" and \\"The City of Sarnia has adopted a Smog Alert Response Plan in support of the Ontario Government's Air Quality Ontario initiative. The initiative is to provide better and more timely air quality information to the Ontario public. City staff are notified of smog alerts and implement the air quality improvement strategies outlined in the City's Smog Alert Plan.\\". In 2009, Sarnia had a record low three smog advisories and only five smog days. The County of Lambton reports that from 1995‚Äì2008, Sarnia experienced a high of thirteen smog advisories and forty-six smog days, both in 2005. Shale Gas Controversy Despite all Sarnia has done to improve its pollution, there are plans to bring shale gas into Chemical Valley by pipeline in mid-2013. This process is environmentally divisive because it necessitates hydraulic fracturing to extract the gas. Hydraulic fracturing involves injecting a liquid into rock, shale or otherwise, at very high pressure to extract fossil fuels such as the aforementioned shale gas. Environmentalists oppose hydraulic fracturing since it can damage water supplies and produce long lasting toxic deposits, either in the waste water produced, air particulates, or solid forms of the gels or chemicals mixed with the water as part of the process. Supporters tout the employment benefits to an already sagging Sarnia petrochemical industry. Business interests seem to have won the argument since the shale gas is expected to flow into Chemical Valley this year, notably to Nova Chemicals. Warning Sirens Due to the risk of hazardous materials incidents (chemical emergencies) occurring in the industrial corridor south of Sarnia, four sirens have been placed in Sarnia south of Wellington Street, three more on nearby the Aamjiwnaang First Nation reserve, three in Corunna, and one in Point Edward.CAER's Home Emergency Preparedness Guide In the event of an emergency requiring immediate action by the public, the sirens are sounded for a three-minute period, serving as an alert to the public to seek shelter indoors and to tune to a local radio station for updated instructions. These sirens are tested (and can be heard) every Monday at 12:30pm to ensure proper functioning. An emergency Command Centre located at the Sarnia Police Station can coordinate deployments of emergency responders during hazardous materials incidents.CAER Community Warning System References Category:Sarnia Category:Environment of Canada Category:Chemical industry Chemical industry in Sarnia ","title":"Environmental impact of the chemical industry in Sarnia"},{"id":"35448742","text":"Mulu was an online social network enabling users to share product recommendations and direct a percentage of the resulting revenue to themselves or a charity of their choosing.Goode, Lauren, \\"Meet Mulu\\", Wall Street Journal AllThingsD, 24 Jan 2012 Users can share their own recommendations or browse recommendations from other users, including celebrities.\\"Shop for a Cause\\", InStyle Magazine, 6 Feb, 2012 Purchases made based on mulu recommendations benefit either the user who made the recommendation or the charity of their choosing.

His manuscript collection, known as the McLagan Collection, comprises some 250 manuscripts of primarily Gaelic song and poetry collected in the second half of the eighteenth century. The collection includes works by many of the best-known 17th- and 18th-century Gaelic poets such as Iain Lom, M√†iri nighean Alasdair Ruaidh and Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair.  Life and career  McLagan was born in 1728 at the Ballechin estate near Strathtay, Perthshire. A son of Donald McClagon, a farmer, his birth (or baptism) is recorded in the parish of Moulin, Perthshire, on 8 September 1728. In 1750, he matriculated at the University of St Andrews in the 1750/51 session. It is not known what he studied or when he left, but he is subsequently recorded as being ordained in the Church of Scotland by the presbytery of Dunkeld on 6 February 1760. His first position as minister was at the chapel of ease in Amulree, Perthshire, between 1760-64. He left Perthshire in 1764 when he was appointed chaplain to the 42nd Regiment of Foot, the Black Watch, which had originally been raised at Aberfeldy, Perthshire. He succeeded Adam Ferguson, later professor of philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, in this post. He continued as chaplain with the regiment until 1788 during which time he served in the Isle of Man, Ireland and in the United States where the regiment was involved in the American War of Independence. The freedom of the city Glasgow was conferred on him 5 April 1776. He did not spend all of the time he was employed with the regiment in their company, as on 7 June 1784, he married Catherine Stuart, daughter of James Stuart, the minister of Killin who worked on the translation of the New Testament into Scottish Gaelic. She was half her husband's age in 1784, and they had a family of four sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, also James, was minister of Kinfauns, became professor of divinity at King's College, Aberdeen, and authored Spiritual Views of the Divine Government (1831). After leaving the Black Watch in 1788, he became minister of Blair Atholl and Strowan, Perthshire, and stayed there until his death. In the Statistical Accounts of Scotland of 1792, he authored the section covering the parish of Blair Atholl and Strowan in which he voiced warnings about the perceptible weakening of Gaelic in that area. McLagan died at Blair Atholl on 3 May 1805. Poetry He composed poetry in Scottish Gaelic. published in Gillies collection and MacPh√†rlain. Poetry Collection and the 'McLagan Manuscripts' The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes the manuscript collection amassed by McLagan as his \\"great achievement\\". The collection was donated to the University of Glasgow in 1910 and is now housed in the University of Glasgow Library Special Collections. The collection contains 250 manuscripts with some 630 separate items which were collected or transcribed by McLagan, mainly in Scottish Gaelic along with items in Middle Irish, English and Latin. They are largely anonymous and ascribed verse, with a small number of prose items, sourced from many areas of Highland Scotland and also from Ireland and the Isle of Man. John Mackechnie‚Äôs Catalogue of Gaelic Manuscripts (1973) notes that there are at least 47 different hands represented in the collection. In many instances these manuscripts contain the earliest, or the only, examples of particular poems or songs, and, in the view of Professor of Celtic Derick S. Thomson, they provide \\"a highly valuable source\\". McLagan began collecting the Ossianic ballads of Scottish Gaelic while still at school. McLagan's material was drawn partly from Perthshire sources, including some manuscripts which are older than 1750. He also used his contacts, both ministerial and military, to acquire versions of poems and songs from other parts of Gaelic Scotland, such as Argyll with its islands, Ross-shire, Inverness-shire, Skye and the outer isles, and districts in Aberdeenshire and elsewhere that were still Gaelic-speaking in his time. According to Derick S. Thomson, McLagan likely provided some material for John Gillies' Clan Feuds and Songs (1780), and he was closely involved with the same publisher's book of 1786, known generally as the Gillies Collection. His contemporaries in poetry and song collection included Jerome Stone, a teacher in Dunkeld, Donald MacNicol, Church of Scotland minister of Lismore, Joseph Macintyre from Glenorchy, Archibald MacArthur from Glenlyon, and John Stuart, Church of Scotland minister of Killin (his brother-in-law). =Ossianic Ballads= In October 1760, while McLagan was minister of Amulree, he was contacted by James Macpherson, the famous publisher of Fragments of Ancient Poetry collected in the Highlands of Scotland and subject of the Ossian controversy. The next year, Macpherson wrote to MacLagan twice to thank him for sending him on some poems. In 1800 McLagan recalled that he had given Macpherson ‚Äòabout thirteen poems‚Äô.

Prostitution has become a problem since the country gained independence from Indonesia, especially in the capital, Dili. There are estimated to be 1,688 sex workers in the country. Law enforcement is weak, but there are occasional clampdowns. Foreign sex workers are usually targeted, and are often deported. Public order laws are also used against prostitutes. Many of the local prostitutes have entered the sex trade due to poverty and lack of other employment. Foreign prostitutes, especially from Indonesia, China and the Philippines, enter the country on 90-day tourists visas. Sex trafficking and Child prostitution are problems in the country. UN peacekeeping force Prior to its departure in 2012, the UN peacekeeping force's UNPOL division assisted the police, including taking part in prostitution raids. However, despite a zero-tolerance policy towards UN personnel using prostitutes, the UN personnel were also a large client group of the prostitutes. It was alleged they frequented brothels, including those using trafficked women. UN vehicles were used to pick up street prostitutes. There were also allegations that a ship chartered by the UN was being used to traffic children for prostitution in the country. Sex trafficking East Timor is a source and destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Timorese women, girls, and occasionally young men and boys from rural areas are led to the capital with the promise of better employment or education prospects and are subjected to sex trafficking; there are reports of official complicity in these practices. Foreign women, including those from Cambodia, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, are vulnerable to sex trafficking in East Timor. Transnational traffickers may be members of Indonesian or Chinese organised crime syndicates, and they appear to rotate foreign victims of sex trafficking in and out of the country for the length of a 90-day tourist visa in order to avoid raising suspicions or calling attention to the crime through visa overstay violations. Police accept bribes from establishments involved in trafficking or from traffickers attempting to cross borders illegally, and in prior years have been identified as clients of commercial sex venues investigated for suspected trafficking. According to immigration officials, police, and media sources, foreign women in prostitution, many of whom were possible victims of sex trafficking, were sometimes detained en masse during law enforcement raids and then deported without proper screening, or as a result of arresting officers‚Äô inability to derive pertinent information from the women due to their having been coached to provide identical accounts. For this reason, PNTL officers claimed they were not able to obtain sufficient evidence to prosecute the owners of a karaoke bar who may have subjected 67 foreign women to sex trafficking during the reporting period. The PNTL reported karaoke bar owners confiscated the passports of foreign workers and only surrendered them if the police ordered the foreign workers‚Äô deportation. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks East Timor as a 'Tier 2' country.

Crosses are often worn as an indication of commitment to the Christian faith, and are received as gifts for rites such as baptism and confirmation. Communicants of the Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox Churches are expected to wear baptismal cross necklaces at all times. In addition, many Christians believe that the wearing of a cross offers the wearer protection from evil. Some individuals, including Christians and non-Christians, may also wear cross necklaces as a fashion accessory. \\"In the first centuries of the Christian era, the cross was a clandestine symbol used by the persecuted adherents of the new religion.\\"Metropolitan Jewelry, (Sophie McConnell, ed.), Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1991, p. 66 Many Christian bishops of various denominations, such as the Orthodox Church, wear a pectoral cross as a sign of their order. Most adherents of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church will wear a cross attached to either a chain or a mat√§b, a silk cord. The mat√§b is tied about the neck at the time of baptism, and the recipient is expected to wear the mat√§b at all times. Women will often affix a cross or other pendant to the mat√§b, but this is not considered essential. In some nations, such as the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, an atheist state, the wearing of cross necklaces was historically banned. In two highly publicised British cases, nurse Shirley Chaplin and British Airways flight attendant Nadia Eweida were disciplined for wearing cross necklaces at work, in breach of their employment terms. Both took their cases to the European Court of Human Rights; Chaplin's case was dismissed, while Eweida was awarded damages on the grounds that the UK government had failed to weigh her right to religious expression heavily enough. In light of such cases, in 2012 the former Archbishop of Canterbury of the Anglican Communion, Lord Carey, and then head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, have urged all Christians to wear cross necklaces regularly.

The band played at various venues, including the Studio Club, with a repertoire that consisted of material taken from the British Invasion and R&B; standards. Over time the band began experimenting with early elements of psychedelic music and are often cited as one of the first groups to play in such a style. Kenny and the Kasuals released several singles including their best-known song, \\"Journey to Tyme\\". A live album, Impact, was also recorded in 1966.  History  Encouraged by his father, a former big band leader in the 1930s, Kenny Daniel (rhythm guitar, backing vocals) formed the first line-up of Kenny and the Kasuals in 1964 with high school classmate Tommy Nichols (lead guitar, lead vocals) who began jamming with Daniel at his home. Known early on as the Ilusions Combo, the duo was joined by neighborhood friends Blaine Young (drums) and Charles Beverly (bass guitar) to perform for small- time local events. Daniel and Nichols, however, were forced to restructure the line-up later in the same year after Young joined the Marines. While serving contracted Leukemia and died at 19 years of age, and Beverley expressed no desire to tour with the band. Taking over as frontman, Daniel put together another variation of the group, this time with the name Kenny Daniel's Combo, with guitarist Jerry Smith and bassist Lee Lightfoot, former members of rival band the Vibrations, as well as David ‚ÄúBird‚Äù Blachley (drums) and Paul Roach (keyboards). Daniel and Smith knew Dallas businessman Rick Norwood, leading to frequent gigs at his hotel club and an opportunity for the band to hone their skills as musicians. Soon after, Mark Lee introduced himself to the group at another nearby club with an offer to take on management duties for them. Not much older than the band members, Lee nonetheless sensed potential in Kenny Daniel's Combo and saw an opportunity to cash in on the craze caused by the Beatles. He renamed the group Kenny and the Kasuals and dropped Nichols, making Daniel the face of the band. Lee methodically promoted the band to the public; \\"He researched the Beatles and tried to do the same thing with us\\", Daniel recalled, \\"He dressed us up in white satin pants and introduced us to Highland Park media. We bought all new Vox equipment, because that‚Äôs what the Beatles used\\". Neatly dressed in matching suits and ties to emulate the Fab Four, Kenny and the Kasuals began to appear at more high-profile venues in Dallas such as the Three Thieves and the Studio Club, but also embarked on a tour in Oklahoma and Louisiana in 1965. The band had several residencies at the Studio Club, a newer venue popular in Dallas's teen scene, and opened for nationally successful acts. Sonny and Cher, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, and the Buckinghams among others, shared the bill with Kenny and the Kasuals. In addition, the band became a favorite on Sump N' Else, a regional version of the American Bandstand television show hosted by Ron Chapman. All the while, the group continued to rehearse their material until they felt competent enough to enter the recording studio for the first time. The band recorded and released their debut single \\"Nothin' Better to Do\\" late in 1965 for Lee's own label, Mark Records; \\"Don't Let Your Baby Go\\" and \\"It's All Right\\" followed. Based on their self-penned releases, music historian Richie Unterberger described the group as \\"too accomplished to be called a garage band in the usual sense of the term\\". In 1966, Kenny and the Kasuals decided to record a live album at the Studio Club ‚Äì in actuality, not entirely live, by the band's own admission it was recorded mostly at Robin Hood's Studio in Tyler, Texas with crowd noises from the club added in. The results were released as The Impact Sounds of Kenny and the Kasuals Recorded Live at the Studio Club on a limited 500-copy pressing. Known by collectors simply as Impact, an original version of the album was described by Rolling Stone magazine as \\"one of the most collectible American albums\\" ever distributed. The same year, Smith and Lee co-wrote the song \\"Journey to Tyme\\" when the band was afforded additional time in the studio. Around the same time, Lightfoot, who was recently introduced to the Who's music, shared his enthusiasm with the band by purchasing a fuzz tone pedal for use in the recording of the new song. He relied heavily on distorting the sound of his bass on \\"Journey to Tyme\\"; coupled with its existentialist concept, the song is considered one of the earliest ‚Äì if not the first ‚Äì songs to incorporate elements of psychedelic music. Local deejay Jimmy Rabbit, in the studio during recording, was impressed by \\"Journey to Tyme\\" and played an acetate of the song at his radio station. United Artists negotiated a deal with Kenny and the Kasuals to distribute the song nationally; it became a Top 10 hit in Dallas and the Northeast not long after. Encouraged by their success, the band relocated to Greenwich Village in New York City in 1967. There, Kenny and the Kasuals began receiving concert offers while United Artists presented the group with an enormous opportunity: Kenny and the Kasuals would share the bill with the Beatles at Shea Stadium. The band was listed to appear; however, in a last- minute decision, United Artists banned the group when Lee refused to give the label exclusive publishing rights. Kenny and the Kasuals released one final single, \\"See-Saw Ride\\", but disbanded in mid-1967 after Daniel was drafted. Before Daniel was deployed to Germany, the band reunited for a final show called \\"The Flower Fair\\" in April 1968, which was received positively by the audience. In the late 1970s, Daniel reformed Kenny and the Kasuals, abandoning the psychedelic sound that characterized the early incarnation of the band in favor of a punk rock-oriented act. The Impact album was heavily bootlegged across Europe, leading to an official reissue of the recording in 1977. The new band took advantage of the revival of their music by touring as openers for such acts as Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, and The Boomtown Rats. . In the 1980s, original members began to leave Kenny and the Kasuals but Daniel formed another variation of the group that performed well into the 2010s.. Cover versions of \\"Journey to Tyme\\" were released by garage rock revival band the Fuzztones on their debut studio album Lysergic Emanations in 1985, as well as by the Time Beings on their 2007 CD entitled \\"Journey to Tyme with The Time Beings\\" on dino Records..

P. homomalla contains the bioactive lipid prostaglandin A2 15-acetate methyl ester at about 3% of total wet weight. Description P. homomalla forms a bushy or candelabra-like colony of upright branches. It has a tendency to branch in a single plane with a few dichotomous forks, but mostly bears lateral branches. It grows to a height of about and has two forms; P. h. forma kuekenthali is taller and slimmer, with narrow terminal branches, and P. h. forma homomalla is shorter with more robust terminal branches. The central stalk and branches are black or dark brown, and the polyps are cream-coloured, yellow, or pale brown. The calyces from which the polyps protrude are typically not projecting, but may be slightly raised above the surface of the coral.Bayer, 1961. Shallow water Octocorallia of the West Indian Region.

Plexaura homomalla (Esper 1792) Coralpedia. Coventry, England: University of Warwick. Retrieved 2012-04-10. Distribution P. homomalla is found growing on reefs in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, and Florida. It grows at depths down to about with P. h.forma homomalla being more abundant in shallow waters and P. h.forma kuekenthali occurring mostly at greater depths. Ecology P. homomalla contains a high level of the lipid prostaglandin A. This physiologically active substance is a million times more abundant in its tissues than in those of most other animals. The function of this large amount of prostaglandin in the coral is unknown. Its function in mammals is to act as a muscle relaxant. It is used to induce labour and it causes nausea and vomiting. P. homomalla contains 2 to 3% by weight of prostaglandin and was used as a source for the drug until methods for its synthesis became available in the 1970s. Killifish, family Cyprinodontidae, and yellowhead wrasse (Halichoeres garnoti) vomit after being fed gelatine pellets containing prostaglandin. In feeding trials, the fish quickly learned to avoid these pellets while accepting control pellets. The prostaglandin produced by the coral seems to offer a chemical defence and act as a deterrent to predatory fishes.

The club is mostly renowned as one of the most successful teams in the early football era of Italy, with seven national titles (all won between 1908 and 1922). They currently play in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football. History =Early league successes and decline= The origins of football in Vercelli go back to 1892 when it was founded as Societ√† Ginnastica Pro Vercelli (Pro Vercelli Gymnastics Society), and 1903 with its Football Division. The first official match for the football division of S.G. Pro Vercelli took place on 3 August 1903 against the Forza e Costanza. The club won seven Italian Football Championships from 1908 to 1922: 1908, 1909, 1910‚Äì11, 1911‚Äì12, 1912‚Äì13, 1920‚Äì21, and 1921‚Äì22. The introduction of professionalism in Italian football, and the rise of teams from larger industrial and business cities such as Milan and Turin, led Pro Vercelli to a slow but continuous decline. They played Serie A for their last time to date in 1934‚Äì35, and went ultimately relegated also from the 1947‚Äì48 Serie B, starting a long period out of the two top divisions of Italian football, even being relegated to Italy's amateur league, Serie D, in multiple times. They regained professional status for good after winning promotion and the Scudetto Dilettanti in the season 1993‚Äì94. =Bankruptcy and the new Pro Vercelli= In the early 2000s, Pro Vercelli also had to challenge crosstown rivalry from a new team, A.S. Pro Belvedere Vercelli (with the colors yellow and green), founded in the summer of 2006 as a merger between A.S. Trino Calcio (based in Trino, Piedmont), who played in Serie D and minor league team P.G.S. Pro Belvedere, founded in 1912. In the 2006‚Äì07 Serie D, the team finished 9th in Girone A. A year later, in the Serie D 2007‚Äì08 season, the team finished 3rd in the same division, qualifying for the Serie D play-offs. It won its way to the group stage of the tournament, but failed qualify as one of the top 5 teams of the play-offs, all of which were later promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. In the 2008‚Äì09 Serie D, Pro Belvedere finished first in Girone B, winning direct promotion to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. Their debut season into professional football also featured, for the first time in the club's history, a crosstown derby with Pro Vercelli, but was not particularly successful, with the team lying in second- last place for most of the time in the 2009‚Äì10 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, and promotion winning coach Luca Prina being replaced by the more experienced Gianfranco Motta. Pro Belvedere were relegated after only one season but re- admitted to fill a number of vacancies in the league; at the same time, due to large debts, Pro Vercelli was not allowed to participate in the 2010‚Äì11 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione and so folded. In order to keep the old Pro Vercelli alive, Pro Belvedere changed its name to U.S. Vercelli Calcio and weeks later acquired honours and trademarks from the old Pro Vercelli, being thus allowed to switch its denomination to the current one, as well as to maintain the historical names and colors of the original team. In the season 2010‚Äì11 the team played in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione ranking 3rd and was eliminated from Pro Patria in the semifinal of the play-off, but on 4 August 2011 it was later admitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione to fill vacancies. =New successes: back to Serie B after 64 years= In the season 2011‚Äì12 of Lega Pro Prima Divisione the club was promoted to Serie B after 64 years, beating Carpi 3‚Äì1 in the final return of the play-off after the 0‚Äì0 of the first round. The club had a very unsuccessful return to Serie B, finishing 21st of 22 teams and with a goal difference ‚àí30, the worst in the league. Their placing in the league meant that they were relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione. In 2013‚Äì14 season, Girone A of Lega Pro 1, Pro Vercelli missed out on an immediate automatic promotion back to Serie B by a single point, finishing second in the league to Virtus Entella and eight points above third placed S√ºdtirol. Striker Ettore Marchi starred throughout the season, scoring 15 goals. In the promotion play- offs, Pro Vercelli eliminated FeralpiSal√≤, Savona and ultimately defeated S√ºdtirol in the final, thus returning to Serie B after only one season away. Pro Vercelli finished 16th in Serie B in the 2014‚Äì15 season and 17th in the 2015‚Äì16 season. They were again relegated to Serie C after the 2017-18 season. On July 11th 2019, former Italian international striker Alberto Gilardino took the job as head coach. The legend of the game hopes to take Pro Vercelli back to the top of Serie A.

According to the agreement signed with Turkey, the Islamic Army of the Caucasus, led by Nuru Pasha, closely participated in the forming Azerbaijan army. The Azerbaijani defense together with the Caucasian Islamic Army released Baku and nearby areas from the Bolshevik-Dashnak occupation on September 15, 1918. At that time, the Azerbaijani army had generals such as Huseyn khan Nakhchivanski, Ibrahim agha Usubov, Abdulhamid bey Gaytabashi, Kazim Gajar, Javad bay Shikhlinski, Habib bey Salimov. From its first days sub-units of the Azerbaijani Army fought against illegally formed armed forces of Armenia in hard battles throughout the all territory of the country. The Azerbaijani Army became a secure guarantee of independence of the Republic and its people, who made a choice to establish a democratic government. After regaining independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, a new national army was formed in the country. Legislative basis On October 9, 1991, the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan passed a law \\"On the Establishment of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan.

The parade is one of the biggest in the former Soviet Union. The guest of honor is the President of Azerbaijan in his constitutional role as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, and at around 10am as the massed bands of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan sounds a fanfare, he arrives at a special tribune at Government House, Baku, to receive the salute of the parade assembled led by the Minister of Defense, as well as of his report informing him of the readiness of the contingents assembled. At the stands are veterans, active duty personnel of the armed forces, and employees of the civil service.

As the band ends playing the anthem the President then delivers his holiday address to the people and the men and women of the armed services. Following the address, the parade commander (holding the billet of a lieutenant general) orders the parade to begin its march past in quick time in the following manner: ::Parade... weapons on shoulders! To the solemn march! With divisions! Distance by a single lineman! First division stand still, the rest... right.. turn! Look rightwards. Step by step.... march!

After a breakout season for the Brumbies in 2012, he was signed by the New South Wales Waratahs where he begun the 2013 season. 2013 was a standout year for Hooper who won many accolades including Brumbies best forward, Australian Rugby Union Rookie of year and was placed third for the John Eales medal after playing less than half of the polling games. In 2013, Hooper played every Waratahs Super Rugby game in the season and he won the Australian Super 15 player of the year award, as well as the Waratahs player of the year award. On 1 March 2014, Hooper was named captain for the Waratahs' clash with the Queensland Reds after team regular Dave Dennis was ruled out of the game due to injury following the Waratahs' first game of the 2014 season against the Western Force. He led the Waratahs to their 32-5 win over the Reds at ANZ Stadium. He went on to play all of the games remaining in the Waratahs' 2014 season including the Grand Final against the Crusaders which he was the captain for, leading the team to a 33-32 win at ANZ Stadium.

Related activities such as solicitation, living off the earnings of prostitution or procuring are prohibited. Punishment is up to 10 years imprisonment if minors or violence is involved. Sex trafficking, child prostitution and HIV are problems in the country. However, the country has recently introduced some government codes, and has also started enforcing existing codes, such as a child code protecting the rights of children throughout the country, in order to help combat some of these problems. Overview In 2014, it was estimated there were 10,284 sex workers in the country. A 2011 survey found 51% worked in bars and 26% in brothels. About half of the country's sex workers are in Lom√©. According to research published in 2015, between 2005 and 2015, prostitution in the country increased 180%, and that three quarters of the prostitutes are Togolese, and Ghanaian women 15%. It is not uncommon for prostitutes travel between Togo and neighbouring countries to find work. There are reports of brothels and prostitutes working in various parts of Lom√©, including D√©cor and Kodjoviakop√© (near Aflao across the Ghanaian border). The nationalities of the prostitutes include Togolese as well as Nigerians, Liberians, Ghanaians and Ivorian nationals. Many sex workers in the city have regular taxi drivers who run them around and wait while the woman is with a client. Hotel managers may also offer special rates if the sex worker brings clients there regularly. A number of university students are turning to prostitution for financial reasons. History =German colonial period= During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the country formed part of the protectorate of Togoland in the German Empire. Prostitution grew with German colonisation, initially along the coast (especially in Lom√©) and then spreading inland as colonisation advanced into the interior. In Lom√©, An√©ho and Atakpam√©, African prostitutes serving only European males were required to live in designated areas known as kasernierung. A brothel was built in Lom√© in 1909 to replace the kasernierung area. Initially it housed 40 prostitutes. =French colonial period= Following the defeat of Germany in World War I and subsequent French control of the country, prostitution continued to flourish. The large number of single, or married men away from home, colonists and troops created the demand for prostitution. As in other French colonies, military brothels (Bordel militaire de campagne) were set up around where troops were stationed.  Gender inequality  Experts convened by the United Nations found that typically \\"all the responsibility\\" of the problems that are faced in the sex industry are usually placed on women. In response to the issues noted by this committee, the government of Togo has declared that July 31 is Women's Day throughout the country. Additionally, this may have been what encouraged them to enact on some of their new policies, such as actively enforcing laws that protect children against the sex trade. This committee noted that sex was a two-person act and that the men who are typically the demand market for sex workers need to be examined too and held accountable for their actions. Sexual health HIV and syphilis are problems in the country. Sex workers and their clients are high risk groups, especially as condom use is inconsistent, although there are 11 different prevention programmes distributing condoms throughout the country. HIV prevalence has dropped amongst sex workers: 29.5% in 2005, 13.1% in 2011 and 11.7% in 2015. (National adult HIV prevalence was 2.1% in 2016.) However, prevalence rates vary across the country; although the average amongst sex workers was 13.1% in 2011, it ranged from 19.5% in Lom√© to 7.8% in the Savanes and Kara Regions. A study in 2008 noted that as many as 60% of long truck drivers in Togo that were having sexual relations with sex workers were not using a condom during sex. Additionally, around 50% of the truck drivers interviewed stated that they had not been tested for HIV, which is a concerning statistic considering the prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases in Togo. A study in 2011 found 2.2% of sex workers were infected with syphilis, and 2.3% of clients. This also varied by region with those in Lom√© having the highest rate of infection at 3.1%. Homosexual men, women, and couples do not receive the same access to the ability to be diagnosed and treated for a potential case of HIV/AIDS that heterosexual couples receive. Human rights concerns In the 2000s concerns were raised internationally about child prostitution in Togo. Togolese law explicitly prohibits the sexual exploitation of children and child prostitution, although it is not effectively enforced. NGO organizations such as UNICEF have intervened to try to get child prostitutes off the streets. There are also reports of women being trafficked for prostitution. Another issue in Togo is that the laws do not protect well against child trafficking, and these children are usually sold in to the sex industry. Togo does not enforce the law that prevents selling children into sex slavery, and there is also no statutory rape law in Togo. Since 2007 the Togolese government has done a better job of raising awareness for people in Togo about the issues of child sexual exploitation and child prostitution. They released a code in 2007 which protected the rights of children in certain areas of life, and this code led to the eventual release of hundreds of child sex workers throughout the country of Togo, after they improved their efforts to enforce this code. Once these children were rounded up, they were properly taken care of, and tested for a variety of medical issues, mostly of mostly sexual health aspects. Sex trafficking Togo is a source, transit and, to a lesser extent, destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. The western border of the Plateau region, which provides easy access to major roads leading to Lome, and Accra, Ghana, was a primary source for trafficking victims during the reporting period. Most Togolese victims are children exploited within the country. Traffickers bring children from rural areas to Lome, where they are exploited in child sex trafficking. Girls from Ghana are exploited in sex trafficking in Togo. From September to April, many Togolese adults and children migrate in search of economic opportunities to Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali, where many are subjected to sex trafficking. Togolese women have been fraudulently recruited for employment in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, the United States, and Europe, where they are subjected to forced prostitution. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Togo as a \\"Tier 2 Watch List\\" country. In 2005, in a raid in the capital city Lome, over 200 people were arrested in an operation designed to reduce child prostitution. The government had previously announced on the radio its commitment to address the issue. The government's minister for child protection, Agneley Christine Mensah, said that the children who had been arrested would be taken into care and helped \\"to acquire new trades and skills so that they can be integrated into normal social and economic life\\".

Scherzer has challenged the validity of 14 of these listings.Scherzer 2007, pp. 141‚Äì145. This is the second of two lists of all 661 Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients whose last name starts with \\"H\\". The recipients whose last name is in the range \\"Ha‚ÄìHm\\" are listed at List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (Ha‚ÄìHm).Fellgiebel 2000, pp. 208‚Äì228. The recipients are initially ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded. Background The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross. Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, based on the enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized. Recipients The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists for the Waffen-SS and for each of the three military branches, the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), and Luftwaffe (Air Force). Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade.Fellgiebel 2000, p. 112. Of the 224 awards made to servicemen whose last name is in the range \\"Hn‚ÄìHz\\", 24 were later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, three the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and one the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds; 16 presentations were made posthumously. Heer members, including the Volkssturm, received 155 of the medals; 7 went to the Kriegsmarine, 55 to the Luftwaffe, and 7 to the Waffen-SS. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Name ! scope=\\"col\\"  Service ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Role and unitFor an explanation of the various naming schemes used by the Luftwaffe, Heer, Kriegsmarine and Waffen-SS refer to nomenclature used by the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS. ! scope=\\"col\\"  Date of award ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Notes ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"  Image - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\"  ?

Balfas, was an Indonesian writer and literary critic. Biography Balfas was born in Krukut, Batavia (now Jakarta), Dutch East Indies, on 25 December 1922. He came from an ethnic Betawi family of Arab descent. Little is known about his early life, except that he graduated from a Dutch-run high school (MULO) in 1940. Balfas began his writing career in the 1940s. His first short stories were published in Asia Raja, the official newspaper of the Japanese occupation government, in 1943. He later began contributing poems, stories, and essays to the Indonesian-run magazine Pembaroean. During the Indonesian National Revolution, Balfas found employment as a reporter. He also headed the magazine Masyarakat. In 1952 Balfas released Dr. Tjipto Mangunkusumo, a biography of the resistance leader of the same name; it was published by Djambatan as part of series of biographies of revolutionary leaders. That same year he released Lingkaran-Lingkaran Retak (Cracked Circles), a collection of five short stories, led by \\"Anak Revolusi\\" (\\"Child of the Revolution\\"). In 1953, with Sudjati S.A., he established the magazine Kisah, which exclusively published short stories. He continued as one of the magazine's editors, with HB Jassin and Idrus, until it stopped printing in 1956. In 1956 Balfas published the children's story Suling Emas (The Golden Flute). The following year he wrote an adult-oriented radio drama, Tamu Malam (Nighttime Guest). In 1960 he published another children's story, Anak-Anak Kampung Jambu (Children of Jambu Village). In 1961, he helped Jassin establish the magazine Sastra; the following year he moved to Malaysia. From 1962 to 1967 Balfas worked at Voice of Malaysia. While living in Malaysia he published his only novel, Retak: Lahirnya Sebuah Mythe (Cracked: The Birth of a Myth); it was originally entitled Aku Bukan Nabi (I am Not a Prophet). In 1968, Balfas, dissatisfied with life in Malaysia, moved to Australia to teach at the University of Sydney. In 1975 he took a year's leave to research the history of Indonesian literature. Balfas died in Jakarta on 5 June 1975 after being hospitalised for a fit of asthma. He was buried in Karet Bivak Cemetery. He left behind an unfinished manuscript entitled Si Gomar; Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw describes the work as Balfas' most interesting. Themes Lingkaran-Lingkaran Retak dealt with underprivileged groups, while Retak dealt with humanism and sacrifices for one's ideology. For this, Teeuw classifies Balfas as part of the '45 Generation of Indonesian literature. Jassin wrote that \\"Anak Revolusi\\", which he considered to \\"create its own universe\\", showcased the basic ideology and world-view Balfas used in his other works.

In 2010, Asia Sentinel described Chen Xiwo as 'one of China's most outspoken voices on freedom of expression for writers.' Due to Chen's refusal to compromise about his often controversial writing, however, it was nearly 20 years before his books could be published in China. He now teaches comparative literature at Fuzhou Normal University, and has published seven major novels. After graduating from Fujian Normal University, Chen studied in Japan from 1989 to 1994. One recurring theme in Chen's fiction is sex, and perhaps his most famous work I Love My Mum (ÈÅÆËîΩ), uses incest as a metaphor for a dysfunctional society. Despite his early difficulties being published in China, Chen's writing has now received widespread recognition there. One of his major novels, Exile, won the eighth HuangChangXian Literature Prize. Other books, including Irritation, which has also been translated into French, helped gain Chen the fourth Fujian Flowers award for outstanding literary works.  One Man Against the Censors  In June 2007, the Fuzhou office of China Customs intercepted the galley proof of author Xiwo's book, which had been mailed to him by his Taiwanese publisher. The collection of Chen's works was quickly deemed 'prohibited' because it contained the banned novella I Love My Mum. Chen launched a legal case against China Customs, and an uproar exploded in the Chinese media at the absurdity of a writer having his own book confiscated. The scandal surrounding I Love My Mum in many ways epitomized a writing career characterized by a refusal to compromise.  I Love My Mum  This is the first English translation of one of Chen's most famous works. I Love My Mum caused an international sensation in 2007 when the author sued Chinese customs after they confiscated the Chinese version. I Love My Mum is a shocking tale of murder and incest narrated by a hardened crime squad detective who is used to the seamy side of life, but had never come across a murder case like the one in the story. In addition to a full and uncensored translation of I Love My Mum, the book includes a specially written afterword by Chen and an introduction to his life and work.

Danuta Zadworna- Fjellestad and film scholar Linda Williams put the production date of this film at 1923‚Äì1924. It is the first known pornographic film to use animated cartoons. Plot The opening scenes of The Virgin with the Hot Pants are animation. The first animation shows a cartoon penis and two testes pursuing a cartoon woman inside a room. After a while, as the woman is hanging from a chandelier, the penis penetrates her vagina. In the next animation, a cartoon mouse is shown putting its very large penis into the vagina of a cartoon cat. From this point, the film shows live action. Various sequences are shown depicting naked women engaged in a variety of acts such as dancing, kissing, and masturbating with a dildo, a male hand spreading out a woman's labia, a woman showing her vulva, a scene of cunnilingus, and a scene of insertion of a beer bottle inside a woman's vagina. In the last sequence, a man and a woman are shown stripping. The woman then sits over the penis of the seated man, and they have sex. Analysis Williams dubbed Virgin as \\"primitivism with a vengeance\\". According to her, the film exemplifies what she describes as \\"primitive depths of crude body show\\". She notes that the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction has labelled the film as a \\"potpourri\\". Williams classifies Virgin into a group of stags characterized by a lack of narrative. In this group of stags, according to her, scenes of dissimilar sexual acts are arranged into a single film reel. Lacking a narrative and a title character, Virgin is composed of close-ups of genitals.

There are many Manikeswari temples present in Western and Southern part of Odisha. Modern Manikeswari Temple in Bhawanipatna Manikeswari temple in Bhawanipatna of Kalahandi District is well recognized in Odiy. Manikeswari is also the primary deity associated with the royal family of Paralakhemundi in Gajapati District. Chhatar Jatra is one of the most popular festivals of Manikeswari at Bhawanipatna. Khandasadhaka is a festival associated with Manikeswari in Paralakhemundi. Brief history The deity of Chakrakotamandala comprising present days Kalahandi, Koraput and Bastar was Manikya debi or Manikeswari around 10th century A.D. Later on Kalahandi king Harichandra Deo struggled and died because of which his pregnant queen left for her father‚Äôs house in Gadapur, Phulbani. Some part of Phulbani was part of Mahakantara in ancient time and Chakrakota Mandala. Though capital of Chakrakotamandala is still being debated, it is clear that it has many similar with Kamala Mandala, another ancient name of Kalahandi, Manikya Devi came to Gadapur perhaps due to influence of Chakrakota Mandala. Later, the queen and her son, Ramchandra Deo returned with Manikya Debi or Manikeswari as per Kalahandi‚Äôs public request that time. Manikeswari was brought from Gadapur (Phulbani) around 1200 A.D. and it was located in Kalahandi. Manikeswari was also popularized by Suryabansi Gajapati in 15th-16th century in Puri region. Purushottama Deva Gajapati considered Manikeswari as consort of Lord Jagannath and made a shrine of Manikeswari at Chilika, now doesn‚Äôt exist. Manikeswari is royal family deity of Parlakhemundi. Manikeswari was installed in Bhawanipatna much later around 1849 AD during shifting of the capital from Junagarh. Some people also mention Manikeswari in Thumaul Rampur as Adipitha and Devi was brought to Bhawanipatna from there. Uditnarayan Deo laid the foundation of the present modern temple in Bhawanipatna and it was completed in 1947 by Brajamohan Deo. Manikeswari was associated with Kalahandi history as a goddess of wealth, Manik, since 10th century. There is some debate to relate Manikeswari with Stambeswari temple in Asurgarh-Narla around 5-6th century as well as Maningeeswari in Banapur in Puri. There are many Manikeswari worshiping locations in many place of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, especially in undivided districts of Koraput, Phulbani, Boudh, Bolangir, Sonepur, Ganjam, Gajapati, Angul, Dhenkanal, Keonjhar, Sundergarh, etc. due to influence by various rulers.

The majority of the population remains below the poverty line, a situation which provides fertile soil for the development of prostitution. In Mozambique, as in many poor countries, the government is responsible for monitoring sex workers, and data on the number of prostitutes in Mozambique is not available. UNAIDS estimate there to be 13,554 prostitutes in the country. History At the time of independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the poorest countries in the world. The position of residents worsened during the civil war years 1977‚Äì1992. The arrival of peacekeepers operating under the auspices of the UN resulted in an increase in the prostitution industry. In 1992, prostitution in Mozambique had reached such proportions that the post of mediator was created between the military on the one hand and pimps and prostitutes on the other. The problem of prostitution in Mozambique came under international discussion for the first time in the mid 1990s, when the deputy head of the UN mission Behrouz Sadri accused UN peacekeepers of buying sex from underage prostitutes. Statistics of child prostitution Research into child prostitution carried out in Maputo and published in 2001 indicated that 98% of child prostitutes were girls, 26% were aged 10-14 years, and 14.1% attended school. Of those not attending school, 69% had dropped out of school due to lack of funds, 12% had reached the second year of primary school, and 7.4% had attended high school. Sex trafficking Human trafficking in Mozambique is a significant problem. Mozambique is a source country for people trafficked for forced prostitution. Research in 2003 indicated that Mozambican girls and young women between the ages of 14 and 24 were typically being recruited. The main destination was South Africa, where they were put into sexual slavery and compelled to work in prostitution. It was estimated that around 1,000 women were being recruited, transported and exploited in this way each year. To a much lesser extent Mozambique is also itself a destination for human trafficking. Women and girls from Zimbabwe and Malawi who voluntarily migrate to Mozambique are manipulated by traffickers into forced prostitution. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Mozambique as a 'Tier 2' country.

The protagonist, Dutch geologist Alfred Issendorf, has a geology dissertation in preparation, and embarks on an expedition to Finnmark, northern Norway, to verify his dissertation director's theory that craters in the local landscape were formed by meteor impacts rather than by Ice Age glaciers. Initially he is accompanied by a group of three Norwegian students of geology, but soon after two travel their own course Alfred loses his guide Arne, who falls to his death, and is then on his own in a land where the sun never sets. Beyond Sleep is one of the canonical novels of the Dutch postwar period, and a prime example of what is perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of the author's work, the intense cohesion between theme and narrative strategy. Plot Alfred Issendorf, a geology student from Amsterdam, has received a grant to do field work in Finnmark, Norway, attempting to verify his professor's theory that meteors have impacted the area, leaving telltale craters. His professor, Sibbelee, has written the Norwegian professor Nummedal (his own former dissertation director) to ask for aerial photographs of the area, but when Issendorf meets Nummedal in Oslo the latter knows nothing of any photographs (and scoffs at the meteor theory); if they exist, he says, they may be at the Geological Survey in Trondheim, with a Professor Hvalbiff. In Trondheim, however, no Hvalbiff is present, and the unfinished office buildings are in disarray‚Äîquickly it turns out that no aerial photographs are here, and later Issendorf discovers that Hvalbiff (\\"whale meat\\") was probably a derogatory name for the director, Oftedahl. Without photographs, and now sleep-deprived because of his anxieties and the lack of darkness at night, Issendorf travels on to Troms√∏, and thence to Alta, in Finnmark. There, he meets up with Arne, an old geology acquaintance who is also there for fieldwork, and then with two more students, Qvigstad and Mikkelsen. With two tents, tinned meat, and boxes of knekkebr√∏d, the four set out for the interior, a rather bleak, uninhabited, and mosquito-infested area. One of their camps is under the mountain Vuorje, at a lake where they fish for trout. Issendorf, who does not get along with Qvigstad and Mikkelsen, sleeps poorly and spends much of his time in gloomy thoughts, feeling unable to measure up to his father and even to Arne, and wondering whether ancient resentment between Sibbelee, Oftedahl, and Nummedal is to blame for making his mission impossible. Issendorf's efforts at locating meteor impact craters are eminently unsuccessful. One morning he finds Qvigstad and Mikkelsen gone, and he continues to another location with Arne. After crossing a deep ravine, he differs with Arne on what direction to take and charges on without waiting for him, but soon discovers he had misread his beautiful new compass, which he promptly loses. By orienting himself toward Vuorje he is able to backtrack to the ravine, a journey of several days; as it turns out, Arne had set up camp there to wait for him, but then fallen to his death.  Characters  * Alfred Issendorf, Dutch Ph.D. candidate in geology. * Arne Jordahl, Norwegian geologist, Alfred's guide. * Qvigstadt, Norwegian geologist, joins the two before he leaves together with Mikkelsen. * Mikkelsen, Norwegian geologist, in possession of aerial photographs, principal companion of Qvigstadt. Minor characters. * √òrnulf Nummedal, Norwegian professor of geology at Oslo, very old and almost blind, unable to help Alfred access aerial photographs. * Oftedahl, Norwegian professor of geology at Trondheim, unable or unwilling to hand aerial photographs to Alfred. Themes According to Hermans scholar Frans A. Janssen, the novel can be read at three levels: as the report of a geological expedition, as a psychological story of a young man with the urge to supersede his father's achievement, and as a philosophical story in which the search for meteorites must be interpreted as a \\"holy grail quest\\", one that leads the protagonist to the insight that no understanding of the fundamental mystery of life is possible. With regard to the last level Janssen speaks of an \\"inverted Bildungsroman\\".Janssen (1985), 266 Hermans scholar G.F.H. Raat relates the narrative technique to the theory of the three stages in the history of mankind described some thirty pages into the book. In the first stage man does not know his mirror image. At this point he is fully subjective and has no self-image. Inaugurating the second stage is Narcissus's discovery of the mirror image. Now there exists an I registering a self, and these are symmetrical. The third stage begins with the invention of photography and this hands out the final blow of the truth, for a picture is an objective fixation of the image the outside world holds of a person.Raat (1989), 222 The image that man loves (his self-image or ideal image) and the circulating photographs of him (the different images of him that the outside world develops) are at odds with each other. The problematic nature of this third stage is a theme in many of the author's novels and stories, and essentially it is the problem of Osewoudt of the war novel The Darkroom of Damocles (1958), driven to despair by the discrepanties between his own view of himself and the images that others have of him. Unable to find acceptance for his view of himself, he loses his identity as well as his life. Similarly, Alfred fights for his identity, as he attempts to become symmetrical to his ideal self-image and next to find confirmation for this image from others. The implication is that he finds himself in the third stage, yet his view of himself is far from complete, which becomes evident when he looks in the little mirror in his compass. The image that is supposed to lead him on his way is incomplete, because the mirror is so small that even when held at arm's length it cannot project his full face. Only after his separation from Arne does he become symmetrical to his mirror image, as borne out by his own description of his baffled face in the mirror when he discovers he must have read the compass wrong. At this point, with his mouth open in shock, his face is perfectly in tune with how he feels. Here, says Raat, I and self are one. Apparently he has entered the second stage, because not long before this episode he discovered that his camera, which symbolizes the third stage, was no longer working.Raat (1989), 224 This regression goes even further when Alfred's compass, and the mirror in it, disappears in a crack in a rock of stone. Alfred now enters the subjectivity characteristic of the first stage, also indicated by his use of his native language for the first time in weeks. Appropriately, he has to live in primitive circumstances until he reaches inhabited territory again. Surviving like the first prehistoric people, he ponders and worries less than before and finds himself in harmony with nature for the first time. Eventually, as the circular structure of the novel suggests, Alfred will make it back to his point of departure. The discovery of Arne's dead body brings Alfred to a state of confusion in which he climbs and descends the very mountain ridge that caused Arne's fatal fall. Earlier in the novel, Alfred was looking up to Arne's easy, self-confident way of handling such obstacles in the terrain. Now Alfred is his equal.Raat (1989), 225-6 An ominous side to this identification is that Alfred will offer to Professor Nummedal to finish Arne's project, and by doing so he puts himself again in the position of a dependent.Raat (1989), 226 Style The writing style, with short phrases and paragraphs full of catchy oneliners, gives the impression of someone jotting down notes. The only correction to the inherently unreliable first-person point of view and prejudiced, limited perception of Alfred Issendorf lies in Arne's diary. In the difficult circumstances of the expedition, the narrator's focus is continuously on himself. During his quest for what he is and can be, he inspects himself almost without interruption. As the narrator recognizes, his geological research in fact comes down to soul- searching. According to scholar G.F.H Raat, this habit of incessant self- observing resembles looking in the mirror, and this fundamental disposition of Alfred finds its equivalent in the use of first-person present-tense narration. To narrate the events simultaneously with their unfolding, with a narrator focused on his own position, is remarkably analogous to the situation of someone who watches his own mirror image.Raat (1989), 221-222  Background  Two geographical expeditions, in 1960 to Sweden and in 1961 to Norway, undertaken by the author serve as the basis for the book. The 1960 visit entailed attending a geographical congress on glacial morphology.Van der Valk (2002), 28-9 Hermans started writing the book in 1962, during a period where he wrote exclusively first-person narratives, mostly in the present tense. This narrative technique intrigued him throughout the decade: his only other work of fiction from this decade is the 1967 short story-collection A Miracle Child or a Total Loss (Een wonderkind of een total loss), which consists of four first-person narratives, three of them in the present tense.  Publication history  The first edition was published in February 1966 by publisher De Bezige Bij in 19,400 paperback copies and 490 hardbound copies.Janssen en Van Stek (2005), edition JS 229 Revisions were introduced as soon as the second printing, issued in the same year. From the sixth printing (1969) on, the cover illustration was a photograph by the author himself of a big rock in an otherwise empty landscape, with a backpacker far in the background. Major revisions were introduced in the eleventh printing (1973), and the fifteenth printing (1979) introduced more than 250 revisions, in addition to another new cover photograph, again by the author, this time of a stream of water with stones and little rocks in it. Hereafter no more revisions were introduced. During the author's life the number of printings totalled twenty-five.Janssen en Van Stek (2005) Reception Some of the first reviewers criticized the construction of the novel, taking the death of Arne as its climax and considering the subsequent pages superfluous. Within a few years the book was widely accepted as a masterpiece. In 1967 the Jan Campert Foundation (Jan Campertstichting) awarded the author the Vijverberg Prize of 2,500 guilders for Beyond Sleep. In characteristic sarcastic fashion, Hermans wrote a letter requesting the jury \\"to be so good to donate this small sum to Food for India\\", adding: \\"I will write a novel about [the jury] entitled Good Night, Sleep Tight.\\"Cited in De Friese koerier, 11 March 1967. The Swedish translation of 1977 led literary critic Rolf Yrlid to wonder out loud when the Nobel Prize for Literature would go to the Netherlands. The German translation of 1982 led critic Joseph Quack to praise the abundance of \\"sparkling observations\\" and \\"a compelling story\\".Den Boef (1984), 81. The novel is a staple for generations of Dutch high school students, and is praised for its prose style as well, the opening sentence (\\"The porter is disabled.\\") hailed as one of the best opening sentences in Dutch literature. In a 2002 poll, members of the Society for Dutch Literature ranked Beyond Sleep ninth in the Dutch canon of literary works (Hermans's The Darkroom of Damocles ranked fifth), and third in the canon since 1900 (with Darkroom ranking second, after Gerard Reve's De Avonden). Reviewing the English translation Michel Faber wrote in The Guardian: \\"In the original Dutch, Hermans's prose is bracingly lucid and straightforward, justifying his reputation as a champion of unadorned style. Ina Rilke's translation is fluent and finds clever solutions to tough challenges (such as preserving the comic effect of conversations in which English is the foreign language), but overall the tone is more formal, more prim than it should be. ... Beyond Sleep is an engaging yarn once it hits its stride, intermittently thought-provoking, frequently funny, well worth investigating.\\" Film version In September 2013 NRC Handelsblad reported that the movie rights for an international, English-language production to be directed by Boudewijn Koole (Kauwboy) had been sold. On January 27, 2016 the English language film version, under the title Beyond Sleep, premiered at the Rotterdam Film Festival. The film was directed by Boudewijn Koole, with Reinout Scholten van Aschat in the lead. It received mixed reviews.

Robert Oppenheimer, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Carl Jung, Bulent Ecevit, Hermann Hesse, Heinrich Himmler, Nikola Tesla and others. The main source of the doctrine of Karma Yoga is obviously Bhagavad Gita. Famous reflections ;His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami PrabhupƒÅda, author of Bhagavad-Gita As It Is Our only purpose is to present this Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ As It Is in order to guide the conditioned student to the same purpose for which K·πõ·π£·πáa descends to this planet once in a day of BrahmƒÅ, or every 8,600,000,000 years. This purpose is stated in Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, and we have to accept it as it is; otherwise there is no point in trying to understand the Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ and its speaker, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa first spoke Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ to the sun-god some hundreds of millions of years ago. We have to accept this fact and thus understand the historical significance of Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, without misinterpretation, on the authority of K·πõ·π£·πáa. To interpret Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ without any reference to the will of K·πõ·π£·πáa is the greatest offense. In order to save oneself from this offense, one has to understand the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as He was directly understood by Arjuna, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa's first disciple. Such understanding of Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ is really profitable and authorized for the welfare of human society in fulfilling the mission of life. ;Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi The Bhagavad Gitas emphasis on selfless service was a prime source of inspiration for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi told-\\"When doubts haunt me, when disappointments stare me in the face, and I see not one ray of hope on the horizon, I turn to Bhagavad- Gita and find a verse to comfort me; and I immediately begin to smile in the midst of overwhelming sorrow. Those who meditate on the Gita will derive fresh joy and new meanings from it every day\\". ;Sri Aurobindo According to Sri Aurobindo, the \\"Bhagavad-Gita is a true scripture of the human race a living creation rather than a book, with a new message for every age and a new meaning for every civilization.\\" ;Swami Vivekananda Swami Vivekananda evinced much interest in Bhagavad Gita. It is said, Bhagavad Gita was one of his two most favourite books (another one was The Imitation of Christ). In 1888-1893 when Vivekananda was travelling all over India as a wandering monk, he kept only two books with him ‚Äî Gita and Imitation of Christ. ;Aldous Huxley Aldous Huxley, the English writer found Gita \\"the most systematic statement of spiritual evolution of endowing value to mankind.\\", He also felt, Gita is \\"one of the most clear and comprehensive summaries of perennial philosophy ever revealed; hence its enduring value is subject not only to India but to all of humanity.\\" ;Jawaharlal Nehru Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India found that \\"The Bhagavad Gita deals essentially with the spiritual foundation of human existence. It is a call of action to meet the obligations and duties of life; yet keeping in view the spiritual nature and grander purpose of the universe.\\" ;J. Robert Oppenheimer Trinity test of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, which lead Oppenheimer to recall verses from the Bhagavad Gita, notably being: \\"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds\\". J. Robert Oppenheimer, American physicist and director of the Manhattan Project, learned Sanskrit in 1933 and read the Bhagavad Gita in the original form, citing it later as one of the most influential books to shape his philosophy of life. Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion of the Trinity nuclear test, he thought of verses from the Bhagavad Gita (XI,12): Years later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time: ;Henry David Thoreau Henry David Thoreau wrote \\"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.\\" ;Hermann Graf Keyserling Hermann Graf Keyserling, German Philosopher regarded Bhagavad- Gita as \\"Perhaps the most beautiful work of the literature of the world.\\" ;Hermann Hesse Hermann Hesse felt that \\"the marvel of the Bhagavad-Gita is its truly beautiful revelation of life's wisdom which enables philosophy to blossom into religion.\\" ;Ralph Waldo Emerson Ralph Waldo Emerson said this about the Bhagavad Gita: \\"I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad-Gita. It was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent,the voice of an old intelligence which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.\\" ;Wilhelm von Humboldt Wilhelm von Humboldt pronounced the Gita as: \\"The most beautiful, perhaps the only true philosophical song existing in any known tongue ... perhaps the deepest and loftiest thing the world has to show.\\" ;Bulent Ecevit Turkish Ex prime minister Bulent Ecevit, when asked what had given him the courage to send Turkish troops to Cyprus . His answer was \\"He was fortified by the Bhagavad Gita which taught that if one were morally right, one need not hesitate to fight injustice\\". ;Lord Warren Hastings Lord Warren Hastings, the first governor general of British India wrote: \\"I hesitate not to pronounce the Gita a performance of great originality, of sublimity of conception, reasoning and diction almost unequalled; and a single exception, amongst all the known religions of mankind.\\"as cited in ;Sunita Williams Sunita Williams, an American astronaut who holds the record for longest single space flight by a woman carried a copy of Bhagavad Gita and Upanishads with her to space, said \\"Those are spiritual things to reflect upon yourself,life, world around you and see things other way, I thought it was quite appropriate\\" while talking about her time in space. ;Annie Besant \\"That the spiritual man need not be a recluse, that union with the divine Life may be achieved and maintained in the midst of worldly affairs, that the obstacles to that union lie not outside us but within us‚Äîsuch is the central lesson of the Bhagavad-Gƒ´tƒÅ.\\" - Annie Besant ;Rudolf Steiner \\"If we want to approach such a creation as sublime as the Bhagavad-gita with full understanding it is necessary for us to attune our souls to it. \\"- Rudolf SteinerFrom his Lectures: ;E.

Related activities such as soliciting, procuring, living off the earnings of prostitution or keeping a brothel are prohibited. Public Order laws are also used against prostitutes. There are recent laws against \\"consorting with female prostitutes\\". People caught paying for sex with children under 14 can face criminal penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment. This is strictly enforced against foreign tourists. As well as in the tourist areas, prostitution also occurs around the mining towns of the interior such as Ilakaka and Andilamena. It was estimated that there were 167,443 sex workers in the country in 2014. Sex workers report law enforcement is arbitrary and abusive. Extortion by the police is also reported. Prostitution first came to the island after colonisation by the French in the late 1800s. In modern times it is increasing due to an increase in tourism and the poverty suffered by most people in the county. Madagascar is a destination for sex tourism, including child sex tourism. Human trafficking and child prostitution are problems in the country. Sex tourism Madagascar has become a recognised destination for both adult and child sex tourism, particularly for French and Italian males. The main areas in the country for sex tourism are Antananarivo (the capital), Nosy Be, √éle Sainte-Marie, Mahajanga, Diego-Suarez and Toamasina. =Nosy Be= In the 1990s the government awarded a tuna fishing contract to the Japanese. The trawlers docked at Nosy Be, an island off the north coast of Madagascar. Prostitution grew up around this fishing industry, with prostitutes migrating to the island from all over the country. When tourism to Madagascar started, Nosy Be became a popular destination because of the established sex trade. Subsequently, most of the \\"all-inclusive\\" resorts have been built on the island. This is the premier location for Europeans, predominantly French, some of whom come to the country for sex tourism. It has been estimated that 70% of the island's female population work in prostitution, half of them underage. Child prostitution In addition to being a destination for child sex tourism, Malagasy men also use underage prostitutes. A study by UNICEF found that three quarters of the Malagasy men who use prostitutes go with underage girls. Child sex tourism has increased in the country since Mozambique tightened is laws in this area. Many families encourage their daughters to engage with white tourists for financial reasons. In some cases twelve and thirteen year olds are given French and Italian lessons in preparation for their work as prostitutes. Some girls in rural areas are sold as concubines, by their parents, to foreigners or wealthy cattle owners for a period of several years. Police corruption means there is little action against the users of underage girls. Several NGOs, such as the Collective for the Rights of the Child and Family (CDEF) and UNICEF, are working to improve the situation. Sexual health Although Madagascar has a low HIV prevalence for a Sub-Saharan African country (0.2% in 2016), it has of the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the world.\\"Health Profile: Madagascar\\" . USAID (February 2005). Sex worker organisations, such as Fikambanaina Vehivavy Miavotena Toamasina (FIVEMITO) and Femmes Interessee au Development de Antalaha (FIDA) (which is partially funded by the World Bank), have reached agreements with local governments to issue sex workers over the age of 18 identity cards. These identity cards allow access to free healthcare. In 2016, the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers was 5.5%. Sex trafficking Madagascar is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Malagasy children, mostly from rural and coastal regions, and from impoverished families in urban areas, are exploited in child sex trafficking. Most child sex trafficking occurs with the involvement and encouragement of family members; however, tourist operators, hotels, taxi drivers, massage centres, and local adults in prostitution also facilitate this crime. Some children are fraudulently recruited for work in Antananarivo as waitresses and masseuses before being exploited in child sex trafficking. Reports suggest child sexual exploitation is most prevalent in tourist destinations and surrounding formal and informal mining sites. NGOs previously reported government officials‚Äô complicity in obtaining falsified national identity cards facilitates the child sex trafficking in Madagascar. Previous reports indicated child sex trafficking of boys was becoming more prevalent. Child domestic labour continues to be a problem and informal employment agencies recruit child domestic workers who Malagasy men exploit as child sex trafficking victims, while most child sex tourists are French and Italian nationals, and to a lesser extent, other Westerners and Comorians. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Madagascar as a \\"Tier 2 Watch List\\" country.

The game is a redevelopment of one of Minter's first attempts at iOS programming, and is loosely based on Time Pilot. Although it does not explicitly announce itself to be a Minotaur Project game, the distinctive font and coloration of the text appearing throughout the game is that of the Commodore 64. The game's title is taken from the 5 A Day healthy eating program. Gameplay The player controls a spaceship which remains in the centre of the screen while the game environment scrolls around it. The ship fires continuously in the direction it is pointing, with its bullets remaining in the coordinate system of the screen rather than the environment. The objective is for the player to shoot down enemy ships without colliding with them. Certain enemy ships will be using tractor beams to tow fruit, vegetables, and occasionally minotaurs behind them. Destroying these enemies will free the carried item allowing the player's ship to collect it. Collected items form a chain behind the spaceship, and these items can deal damage to enemies they hit. If enemies carrying items are not destroyed in time, they will pull the carried items in, which causes them to turn green and gain extra attacking power. When a sufficient number of enemies are destroyed, a boss appears; a single enemy which fires a large number of bullets and is usually resistant to the ship's own bullets while being vulnerable to the trail of fruit. Once the boss is destroyed, the player moves on to the next stage. Each game level is represented as a \\"day\\" and is divided into five stages: Haytime (Breakfast, referring to the feeding of sheep), Crunchtime (Work, referring to the Crunch Time experienced by game programmers), Nicecupofteatime (Tea break), Currytime (Dinner), and Sheepenumerationtime (Night, a reference to Counting sheep). Provided at least one fruit is collected from each of the five stages on a day, a \\"5 a day bonus\\" of an extra life is awarded. If any stage is completed with no fruit collected, the extra life cannot be awarded for that day. This produces the message \\"Fruitless - you've lost your way to five a day!\\", a reference to a slogan frequently used by the 5 A Day healthy eating promotions.

Initially, authorities feared that the initial earthquake would cause a tsunami and warnings were issued across the Indian Ocean; however, these warnings were subsequently cancelled. These were unusually strong intraplate earthquakes and the largest strike-slip earthquake ever recorded. Tectonic setting The 2012 earthquake's epicenter was located within the Indo-Australian Plate, which is divided into two sub- or proto- plates: the Indian, and Australian. At their boundary, the Indian and Australian Plates converge at per year in a NNW‚ÄìSSE direction. This convergence is accommodated by a broad zone of diffuse deformation. As part of that intraplate deformation, north‚Äìsouth trending fracture zones have been reactivated from the Ninety East Ridge as far east as 97¬∞E. The Indo‚ÄìAustralian Plate was formed after the amalgamation of the Indian Plate and the Australian Plate some 45 million years ago. However, there is a relative movement between the Indian Plate and the Australian Plate. A process which would eventually split the Indo-Australian Plate in two probably started 8 to 10 million years ago and is still taking place. The 2012 Indian Ocean earthquake is associated to the reactivation of the NNE-striking sea floor fabric.\\"The 2012 Mw 8.6 Sumatra earthquake: Evidence of westward sequential seismic ruptures associated to the reactivation of a N‚ÄìS ocean fabric\\" by C. Satriano, E. Kiraly, P. Bernard, and J.-P. Vilotte Earthquake The magnitude 8.6 (Mw) earthquake occurred about southwest of Banda Aceh, Indonesia at 08:38 UTC on 11 April 2012. The earthquake occurred at a depth of , which is considered relatively shallow according to the scale used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The quake was originally reported as a magnitude 8.9, but was later downgraded to 8.6. It was felt as far away as Malaysia, the Maldives and in India. The earthquake was caused by a strike- slip motion. The earthquake and the largest aftershock had a fault displacement of . The strike-slip nature of the earthquake meant that the movement displaced relatively little seawater and was less likely to cause a tsunami. USGS ShakeMap for the M8.6 event Both the initial earthquake and the magnitude 8.2 aftershock were classified (based on their focal mechanisms) as strike-slip earthquakes, meaning that the crust on either side shifted against each other horizontally, rather than vertically. Since 2006 there have been three other earthquakes in the area with a similar faulting style. All these earthquakes were consistent with either left-lateral slip on SSW‚ÄìNNE orientated strike-slip faults, or right-lateral slip on WNW‚ÄìESE orientated strike-slip faults, both compatible with the direction of convergence. A back projection analysis of data collected by Hi-net, an observation network in Japan, found a complex pattern of four conjugate faults. There was a strong correlation between the fault rupture pattern and the distribution of the aftershocks. These earthquakes have a complex rupture process. The rupture of these earthquakes occurred on multiple, almost orthogonal faults. This is rare in a single earthquake. This earthquake had an overall relatively slow rupture speed, although the speed was above the S-wave velocity in some fault segments. The rupture may have affected the crust and the upper mantle according to the kinematic source inversion. The rupture was caused by ductile shear heating instability which is different from frictional failure and operates between , which corresponds to about the depths of . The serpentinization of oceanic lithosphere can lead to a low friction coefficient, but the reaction is possible only up to , which corresponds to the depth of about . A single dynamic weakening mechanism which can work over the whole range of slip of this earthquake is still to be identified. =Damage= Four people in their 60s and 70s in Banda Aceh, and a 39-year-old man in Lhokseumawe died from heart attacks or shock. Injuries were reported in Aceh Singkil, including a child who was critically injured by a falling tree.Jakarta BNPB The quake prompted people in Indonesia, Thailand and India to leave their homes and offices in fear of tsunamis. People headed for higher ground in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. In Aceh, where 31,000 people were killed in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, people were reported weeping. Some people used cars and motorcycles to reach higher ground. Patients were reportedly wheeled out of hospitals, some with drips attached to their arms. One hotel guest was slightly injured when he jumped out of his window to save himself. The earthquake was felt over a large area, including Indonesia, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, Singapore, and Vietnam.The Brief ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Tremors felt. Nepali Times. Retrieved on 13 April 2012. The quake was felt across the eastern coast of India including Chennai, Bangalore, Kochi, Bhubaneswar, Vizag and Kolkata. The Metro Rail services were suspended in Kolkata, and passengers were asked to leave stations. In peninsular Malaysia, shaking was felt in Penang and Kuala Lumpur. The tremor was felt in Colombo, Sri Lanka, where people in some high-rise buildings were evacuated. In China, the earthquake was felt in Tibet. However, it was not reported to be felt in places closer to the epicenter such as Yunnan and Guangxi.‰∏ìÂÆ∂Ë°®Á§∫ÔºöÂç∞Â∞ºÂú∞ÈúáÈÄ†ÊàêÊàëÂõΩË•øËóèÂú∞Âå∫ÊúâÈúáÊÑüÂ±ûÊ≠£Â∏∏ ‚Äì Êñ∞ÂçéÁ§æ‰ºö ‚Äì Êñ∞ÂçéÁΩë.

Many aftershocks with magnitude readings between 5.0 and 6.0 were recorded for several hours after the initial earthquake which hit the west coast of northern Sumatra. Since the initial magnitude 8.6 earthquake, there have been 111 aftershocks over magnitude 4.0 according to USGS, including a magnitude 6.2 on 15 April 2012. Tsunami warnings People evacuating high rise buildings on the streets in Kolkata, India, in front of the Cognizant building. Three hours after the initial quake it was still unclear whether a tsunami had been generated or if a tsunami had done any significant damage. A geophysicist from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) stated that a gauge closest to the epicenter recorded a wave peak of about . The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said that at 10:14 UTC that a tsunami was generated and may have already caused some coastal destruction. A seismologist from the British Geological Survey said that the \\"tearing earthquake\\" displaced relatively little water and was therefore unlikely to cause a significant tsunami. Indonesian authorities also issued a statement saying that the likelihood of a tsunami was low. Tsunami warnings were issued in the following countries: Indonesia, Australia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Pakistan, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Seychelles, Mozambique, Mauritius, Comoros, Madagascar, South Africa and the dependencies of Diego Garcia as part of the British Indian Ocean Territories, Crozet Islands, R√©union and Kerguelen Islands. Projected tsunami landfall times in GMT were: 8:38 for Indonesia, 11:38 for Sri Lanka, 14:38 for the Seychelles, 17:38 for Madagascar and 20:38 for South Africa. =India= After the earthquake, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) issued a high-level tsunami warning for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Authorities told civilians to move away from the coast and towards higher ground. Areas subject to warnings included Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Prabkhakar Rao of the disaster control room in Port Blair said that there could be tsunamis as high as at Port Blair and at Campbell Bay. In Kolkata, underground Metro Railways services were stopped and tall office buildings and shopping malls were evacuated. Navy warships were put on high alert. The Indian Air Force dispatched two C-130s and one Il-76 aircraft to the Andaman islands. Evacuation order issued by Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights in Sri Lanka =Sri Lanka= The Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights (Sri Lanka) authorised an evacuation order at 9:08 UTC advising people living near coastal regions to move to higher ground. The initial quake was not expected to affect Sri Lanka, but aftershocks were being monitored. Deputy Director M. D. Dayananda said that a tsunami could hit Trincomalee. As part of a risk mitigation measure, the Ceylon Electricity Board disconnected power supplies to coastal areas and railway control rooms. Coastal train services were suspended. The Road Development Authority removed toll charges from the Southern Sri Lanka Distributor to aid the evacuation. Coastal bus services were temporarily re-routed. =Thailand= Six Andaman coast provinces urged people to go to high ground and stay away from areas that could be affected. Phuket International Airport was closed. The alerts caused panic as people fled buildings and made for high ground. During the initial earthquake and for more than two hours after none of Thailand's free television stations reported the earthquake or tsunami warnings, preferring to continue a live broadcast of a royal family ceremony, despite the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC)'s urgent order directing the emergency information to be broadcast instead without delay. This caused criticism on the internet, although it was muted by a l√®se majest√© law. The Television Pool of Thailand defended their actions, saying that running texts about the warnings were displayed onscreen during the broadcast. Tsunami Small waves, within regular tide limits, were reported in the Campbell Bay area of Great Nicobar Island, and waves were reported in Thailand. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics said three small tsunamis struck the Aceh coast. The highest was , at Meulaboh. After the sea was seen receding about at Simeulue, a wave was observed. Simeulue is an island of fishing villages off the west coast of Sumatra.

It is the largest examination hall for imperial examination in ancient China. History Jiangnan Examination Hall (Jiangnan Gongyuan) was first built in the 4th year of the Xiaozong reign (Qiandao era) of the Southern Song (1168). Nanjing was made as capital in the Ming dynasty. Jiangnan Examination Hall was used as the examination hall for both the provincial level examination (juren) of Jiangsu Province as well as Anhui Province and metropolitan examination (jinshi). After the capital was moved to Beijing in the Yongle period, the formal capital became Nanjing Had. Jiangnan Examination Hall was heavily expanded with more than 20,000 buildings. In the early Qing dynasty, Nanjing was the capital of Jiangnan province, so the Examination Hall continued to use the name of Jiangnan Examination Hall. Examination In the Qing dynasty, the imperial examination included 112 subjects in all; there were, in total, 58 examinees from Jiangnan Province (includes Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai today) who passed the provincial imperial examination held in the Jiangnan Examination Hall and then became the Number One Scholar in the final imperial examination. And those 58 examinees of which 49 were from Jiangsu and 9 were from Anhui took up 51.78% of the total number of the Number One Scholar of the national level. Around the Examination Hall there are two enclosures surrounded with walls full of thorns. They were designed to avoid cheating, and called \\"Thorns Wall\\". Location and size East from Yao‚Äôs Lane, west to Gongyuan West Street, north near Qinhuai River and south to Jiankang Road, the Examination Hall used to cover an area of 300,000 sqm. It is one of the main architectural complexes in the Confucius Temple District. T‚Äôai-tsu also built a government-run brothel by the side of Qinhuai River, which faced the Examination Hall across the river. The brothel was once named as Old Court or Fule Court, which was built for the gifted scholars and the beautiful ladies. The district of Qinhuai River once prospered because of Examination Hall, Fule Court and Confucius Temple. Only a Siheyuan-type building is left now, which was used as a museum about that time. Inside, there is a picture of building models which shows the magnificence of Examination Hall during its flourishing age. The Examination Hall was listed among the third batch of Provincial Key Cultural Relics Protection Units in Jiangsu Province in 1982. In 2002, the ancient buildings of Jiangnan Examination Hall were classified into Gongyuan Inscriptions, and it was listed in the provincial units of cultural relics protection under the name of Jiangnan Examination Hall. Famous persons Famous persons in the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty such as Tang Bohu, Zheng Banqiao, Wu Jingzi, Shi Nai'an, Weng Tonghe, Li Hungchang and \\"Number One Scholar\\" Zhang Jiang in the late Qing dynasty all took the imperial examination here. History museum A history museum in Jiangnan Examination Hall, is located in the 1st Jinlin Road, Confucius Temple, Nanjing. It is the only professional museum that reflects the content of Chinese imperial civil examination system in China. The museum, open both day and night, is also a place of studying the imperial examination and an institution for collecting cultural relics and historical data about the imperial examination.

It is used when employing direct methods to solve a structure. Its formulation is the following: F_{hkl} = \\\\sum_{h'k'l'} F_{h'k'l'}F_{h-h',k-k',l-l'} which states how the structure factor for a beam can be calculated as the sum of the products of pairs of structure factors whose indices sum to the desired values of h,k,l. Since weak diffracted beams will contribute a little to the sum, this method can be a powerful way of finding the phase of related beams, if some of the initial phases are already known by other methods. In particular, for three such related beams in a centrosymmetric structure, the phases can only be 0 or \\\\pi and the Sayre equation reduces to the triplet relationship: S_{h} \\\\approx S_{h'} S_{h-h'} where the S indicates the sign of the structure factor (positive if the phase is 0 and negative if it is \\\\pi) and the \\\\approx sign indicates that there is a certain degree of probability that the relationship is true, which becomes higher the stronger the beams are.

It is closely associated with the nearby Hughenden Manor and the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Benjamin Disraeli who is buried in the churchyard. The church stands on land owned by the National Trust but the church and churchyard belong to the Church of England. History Disraeli's tomb According to early records, a church existed on this site in the 12th century, built by Geoffrey de Clinton between 1100 and 1135. Monks established a small priory here in the building which is today used as a parish hall, Church House. The church itself is mediaeval in origin and this original building now forms the chancel and north chapel of the present building. In 1848 Benjamin Disraeli purchased Hughenden Manor. The church was restored and extended between 1874 and 1890. Disraeli was British Prime Minister twice, in 1868 and 1874‚Äì80, and was made Earl of Beaconsfield in 1876. He died in 1881 and was buried in the family vault along with his wife Lady Beaconsfield (died 1872) which is located at the west wall of the church. Royal protocol did not permit Queen Victoria to attend the private funeral, but she visited the tomb a few days later to pay her respects. Architecture The exterior walls of St Michael and All Angels are of flint with stone dressings and the roofs are tiled. The rich Victorian decoration in the chancel The oldest part of the church is the chancel, which was formed from the original mediaeval body of the church. When the church extension work was carried out, the floor was covered with ceramic tiles designed by Edward William Godwin and the walls decorated with 1881 wall paintings in the Aesthetic Movement style by Heaton, Butler and Bayne that depict the Nativity, the Four Evangelists and the Prophets. A memorial to Disraeli was erected by Queen Victoria on the north side of the chancel following his death. It was the only memorial to be erected by a reigning monarch to one of her subjects in an English parish church. The inscription reads: The Banner and Insignia of the Order of the Garter hanging beside the memorial originate from St George‚Äôs Chapel, Windsor. Among the stained-glass windows are works by Thomas Willement and Clayton and Bell, including their 1881 East Window depicting Christ in Majesty which was installed as another memorial to Disraeli. The ornately carved marble and alabaster pulpit (c. 1891) is the work of Thomas Earp in the High Victorian style and features effigies of archangels in Gothic arches. The memorials in the church include three recumbent effigies of knights, one lying cross- legged; although apparently in the style of the 13th century, the effigies have been ascertained to date from the 16th century and are thought to have been sculpted as fabricated evidence of the pedigree of the Wellesbourne family as descendants of Simon de Montfort.

It runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction from U.S. Highway 425 (US 425) north of Bastrop through Beekman to the Arkansas state line. LA 142 traverses a rural and thickly wooded area in the northeastern portion of the state. The route connects Bastrop, the parish seat and largest city in Morehouse Parish, with Crossett, a city in Ashley County, Arkansas. While LA 142 heads northwest toward Crossett, US 425 travels in a slightly northeastern trajectory to the smaller city of Hamburg. Though the route performs a north‚Äìsouth function, signage for LA 142 does not carry directional banners. LA 142 is known locally as Crossett Road. Route description From the south, LA 142 begins at an intersection with US 425 near Chemin-A-Haut State Park north of Bastrop. It proceeds northwest for just under before curving slightly to the west and passing through a sparsely populated area along the Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi Railroad known as Beekman. LA 142 crosses the AL&M; line at grade then resumes a northwestern course. later, LA 142 intersects LA 543, which heads southwest through a point known as Vaughn. Shortly afterward, the highway curves more to the north and continues for before reaching the Arkansas state line. The route proceeds northward into Ashley County as Arkansas Highway 133 (AR 133) toward the city of Crossett. The route is classified as a rural minor arterial by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) with an average daily traffic volume in 2013 of 3,400 vehicles. LA 142 is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length with a posted speed limit of . History =Pre-1955 route numbering= In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 142 was designated as State Route C-1490. Like all state highways created after 1930, Route C-1490 was numbered by the state highway department rather than by an act of the state legislature and carried a \\"C-\\" prefix. The southern terminus was at that time a junction with State Route 204, which followed the modern route of US 425 between Bastrop and the Arkansas state line. Apart from the straightening of some curves in the vicinity of Beekman, Route C-1490 remained relatively unchanged until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. =Post-1955 route history= LA 142 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of State Route C-1490. The southern terminus of the route was now a junction with LA 139\\\\. In 1989, US 425 was created and replaced the LA 139 designation north of Bastrop. The route of LA 142 has seen only minor improvements since the 1955 renumbering. Most recently, LA 142 was slightly realigned at its southern terminus to intersect US 425 at a right angle. This was done in conjunction with a project completed in April 2012 that widened US 425 to four lanes between Bastrop and the Arkansas state line.

Vacancy  Sir Samuel Savery the sitting Conservative MP died aged 77 on 27 December 1938, creating a vacancy. He had been the MP since 1923.  Electoral history  The constituency was created in 1885, since when it had been won by Conservative candidates at every election since, with the exception of 1922 when the Liberal Party won the seat. That Liberal success was during a time when only two parties contested the seat, Conservative and Liberal. The first time the Labour Party ran a candidate was in 1929 when the Conservatives won on a minority of the vote. Then, as with every subsequent election, the Labour Party came third. It was Savery who re-gained the seat for the Conservatives in 1923. Over the course of 5 successive election victories Savoury would have had the opportunity of building a large personal vote.  Candidates  *The Conservatives selected 43-year-old Gurney Braithwaite to defend the seat. He had been MP for Sheffield Hillsborough from 1931 until his defeat in 1935. Braithwaite contested Rotherhithe without success in 1929. He came from a Quaker family and was educated at Downs School, Colwall and Bootham School, York. *On 10 January, the Liberal party re-adopted Aline Mackinnon.Hull Daily Mail, 11 January 1939 She had come second here at both the 1931 and 1935 general elections. She was a daughter of Sir Percy Mackinnon who was Chairman of Lloyd's.Hull Daily Mail, 14 January 1939 She was educated at Newnham College, Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh, where she graduated with a Master of Arts.The Lady's Who's who, 1938 *Thirty-nine-year-old Hull Alderman Joseph Leopold Schultz was also re-selected by the local Labour party having come third at both the 1931 and 1935 general elections. *A fourth candidate entered the contest, 48-year-old former Yorkshire cricketer, Lt-Col. Raleigh Chichester-Constable. He was a local farmer, Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant. He stood as an Independent, having been nominated by the Holderness Independent Political Discussion Group.Hull Daily Mail, 7 January 1939 He was quickly endorsed by the Holderness branch of the National Farmers Union.Hull Daily Mail, 10 January 1939 Leading Labour politician, Sir Stafford Cripps was campaigning for a Popular Front where the Labour and Liberal parties, together with other parties on the left, would unite behind a single candidate to better challenge the National Government. His campaign had some support among elements of the Labour and Liberal parties and the tactic had been successful in returning an Independent Progressive supported by both parties at the 1938 Bridgwater by-election. In Holderness, there was some hope that the Labour party would not run a candidate, giving Mackinnon a free run at the Tory. However, Schultz seemed intent on standing. The Liberals also tried to get the Labour party to agree to support a joint Independent Progressive candidate, with Mackinnon offering to withdraw. The Labour party would not agree.Hull Daily Mail, 21 January 1939 Campaign The presence of Chichester-Constable on the ballot paper was thought most likely to damage the Conservative candidate, particularly given his support among the farming community.Hull Daily Mail, 23 January 1939 The issue of Agriculture became one of the most important issues in the campaign. The National Farmers Union sent a questionnaire on farming policy to all four candidatesHull Daily Mail, 12 January 1939 so that they could provide feedback and voting guidance to their members. Miss Mackinnon said that the Liberal Party cared very much about the present sad condition of agriculture. Prosperity could only be restored by reducing the farmers' outgoings which had been made high by subsidies and tariffs.Hull Daily Mail, 24 January 1939 The Yorkshire Farmers Union held a Conference to which all four by-election candidates were invited. Only the Labour candidate, Leopold Schultz failed to attend. The Conference called for price insurance for farmers.Hull Daily Mail, 27 January 1939 Despite there being no 'Popular Front' candidate, the Liberal campaign was given a boost when the Popular Front victor of the recent Bridgwater by-election, Vernon Bartlett sent a letter of support to Miss Mackinnon. Bartlett said it was \\"clear that Europe is preparing for another dangerous crisis in the near future between the forces of democracy and Fascism\\".Hull Daily Mail, 31 January 1939 Mackinnon also had some public support from prominent Labour people who wished to see the Conservative candidate beaten.In the year of Munich by Roy Douglas The Chairman of Holderness Constituency Labour Party, Robert G. Newton, resigned and endorsed the Liberal candidate saying he would give support \\"for Miss Mackinnon, who I, as a Socialist, consider far more worthy of support than Alderman Schultz.\\".Hull Daily Mail, 31 January 1939 She also received a letter of support from leading Labour Party politician Sir Norman Angell.Hull Daily Mail, 3 February 1939 Right up until the close of nominations on 6 February the Liberals hoped that the Labour candidate could be persuaded to withdraw. While the Conservatives hoped that as with the 1939 East Norfolk by-election the 'farmers candidate' would withdraw. The January/February campaign was influenced greatly by the weather. Blizzards made campaigning difficult.Hull Daily Mail, 26 January 1939 Towards the end of the campaign, Chichester-Constable, the National Independent candidate, said that both the Liberal and Labour candidates had fought a clean campaign. However he criticised the Conservative campaign, \\"some of the misrepresentations by the other candidate had not been cricket.\\"Hull Daily Mail, 14 February 1939  Result  The Conservatives held the seat with a substantially reduced majority. The combined Liberal and Labour vote was far greater than the Conservative vote, suggesting that an Independent Progressive candidate would have won the seat; After the election, Schultz ceased being Labour's candidate,Report of the Annual Conference of the Labour Party, 1939 indicating that the party may have decided not to contest the seat at a 1939/40 general election, allowing Mackinnon a straight fight with Braithwaite.  Aftermath  Gurney Braithwaite saw active service with the RNVR before being re-elected in 1945. Deprived by the outbreak of war of another crack at Holderness, Aline Mackinnon retired from active politics.

From 1914 to 1925, Beaumont was a member of Derbyshire County Council. He began fighting Parliamentary seats at Aldershot in the 1924 general election, and Harrow in the 1929 general election. In the 1931 general election he was chosen for the winnable seat of Peckham where the sitting MP John Beckett had split from the Labour Party.

He had gained the seat from Labour at the 1931 general election before losing the seat back to Labour at the 1935 general election. * The Liberal Party already had a prospective parliamentary candidate in place before the vacancy occurred. They had selected Ernest E Dalton, who had contested Sheffield Park at the 1929 general election, but had not fought a parliamentary election since. He was a retired police officer who became the Business Manager of the Leeds Art Centre.The Times house of Commons, 1929 Dalton was a supporter of the Popular Front that was being advocated by leading Labour Party politician Sir Stafford Cripps. Cripps argued that the best way of rallying support against the National Government's Nazi appeasement policy was for the Labour and Liberal Parties to support joint candidates. To this end, Dalton said that he was prepared to withdraw his candidature for the by-election if the Labour Party candidate also withdrew, to support a Popular Front candidate standing as an Independent Progressive. Dalton even suggested a potential candidate, the author J. B. Priestley. Priestley had recently said that he would be prepared to seek election to Parliament as an Independent Progressive.Aberdeen Journal, 2 Feb 1939  Result   Aftermath  In the 1945 general election, References Category:1939 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1939 in England Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Leeds constituencies Category:Elections in Kirklees Category:1930s in Leeds Category:1930s in Yorkshire ","title":"1939 Batley and Morley by-election"},{"id":"35455140","text":"A parliamentary by-election was held on 30 March 1939 for the British House of Commons constituency of Kincardine and Western Aberdeenshire.

The Congolese penal code punishes pimping, running a bawdy house or brothel, the exploitation of debauchery or prostitution, as well as forced prostitution. Activities that incite minors or promote the prostitution of others have been criminalised. The government does little to enforce the law. During the colonial era and the years that followed independence, the Ministry of Health issued calling cards identifying professional sex workers and provided them with medical health checks. However, this system was abandoned in the 1980s. Public order laws are sometimes used against sex workers. Street prostitutes report harassment, violence and extortion from the police. UNAIDS estimated there are 2.9 million sex workers in the country. Food insecurity and extreme poverty are now the main reasons why women in the DRC become prostitutes. Traders make up the majority of clients, along with officials working for national and international NGOs. Many sex workers earn between $2 and $5 and payment is sometimes made in the form of food or other goods. Prostitutes working in bars and nightclubs receive between $10 and $20, and are known as \\"Londoners\\" as they dress like British girls on a Saturday night out. \\"VIP prostitution\\" operates from hotels, with sex workers earning between $50 and $100. Some Congolese prostitutes are from abroad or homeless children who have been accused of witchcraft. HIV The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) was one of the first African countries to recognize HIV, registering cases of HIV among hospital patients as early as 1983. UNAIDS reported in 2016 that there was an HIV prevalence of 5.7% amongst sex workers, compared with 0.7% amongst the general population. There is a reluctance to use condoms amongst the clients of sex workers, and will pay double the price for unprotected sex. M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res distribute condoms to sex workers and encourage their use. Child prostitution Child prostitution is a problem in the country but is generally ignored by the authorities. NGOs such as Association de Solidarit√© Internationale (ASI) and Reiper work to try and alleviate the problem. There is evidence of sexual abuse of children by soldiers during the Continental and Civil wars. Between 2004 and 2008 there were 140 recorded instances of Congolese, Indian and UN Peace Corps soldiers paying for sex with children, with local criminal ganga being implicated. Child prostitution in the country takes many forms: * \\"Shegues\\" - Boys and girls from 13 to 16 years old who have run away from home and survive from the proceeds of street prostitution. * \\"Kamuke\\" or \\"Petit Poussins\\" - Boys aged 10 to 17 years who take a passive role in sexual intercourse. * \\"Filles Londoniennes\\" - Girls from 10 to 15 who offer sexual services in urban areas * \\"Encadreurs Filles\\" - Girls offered to visiting dignitaries by the host as a sign of appreciation. This activity is becoming rarer. Sex trafficking The DRC is a source, destination, and transit country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls were forced to marry or serve as sex slaves for members of some armed groups. Some street children are suspected to be exploited in sex trafficking. An NGO reported some families send their children to Kinshasa, after being promised educational opportunities for the children; however, upon arrival, the children are subjected to sex trafficking. Some Congolese women and girls subjected to forced marriage are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Congolese women and children migrate to other countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, where some are exploited in sex trafficking. The 2006 sexual violence statute (Law 6/018) prohibits sexual slavery, sex trafficking, and child and forced prostitution and prescribes penalties ranging from five to 20 years imprisonment. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a Tier 3 country.

Originally the above-water part of the ridge of an underwater caldera, Nishinoshima was enlarged in 1974 after fresh eruptions created a new section of the island. Another eruption that began in November 2013 further enlarged the island and attracted worldwide attention. A volcanic cone soon formed, rising to an estimated height of 142 m (466 ft) by July 2016.https://www1.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/GIJUTSUKOKUSAI/kaiikiDB/kaiyo18-2.htm . Retrieved 20 December 2019. The eruptions ceased by November 2015, though emissions of volcanic gases continued for several months afterwards. As of 2016, the island was about in size and evinces the return of various plants and animal species. There were further eruptions in 2017, 2018, and 2019, with the latest eruption continuing as of July 2020. As of 14 August 2020, it is about and over in diameter.  Etymology  The island was named \\"Jena Island\\" when it was discovered by the Spanish ship Rosario in 1702. That was the island's name until 1904 when the Japanese term \\"Nishinoshima\\" (literally, \\"West Island\\") was made the official name. When a new island was formed in the 1973 eruption, that was called , but due to erosion and shifting sands, that island joined the main island and ceased to be considered a separate entity. During the early stages of the 2013 eruption, a new volcanic island was formed about southeast from the original Nishinoshima. The island was not given an official name but was mentioned in Japanese reports as \\"new island\\": or . Government officials said the island would be named \\"after it is stable and it is clear it will remain\\". As the island has now merged with Nishinoshima, \\"there is little possibility it will be named as a separate entity.\\"  Geology  =Morphology= Nishinoshima before 1973 Prior to 1974, Nishinoshima was a small, green island which had no eruptions in the past 10,000 years. The island was merely the tip of an undersea volcano some in height and wide at the base. Its main period of activity was from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. The volcano takes the form of a caldera, with the original Nishinoshima and some nearby rocks forming part of the northwest ridge of a caldera about in diameter. The island was originally about long and wide. A 1911 survey determined the caldera was at its deepest. The volcano has many large, submarine, satellite cones to the south, west, and northeast. The southern cone rises to within of the surface, around SSE of Nishinoshima. 1973‚Äì1974 Eruption Nishinoshima in 1978 aerial photo. The upper part of the bay is the old island, and the lower part is the new island formed by the 1973 eruption. Later, the bay was filled with sediment due to sedimentation, forming a trapezoidal coastline just before the eruption in 2013. On 30 May 1973, the crew of a passing ship noted that, at around 11:00, white smoke rose east of the island to around in the air every few minutes. An aerial inspection the next day said that the eruption was taking place east of the island. A whirlpool was also seen. Yellow-green sea water and floating pumice were seen north of the site. Another crew discovered that two black rocks were rising from the sea. In July, the eruption continued to erupt water fountains every few minutes with white smoke rising to 100 m above sea level. An aerial inspection on 14 September noted that a new island had formed above the submarine eruption site, the island formed a cinder cone around high and across. The new island had a diameter crater that frequently ejected cinders to a maximum height of . White smoke rose to a height around high. In November, a fissure eruption was noted on the new island with a chain of cinder cones running from southwest to northeast. The most recent cones were formed at the end of the chain, with the original cone being destroyed by the waves. The cones were erupting ash to a height of around . In December, the new island grew larger than \\"old\\" Nishinoshima. The island was long and wide; the new island had now developed a central crater that rose to a maximum height of . The cone was continuing to eject ash and cinders to a height of . A small craterlet on the new island was also emitting lava flows. By February 1974, the new island had developed two cinder cones at the western end of the new island, but only the eastern cinder cone was erupting. Observations on 11 January noted that the active eastern cinder cone was emitting a lava flow. In March, the new island was still erupting; by then, the island had five cinder cones; one cinder cone was erupting red hot lava. Lava flows were still erupting from the new island's flanks. On 1 March, the five cinder cones were quiet, but a large lava flow may have still been effusing from the island's flanks. After that, the eruption ended; wave movements then joined the new and old islands. 2013‚Äì2015 eruption In November 2013, an eruption created a new small island south-southeast off the shore of the original island. with pictures. By December 2013, the island rose above sea level, with an area of 56,000 square meters (13.8 acres). The island was considered large enough to maintain a presence above sea level for at least several years. By 20 December 2013, the island had grown fast enough that experts predicted that it would probably join up with Nishinoshima before the end of 2013 and cease to be a separate island. On 26 December 2013, the Japanese Coast Guard confirmed that the two islands had joined. The United States space agency, NASA, says two cones have formed around the main volcanic vents and stand more than above sea level.Volcanic islands merge in Pacific Ocean BBC, 8 April 2014 The newer portion of the island is now larger than the original Nishinoshima landmass. The merged island is slightly more than across. During July and August 2014, lava flow increased, causing the island to expand rapidly to the east. Between September and December, the lava flow increased further and headed north, almost completely overrunning the pre-existing island, leaving only a small portion of the old island exposed. On 27 December 2014, Japanese authorities said the island had reached nearly in size and is estimated to have risen to about above the sea level and that the volcano was still active. A pyroclastic cone formed around the vents which further rose the island to about 135 m (442 ft) by 23 February 2015. The eruption continued throughout the first half of 2015, and the island continued to expand. However, by August, the volcano ceased to erupt smoke and ash, but continued to emit lava. As of 16 September 2015, the total area of the island had decreased slightly, but the fumarolic zone had expanded as \\"vigorous volcanic activity continued without significant change\\". Eruptions resumed soon thereafter, but 17 November 2015, was the date of the last observed explosive eruption. Fumarolic activity continued, but decreased in amount as no new lava flows were observed. Decreases in temperatures were also recorded, and subsidence was observed near the summit of the volcano. In August 2016, the Japan Meteorological Agency announced that the alert level for the volcano had been lowered, and that the no-entry zone had been reduced from a radius of to a radius of . This would finally enable landings on the island. Water discoloration was still evident immediately offshore in August, indicating that volcanic activity, while in significant decline, was still present. On 14 February 2017, the Japan Meteorological Agency cancelled all alerts for the island, declaring that there was no indication of subsequent eruptions. In October 2016, a team of scientists visited Nishinoshima to conduct research on the island. Apart from documenting the island's ecology and geology, monitoring equipment was also installed for future volcanic activity. Wyss Yim, a retired professor of Earth Sciences, has theorised that the Nishinoshima eruption caused the North Pacific Blob, a mass of warm surficial water off the Pacific Coast of North America.Wyss Yim - Explanation for the north Pacific Blob. Imperial Engineer Autumn 2016, p. 15Wyss Yim - Geothermal heat: an episodic heat source in oceans. Imperial Engineer Spring 2017, p. 14-15.  2017 and 2018 eruptions  On 20 April 2017, the Japan Coast Guard confirmed explosive eruptions at the No. 7 crater at Nishinoshima and lava flows emerging from the base of volcano. Satellite imagery from 19 April also confirmed high temperatures on the island. Examination of the data revealed that the eruption likely began on 17 April. By 27 April, two lava flows had reached the sea, one on the west shore, the other on the south-west shore of the island. By 29 June, the flows had created two lobes, one extending 330 meters beyond the western shore, and other 310 to the south-west. The area of the island increased to . By July, surface temperatures began to decrease until they became indistinguishable from the surroundings in August; lava flows also stopped by the end of August. On 3 October, the Coordinating Committee for Prediction of Volcanic Eruptions of the Japan Meteorological Agency announced that Nishinoshima had likely ceased erupting. In June 2018, the JMA announced that the no-entry zone had been reduced from a radius of to a radius of . Within a month, however, the zone was returned to 1500m after small eruptions were spotted on 12 July 2018. These eruptions quickly subsided, and the no-entry zone was reduced to 500m on 31 October 2018.  2019-2020 eruption  On 6 December 2019, the Japan Coast Guard confirmed explosive activity in Nishinoshima has returned, with new lava flows entering the sea by the following day. The conditions were enough that the Meteorological Agency issued a warning to passing ships to stay clear of Nishinoshima. In January 2020, the Japan Coast Guard observations confirmed that lava was flowing out on the northeast coast. Further activity was observed on 4 February, and the northern extension of the island was expected. As of 25 June 2020, the explosive-effusive eruption was still continuing, with lava flows on the northeastern slope of the volcano, as well as ash plumes reaching 2600 meters (8500 feet). On 4 July, an ash plume reached 8300 meters (27200 ft) in height. On 14 August 2020, it reached a size of with a diameter over .  Ecology  Since the 2013 eruption, biologists have expressed great interest in how Nishinoshima would be colonized by plants and wildlife. It is expected that organic matter, mainly deposited by nesting birds in the form of feathers or excrement, would enrich the island surface for plants to grow. To prevent interference of the colonization process, researchers were also advised not to bring external species to Nishinoshima. In October 2016, a team of scientists visited Nishinoshima to examine its environment and geologic makeup for the first time up-close. Their studies have discovered that both plant and animal life continue to exist on the remaining part of the old Nishinoshima island that had not been covered by lava. An accompanying video crew from Nippon TV captured masked boobies laying eggs and a pod of dolphins (either Indo-Pacific, Tursiops aduncus, or common bottlenose, T. truncatus) swimming off the coast. Gannets, bramblings and earwigs were also discovered living on the island by researchers.

Early life Hayes was born in Abbeyfeale, Co. Limerick in 1902 and grew up in Claremorris, Co. Mayo. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College and Trinity College Dublin. Cryptologist It's not clear how Hayes, who joined the National Library with a degree in languages from Trinity College, Dublin (TCD) was identified by army intelligence as a codebreaker. Colonel Dan Bryan, head of Ireland's G2 intelligence service, made the initial approaches to the newly appointed director in 1940 when a cipher was found on the first German agent to be captured in Ireland, Wilhelm Preetz. Hayes made significant progress in breaking the code and in February 1941, at the behest of √âamon de Valera, he was given an office and three lieutenants to decode wireless messages being covertly transmitted from a house in north Dublin owned by the German legation. One of his staff was Kevin Boland, son of the then justice minister Gerald Boland. The operation was so secret that the younger Boland was instructed not to tell his father what he was doing. One of the most notorious German spies interned in Ireland during the war, G√ºnther Sch√ºtz, described him as \\"absolutely brilliant\\". As far as Sch√ºtz and the other German spies whose cells he entered during the Emergency knew, their quiet-spoken and polite interrogator was \\"Captain Grey\\", a mysterious military figure always accompanied by another intelligence officer. Only a handful of people in G2 military intelligence knew that \\"Captain Grey\\", one of the most important and prolific code-breakers of the second World War, was not a military man at all. Members of MI5 believed \\"his gifts amounted almost to genius\\" and described him as Ireland's \\"greatest unsung hero\\". The US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) characterised him as \\"a colossus of a man\\". It is only in recent years that the importance and extent of Hayes's work has become known. During the war his own family didn't know the nature of his role with military intelligence. His daughter Fairy, aged seven when the war broke out, only learnt recently that her father used her school exercise book to decode complex German ciphers. Even G√ºnther Sch√ºtz went to his grave in 1991 still believing that it was another man, Commandant de Butl√©ir, who was responsible for identifying his microdot codes ‚Äì the first cryptologist in the world to do so. Sch√ºtz and Goertz G√ºnther Sch√ºtz was dropped into Ireland on 12 March 1941 to make contact with IRA members sympathetic to the German cause and to transmit weather reports back to his handlers in Hamburg. Sch√ºtz readily gave up one of his codes to his Irish captors in the hope of diverting attention from his microdots, but a microscope in his luggage raised the suspicions of the authorities and his belongings were handed over to Hayes, who spotted Sch√ºtz's codes. In all, 30 pages of operating instructions as well as extensive lists of names and addresses of Nazi sympathisers in the Republic were secreted in random characters in newspaper cuttings that the German intelligence agent was carrying when he was picked up by garda√≠ in Wexford in 1941. Hayes studied two newspaper cuttings tucked into the spy's pocket book and in a testimonial letter affirming the curative qualities of Aspro, he identified messages, reduced in size 400 times, and secreted within three letter 'o's in the text. On an article about Oxford Pamphlets, he spotted a further four microdots, with three more in an ad for the Green Park Hotel. Within 10 days of Sch√ºtz's arrest, Hayes had found and translated the entire contents of his highly sensitive microdots. It would take the FBI a further four months to even identify that such a system of transmitting messages existed. \\"The Germans were so cocksure that the microdots couldn't be discovered that they didn't even encode them\\", Sch√ºtz said after the war. \\"They were to be a vital weapon in espionage. Finding them as the Irish intelligence officers did was an act of brilliance.\\" Hayes had some success decoding cable messages, but it was working on complex letter based ciphers that he demonstrated his brilliance as a code breaker. When Major Hermann Goertz, the most senior Nazi agent to be captured in Ireland, was arrested at the end of 1941, he was carrying a code later described by MI5 as \\"one of the best three or four in the war\\". A similar cipher had already baffled cryptologists at Bletchley Park, the headquarters of British code-breaking activity, but Hayes finally identified a system of decoding it based on a sequence of rotating keywords. The first of the Goertz messages to be successfully decoded was unlocked with the key 'Cathleen Ni Houlihan'. Informed of the breakthrough Hayes had made, Cecil Liddell of MI5 visited Dublin in 1943 and the two secret services continued to share intelligence information until the end of the war. Afterwards, Liddell said that there was a \\"whole series of ciphers that couldn't have been solved without Hayes's input\\". Hayes advocated the establishment of a permanent cryptology cell within the armed forces. In 1946, Hayes wrote to the government, advising that \\"it is to be hoped that the Irish army will never again face an emergency so ill-provided in this essential security device\\". Librarian Throughout his time with G2, Richard Hayes continued to visit his office at the National Library every day. He had joined the Library in 1923 and served as Director 1940‚Äì67. During his time in the Library he made an enormous contribution to Irish bibliography, editing the following publications: * Manuscript Sources for the History of Irish Civilisation. (1965) * Sources for the History of Irish Civilisation: Articles in Irish Periodicals. (1970) * with Brighid N√≠ Dhonnchadha, Cl√°r Litridheacht na Nua-Ghaedhilge. (1938) He also compiled the first major bilingual dictionary between Irish and a language other than English since the 1700s i.e. French When there was a danger that the Ormonde papers might be sold and leave the country, he prevailed on the government to introduce the Documents and Pictures(Regulation of Export)Act 1945. When he retired as director in 1967 he took over the helm at the Chester Beatty Library. RT√â has archived a television interview with Hayes about the Chester Beatty collection, on the occasion of the reopening of the Chester Beatty Library in 1975 at its then location on Shrewsbury Road. Hayes died in 1976, leaving behind a collection of papers and manuscripts that is now catalogued in the National Library.

Nerves in the wall of the renal artery are ablated by applying radiofrequency pulses or ultrasound to the renal arteries. This causes reduction of sympathetic afferent and efferent activity to the kidney and blood pressure can be decreased. Early data from international clinical trials without sham controls was promising - demonstrating large blood pressure reductions in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. However, in 2014 a prospective, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial failed to confirm a beneficial effect on blood pressure. A 2014 consensus statement from The Joint UK Societies did not recommend the use of renal denervation for treatment of resistant hypertension on current evidence.  History  Prior to pharmacological management of hypertension, surgical sympathectomy was a recognized treatment for hypertension. This was often successful in reducing blood pressure but due to its non-selective nature the side effects of the procedure were poorly tolerated. Side effects included orthostatic hypotension, palpitations, anhydrosis, intestinal disturbances, loss of ejaculation, thoracic duct injuries and atelectasis. Modern antihypertensive pharmacological interventions have improved the control of hypertension, but only 34-66% of people with hypertension in England, USA and Canada have blood pressure at or below target levels. Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above target (140/90mm Hg) despite concomitant use of 3 or more anti- hypertensives ‚Äì one of which should be a diuretic. It has been estimated that 8-10% of people with hypertension fall into this category. Devices Several commercial devices exist. These include Medtronic's Symplicity Renal Denervation System, St. Jude Medical‚Äôs EnligHTN‚Ñ¢ System, Boston Scientific's Vessix V2‚Ñ¢ Renal Denervation System, Covidien‚Äôs OneShot‚Ñ¢ System, Recor‚Äôs Paradise‚Ñ¢ System, Terumo's Iberis‚Ñ¢ System and Cordis Corporation's RENLANE‚Ñ¢ Renal Denervation System. Currently, no renal denervation device has FDA approval.  Procedure  The procedure involves endovascular access via the femoral artery with advancement of a catheter-mounted device into the renal artery. The device uses radiofrequency or ultrasound to ablate the renal nerves. Typically, numerous ablations are applied at a different longitudinal and rotational positions to ensure maximal denervation. The procedure does not involve a permanent implant.  Benefits  The most widely-discussed studies to date are the Symplicity HTN-1, HTN-2 and HTN-3 trials, conducted with Medtronic's Symplicity RDN System. Symplicity HTN-1 looked at outcomes in 153 patients that underwent catheter-based renal denervation. Three-year follow-up data have demonstrated an average blood pressure reduction of -33/-19mm Hg. Symplicity HTN-2 was a randomized, controlled trial that compared 54 control patients with 52 patients who underwent catheter-based renal denervation. Six month follow-up data demonstrated a blood pressure reduction of -32/12mm Hg in the treated group compared with a change of 1/0 mm Hg in the control group. Meta-analyses of renal denervation have yielded conflicting results. Whilst office systolic blood pressure reductions typically average around 30 mmHg, reductions observed on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are typically much smaller, around 10 mmHg. Explanations offered for this mismatch include renal denervation obliterating the white coat response, thereby disproportionately reducing clinic pressures, or inadvertent bias arising from the unblinded design and lack of sham control procedure in almost all renal denervation trial designs to date. The most recent study, Symplicity HTN-3, was a prospective, single-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial in which 535 patients with severe resistant hypertension were randomized to undergo renal denervation or a sham procedure (in a 2:1 ratio). The results showed no statistically significant difference between renal denervation and the sham procedure. Following the publication of Symplicity HTN-3 the Joint UK Societies produced a consensus statement that did not recommend the use of renal denervation for treatment of resistant hypertension in routine clinical practice. However they advocated further research with better designed randomised studies.  Risks  The Symplicity HTN-1, HTN-2 and HTN-3 trials have demonstrated acceptable safety profiles for catheter based renal denervation. Patients may experience pain during application of radiofrequency pulses and intraprocedural bradycardia requiring atropine has also been reported. Other documented procedure related complications include femoral artery pseudoaneurysm and renal artery dissection. Of particular concern is the theoretical risk of damage to renal arteries during delivery of radiofrequency energy. An animal study using swine showed no damage to the renal arteries at 6 month follow up. This finding is further supported in human studies in the HTN-1 and HTN-2 trial where follow up imaging has not demonstrated renal vascular damage.  Other indications  Other diseases may be associated with an overactive sympathetic drive and therefore, in theory, renal denervation could be of benefit. Congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), atrial fibrillation (AF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) all have been associated with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Current clinical trials are examining the effect of renal denervation in these conditions.

His work aims to convey scientific concepts in layman's terms to enable public debate. Many of his books look at aspects of what it is to be human, and how the technological implementation of scientific discoveries will affect us. His writings cover a wide range of areas including science, philosophy, theology and history, and much of his writing aims to show the history behind ideas as well as revealing their strengths and weaknesses. His business, ThinkWrite, provides a tested and structured method for writing complex or long documents clearly and successfully.  Biography  Pete Moore was born in Abingdon, Oxfordshire and lived in Retford, Nottinghamshire and Buntingford, Hertfordshire, before studying the 'Physiology and Biochemistry of Farm Animals' at the University of Reading. He stayed at Reading to pursue a PhD in fetal physiology, with a research project that aimed to work out the neural mechanisms that cause mammals to breathe once they are born. His Post- doctorate phase involved work at the University of Auckland and University College London. Since 1990 he has written for many broadsheet papers and journals including Nature, New Scientist, The Lancet, BMJ, The Guardian, Journal of Biology and Zest. He has won or been shortlisted for national awards for his work including a shortlisting for his work on The Wonder Project . He has acted as a rapporteur at private meetings held at St George's House, Windsor Castle and at the House of Lords. Media appearances include interviews on BBC radio and TV as well as many other international radio stations. He is a visiting lecturer on the University of the West of England's Science Communication masters course. In 2000 he established ThinkWrite, a training organisation dedicated to helping people reduce the time they spend writing clear and successful documents by informing their approach to structure. These workshops were initially delivered to the academic sector, but by 2018 participants came from a wide range of backgrounds including business. By 2019 ThinkWrite had delivered over 2,000 workshops, and met more than 30,000 participants. He is a member of the Physiological Society, the Association of British Science Writers, and a past chair of the Medical Journalists' Association. He is Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and the Faraday Institute.  Reviews of Moore's writings  In its review of Blood and Justice, The Wellcome Trust said \\"I am left craving more medical and scientific history to be delivered in such a lively manner\\", but criticised Moore's \\"readiness to skip forward within his chapters, filling the readers with more up-to-date information of the subsequent findings about blood and transfusion\\", finding this \\"a bit disconcerting\\".

Facts & Initial Hearing The case arose out of an incident that had occurred in March 1997 when Ms Vine, the appellant, had parked her car in one of five parking spaces just off High Road, Leytonstone, in east London on land owned by the East London College. At that time the College issued licences to a limited number of people to use these spaces and, in turn, used a service provided by the respondent the London Borough of Waltham Forest to clamp or tow away unauthorised vehicles from them. On the day in question Ms Vine, who that morning had been undergoing medical treatment at a nearby hospital and had just been informed that she needed an urgent operation, had suddenly felt unwell whilst driving home from the hospital. Unaware that they were on private property she hurriedly parked in one of the five spaces and stepped out and away from her car without seeing the signs warning of the possibility of clamping. She returned only three or four minutes later to discover that her car had been clamped by contractors operating on behalf of the London Borough of Waltham Forest. The clamp was removed after some fifteen to twenty minutes, once Ms Vine had paid the release fee. Later that year Ms Vine issued proceedings against the London Borough on the basis that they had wrongfully clamped her car. In their defence they in turn asserted that there was ample signage warning of the clamping of unauthorised vehicles and that their release fee did not represent an unreasonable charge. The case was heard before the London County Court in May 1998 where the recorder, though very sympathetic towards Ms Vine, found in favour of the London borough. He was satisfied there was ample signage warning of the possibility of clamping and that these could have been seen by Ms Vine. Ms Vine appealed and the matter came before the Court of Appeal on 5 April 2000. Judgment The appellant's case was, essentially, that the recorder at the original hearing had erred in that although he had concluded that she had not seen the warning signs he failed to conclude that the clamping of her car was, as a consequence, a trespass. The respondent stated that it was reasonable to infer from the recorder's judgment that as the signs were clearly visible that Ms Vine had therefore seen them and understood their content. In allowing Ms Vine's appeal Roch LJ, said (Para. 19 of the judgment): At paragraph 20 he went on to add: Summary In summary, the decision established that applying a wheel clamp to a vehicle constitutes a trespass to goodsStreet on Torts 12th Edition, by John Murphy, Oxford University Press, 2007, p.276, 296 and that the onus remains with the clamper to demonstrate that the person parking the vehicle knew of the risks and happily took these on at the time that he parked the vehicle. Although it might reasonably be inferred that a motorist saw and understood the signs as a result of their numbers, size and location it was insufficient that an appellant had simply had the opportunity to see warning signs but that they must also have read and understood them and only then, by doing so, could they consent to the act of clamping if they parked in contravention to the notices. By extension, it was held, if the fee was exorbitant then consent to its payment could not be implied.
