The palazzo is also known as Ca' dei Cuori, a family whose wrought iron coats of arms is present on the fa√ßade. History Built in 1678 on the place where there was an ancient Gothic palace, of which only the corner columns survive, the Palazzo Correr Contarini Zorzi was a residence for many noble Venetian families. The building was initially commissioned by the Correr family, then it passed to the Soranzo, Zorzi, and Contarini families. In this palace lived Antonio Correr, known for being one of the few patricians who refused to wear a wig, then considered to be a status symbol of the noble classes. In the 20th century, the palace was owned by the de Mombell family; they added the terrace that concludes the fa√ßade. The building was recently renovated. Architecture The palace offers an impressive 17th-century fa√ßade with two imposing monumental water portals, decorated by bow-shaped heads. The portals have main openings surrounded by quadrangular windows; their position symmetrical to that of the windows of the upper floors. There are two noble floors of equal importance and of the same design. The floors are decorated with triforas with small balconies shifted to the left and flanked by pairs of single-light windows on the left and (double) on the right. The horizontal bands of Istrian stone underline the symmetry and harmony of all the elements. The facade terminates with a white balustrade, which delimits an extensive roof terrace and is supported by a dentiled cornice. There are neoclassical frescoes inside the palazzo.

Contents GURPS Celtic Myth is a softcover book of Iron Age Celtic culture written by the then husband and wife team of Ken Walton, co-founder of Cakebread & Walton, and novelist Jo Walton. It supports a game referee in designing a GURPS campaign set in ancient Ireland or Scotland. The first half of the book gives an overview of Celtic history and literature. The second half of the book, entitled \\"Celtic Myth\\", delves into how ancient magic could be woven into a GURPS campaign. This includes shapeshifter duels, enchanted Snakestone beads, and letter spells using Ogham runes. Reception In the March 1996 edition of Arcane (Issue 4), Dan Joyce liked the book, commenting that \\"what is here is cracking stuff. If you want to run a Celtic campaign - GURPS or otherwise - buy this book.\\" Joyce concluded by giving the book an above-average rating of 8 out of 10. In the July 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue 231), Rick Swan found that the history in the first half of the book \\"reads like a college text, expansive but a bit stuffy.\\" However, he thought the exploration of Celtic magic in the second half of the book \\"comes to life.\\" Swan concluded that making a complete Celtic campaign was too much work, saying, \\"I‚Äôm not convinced a Celts campaign is worth the trouble, but incorporating the druidic material into another setting ‚Äî say, GURPS Camelot or GURPS Imperial Rome ‚Äî could be mighty interesting.\\" References Celtic Myth ","title":"GURPS Celtic Myth"},{"id":"61472078","text":"Mike Bonser (n√© Merz, born 14 October 1970) is an Australian professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation events.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by Cat Ketch Corp. in the United States from 1979 to 1986, with 100 examples completed, but it is now out of production. Design The Herreshoff 31 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass and polyurethane over wood, with wood trim. It has an unstayed catboat ketch rig, which can also be supplemented with a staysail on the aft mast, with an area of . the design has a spooned plumb stem, a near-vertical transom, a transom-hung rudder on a skeg controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with an Italian Nanni Industries or Japanese Yanmar diesel engine for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The space below decks is large, and lacks a forward bulkhead between the main cabin and the forward cabin. The galley is located to starboard and includes a two-burner stove. The head is to port at the foot of the companionway stairs, opposite the galley. Sleeping accommodation consists of a forward \\"V\\"-berth in the bow and two double bunks in the main cabin, with a stowable table in-between them. The berths all have draw stowage underneath them. The unstayed rigging features a simple layout, with only an outhaul, halyard, downhaul and sheets for each loose-footed sail. The booms are high and on the starboard side of each sail. The boat can be sailed on one sail or both and with either reefed. The staysail can be raised on the aft mast in lighter air. The masts are designed to flex to shed excess wind loads. There are no winches for the sheets and none are required. Operational history In a review of the Herreshoff 31, Richard Sherwood noted, \\"the popularity of cat-ketches is due to the ease with which they can be sailed. Masts are usually unstayed and running rigging is simple. Tacking does not have to involve sail handling. Many of these boats have a fairly high ballast/displacement ratio, are good (though not excellent) sailers on all points, and have a lot of room below.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Allmand 31 *Beneteau 31 *Catalina 310 *Corvette 31 *Douglas 31 *Hunter 31 *Hunter 31-2 *Hunter 310 *Hunter 320 *Marlow-Hunter 31 *Niagara 31 *Tanzer 31 References Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Herreshoff 31"},{"id":"61472353","title":"Me Entrego a Ti"},{"id":"61472364","title":"60 Second Docs"},{"id":"61472368","text":"Shawn Brenneman (born 6 August 1973 from Woodstock, Ontario) is a former Canadian professional darts player who played in Professional Darts Corporation events.

During her undergraduate degree she became interested in infectious disease, particularly conditions such as trypanosomiasis, HIV and neglected tropical diseases that affect people in the developing world. Clark recognised that the causes of these diseases were social rather than biological, which inspired her to pursue a career in public health. She has a Master's degree in public health, and earned her PhD in Public Health Science at the University of Toronto. Having been awarded a full doctoral fellowship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, where she was ranked the highest in the country for that year, her dissertation investigated the medicalisation of sexual assault and gender-equity in public health. Clark was offered a postdoctoral position at University of California, San Francisco, but chose to move to London to take up a fellowship at The BMJ.  Research and career  Clark began her editing career at The BMJ, where she worked as an Assistant Editor from 2002 to 2007. She moved back to Canada in 2008, joining PLOS Medicine as a Senior Editor. Here she developed the magazine content and editorial policy. She was one of the first to write for a medical journal on the use of rape as a tool of war and the problems with the food and beverage industry in health. Clark believes that PLOS are uniquely positioned to comment on global health issues; as they are open-access and do not take money from the pharmaceutical industry. As her interest in global health grew, Clark became keen to work a developing country. Clark served as Executive Editor for the journal of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), where she trained doctors in scientific writing and publication. Whilst in Dhaka Clark wrote for The BMJ, The Guardian and Grand Challenges Canada. She completed a writing residency at Lake Como. Here she investigated the over medicalisation of global health at the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, and wrote a four part series outlining whether global health had become too medicalised, the medicalisation of mental health, the medicalisation of non-communicable diseases and the Universal Health Coverage campaign. In 2014 Clark was named as one of the Top 100 Women in Global Health. She examined the risks associated with predatory journals, particularly how they may impact scientists in the developing world. It was estimated that predatory journals earned $75 million in 2014. Clark joined The Lancet as Executive Editor in 2016. She commissioned and edited The Lancet Canada Series in 2016, which was a collection of scientific papers evaluating Canada's system of universal health care. It included commentaries from Jane Philpott and Justin Trudeau. She called for more action on the public health of indigenous populations. Clark is committed to gender equality in science, whether that is in medical trials, research groups or scientific publishing. She founded the Canadian Women in Global Health list in 2018. The list was established to help conference organisers, journal editors, the media and funding bodies identify more diverse experts. In 2019 she led a theme issue of The Lancet that was focussed on women in medicine. Whilst women outnumber men in the Lancet workforce, men are considerably more likely to review and publish appears. Clark said that there were over 300 submissions from more than 40 countries for the Lancet Women. She stated that, \\"The evidence is clear, women are disadvantaged within science, medicine and global health. The source of that disadvantage is gender bias, which is a core feature of the very systems that organise these three fields\\". #LancetWomen was launched in February 2019, after which The Lancet committed to re- assembling their editorial boards to improve gender balance. She has questioned whether efforts toward gender equality will ever progress beyond institutional resistance. She was elected to the Royal College of Physicians and the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences in 2019. Clark serves on the advisory board of Global Health 5050.

Recolonization inherently references the failure or incomplete nature of decolonization and is often used to reference the conditions of former colonies in the Global South, many of which are now officially independent and sovereign nations yet are still subjugated to former colonial powers in the Global North by global capitalism, which maintains continued resource extraction and military control (e.g. counter- revolutionary forces and regime changes) in former colonies with the explicit purpose of serving and benefiting the interests of the former or new colonizing powers.Talpade Mohanty 2003, p. 2-3.Saul 1993, p. x-xii.Kimche 1971, p. 205. The term has been compared to neocolonialism, although has been distinguished as a more powerful metaphor regarding the continued influence of colonial powers over former colonies.  Usage of term  In the 1990s, African writers Ali Mazrui and Archie Mafeje held an intense debate regarding the usage of the term recolonization following Mazrui's publication of a newspaper article entitled \\"Recolonization or Self-colonization? Decaying Parts of Africa Need Benign Colonization\\" in the Los Angeles Times and the International Herald Tribune, which was translated into various languages. In the article, Mazrui argues that \\"surely it is time for Africans to exert more pressure on each other, including through benevolent intervention, to achieve a kind of Pax Africana based on regional intervention or unification of smaller states,\\" further stating that some countries may need to be temporarily controlled by others and \\"submit to trusteeship and even tutelage for awhile,\\" citing the case of Zanzibar's annexation by Tanganyika in 1964. Mazrui proposed an African Security Council which would \\"oversee the continent\\" and coordinate with the United Nations, concluding that \\"if Africa does not follow this path, the lack of stability and economic growth will push the entire continent further into the desperate margins of global society\\" and reflecting that \\"self-colonization if we can manage it, is better than colonization by outsiders.\\"Mazrui 1994, p. 339-341. Mazrui was accused by Mafeje of being an \\"unconscious agent of Western racism\\" who used the terms recolonization and colonization in a manner which was \\"intellectually bankrupt\\" and \\"analytically superficial.\\" Mafeje asserted that Mazrui was \\"acutely aware of the racist and imperialist connotation of the term and for this reason he tries to dispense with the white man's burden (a crude clich√©)\\" and deconstructs his arguments for a trusteeship system, citing how this same imperialist system eliminated Patrice Lumumba. He refers to Mazrui's assertions that some more stable or powerful African states may need to oversee or \\"recolonize\\" more dysfunctional African states as outright absurd. Mafeje concludes his critique of Mazrui's article by claiming that \\"every political scientist in Africa knows that Ali Mazrui's prescription is in fact contrary to popular sentiments on this continent\\" and \\"far from needing recolonization, we need decolonization in Africa not only of the body polity but also of the mind.\\"Mafeje 1995, p. 342-349. Mazrui's article notably prompted confusion in Egypt, Somalia, and elsewhere, as Kassem-Ali notes that Mazrui's arguments may have been misinterpreted by some due to language employed in the Arabic translation of the article. Jaafar Kassem-Ali argues that Mazrui's article was \\"dreaming of an early Pax Africana\\" rather than inviting the preceding system of colonization back to Africa.Kassem-Ali 2004, p. 335-337. Benevolent recolonization occurs when the colonized benefit far more from the new relationship than the colonizer. Kassem-Ali cites the case of the recolonization of Zanzibar by Tanganyika during the mid-1960s, in which the people of Zanzibar arguably received greater political power in the United Republic of Tanzania, which included a guaranteed Vice-Presidency in the Union. This was a case of \\"recolonization\\" however because \\"the people of Zanzibar were never consulted whether they wanted to give up their sovereignty after independence from Britain.\\" Benign recolonization occurs when the benefits between the colonizer and the colonized parallel one another and the moral case is also in relative equilibrium. Kassem-Ali references how Tanzania's brief occupation of Uganda in 1979 which deposed of Idi Amin and reinstated the leadership of Milton Obote was a case of benign recolonization, in which Tanzania gained \\"a more responsive government\\" in Kampala and Uganda gained via the end of the tyranny instated under Amin. Malignant recolonization occurs when the colonizer benefits far more from the new colonial relationship than the colonized. Kassem-Ali cites the case of Ethiopia's decision to annex Eritrea under the leadership of Emperor Haile Selassie following the end of Italian colonial rule without granting Eritrea any regional autonomy, which resulted in a thirty-year civil war from 1962 to 1992. Another case exists in which Morocco attempted to forcibly incorporate Western Sahara through \\"manipulating a referendum or threatening armed action,\\" which prompted action from the United Nations to prevent Sahrawi annexation without self-determination. In his analysis of both benevolent and benign recolonization, Kassem-Ali lists the term in quotes (\\"recolonization\\"), whereas in his discussion of malignant recolonization the term is left as is, indicating that the term recolonization more aptly applies in the latter scenario.

Family Buenaventura Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba Sp√≠nola de la Cerda was born on 23 February 1724, the fifth of a family of seven children. His full baptismal name was Buenaventura Francisco de Sales Antonio Ram√≥n Pascual P√≠o Bibiano Mar√≠a de la Soledad Juan de Mata Luis Alfonso de la Concepci√≥n Policarpo Venancio Diego Jos√© Francisco de As√≠s. His parents were Nicol√°s Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba Figueroa de la Cerda, 9th Marquis of Priego, Villafranca and Montalb√°n, Duke of Feria and 10th Duke of Medinaceli, and Jer√≥nima Mar√≠a Sp√≠nola de la Cerda. His father was one of the most powerful and wealthy men in 18th century Spain, who had inherited the house of Priego and Feria from his father, and the Duchy of Medinaceli after the death of his maternal uncle, the last male descendant of the house of Cerda. Buenaventura was given an excellent education by private tutors. He studied letters, languages and theology, and earned a doctorate in theology. Career After being ordained, Buenaventura was named chaplain and grand almoner of King Charles III of Spain. He was consecrated as bishop in the Royal Church of San Jer√≥nimo, Madrid on 28 June 1761 by Manuel Quintano Bonifaz, Titular Archbishop of Pharsalus and Inquisitor general for Spain. His principal co-consecrators were Manuel Antonio de Murillo y Arg√°iz, Bishop of Segovia and Andr√©s Cano y Junquera, Titular Bishop of Arad. Due to his powerful family, when he became a priest he was naturally given high positions in the church. He was made Abbot Major of Rute, one of the richest abbeys in Andalusia. He was later appointed Canon of Toledo and Archdeacon of Talavera. He became Abbot nullius of Alcal√° la Real in 1761. Buenaventura was sponsored by Charles III as archbishop of Neoces√°rea. On 6 April 1762 he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Neocaesarea in Ponto and Patriarch of the West Indies. As patriarch, he replaced √Ålvaro de Mendoza Caama√±o Sotomayor, who had died on 23 January 1761. He was military vicar of Spain from 1762 until his death. He was a judge of the Royal Chapel. Buenaventura was a member of the king's council. Buenaventura was made a cardinal at the request of King Charles III. Pope Clement XIII appointed him cardinal on 23 November 1761. He participated in the conclave that elected a new pope on 19 May 1769. He was installed as Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in panisperna on 26 June 1769. As cardinal- priest he replaced Lorenzo (Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio) Ganganelli, who had been elected as Pope Clement XIV. He then made a trip through Italy and visited the courts of Leopold, Duke of Tuscany (the future Holy Roman Emperor), Ferdinand, Duke of Parma and King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia. After returning from Italy Buenaventura suffered an apoplectic attack, the first of a series of attacks, which greatly limited what he could do. He was not able to participate in the conclave of 1774‚Äì75. He died on 6 May 1777. He bequeathed his wealth to foundation of a school for orphan boys and girls. He was replaced as Patriarch of the West Indies by Francisco Javier Delgado Venegas, who was appointed on 30 March 1778. He was replaced as cardinal- priest by Giovanni Battista Bussi de Pretis, who was appointed on 12 September 1794.

Tombstone South is the lower of the two summits, and is labelled as Tombstone Mountain on some maps. It can be reached via scrambling, whereas the true north summit requires technical climbing.Alan Kane, Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies, 3rd Ed, page 190. Tombstone Mountain is situated within Elbow-Sheep Wildland Provincial Park, and its nearest higher peak is Elpoca Mountain, to the south. History The mountain was named by Canadian surveyor George Mercer Dawson in 1884 for the pinnacles and slabs which resembled tombstones near the summit. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Tombstone Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Tombstone Mountain was created during the Lewis Overthrust. The steeply tilted strata are virtually the same in each peak of the Opal Range, with softer layers sandwiched between harder layers. Tombstone South seen from Elbow Lake Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Tombstone Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. In terms of favorable weather, July through September are the best months to climb Tombstone Mountain.

As a security measure in the prevailing situation of heavy rains, the India Meteorological Department had issued Red alert in the 9 districts in Northern and Central Kerala, orange alert in 3 districts of Central Kerala, and yellow alert in the 2 districts of southern Kerala.https://twitter.com/vijayanpinarayi/status/1159719778082181120?s=20 Thousands of people have been evacuated to safer places and relief camps. A total of 121 people have died due to rain-related incidents as of 19 August 2019. Another deluge had hit the state in August 2018, in which over 470 people died and properties worth US$5.8 billion (‚Çπ40000 crore) were damaged. Causes The extreme rains were triggered by a depression that formed in North-West Bay of Bengal near Odisha coast. This depression strengthened monsoon currents across the Arabian sea resulting in intense convection over Kerala. Every year parts of South Asia are hit by a period of heavy rain known as the Monsoon which usually falls between June and September. It is caused by a change of wind patterns over the region, this change causes heavy rains in the summer and long dry spells over the other months. In India, the monsoon rains can provide 70% of the country's rainfall for the year. The rain fall so quickly and heavily that it can easily cause sudden flooding. Unrestricted mining operations in places have contributed to environmental degradation. Scientists who have conducted research on the disaster-prone areas have warned that soil-piping is a major cause for the landslides witnessed in these places and the high ranges of Kerala will likely be worst hit if this continues. Also known as 'tunnel erosion', soil piping is the subsurface erosion of soil caused by percolating waters to produce pipe-like conduits below the ground, especially in non-lithified earth materials.https://www.indiatoday.in/india- today-insight/story/kerala-manmade-disaster-flood-1595657-2019-09-05 Impact As of 19 August 2019, 121 people have been killed due to the floods across the state of Kerala.

Rescue Kerala's State Disaster Management Authority, Kerala police along with the Indian Air Force, civilians, volunteers, fishermen from coastal Kerala are actively taking part in the rescue operations in flood-affected regions. However, inclement weather with heavy rains and landslides are hampering the rescue operations in the hilly regions of Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts. 83 National Disaster Response Force(NDRF) teams were deployed in addition to the 173 teams of Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard to take part in the relief operations. Animal rescue was carried out by local NGOs and activists on ground mainly in places like Wayanad and Nilambur. Notable work was done by Sally Varma of Humane Society International/India in Nilambur where around 500 kg of dog food and more than 5000 kg of cattle feed and 2500 kg of goat feed was distributed to the starving animals.

Although, congregations have spread all over North America and in many other countries. The key phrase used to identify the belief of Kosin is \\"Life before God (Coram Deo)\\", or \\"Life within the authentic (Apostle's) faith\\". The denomination was built upon the faith of martyrs who rejected shrine worship during the Japanese oppression. The ministers who established the synod of Kosin believed that the purpose of the establishment is not in martyrdom, but it is in the continuing existence of the Apostle's faith and teaching, purity of life, as well as foundation of churches in Korea and the world under the reformed faith. In order to preserve the catholic Christian faith, The Kosin Presbyterian Church in Korea embraces the Bible as the principle scripture, but also employs Westminster Standards as the primary documents. The church proclaims the following phrases as the principles for life: * God Centered * Bible Centered * Church Centered  History  = Mission in Korea and Growth of Presbyterian Church = The Presbyterian mission began in Korea by a medical missionary, Dr. H. N. Allen of Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. On April 5, 1885, Presbyterian missionary named H.G. Underwood arrived in Korea and the Presbyterian mission in Korea began to bloom. In January 1893, Congregation of Presbyterian Missionaries was established and on May 15, 1901, Pyongyang Presbyterian Theological Seminary was established. After few years, on September 17, 1907, the synod of Joseon Presbyterian Church was organized. = Colonial Oppression of Japan and Demand for Shrine Worship = In 1910, Japan enforced annexation of Joseon and proclaimed the slogan \\"Japan and Korea are One\\" as an effort to colonize Korea and other Asian countries using the idea of militaristic imperialism. The slogan was used to force people to become \\"japanized\\", by enforcing Japanese language, shrine worship and deification of the Japanese emperor, as well as enforcing Japanese culture. Christian schools were the first victim of Japanese colonization. While Japan exclaimed that, \\"shrine worship is not a religious ceremony but a nationalistic ceremony\\", many Christian schools resisted shrine worship and voluntarily closed. The churches in Korea was the next target and starting in 1935, many Christian denominations including Seventh-Day Adventist, Methodists, Salvationists, the Holiness Church, the Anglican church and Roman Catholic Church accepted the shrine worship. As for the Presbyterian Church in Korea, the regional synod of Northern Pyongan was the first branch to accept the shrine worship and many other synods began to follow. = Resistance to Shrine Worship and Liberation of Korea = In efforts to preserve the Christian faith, movement of resistance to shrine worship was formed by the group of ministers who wanted to protect the Gospel. Many ministers at Pyongyang Presbyterian Theological Seminary was displaced and the seminary eventually closed. Reverends Joo Ki- Chul, Han Sang-Dong, Joo Nam-Sun and other ministers were arrested at Pyongyang imprisonment camp and tortured. Churches in Korea lost its functionality under Japanese oppression and on August 1, 1945, all churches were combined under Japan-Joseon Christian churches. During the oppression, Joo died while resisting the Japanese enforcement and the shrine worship. When Korea was liberated on August 15, 1945, the remaining ministers who suffered from Japanese imprisonment were released. Recognizing the state of Christianity in Korea, they decided to establish pure and conservative theological seminary built upon the foundation of reformed faith. In 1946, Han and Joo took the lead in establishing the seminary and as a result, Koryeo Theological Seminary opened. Three pastors founded the Ko-Ryeo Seminary but the Presbyterian Church refused to recognize this seminary. Founders of KoRyu Seminary and BupDong presbytery established later, in September 11, 1952 the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Kosin).http://pck.or.kr/Eng/History/MajorH.asp On December 1960 it was united with the mainline Presbyterian Church in Korea (HapDong), but it lasted until 1963 when the church withdrew from the union and returned to its original form and continues to this day. Only 150 churches remained with the Presbyterian Church (Hapdong). In 1976 a split occurred in the church, the Presbyterian Church in Korea (Ko-Ryeo Pa) was founded, but one part of this reunited with the Kosin church. The Kosin group developed steadily.

The EP was released in Japan on May 24, 2017 by Victor Entertainment, in Europe on August 25, 2017 by JPU Records, and in North America by Sliptrick Records on August 31, 2017. It reached number 27 on the Oricon chart and number 40 on Billboard Japan. Background and release Lovebites was formed in Tokyo, Japan in 2016 by musicians who were all previously in well-known and established bands. From the very beginning, bassist and leader Miho knew she wanted to have English lyrics, and with vocalist Asami having studied abroad, three of the four songs on the EP are in English. Two of them were composed and arranged in collaboration with Lightbringer keyboardist Mao. Miho recorded her bass parts using an ESP AMAZE- ASM. Asami revealed that because she was new to heavy metal music, she was a little lost while recording her vocals. Miho said that the EP was more of a demo to get the band signed, but the label liked it so much they had it properly mastered and released. It was mixed by Mikko Karmila and mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland. The Lovebites EP received a limited release of 3,000 copies in Japan on May 24, 2017 by Victor Entertainment. It was released in the United Kingdom on August 25 by JPU Records and in North America by Sliptrick Records on August 31. All four of its songs were re-recorded with new arrangements for the band's first album released later in the year, Awakening from Abyss. Victor released a limited edition vinyl record version of the EP, titled in Japanese, on August 7, 2019 with new liner notes by Masanori Ito. The songs were also given new Japanese titles; \\"Don't Bite the Dust\\" became , \\"The Apocalypse\\" was changed to , \\"Scream for Me\\" became , and \\"Bravehearted\\" was changed to . Themes Midori's playing on the EP was influenced by Kiko Loureiro. Miho called \\"Don't Bite the Dust\\" the easiest song to listen to on the EP, with its melody balancing the twin guitars and Iron Maiden-like galloping rhythm. It was influenced by and named after a supernatural ability from the Diamond is Unbreakable arc of the manga and anime series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Its ending features a two octave jump by Asami, which she had never tried before. \\"The Apocalypse\\" is the only song newly written for the EP. When writing it, Miho wanted thrash metal guitar riffs like Sodom. Its lyrics are about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. At the suggestion of the producer, Midori played a bottleneck guitar solo for the first time on the track after doing research that included watching Derek Trucks videos on YouTube. \\"Scream For Me\\" was composed by support guitarist and keyboardist Mi-Ya. Its lyricist, Dr. U, is an American male acquaintance of hers who lives in Japan. For her bass parts on the track, Miho was thinking of Anthrax's song \\"Lone Justice\\". The final track \\"Bravehearted\\" is the band's only song with lyrics in Japanese. Written by drummer Haruna, it is a new arrangement of an unreleased song by her and Miho's previous band Destrose. Reception The Lovebites EP reached number 27 on the Oricon Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for four weeks. It peaked at number 40 on Billboard Japans Hot Albums chart. Numerous musicians praised the EP, including Kiko Loureiro of Angra, Stratovarius vocalist Timo Kotipelto, and Blind Guardian's Hansi K√ºrsch. Michael Weikath of Helloween said \\"What I consider the best about this material is that they construct a direct link to classic metal. And it is not sounding old fashioned, dusty or boring. It is fresh.\\" Neo gave the EP a perfect rating, claiming it \\"would make Iron Maiden proud. LOVEBITES are metal stars in the making.\\" Japanese music-focused website JaME wrote that although it is the band's debut release, the EP is clearly the work of professional musicians with years of experience. They cited \\"Scream for Me\\" as the heaviest track \\"where melodic riffing is side-lined in favour of chugging power chords and some spontaneous showboating.\\" Track listing Personnel Lovebites *Asami ‚Äì vocals *Miho ‚Äì bass *Haruna ‚Äì drums *Midori ‚Äì guitars Other *Mi-Ya ‚Äì guitars and keyboards *Mao ‚Äì keyboards and programming *Steve Jacobs ‚Äì production *Mikko Karmila ‚Äì mixing *Mika Jussila ‚Äì mastering References External links Category:2017 debut EPs Category:Lovebites albums Category:EPs by Japanese artists Category:Victor Entertainment EPs ","title":"The Lovebites EP"},{"id":"61472770","text":"SWAPGS may be: *SWAPGS (security vulnerability) *an X86 hardware instruction ","title":"SWAPGS"},{"id":"61472772","text":"Briton Ferry Llansawel AFC Ladies is a football team, playing in the Women's Welsh Premier League, to which they were promoted in 2018.

He is known for discovering what has since become known as the Beavis effect: namely, that the estimates of phenotypic variance associated with one of multiple quantitative trait loci, each of which has a small effect on the trait being studied, are typically significantly inflated if the sample size of organisms in the study is too low (e.g. about 100), but that these estimates are fairly accurate if the number of individuals is much greater (about 1,000). Education and career Beavis was educated at Humboldt State University, New Mexico State University, and Iowa State University. In 1986, he began working for Pioneer Hi-Bred, where he continued to work until 1998. That year, he began working at the National Center for Genome Resources, where he served as chief science officer from 2000 until leaving in 2007.

The Office of the Solicitor has the second largest litigation department in the U.S. federal government, with about 500 lawyers in both national and regional offices. The Solicitor of Labor has independent authority to initiate lawsuits to enforce 180 federal workplace statutes. The position is a Presidential appointee requiring Senate confirmation, and is paid at Level IV of the Executive Schedule. The Office of the Solicitor was established by the Organic Act of 1913, which separated the Department of Labor from the Department of Commerce and Labor, although a Solicitor position for the combined department had existed since 1903. The Solicitor of Labor was originally located in the Department of Justice until it was transferred to the Department of Labor in 1933. In 1940, all Department attorneys and legal personnel were transferred to the supervision of the Solicitor of Labor. In the 1980s, the office attracted attention for delays in cases enforcing the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and for not seeking the maximum compensation for back wages due under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. In 2019, a memo directing lawyers to consult with agency heads before filing lawsuits against employers was criticized as ceding some of its authority to political appointees.

After completing her education, she first taught school and then worked in youth programs. She served as the director of the Murrow Indian Children's Home at Bacone College and directed for the Cherokee Nation Jobs Corp Center before becoming the art instructor at Sequoyah High School in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Simultaneously, Adair began a career as a professional artist in 1967, winning numerous art prizes and exhibiting mainly in the western part of the United States. Among the places where her work has been shown are the Cherokee Heritage Center of Park Hill, Oklahoma; the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona; the Museum of the Cherokee Indian at Cherokee, North Carolina; and the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She has pieces in the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in Muskogee, Oklahoma, as well as other public collections. Julie Pearson-Little Thunder interviewed Adair in 2011 as part of Oklahoma State University's Oklahoma Native Artists Oral History Project Early life Mary Adair was born in 1936 in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma to Velma and Corrigan Adair. Adair's family can be traced back to Gahoga, a Cherokee woman, (sometimes known as Nancy Lightfoot) who married John Adair, a Scotsman in South Carolina in the 18th century. Her great-great- great-grandfather Walter was jailed by Georgia settlers seeking to have the Cherokee removed from the state and died before the Trail of Tears march. Both her great-grandfather and her grandfather, Oscar Adair, were judges for the Cherokee Nation. After graduating from Sallisaw High School, Adair went on to further her education at Bacone College in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and graduated with her B.A. from Northeastern Oklahoma State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma in 1957. On May 26, 1958, in Tucson, Arizona, she married Sam Horsechief, a Pawnee craftsman, with whom she would have three children who became artists, Sam HorseChief Jr., Mary HorseChief Henderson, and Daniel HorseChief. Career In 1958, Horsechief began her teaching career in the Tulsa Public School System, continuing her graduate studies at the University of Tulsa and would complete her master's degree in education at Northeastern. The couple moved to Dallas, Texas in 1959, but returned to Oklahoma City, before settling in Muskogee, Oklahoma around 1965. There, she worked as a director of the Head Start Program before becoming the director of the Murrow Indian Children's Home. In the late 1970s, Horsechief worked for the Cherokee Nation, directing the Jobs Corps Center for a decade. Returning to teaching, she served as the art instructor at Sequoyah High School in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Horsechief began her professional art career in 1967 and used the professional name Mary Adair Horsechief until her children became active as artists when she began using Mary Adair. Her subject matter typically focuses on Native American people, as they go about their daily lives or participate in ceremonies and she often portrays children. She has exhibited at the 'Trail of Tears Art Show and Cherokee Homecoming in Park Hill, the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in Muskogee, the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, the Museum of the Cherokee Indian of Cherokee, North Carolina, the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma and the Red Cloud Indian Art Show in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, among others. In 1972, Adair won a first-place award at the Five Civilized Tribes annual competitive art show and was featured with David E. Williams (Kiowa/Tonkawa/Kiowa-Apache) in a two-person exhibition and lecture held at the Goddard Center in Ardmore, Oklahoma. That year, she was one of four artists including Doc Tate Nevaquaya (Comanche), Leonard Riddles (aka Black Moon, Comanche) and Johnson Scott (Seminole), who exhibited at the University of Oklahoma. She repeated the win at the Five Civilized Tribes art show following year with a first-place award as a Cherokee artist. In 1976, Adair, along with Sharron Ahtone Harjo (Kiowa), Ruthe Blalock Jones (Delaware/Shawnee/Peoria), Virginia Stroud (Keetoowah Band Cherokee/Muscogee Creek), Carrie Wahnee (aka Water Girl) and Mary Bresser Young (Choctaw), were featured in an all-women's exhibition hosted at the Stovall Museum in Norman, Oklahoma. In 1977, she was awarded the Special Indian Heritage Award by the Five Civilized Tribes Museum. Adair again joined Stroud, Harjo, Jones, as well as Joan Brown (Cherokee descent), Valjean McCarty Hessing (Choctaw), and Jane McCarty Mauldin (Choctaw) in the Daughters of the Earth exhibition, curated by Doris Littrell, which toured from 1985 to 1988 throughout the United States and Europe. Many of these same women participated with Adair in the Mothers and Descendants exhibition hosted at the Kirkpatrick Center of Oklahoma City in 1987. Adair was one of the artists interviewed in 2011 for the Oklahoma State University's Oklahoma Native Artists Oral History Project. In 2015, she worked on a collaborative project with her children Sam, Mary, and Daniel, for the expansion of the Wilma Mankiller Health Center in Stilwell, Oklahoma. The piece called The Origins of Strawberries, featured paintings and text combining panels to tell the traditional Cherokee story. Her works were included in the Women of the Five Civilized Tribes exhibition hosted by the museum in Muskogee in 2019. Besides having works in the permanent collections of the Five Civilized Tribes Museum, her works are located in other museums, libraries, and private collections.

It was the title story in a short story collection published in 1976 by Wydawnictwo Literackie. It is a story of an assassin android she-robot programmed both to love and to kill its human target and who gradually becomes aware of herself and her programming.Jo Alyson Parker, \\"Gendering the Robot: Stanislaw Lem‚Äôs The Mask\\", Science Fiction Studies, Volume 19, Part 2, issue 57, July 1992\\"\\"Maska\\" Stanis≈Çawa Lema\\", culture.pl, May 18, 2011 The English translation may be found in the collection Mortal Engines. Initially Lem planned it as a story within a story, in the story Edukacja Cyfrania from the Polish edition of the collection The Cyberiad.Stanis≈Çaw Lem, Listy albo op√≥r materii, Krak√≥w, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 2002, pp. 83-84. Plot The story is set in quasi-feudal world, which is unusually technologically advanced, reminiscent of that of the Fables for Robots and The Cyberiad. It is a story from the point of view of a complicated \\"hound machine\\", an insectoid robot disguised as a beautiful girl. Her target is a high-ranked dissident wise man Arrhodes. She is programmed both to love and to kill Arrhodes. When they see each other at a ball, they both immediately fall in love. When Arrhodes decides to visit her, she transforms from a girl into a mantis-like steel monster. Arrhodes recognizes the \\"hound machine\\" and flees, and the pursuit begins. The robot gradually gains the ability of introspection, becomes aware of her predicament, and struggles to overcome it. Along her path she meets a priest and confesses. The priest asks what she would do when she sees Arrhodes, and she answers she does not know. To that the priest comments that she and he are \\"equal before the Divine Providence\\". In other words, the ability to have doubt is a humanizing trait.N. Katherine Hayles, My Mother Was a Computer: Digital Subjects and Literary Texts, University of Chicago Press 2010, , Section 7, \\"(Un) masking the Agent: Stanislaw Lem's The Mask\\", pp. 171-192. The priest tells her that Arrhodes was kidnapped by some villains, and she starts hunting the kidnappers in order to free Arrhodes, still not knowing what she will do to him. When she finally finds him, he is already dying, and she (and readers) will never know what she would have done. Discussion In the foreword to a 1977 Russian translation of the story Lem wrote that the story has three aspects. First, illustrates the classical philosophical problem of free will simulated within the framework of cybernetics: can a machine programmed to do something recognize this programming as something enforced onto it and whether it can rebel against it? This is a practical issue of \\"robot rebellion\\". Lem writes that in scientific terms it may be stated as \\"the problem of autodescription of a finite automaton\\".–ú–∞—Å–∫–∞ / –ü–µ—Ä. –ò.–õ–µ–≤—à–∏–Ω–∞; –ü—Ä–µ–¥–∏—Å–ª. –°.–õ–µ–º–∞ ¬´–ù–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å–ª–æ–≤ –æ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª (pp. 19-22) In: –°–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ–π —Ñ–∞–Ω—Ç–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏: –í—ã–ø. 18. ‚Äî –ú.: –ó–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–µ, 1977. ‚Äî pp. 19-61. Second, it was an attempt to model the above science-fictional situation within the framework not typical for science fiction, hence he framed it as a classic love story in the form of a gothic novel. At the same time he attempted to interpret its elements: \\"fatal love\\", \\"love at first sight\\", jealousy, etc., based on the current knowledge in cybernetics. For example, love at first sight may be interpreted as the phenomenon of imprinting, only not of biological origin, but as a result of external programming of a robot. Finally, Lem wrote he wanted to introduce a motif from the genre of fantasy: that of horrible transformation of the heroine. And again, this transformation was to have a rational explanation: it was caused not by a spell, but by a program. In his comments elsewhere Lem draws a parallel with Solaris: both deal with a non-human entity (Harey, in Solaris and the hound machine in The Mask) which has human impulses and behavior. In the foreword to Mortal Engines, the translator Michael Kandel also draws a parallel with Solaris in that the two are both love story and horror story, with quite a few twists.Mortal Engines, 1992, , p. xii The observation on the humanizing ability of being \\"equal before the divine providence\\" is similar to that found in Lem's short story The Inquest, where a human defeats a robot due to his ability to have doubts and hesitate. Film adaptation In 2010 an animated short film Maska (23 min.) was shot directed by the Brothers Quay, based on Lem's short story. the production was financed in part by the Adam Mickiewicz Institute. In this rendering the robot is beautiful in its both forms: the girl and the machine, while the surrounding human world looks rotten, which fits the mood of the story.

The novel, dream-like in tone in a manner influenced by modernist writer Franz Kafka, takes place on an island with a setting reminiscent of that in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty- Four. An English translation by Stephen Snyder was published by Pantheon Books and Harvill Secker in 2019. Plot The story follows a novelist on an island under the control of the Memory Police. An unknown force causes the people of the island to collectively 'forget' and lose their attachment to objects or concepts, e.g. hats, perfume, birds and ribbon. The Memory Police enforce the removal of these objects from the island, and of the people who continue to remember, such as the author's mother. Some who continue to remember are being surveilled and taken by the Police. With the help of an old man, a family friend, the protagonist hides her editor R in a secret room in her home when he reveals his fear that he will be taken by the Memory Police. One day, the old man is briefly taken away by the Police. Upon his release, he tells her that the Police are investigating a few defectors who escaped the island by boat, and he was interrogated as he worked with boats before. While hiding, R then tries to introduce some of the long disappeared objects to the author and the old man, though both struggle to recall their significance and memories of the objects. As the calendars disappear, the winter continues and spring never come. Food is becoming scarce on the island. The Memory Police raid the author's house as they celebrate the old man's birthday, but fail to discover the secret room, leaving them free. Novels then disappear as well. On R's advice, she continues to work on her ongoing novel and keeps some books, although she has begun to lose attachment to books. She takes up another job as a typist at a trading company. After an earthquake, some of her mother's sculptures, given back by a family friend, break and reveal more objects that had disappeared, including a ferry ticket and a harmonica. She decides to investigate her mother's cabin, which R believes contains more objects that have long disappeared. The author, along with the old man, manages to retrieve the objects and hide them in her home. One day, the old man dies from a brain hemorrhage. Soon after, the inhabitants are made to forget some of their body parts, with the Memory Police capturing those who continue to retain their sense of the \\"disappeared\\" body parts. The author, despite much difficulty, manages to finish her novel on a typist. The inhabitants, including the author, slowly began to accept their fate as they forget their own existence and slowly vanish. Before disappearing, the author reassures R that he may be able to come out of hiding along with others who manage to preserve their memories of other objects. Reception In an article naming it one of the best books of the Summer of 2019, Time wrote, \\"Ogawa‚Äôs fable echoes the themes of George Orwell‚Äôs 1984, Ray Bradbury‚Äôs Fahrenheit 451, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez‚Äôs 100 Years of Solitude, but it has a voice and power all its own.\\" The Chicago Tribune called it: \\"A masterful work of speculative fiction [...] An unforgettable literary thriller full of atmospheric horror.\\" The New York Times compared it to the novels of Samuel Beckett and Kobo Abe, saying \\"Ogawa‚Äôs ruminant style captures the alienation of being alive as the world‚Äôs ecosystems, ice sheets, languages, animal species and possible futures vanish more quickly than any one mind can apprehend.\\" Michael Adam Carroll, writing in Ploughshares, was chilled by its timeliness: \\"Ogawa hits on something real in her novel‚Äîwe must remember to write and write to remember, to ensure the survival of truth.\\" Awards and recognition The Memory Police was named a finalist for the 2019 National Book Award for Translated Literature, as well as for the 2020 International Booker Prize. It was also named a finalist for the 2020 World Fantasy Award.

Matthew Q. Gebert (born c. 1981) is an American foreign affairs officer in the U.S. State Department, known for being suspended in August 2019 from his position after he was reported as a white nationalist by Hatewatch, a newsletter of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He had grown up in suburban New Jersey, and graduated from George Washington University in 2011. Gebert had studied abroad in and after high school and college in various programs. Gebert joined the State Department in 2013, after passing rigorous exams and background checks. His brother reported him to the FBI in June 2019 for his activities, disturbed by his views and radicalization. Gebert is being investigated by the State Department. As of January 2020, Gebert is still active in the white nationalist movement. Early life and education Matthew Gebert is the older of two brothers in his family, and he and Michael grew up in Somerdale, New Jersey. He graduated from Sterling High School and was known for liberal views. He listened to hip hop, including the rap group Wu-Tang Clan. Voted by his class as \\"Most Likely to Succeed\\", Gebert had earlier participated in a student exchange program in Ukraine. Gebert graduated from George Washington University in 2011. In 2001 he had participated in a study program in Moscow that was sponsored by American University. There he met his future wife, Anna Vuckovic, a Serbian- American student abroad in a study program of Northwestern University. Gebert also took other opportunities later for travel in Eastern Europe. Marriage and family Gebert and Vuckovic married in 2007, and have children together. They settled in Leesburg, Virginia, now a distant suburb of Washington, D.C. Radicalization According to his own account in a white nationalist forum, Gebert became radicalized in 2015. The reasons are unclear, although he had long been interested in Slavic culture and suggested the United States and the Slavic peoples had common interests. Gebert had studied and traveled numerous times in Russia and Eastern Europe since the fall of the Soviet Union. He became a white nationalist, leading a Washington, D.C.-area chapter of a neo- fascist cell called \\"The Right Stuff.\\" He uses the online pseudonym \\"Coach Finstock\\", in addition to several others. Gebert was confirmed by his brother as an attendee at a May 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as seen in a photograph. In a podcast called \\"The Fatherland\\" in May 2018, Gebert was quoted as saying: \\"...[whites] need a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split.\\" In 2018, Gebert donated $200 to white supremacist Paul Nehlen's election campaign. He has hosted known white nationalists in his home in Leesburg, Virginia. In 2019 He shared an image of a swastika-shaped cookie with the caption: \\"From our pool party last night. Plate was stacked.\\" The cookies were saved for special guests. On July 2, 2019, Matthew Gebert's brother reported him to the FBI because: \\"I saw so much evil in my brother, I could not fucking deal with it\\". Following an investigation, as of August 8, 2019, Gebert was placed on leave from the State Department.

The coins were authorized by Public Law 115‚Äì343 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.  History  Following the success of the National Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coins of 2014, H.R.4592 was introduced to the House of Representatives in 2016. It proposed the production of a series of coins commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. However, it did not make it past the House. The production of Basketball Hall of Fame coins was proposed again in 2017 with H.R.1235, this time with production scheduled for 2020. Unlike the previous proposal, H.R.1235 passed the House and the Senate, and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on December 21, 2018, becoming Public Law 115‚Äì343.  Legislation  Public Law 115‚Äì343 calls for a maximum mintage limit of 750,000 clad half dollars, 400,000 silver dollars, and 50,000 gold half eagles. It also calls for the coins to be dome-shaped and for the reverse to feature a basketball.  Designs  The US Mint launched the Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Design Competition on March 19, 2019, calling for artists to submit obverse designs to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The chosen designs were unveiled on September 6, 2019. The obverse, designed by Justin Kunz, will feature three players reaching for a ball. The reverse, designed by Donna Weaver, will feature a basketball falling into a net. Some of the designs not chosen for the Basketball Hall of Fame coins were later submitted to the CCAC for the reverse of the 2020 Massachusetts American Innovation dollar. = Colorization = On July 17, 2019, April Stafford, the chief of the Office of Design Management, stated that the Mint was considering colorizing the half dollar and silver dollar coins. The Mint confirmed later that year that those coins would be colorized, becoming the first such coins released from the Mint. The idea of colorized coins brought mixed responses from the numismatic community. One reader of Coin World opined negatively that the Mint would be mimicking the Royal Canadian Mint's \\"plan of turning out trinkets\\". However, some welcomed the prospect of coloring.

Public use As a strict nature reserve, the Yalta Reserve's primary purpose is protection of nature and scientific study. Public access is limited: mass recreation and construction of facilities is prohibited as are hunting and fishing. The reserve does support environmental education, and maintains a number of \\"ecological trails\\" that are open to public hikers. As with all reserves on the Crimean Peninsula, ownership is subject to dispute.

Naming According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, , meaning \\"the glen of water\\", is from the glen on the south-east side of this peak.

The green Connemara marble is quarried in Barr na n√ìr√°n, which was first started by Thomas Barnwall Martin in the 1820s. Geography Benglenisky is the second southernmost peak of the Twelve Bens after Benlettery , and lies at the western edge of the range. Benglenisky is connected to the range by a high north-easterly ridge to the peak of Bengower ; this ridge forms a fork which also connects neighboring Benlettery to Bengower. Benglenisky sits off the main ridge of the six Bens that form a horseshoe around the valley of the Glencoaghan River (also known as the Glencoaghan Horseshoe), and is thus less frequented. Benglenisky is the lowest of the core Twelve Bens, and only meets the mountain classification of an Arderin. Its relative positioning at the southern end of the range, jutting out on its own ridge, means that it often appears as a scenic backdrop to Ballynahinch Castle and the Ballynahinch Lake, however, it is still overshadowed by its more dramatic neighbour, Benlettery, with its striking \\"pyramidal\\" profile. Hill walking As with Benlettery, Benglenisky's accessibility means that it can be summited as a standalone 5-kilometre 2-3 hour climb (starting and ending at the Ben Lettery An Oige youth hostel); however, the high ridge Benglenisky shares with the peaks of Bengower and Benlettery, means that it is also climbed as part a 7-kilometre 3-4 hour horseshoe loop-walk with these peaks.

Bruun. Created by Harvard art historian Joseph Koerner, the film explores Viennese architectural Modernism through the story of Koerner's father, painter Henry Koerner, who escaped Vienna after Adolf Hitler's annexation of Austria. Part documentary, part personal narrative, part dream sequence, the film deals with fundamental questions of home, memory, trauma, and exile.  Synopsis  A painting haunts Joseph Koerner. It shows his grandparents before they vanished in the Holocaust. The film follows Joseph's return to Vienna to solve the riddle of their disappearance.  About  The film follows Joseph Koerner as he investigates the fate of his grandparents and their Viennese home ‚Äì known only through a painting by his exiled father. Made in 1944, the painting lovingly details the grandparents‚Äô apartment, the private sanctuary from which they were taken and from which their son‚Äî artist Henry Koerner, Joseph's father and the painting's creator‚Äîbarely escaped in 1938. With his father's painting as his guide, Joseph visits historians, archivists, architects, and artists who conjure Vienna's passion for homemaking‚Äîthe apartments, bars, galleries, and sanatoria that are the triumphs of modern interior design. He enters interiors created by Otto Wagner, Gustav Klimt, Josef Hoffmann, Adolf Loos, Sigmund Freud and others that bring to light dark recesses of the soul. Joseph's journey also passes through a maze of state and municipal archives, where Joseph uncovers the history of his grandparents‚Äô home after the catastrophe brought about by the Anschluss‚ÄîHitler's annexation of Austria and the systematic destruction of the homes and families of Viennese Jews, who sought safe haven in the city after centuries of persecution. Joseph also enters the workshop of a master shoemaker, heir to an establishment boasting the \\"imperial and royal\\" Habsburg patent that made shoes for the nobility. The present shoemaker's family history is one of multi-generational belonging to Vienna, though haunted by the past, including fate of a Jewish tailor in the same building. His story plays off against Joseph's. The film discovers Joseph receiving repaired shoes back from this shoemaker, who describes his products as interiors that wearers carry with them. Completed eighty years after the Anschluss, the film unfolds through thirteen chapters, called \\"Stellen\\" (German for \\"stations\\"), that move through Vienna's urban and psychic interior to a buried past, when dreams of home became, for a city's most ardent homemakers, an unimaginable nightmare. The word \\"Stellen\\" references Otto Wagner's theory of infrastructural transit nodes that characterize belonging in the modern metropolis as necessarily in motion. The film's interviews are set in representative interiors that are simultaneously closed off from the city and invaded by movement in the form of subterranean waters, subways, tunnels, back entrances, etc. Movement between these interiors is disorienting, as in a dream. Towards the end, the film reveals that its locations and the camera's point of view repeat paintings painted by Joseph's father, which were themselves repetitions of the grandparent's walks. The shoemaker, a water scientist, and the expert interviewees are cast as characters in an unfolding sequence of accidental and fated tableaux. The past is repeated rather than recovered.  Plot  Entering Vienna in aerial shots and by train in the morning from the west, with the flow of the Danube River, Joseph visits the Imperial Pavilion, a station at Hietzing of the Wiener Stadtbahn designed by Otto Wagner to take the Emperor by train from his summer residence Sch√∂nbrunn Palace to the Hofburg and his offices in center city. A famous interior designed by Wagner, the Pavilion, straddling the tracks of the Stadtbahn, supposes Franz Joseph I of Austria to be a busy, nervous commuter needing to be comforted by nature imagery and directed by modern architectural signage and design. The film transitions to Freud's home and offices at Berggasse 19, where we learn about Freud's home-making efforts and the peculiar space he created for patients: the psychoanalytical consultation room as utopian domestic setting that projects patients back to family and home. We learn about Freud's flight from Vienna in 1938 and the fate of his apartment at Berggasse 19‚Äîit became a collective apartment for Jews to be sent to the death camps. Wagner's Stadtbahn carries Joseph to the exposed bed of the Wien (river) where he encounters water ecologist Stefan Schmutz releasing baby sturgeons. Sturgeons, Schmutz explains, are born with a homing instinct: they return to spawn where they were born. Flowing underground the river takes Joseph to the Vienna Secession, where Vienna's foremost artists and architects (Olbrich, Klimt, Hoffmann, Koloman Moser and others) imagined futuristic dream homes for their largely Jewish clientele. Speaking before Klimt's Beethoven Frieze, artist and theorist Peter Weibel explains Freud's theory of the Uncanny, where home is familiar and strange, built architecture and psychic space. The story of interior design, as an artistic and psychic process, passes to Josef Hoffmann's modernist Sanatorium Purkersdorf, Adolf Loos' American Bar and Looshaus on Michaelerplatz, artist Bernhard Leitner's sound- art studio in Upper Austria, and shoemaker Rudolf Scheer & Sons, to the archives at the heart of Vienna. There Joseph learns of the facts of his grandparents murder in the Maly Trostinets extermination camp. Joseph walks to the site of his father's disappeared Viennese home. To the sound of a late 1920s recording of an old-fashioned aria from Erich Wolfgang Korngold's \\"Die tote Stadt,\\" a montage of photographs taken by his father in Vienna in 1946 gives way to a full view of the painting and the lost home it depicts. The film ends with an extended coda. Joseph visits an elderly holocaust survivor, Edith Brickell, whose parents also died at Maly Trostinets. Able to reclaim her Vienna apartment after the war, she reports that dreams she had of her parents surviving ceased after she moved back into that apartment. The film ends on an abandoned beach at the eastern outskirts of Vienna, where the Danube departs from the city. Joseph chances on an centenarian bather who at first dimly remembers Henry Koerner, then recovers precise memories of him. A refugee from communist Yugoslavia, the old man declares the beach to be his ersatz home. Children replace the bather and his memories, the Danube is shown flowing from the Prater Spitz eastward into Hungary, and a closing aerial shot glimpses Vienna coming into view again from the west, with the voice of Adam Phillips reflecting on secret spaces of home.  Title  The phrase \\"The Burning Child\\" comes from a story told by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams. The story involves the waking situation of a child‚Äôs corpse accidentally catching on fire while the exhausted father, asleep in a room next door, dreams the child stands by his bed, catches him by the arm, ‚Äúand whisper[s] reproachfully, ‚ÄòFather, don‚Äôt you see I‚Äôm burning.‚Äô‚Äù Freud, Sigmund, (2010). The interpretation of dreams. Strachey, James. New York: Basic Books A Member of the Perseus Books Group, p. 513. In the film, Freud's words (unidentified) are read in voiceover by Adam Phillips, first, in part, as the title sequence of the film, then, in full, after the interview with survivor Edith Brickell. Set implicitly in a Jewish home, the dream story concern relations between sleep and waking life, and between generations divided by trauma.  Production  The Burning Child was filmed on location in and around Vienna, except for scenes filmed at the Freud Museum in London and in the consultation room of British psychologist Adam Phillips. Notable locations in Vienna include Sigmund Freud's home in Berggasse 19, Aggstein Castle ruins in Wachau, Otto Wagner's Hofpavillon in Hietzing, The American Bar by architect Adolph Loos, The Secession Building by architect Joseph Maria Olbrich, Sanatorium Purkersdorf by architect Josef Hoffmann. During production, Joseph Koerner was cast as the character Joseph K., named after Franz Kafka's anti-hero, a name given to Joseph Koerner by his teacher, literary critic Frank Kermode. The film's Viennese locations repeat scenes painted by Henry Koerner. The film was funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation on the basis of the Mellon Distinguished Achievement Award, received by Joseph Koerner in 2009. Koerner presented the historical background to the film in his 2012 Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Cambridge University and 2013 Slade Lectures at Oxford University. In 2018, a 126 minute directors' cut of the film was previewed at Harvard University, the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Yale University Art Gallery, and at the Burgkino in Vienna. Since then the film has had director's screenings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Neue Galerie, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, and the Film Forum at Princeton University. It was an official selection of the 2019 Jerusalem Jewish Film Festival and the 2020 JFilm Festival. Original music by Anthony Cheung evokes the atonalism of the Second Viennese School while also referencing specific motifs from the wider soundtrack that includes modern, historical, and personal recordings of works by Vienna-based composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Gustav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg and Korngold.  Technical  Filming started in 2013. The film was shot by Director of Photography Christian D. Bruun in 4K resolution Sony RAW video in wide format 2.35 aspect ratio. Using the Sony NEX-FS700 camera with a 4K upgrade and recording to the Sony AXS-R5 RAW format recorder module, the film is an early example of a film that was shot and finalized in 4K HDR exhibition format DCP at Technicolor in Hollywood, Los Angeles.  Release  The film was released in 2019. In the Fall 2018 issue of October (No. 166) German art historian Benjamin Buchloh published an extensive interview in conversation with Joseph Leo Koerner about the film. Since the release, Koerner published in Granta an account of the film in light of his subsequent 2019 visit to Maly Trostinets.

Nevertheless, the current broadcast contract, which began in 2006, resulted in a sizable increase in total rights fees. Both Fox and CBS renewed their Sunday afternoon broadcast packages through 2011, in both cases with modest increases. Furthermore, the league and DirecTV signed a five-year extension to their exclusivity deal on NFL Sunday Ticket. Despite relatively high, if declining, TV ratings, ABC decided to end its relationship with the NFL after losing significant money on Monday Night Football. In addition to the fees, part of this decision may have been the result of a resurgent ABC prime time entertainment schedule during the 2004‚Äì05 season, particularly on Sunday evening with Desperate Housewives; thus ABC would be unable to satisfy the league's reported preference for a Sunday night game on broadcast television as opposed to Monday. Because of that, Monday Night Football moved from ABC to ESPN, which are both owned by The Walt Disney Company. The cable network paid $1.1 billion per year from 2006 to 2014 for the rights. Unlike the broadcast networks, however, ESPN can generate revenue from subscription sales, in addition to traditional commercial breaks (ESPN's subscriber fees are the highest of any American cable network, more than four times that of second-place TNThttp://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/files/2010/03/cable-sub- fees.png). The cable network's coverage begins at 1:00 p.m. ET with SportsCenter Special Edition: Monday Night Kickoff. The 2009 edition saw the game itself start at 8:30 p.m., with Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, and Jon Gruden in the broadcast booths. Meanwhile, NBC, after losing the AFC package to CBS in 1997, was able to reclaim some broadcast rights with a deal worth an average of $650 million per year to air the Sunday night package from 2006 to 2014 (not much more than what ESPN used to pay for the same rights). This new deal included the Super Bowl in 2009 and 2012. NBC's coverage also includes two preseason games (including the annual Hall of Fame Game), the first two Wild Card playoff games of each post-season, and the annual Thursday opening Kickoff Game, similar to ABC's broadcast rights package. The major difference was that the NFL allowed NBC flexibility in selecting games in the latter part of the season. ABC did not have the right to be flexible with their Monday Night Football schedule and picked matchups based on a team's record in the previous season (as NBC does), which often led to teams with losing records playing each other on Monday night later in the season. The moves were intended to break NBC out of its ratings slump; however, at one point in the last decade, this did not happen, and although NBC Sunday Night Football had been (and continues to be) the network's top rated program and in the top 30 for viewing audience, it had not lifted the rest of the schedule. For a time, NBC had been firmly in fourth place and was losing large sums of money, so much so that the network had to cut an hour of prime time programming from its weeknight schedule in favor of The Jay Leno Show, a somewhat lower budget talk show which lasted five months. The network has since slowly come back to second place in the network ratings. Year-by-year breakdown =2000= Unexpectedly, comedian Dennis Miller joined the Monday Night Football cast in 2000, along with Dan Fouts. The move was ultimately regarded as a bust by many viewers and commentators. ABC briefly considered adding radio personality Rush Limbaugh before Miller was added to the broadcast team, despite having no prior sports broadcast experience (Limbaugh would instead be assigned as a commentator to Sunday NFL Countdown on ABC sister ESPN). Miller demonstrated a knowledge of the game and its personalities, although at times he tended to lapse into sometimes obscure analogy-riddled streams of consciousness similar to the \\"rants\\" of his standup comedy act. ABC even set up a webpage dedicated to explaining Miller's sometimes obscure pop culture references. Soon, it would become apparent that Miller's comedy did not mix with football. In June 2000, Lesley Visser's career suffered a highly publicized setback when she was famously bounced as the Monday Night Football sideline reporter for a less experienced, much younger woman and a man, who did not have as extensive journalistic credentials as Visser. \\"It was staggering to me\\", Visser later recalled. However, she wound up returning to CBS Sports, philosophical as ever. \\"You can have a short career if it's based on looks and youth\\", she said, \\"but legitimacy is what lasts.\\" Which ABC replaced her with both Melissa Stark and Eric Dickerson. This was part of the overhaul when ABC brought back Don Ohlmeyer to serve as producer, who installed Dennis Miller as an analyst (for ultimately two unsuccessful seasons). She sued ABC Sports for age discrimination, with Howard Katz and Ohlmeyer being named as co-defendants. As previously mentioned, in 2000, Don Ohlmeyer, the program's producer up until 1977 was brought back. After spending time at NBC, Ohlmeyer was lured out of retirement to spark interest and provide some vigor to the broadcast. Besides the on-air talent, Ohlmeyer's changes included clips of players introducing themselves, new graphics and music. In another rather irreverent move, the scoring bug began incorporating nicknames for the teams, such as \\"Skins\\" and \\"Fins\\" (for the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins) instead of their respective common abbreviations, WSH and MIA. On October 23, 2000, the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins competed in what is now known as The Monday Night Miracle. Trailing 30‚Äì7 in the fourth quarter, Vinny Testaverde led the Jets to score 23 consecutive points to tie the game. After Miami scored another touchdown, Testaverde threw to offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott to tie the game at 37-all. At 1:08 a.m. Eastern Time, the game having crossed into Tuesday morning, John Hall kicked a field goal in overtime to win the game 40‚Äì37. It was the second biggest fourth quarter comeback in NFL history and biggest comeback in Jets' history. Arnold Schwarzenegger predicted the comeback at halftime, where he was appearing with the MNF crew to promote his upcoming movie, The 6th Day. With the Jets already down by 20 points he said, \\"Wayne Chrebet will catch a pass and the Jets will win. They're a great team.\\" =2001= On January 28, 2001, CBS Sports, Core Digital and Princeton Video Image introduced state-of-the-art, three-dimensional replay technology called \\"EyeVision\\" for its coverage of Super Bowl XXXV in Tampa (at Raymond James Stadium). The game, CBS Sports' first Super Bowl broadcast since 1992, drew 131.2 million viewers for the Baltimore Ravens win over the New York Giants. As a result, Super Bowl XXXV was the most watched television program that year. Play-by-play announcer Greg Gumbel became the first African-American announcer to call a major sports championship; he was joined in the broadcast booth with Phil Simms. Both of the Ravens' Super Bowl championships to date have been on CBS; the CBS-owned station in Baltimore, WJZ-TV, had been, as an ABC affiliate, one of the strongest TV stations for Monday Night Football for most of the 1980s and early 1990s, due to Baltimore's previous NFL team, the Colts' move to Indianapolis. For the 2001 NFL season, the program moved part- time from the CBS Broadcast Center to a new outdoor studio on the site of the General Motors Building, on 5th Avenue and 59th Street in Manhattan. The set, which was used during the fall, was set up on Sunday mornings at a plaza in the area near the building that later became the reflecting glass structure of the Apple Store, next to the southeast corner of Central Park. During the winter, The NFL Today was broadcast indoors from Studio 43 at the CBS Broadcast Center. The 2001 season of MNF featured a season-long campaign promoting the anticipated 20,000th point scored in MNF history. Denver Broncos kicker Jason Elam completed the task with a field goal during a 38‚Äì28 loss at Oakland on November 5. The three points also put Elam over 1,000 points for his career. In addition, the scoring bug reverted to using the team abbreviations, as opposed to the nickname scheme used in the previous season. The 2001‚Äì02 NFL playoffs marked the first time that the league scheduled prime time playoff games for the first two rounds, in an attempt to attract more viewers. Saturday wild card and divisional playoff games were moved from 12:30 and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time to 4:30 and 8:00 p.m., respectively. As a result, the league abandoned its practice of scheduling playoff games held mainly in colder, northern regions for daylight hours only; any stadium, regardless of evening January temperatures, could host prime time playoff games. =2002= In 2002, the NFL began scheduling a Thursday night special opening \\"Kickoff\\" game, taking place on the Thursday after Labor Day leading into the opening Sunday slate of NFL games. The event includes a pre-game concert and other televised festivities. The first series of these events were held in New York and Washington, D.C., respectively, to celebrate both cities' resilience in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.NFL Scores: 2007 ‚Äì Super Bowl The 2002 San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants game was held on September 5 and televised on ESPN. The 2003 edition featured the Washington Redskins hosting the New York Jets on September 4, 2003, and the game was televised by ABC. Since 2006, NBC has televised the Kickoff game (see below). The NFL Today was rebooted again after the 2001 season with Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason joining Nantz and Sanders. Sanders left the broadcast team after Super Bowl XXXVIII to return to the NFL, playing for the Baltimore Ravens until 2004. Nantz followed shortly thereafter, being promoted to lead play-by-play broadcaster. In 2002, the Monday Night Football broadcast debuted the \\"Horse Trailer\\" award, in which a picture of the game's top performer(s) is displayed, as chosen by the broadcasting crew. During the fourth quarter of a preseason game early that season, Madden was joking about doing some recording in the \\"Horse Trailer\\", a term the producers used for one of the ABC production trucks. It was, in fact, a custom-built trailer designed from the shell of a horse trailer, but housed sophisticated electronic equipment inside it. By the first week of the regular season, an idea to decorate the plain white trailer with MNF decor, the entire MNF schedule, and a weekly MVP, was born. Immediately following each game, the winner(s) is chosen, and his picture is affixed to the trailer in the corresponding location. When Madden and Michaels went to NBC in 2006, they debuted a similar feature, the Rock Star ‚Äì in which the photo of the player of the game was attached to the top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City (the \\"Horse Trailer\\" concept was reinstated for the 2007 season). In addition to Fouts and Madden helming the regular season broadcasts, Brent Musburger and Gary Danielson served as commentators for that year's AFC Wild Card game, with Jack Arute serving as the sideline reporter. After suffering through several years of dismal Pro Bowl ratings, ABC considered moving the game to Monday night. In February 2003, Madden declined to serve as color commentator for the game in Hawaii, citing his fear of flying; former MNF personality Dan Fouts took his place. The Pro Bowl held the following year was played on a Sunday as typical, but was moved to ABC's sister network ESPN. =2003= At the start of the 2003 regular season, CBS Sports introduced Posthumus Zone as the new theme music for The NFL Today and for the network's NFL game telecasts. The song was composed by Los Angeles electronica group E.S. Posthumus, so named because it composes songs that have no-longer-existing ancient cities as a motif. In 2006, Posthumus Zone and a remixed version titled Rise to Glory were included as tracks on the group's second CD release, Rise to Glory. The song Rise to Glory was also featured on The NFL Today and on CBS' NFL broadcasts during the 2005 season. In 2003, ABC and the NFL dropped the Monday Night Football game for the final week of the regular season. The move, which had been in effect for the first eight years of the broadcast (1970‚Äì1977), was the result of declining ratings, as well as problems involved for potential playoff teams, as there was a potential of only four days rest between their final regular season game and first-round playoff game. ABC replaced the telecast with an opening weekend Thursday night game, and in exchange ESPN got a Saturday night game on the final weekend. Also during the 2003 season, Lisa Guerrero decided to leave Fox Sports Net's The Best Damn Sports Show Period to join the MNF television crew as a sideline reporter (replacing the pregnant Melissa Stark). Guerrero's performance on the broadcast was heavily criticized, and the following year (also in an apparent move away from the \\"eye candy\\" concept) ABC replaced her with longtime TV sports journalist Michele Tafoya. Guerrero defended herself by saying that the show hired her with the intention of going in a totally different direction with the job of sideline reporter ‚Äì personality-driven and feature-driven ‚Äì then discarded all of that and told her to just do the job in the usual fashion. She said that she never would have taken the job if she had known that they would change their minds like that. In 2005, Michele Tafoya sat out much of the season while on maternity leave, with Sam Ryan temporarily taking her place. During the October 6, 2003 game between the Indianapolis Colts and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Indianapolis was trailing 35‚Äì14 with 3:43 remaining. The Colts had returned a Tampa Bay kickoff 90 yard to the 11-yard line, setting up a quick score. The Colts recovered an onside kick and scored again to narrow the margin to 35‚Äì28. They forced a Bucs punt and with less than two minutes remaining, Peyton Manning led an 87-yard drive to score the game-tying touchdown with 35 seconds left in regulation. In overtime, kicker Mike Vanderjagt missed a 40-yard field goal, but Simeon Rice was called for a leaping penalty, a rarely seen unsportsmanlike conduct infraction that penalizes a player for running and jumping to block a kick and landing on other players. Vanderjagt's subsequent kick was batted and hit the upright, but fell in good, winning the game for the Colts. Vanderjagt went on to become the second kicker in NFL history not to miss either a field goal or extra point in a single season after Gary Anderson, who accomplished the feat in the 1998 season as a member of the Minnesota Vikings. Vanderjagt did not miss a kick in the playoffs either, making him the first kicker to accomplish that feat (Anderson missed a field goal in the 1998-99 NFC Championship Game). On December 22, 2003, Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre put on one of the most defining moments of his career (while also ranking among his greatest game ever). The day before the contest against the Oakland Raiders, his father, Irvin, died suddenly of a heart attack. Favre elected to play, passing for four touchdowns in the first half, and 399 yards for the game in a 41‚Äì7 destruction of the Raiders (receiving applause from the highly partisan \\"Raider Nation\\"). Afterwards, Brett said, =2004= Starting in 2004, the NFL began awarding the opening game to the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense. The unfurling of the team's Super Bowl championship banner in their stadium has become a centerpiece of the opening ceremonies. Also in, 2004, Jim Nantz and Greg Gumbel swapped roles on CBS's NFL broadcasts. Nantz took Gumbel's place as the lead play-by-play announcer while Gumbel took Nantz's spot as the host of The NFL Today. On ESPN Sunday Night Football, Pat Summerall replaced Mike Patrick for the preseason and for several regular season weeks following Patrick's recovery from open-heart surgery. On November 15, 2004, controversy shrouded Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens when he appeared with actress Nicollette Sheridan (one of the stars of the new hit ABC comedy-drama Desperate Housewives) in an introductory skit which opened that evening's MNF telecast, in which Owens and the Eagles played the Cowboys at Texas Stadium. The skit was widely condemned as being sexually suggestive (see video) and ABC was forced to apologize for airing it (the Eagles went on to win the game, 49-21, with Owens catching three touchdown passes). However, on March 14, 2005, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that the skit did not violate decency standards, because it contained no outright nudity or foul language. Originally, John Madden was supposed to appear in the commercial. =2005= For the 2005 season, which would become ABC's final season as the MNF broadcaster and used through Super Bowl XL, ABC converted its scoring bug into a horizontal time-score banner placed across the bottom of the screen. On December 5, 2005, in a game dubbed \\"The Monday Night Massacre\\" by NFL Films, the Seattle Seahawks shut out the Philadelphia Eagles 42‚Äì0 with three defensive touchdowns (two interceptions, one fumble return) to tie the then- largest margin of victory mark in Monday Night Football history and set the mark for the greatest margin of victory in a Monday night shutout, as well as setting the NFL record for scoring the most points with less than 200 yards of offense. Andre Dyson scored twice for the Seahawks defense, once on a 72-yard interception return and the other on a 25-yard fumble return, earning himself the \\"Horse Trailer Player of the Game\\" as well as NFC defensive player of the week. A fourth interception return by Michael Boulware fell just short of tying another Seahawks NFL record of four defensive scores in a single game, set during a 45‚Äì0 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in 1984. The defeat was the Eagles third worst in team history. This was due to the Eagles' major injuries including star quarterback Donovan McNabb . The Eagles also lost their star running back Brian Westbrook due to an injury in this game. Despite high ratings, ABC lost millions of dollars on televising the games during the late 1990s and 2000s. The NFL also indicated that it wanted Sunday night to be the new night for its marquee game, because more people tend to watch television on Sundays, and games held on that night would be more conducive to flexible scheduling, a method by which some of the NFL's best games could be moved from the afternoon to the evening on Sunday on short notice. Given these factors, as well as the rise of ABC's ratings on Sunday night, and the network's wish of protecting its Desperate Housewives franchise (which they knew would be costly), on April 18, 2005, ABC and the NFL announced the end of their 36-year partnership, with the Monday Night Football broadcasts being moved to ESPN starting with the 2006 season; the move was criticized by some of the Disney shareholders (as well as NFL fans and purists). However, ESPN's ability to collect subscription fees from cable and satellite providers, in addition to selling commercials, made it more likely that ESPN could turn a profit on NFL telecasts, as opposed to ABC's heavy losses. The final Monday Night Football broadcast on ABC aired on December 26, 2005, when the New York Jets hosted the New England Patriots from Giants Stadium. Coincidentally, both the first and last ABC Monday Night Football game telecasts ended with a score of 31‚Äì21 with the Jets on the losing end. Vinny Testaverde holds the distinction of throwing the last TD pass in ABC's MNF telecast history; it was to wide receiver Laveranues Coles. Also, Testaverde's pass set an NFL record: most consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass, 19 seasons (1987‚Äì2005). Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel set a record of note during that last ABC telecast, becoming the first player to catch two touchdown passes and record a quarterback sack in the same game. The final play of the ABC era was a Pats kneeldown by 44-year-old reserve quarterback Doug Flutie. John Madden said at the show's ending: During its final NFL television contract, ABC was awarded the telecasts to Super Bowl XXXIV, Super Bowl XXXVII and Super Bowl XL. With the end of ABC's contract, the Super Bowl XL broadcast was the network's final NFL telecast until 2016, when they simulcasted ESPN's Wild Card game production. To replace Monday Night Football, ABC turned its series of primetime college football specials, which had run until 1975 and again from 1990 to 1993 and from 1996 onward, into a regular series. The network also acquired the rights to the CMA Awards ceremony. The Monday after ABC's final Monday Night game saw the premiere of Dancing With the Stars. To replace Sunday Night Football ESPN moved its late-season Sunday Night Baseball broadcasts back to the network and replaced most of the rest of the open weeks with NBA telecasts. After the 2005 season, James Brown left Fox to return to CBS Sports, where he would become the host of the CBS network's NFL pregame show The NFL Today. On August 16, 2006, after weeks of speculation, the network officially announced that Joe Buck would take over the role as host vacated by Brown. The move also resulted in the show switching from being broadcast from a permanent Los Angeles studio to a portable studio configuration, similar to the pregame show for NASCAR on Fox, in which analysts Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson joined Buck at the stadium site to which Buck is assigned as play-by-play announcer for one of that week's telecasts. Curt Menefee worked all halftime shows and all postgame shows on Sundays when no doubleheader was scheduled, also from the same game site with the same analysts. Menefee hosted Fox NFL Sunday during the several weeks in October when Buck was not available; during that time, Buck called Major League Baseball postseason games, including the World Series. The pregame shows on October 15, 22 and 29 were broadcast from the Los Angeles studios; the show returned to the road on November 5. After NBC lost its NFL rights to CBS at the end of the 1997 season, it in the process, marked the beginning of a slow decline for its sports division, culminating in the unproductive 2004‚Äì05 prime time season (despite heavy lineup promotion during the 2004 Summer Olympics), when NBC carried no major sporting championships during prime time (NBC had already lost Major League Baseball broadcasting rights in 2000 and National Basketball Association rights in 2002; the network had acquired National Hockey League rights in 2004, but that league was involved in a lockout that season). The other major sport on NBC was the NASCAR Winston/Nextel Cup Series. NBC's attempts to replace the NFL with other professional football, including the XFL in 2001 and the Arena Football League coverage from 2003 to 2006, proved to be very unsuccessful. Like CBS before it, NBC would later decide that not having NFL rights did too much damage to its overall ratings to justify foregoing the high rights fees required. In 2005, NBC re-entered the NFL picture during negotiations for television contracts. The network was able to take advantage of a league desire to be able to switch the schedule so non-competitive games would not air in the league's marquee timeslot. Since this would require a move to Sunday night in order for this to happen, and since ABC decided to relinquish their rights to Monday Night Football, NBC was able to bid on the Sunday Night Football package and won the rights after ESPN (corporate sibling to ABC and which had previously held those rights) elected to take over the Monday Night Football rights instead. NBC resumed airing NFL football on August 6, 2006, with coverage of the annual AFC-NFC Hall of Fame Game. NBC's rights package nearly identical to the previous ABC package; in addition to the Hall of Fame Game, the contract gave NBC the rights to one additional preseason game, the National Football League Kickoff game, and two Saturday playoff games. NBC also received the rights to two Super Bowls in its bidding, Super Bowl XLIII and Super Bowl XLVI as well as the Pro Bowls in each of those two years. ABC did not have the right to be flexible with their Monday Night Football schedule and picked matchups based on a team's record in the previous season (as NBC does), which often led to teams with losing records playing each other on Monday night later in the season. The moves were intended to break NBC out of its ratings slump; however, this did not happen right away, and although NBC Sunday Night Football is the network's top-rated program and places in the top 30 among all broadcast network programs, it had no effect on the rest of the network's schedule for several years. =2006= On February 6, 2006, CBS Sports announced the return of James Brown, who left CBS eleven years earlier to become studio host of Fox NFL Sunday, to the network as the host of The NFL Today beginning with the 2006 NFL season. Greg Gumbel moved back to play-by- play duties, teaming with Dan Dierdorf as part of its secondary announcing team, replacing Dick Enberg. Lesley Visser returned to The NFL Today after a two-year hiatus in her previous role as feature reporter, a position she continues to hold to this day; meanwhile, Bonnie Bernstein left the network to pursue other broadcasting opportunities. Aside from Visser returning to the show, Sam Ryan joined CBS Sports in June 2006, as a reporter for The NFL Today; Ryan left the network after the 2010 NFL season. Al Michaels, the longtime voice of Monday Night Football and other events for ABC, moved to NBC to become the play-by-play announcer for Sunday Night Football. Michaels was originally slated to continue calling Monday Night Football for ESPN, but a trade was worked out between NBC and The Walt Disney Company, the parent company of ABC and ESPN. In the trade, Michaels was able to join NBC in exchange for Disney acquiring from NBC's corporate sibling Universal Pictures, among other things, the rights to the cartoon character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, which was created at Universal by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks before the founding of Disney's studio (and then given to Walter Lantz, whose most famous creation would be Woody Woodpecker). Tom Hammond was NBC's secondary play-by- play announcer, calling one of NBC's two games on Wild Card Weekend. John Madden (who had last worked with Al Michaels on Monday Night Football for ABC) was one of the first people hired by NBC, chosen to continue as a color analyst. Cris Collinsworth substituted for Madden when he was unavailable, called Wild Card games alongside Hammond until 2008, and took over on a permanent basis for the 2009 season when Madden announced his retirement from broadcasting on April 16, 2009. Prior to this, he served as a studio analyst for NBC's pregame show, Football Night in America. For the 2009 season, Joe Theismann and Joe Gibbs took Collinsworth's place in the booth for the first game of Wild Card Weekend. Andrea Kremer meanwhile, was the sideline reporter. The first regular season game to be shown by NBC under this contract, between the Miami Dolphins and the Pittsburgh Steelers, aired on September 7, 2006, followed by the first Sunday-night game ‚Äì between the Indianapolis Colts and New York Giants ‚Äì on September 10, 2006. The actual first game of the run ‚Äì the 2006 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game between the Oakland Raiders and Philadelphia Eagles ‚Äì was televised on August 6, 2006. The graphics, logos and scoreboard for NBC's Sunday Night Football telecasts were designed by Troika Design Group, along with the city skyline graphics used in the introductions to both Football Night in America and the games proper. It was effectively the first time the network used permanent time/score boxes throughout any of their sports broadcasts outside of Olympic Games broadcasts, where permanent scoring displays were compulsory; prior to 2006, the network continued the previous mode of presenting the scores on-screen for a short time every few minutes or so, a method common in American sports broadcasting until Fox introduced constant scoring displays in 1994. NBC's game telecasts use the same type of horizontal bottom-screen scoreboard that Monday Night Football used in the 2005 NFL season (and was subsequently used by ABC Sports until its rebranding in August 2006). After its debut, the graphics also began to be phased in across other NBC Sports properties, including its coverage of Notre Dame football and the annual Bayou Classic game (which uses exactly the same graphics used on SNF broadcasts), National Hockey League coverage (which uses the SNF graphics but with a scoreboard on the top), and tennis and golf (which use a modified version influenced by the look, but with bolder text for readability purposes). NBC's Olympics coverage continues to use a different package mixed between NBC's graphics and those of the IOC's world feed. The NBC football graphics are also used, in some form or another, on certain locally produced preseason telecasts carried by NBC owned-and-operated stations and affiliates that serve as flagship outlets for NFL teams (such as New York Giants preseason games on WNBC, and the Minnesota Vikings on KARE- TV). In the 2006 season, in addition to the World Series off-week, there was no game scheduled for Christmas Eve night; NBC broadcast that week's game (Eagles at Cowboys) on Christmas afternoon instead. A half-hour version of Football Night in America aired before the Christmas game and the two \\"Wild Card Saturday\\" games. During the 2006 season, no game was initially scheduled for NBC in the affected weeks ‚Äì instead, the schedule slot for the NBC game was left vacant, with one Sunday afternoon game being moved to the primetime slot (the schedule for the affected weeks simply read \\"one of these games will move to 8:15 Eastern\\"). CBS and Fox could each protect four of its games during Weeks 10 through 15 and also each protect one of its games for Week 17; however, these two networks had to decide which games to protect in early October 2006, after Week 4 of the NFL season. As late as 2006, CBS aired only three of its NFL games in high-definition each week, the same number of games it had aired for the past few seasons. The other networks that held rights to broadcast NFL games ‚Äì NBC, NFL Network and ESPN ‚Äì broadcast all of their games in high definition, and Fox broadcast up to six in HD. Because of this, some fans accused CBS of being \\"cheap.\\" Beginning with the 2007 season, CBS began airing five of the Sunday games in high definition television on doubleheader weeks, and six on singleheader weeks. Former CBS Sports Executive Vice President Tony Petitti (who left CBS in April 2008 to become the head of the newly-established MLB Network) claimed the network would probably air all of its NFL games in high definition by 2009. When asked about the move, Petitti commented that CBS was focused on building a new studio for The NFL Today pre- game show. However, another CBS executive had previously indicated that, because CBS was an \\"early adopter\\" with its first HD game in 1998, it is already \\"at capacity\\" and would have to replace newly purchased equipment in its network center with even more expensive equipment. However, CBS did carry its entire slate of games in 2009 in HD, though a few non-essential camera positions for some games (mainly used only in analysis situations) continued to be shot in 4:3 SD. ESPN's first Monday night broadcast was a preseason game held on August 14, 2006, when the Oakland Raiders visited the Minnesota Vikings, publicized as the return of Randy Moss to Minnesota for the first time since the Vikings traded him after the 2004 season. The telecast debuted with brand-new graphics, including a time-score box placed in the lower center of the screen; a variation of the MNF graphics began to be used on almost all sporting events televised by ESPN and ABC (the former of which effectively took over full responsibility of ABC's sports division that year, which was rebranded as ESPN on ABC). The first regular season Monday Night Football game to air on ESPN was on September 11, 2006, featuring the visiting Minnesota Vikings at the Washington Redskins at FedExField, in which the Vikings won 19‚Äì16. The September 25 edition of Monday Night Football highlighted the New Orleans Saints' first game back in the Louisiana Superdome following Hurricane Katrina to take on the Atlanta Falcons. The game had a Super Bowl-like atmosphere with performances by the Goo Goo Dolls, U2 and Green Day before the game. The NFL tapped producer Don Mischer and director Hamish Hamilton to produce the event. Former President George H. W. Bush handled the pregame coin toss. The Saints beat the Falcons 23‚Äì3 in what now ranks as one of the most- watched events in the history of cable television. ESPN's October 23, 2006 game telecast between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys drew the largest audience in the history of cable television at the time, besting the previous mark set by a 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) debate between Al Gore and Ross Perot. An average of 16,028,000 viewers (12.8 rating) watched as the Giants defeated the Cowboys, 36‚Äì22. ESPN's Monday Night Football telecasts now account for eight of the ten highest-rated programs in cable television history. What would eventually be named the \\"NFL's comeback of the year\\" was played on Monday Night Football on October 16. Late in the third quarter, the massive underdog Arizona Cardinals led the Chicago Bears 23‚Äì3. Arizona seemed to have the game wrapped up, as rookie quarterback Matt Leinart was having a great day, and Arizona had forced six turnovers out of Chicago quarterback Rex Grossman. Chicago's defense then went on to score 14 points on fumble returns for touchdowns. With 2:58 left in the fourth quarter, and down 17‚Äì23, Chicago's Devin Hester returned a punt for a touchdown to take a 24‚Äì23 lead. Leinart then led the Cardinals down the field, only to have Neil Rackers miss a field goal, and Chicago went on to win. On November 17, 2006, a source told the Los Angeles Times that the final two pregame shows of the 2006 season would take place in the Los Angeles studios, with Joe Buck hosting and Dick Stockton taking Buck's place on play-by-play duties at the games alongside Troy Aikman. The source cited that declining ratings no longer justified its high production costs, including security expenses. A Fox spokesman would only say that changes were being considered. At the conclusion of the 2006 season, ESPN had managed to secure all of the cable television audience records. Monday Night Football and its surrounding shoulder programming also became the most profitable franchise on cable television. CBS' coverage of the AFC Championship Game earned a 28.1 rating, which topped the season premiere of American Idol on Fox. Its Super Bowl XLI broadcast drew the third largest television audience in history, finishing behind only its broadcast of the M*A*S*H finale (\\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\") in 1983 and NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XXX (Dallas and Pittsburgh) from 1996. Super Bowl XLI was the second most watched Super Bowl broadcast of all-time, averaging 93.1 million viewers. =2007= During Wild Card weekend, Curt Menefee substituted for Joe Buck as host of the Hollywood-originated pregame show broadcast on Fox. Meanwhile, Buck called the January 7, 2007 game between the New York Giants at the Philadelphia Eagles. During the Divisional Playoffs, Menefee once again substituted for Joe Buck as host, as the pregame show again originated from Hollywood for both games. Stockton called the Saturday, January 13 game between the Philadelphia Eagles at the New Orleans Saints and Buck called the Sunday, January 14 game between the Seattle Seahawks at the Chicago Bears. For the NFC Championship Game between the New Orleans Saints and Chicago Bears on January 21, 2007, Joe Buck hosted the pregame show with the Fox NFL Sunday crew on location from Soldier Field. After Buck joined Aikman for play-by-play duties, Menefee took over as host for the remainder of the game and hosted the halftime and postgame shows. Terry Bradshaw handled the trophy ceremony during the postgame show. After the 2006 NFL season, Fox NFL Sunday returned to the Los Angeles studio throughout the entire 2007 regular season and for the two weeks of that year's postseason. Curt Menefee became the full-time host of the pregame show, while Joe Buck reverted to strictly handling play-by-play duties. For the first time since NBC gained the rights to Sunday Night Football, a tentative full-season schedule was unveiled, including games in the last seven weeks of the season. Those games could be replaced under flexible scheduling if the need arose. The same rules under which CBS and Fox protect games for their own packages still apply. In March 2007, it was announced that Fox NFL Sunday (then branded on-air as The Built Ford Tough Fox NFL Sunday, via a sponsorship agreement with Ford Motor Company) would resume studio broadcasts for the 2007 season, with Curt Menefee assuming full-time hosting duties and Joe Buck reverting to play-by-play only. Jillian Reynolds, who was coming off maternity leave, returned full-time as the program's weather anchor. However, the pre-game show was on-site at Lambeau Field for the 2007 NFC Championship Game between the New York Giants and the Green Bay Packers and at Super Bowl XLII. Three of the games in the last seven weeks of the season were eventually replaced with more compelling matches. This resulted in the situation ‚Äì twice ‚Äì of having a team playing on consecutive Sunday nights. New England had consecutive Sunday nighters: the November 18 New England at Buffalo game was moved to prime time and was followed on November 25 by the already-scheduled Philadelphia at New England game. Likewise, the Washington Redskins played a scheduled game at the New York Giants on December 16, and their December 23 game in Minnesota was moved to prime time. For the last week of the season, the Tennessee Titans‚ÄìIndianapolis Colts game was moved, switching places with the Kansas City Chiefs‚ÄìNew York Jets game that was originally scheduled in the Sunday night slot; the Titans needed a win to secure the final AFC playoff spot. In addition, the annual preseason Hall of Fame Game telecast was shifted to NFL Network, in anticipation of NBC airing the China Bowl contest from Beijing; however, the China Bowl was canceled. In 2007, CBS added a fifth member to its studio analyst table by adding then-recently retired head coach Bill Cowher. Meanwhile, Fox NFL Sunday introduced a new feature, a pre-recorded segment titled \\"Grumpy Old Coaches\\", in which Jimmy Johnson and fellow former Dallas Cowboys head coach Barry Switzer discuss the past week in football. A segment of highlights and commentary of the previous day's college football games was also featured, as a gesture to Fox's then recent acquisition of broadcast rights to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). This segment was dropped following the 2007 season. For the 2007 season, CBS announced the advent of \\"CBS Eye-lert,\\" a service that allows viewers to be notified via e-mail and text message when the start time of a program will be delayed. The \\"Eye-lert\\" was eventually extended on-air to a banner graphic that appears during the prime time lineup within sports broadcasts and segments of delayed regularly scheduled evening programs. Analyst and former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski replaced Joe Theismann, who was offered a prominent football analyst job with ESPN, in the booth beginning with the 2007 season. Upon the original launch of the Thursday and Saturday night games, few television service providers carried the NFL Network due to disputes during the network's terms in its carriage contracts during negotiations. These disputes were magnified throughout the 2007 season, as two high-profile matchups were to be broadcast by the network. The first was a matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers which was scheduled for the week after Thanksgiving and saw both teams at 10-1, vying for the top seed in the NFC, and the second was Week 17 Saturday night game between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants, where the Patriots had a chance to become the first team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to end a regular season undefeated. In the first case, fans were displeased that a matchup between two teams at such a critical point in the season was not available on broadcast television except in the Dallas and Green Bay markets. To avoid such a problem with the potential sixteenth victory for the Patriots, CBS and NBC bought broadcast rights to the game so it could be seen by a nationwide audience on both cable and broadcast television. This ended up causing another controversy, however, as the move by the networks infringed on the exclusivity that would normally have been enjoyed by WWOR-TV in New York City and WCVB-TV in Boston, which were the Giants' and Patriots' respective local over-the-air broadcasters for cable- televised games (the game aired on these stations, as well as on WCBS-TV, WNBC, WBZ-TV and WHDH in the teams' market areas). On December 3, 2007, 17.5 million people watched the undefeated New England Patriots defeat the Baltimore Ravens, 27‚Äì24. The game became the most-watched single cable television program of all-time by total viewership, breaking the previous record set by the August 17 premiere of High School Musical 2, which was viewed by 17.2 million on ESPN corporate sibling Disney Channel (after the film was surpassed by the Patriots-Ravens game, High School Musical 2 retained the record as the highest-rated non-sports program in basic cable history). =2008= The 2008 schedule, released on April 15, continued the 2007 practice of a scheduled game possibly being moved in favor of a more compelling one during Weeks 11 through 16 (November 16 through December 21), but left the slot open on the final Sunday, December 28. The NFL Kickoff Game between the Washington Redskins and defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants that was played on September 4 started at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time instead of the normal 8:30 p.m. time in order to avoid conflict with the nomination speech that John McCain gave at the Republican National Convention that night; the game ended at 10:01 p.m. Eastern Time, averting any conflict. Starting in 2008, NFL Network eliminated all but one of the Saturday night games and started their Thursday night package three weeks earlier. This was done to accommodate the earlier schedule and the league's antitrust exemption that prohibits Saturday games from being held for most of the season. On June 24, 2008, it was announced that former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan would join Fox NFL Sunday as an analyst.NFL.com On November 8, 2009, a special two-hour edition of the program was broadcast on-location from Afghanistan, featuring an audience of U.S. soldiers. While the regular Fox NFL Sunday crew did the pregame show, Chris Rose served as the studio host and anchored the in-game highlights, as John Lynch and Trent Green served as studio analysts for the halftime and post-game reports during the broadcast. On January 24, 2010, Fox NFL Sunday broadcast on-location from New Orleans for the 2009 NFC Championship. After experiencing low ratings and criticism about the production during the 2007 season, ESPN announced that long-time sideline reporters Suzy Kolber and Michele Tafoya would have reduced roles for the 2008 season. As the 2008 season began, ESPN announced a new focus on covering the games as sporting events rather than as entertainment and cultural events. Among the changes were the removal of celebrity booth guests and a reduction in the number of sideline interviews. Tafoya and Kolber were retained to conduct those interviews and file reports from the field. In addition, ESPN replaced the bottom center-screen time-score box introduced in 2006 (which was used until the 2008 preseason) with a horizontal time-score banner across the bottom of the screen. The September 15, 2008 Eagles-Cowboys game, with a 13.3 rating and 18.6 million viewers, set a new record for the most-watched cable television program, surpassing the record set the previous October by the Patriots-Ravens game. The night before the 2008 United States Presidential Election, Monday Night Football studio host Chris Berman interviewed both major party candidates, Republican nominee John McCain and Democratic nominee Barack Obama at halftime. The November 10, 2008 game featured the Washington Redskins losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 23-6. As had happened in 2007, a team played on consecutive Sunday nights due to a game being moved into the Sunday night time slot. The originally scheduled New York Giants-Dallas Cowboys game on December 14 was followed by a flexed December 21 home game for the Giants against the Carolina Panthers; the Giants-Panthers game was flexed because it carried serious playoff implications, as the winner would clinch the NFC's top seed and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. This was the second of three flexed games, with a December 7 interconference matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and Washington Redskins. The league filled the open spot on December 28 with a game between the Denver Broncos and San Diego Chargers with major playoff implications, as the winner of that game would win the AFC West and earn a home game in the playoffs while the loser would be eliminated. =2009= Super Bowl XLIII was NBC's first Super Bowl broadcast since Super Bowl XXXII, The five-hour pre-game show was preceded by a two-hour special edition of Today hosted by the regular weekday team live from Tampa and the NFL Films ‚Äì produced Road to the Super Bowl. Matt Millen was part of the coverage as a studio analyst. The Today contribution included portions of a taped interview with President Barack Obama and pictures of troops viewing the proceedings in Iraq. His calling of the game made John Madden (in his final game broadcast) the first person to have announced a Super Bowl for each of the four major U.S. television networks, having called five Super Bowls for CBS, three for Fox, and two for ABC prior to joining NBC in 2006; Al Michaels also became the second person (after Pat Summerall on CBS and Fox) to be the lead Super Bowl play-by-play announcer for two different major U.S. networks (ABC and NBC). The Super Bowl was one of two major professional sports championship series NBC broadcast in 2009, as it would also broadcast the Stanley Cup Finals. Both championship series involved teams from Pittsburgh winning championships (the Penguins would win the Stanley Cup that year). The NFL has a strict policy prohibiting networks to run ads during the Super Bowl from the gambling industry, and has rejected ads from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. It had been reported that if the television program Las Vegas was airing when NBC televised Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, they likely would not have been allowed to promote the series during the entire broadcast. As Vegas ended during the 2007‚Äì2008 television season, this was no longer an issue for NBC. With an average U.S. audience of 98.7 million viewers, Super Bowl XLIII was the most-watched Super Bowl in history, and at that point the second-most-watched U.S. television program of any kind (trailing only the final episode of M*A*S*H in 1983; both would be broken by Super Bowl XLIV the following year). However, the Nielsen rating of 42.1, was lower than the 43.3 rating for Super Bowl XLII the previous year. The 2009 schedule, released on April 14, continued the 2007 and 2008 practice of scheduling a game every Sunday night during the season (except during the World Series) but declaring the games in Weeks 11 through 16 (November 22 through December 27) subject to change, should a more compelling matchup arise. The pattern of the 2007 and 2008 schedules was continued, as the slot for the final Sunday night of the season ‚Äì January 3, 2010 ‚Äì was left vacant. Two games were \\"flexed\\" in the 2009 season, as the Minnesota Vikings-Arizona Cardinals game replaced the original December 6 matchup between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins. To fill the vacant game slot for the last week of the season, NBC was given the matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and New York Jets that was originally scheduled for 4:15 p.m. Eastern on CBS, with this game having playoff implications for both teams. For the Jets, a win would have put them in the playoffs, while the Bengals had the potential to improve their seeding for the playoffs with a victory. The Jets-Bengals game ended up being the last game played at Giants Stadium (the Jets could have hosted the AFC Championship game, but the Baltimore Ravens did not hold up their end of the deal). Tony Kornheiser stepped down from Monday Night Football for the 2009 season and was replaced by former Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Jon Gruden. The rest of the team remained intact. In the following season, all references to Saturday Night Football were dropped, and any games that are not played on Thursday (such as in 2016, two Christmas weekend games and an NFL International Series game) have since been branded as \\"special editions\\" of Thursday Night Football, and later Thursday Night Special or NFL Network Special. The Thanksgiving matchup was moved from NFL Network to NBC's Sunday Night Football package as part of the new broadcast contract after the 2011 season. During Super Bowl week in 2012, it was announced that the Thursday Night Football package would expand from eight to 13 games and air on NFL Network, again soliciting and rejecting offers from Turner Sports and Comcast. The October 5, 2009 Packers-Vikings game was the fourth ESPN MNF broadcast to become the most-watched program ever on a cable channel, with a 15.3 rating and 21.839 million viewers. The record stood until it was surpassed by the network's telecast of the BCS National Championship Game on January 10, 2011.

The reserve is in the administrative districts of Olevsk and Ovruch in Zhytomyr Oblast Topography The reserve is located in lowlands between the Uborti and Bolotnisya Rivers, which flow into the Pripyat River. To the north is the border with Belarus, and to the west is Rivne Oblast. The territory is flat, and measures 21 km by 27 km. The relative impassibility of the swamps has protected wildlife in the area. Climate and ecoregion The climate of the Polissia reserve is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four months averaging over , but no month averaging over .. In the reserve, average winter temperatures are , and in the summer. The reserve is located in the Central European mixed forests ecoregion, a temperate hardwood forest covering much of northeastern Europe, from Germany to Russia. Flora and fauna The dominant vegetation are pine forests (on sandy soils) and sphagnum bogs. In the mixed forests portions there are also birches and alder. In the bogs the peat layer may be up to 5 meters thick. 604 species of vascular plants have been recorded in the site, about half of which are representative of tundra or taiga floral communities that stretch to the north. There are three types of swamps in the reserve. Lowland swamps are fed by mineral-rich groundwater are characterized by sedges, cane, and mosses. Upland swamps are mostly fed by precipitation and occupy mineral-poor soils; they support cotton grass, cranberries, blueberries, and sphagnum moss. In between are transitional swamps with characteristics of both lowland and upland areas. The animals of the reserve are mostly forest species, many of which are found in more northerly taiga - lynx, elk, white hare and owls. The can survive in the Polissia due to the wetness and humidity rather than temperature. Beavers are active in the reserve, impounding water in places. Wolves are also common. Public use As a strict nature reserve, Polissia's primary purpose is protection of nature and scientific study. Public access is limited: mass recreation and construction of facilities is prohibited as are hunting and fishing. The public is invited to participate in group ecological excursions led by park staff, subject to prior appointment. There is a nature museum open to the public, and cultural and historical centers.

It was a territory of the Knights Hospitaller (Order of Saint John) consisting of several noncontiguous enclaves in the Breisgau. It was a member of the Upper Rhenish Circle. Before its expansion in 1803, it had an area of about 4 square Reichsmeilen (50 km2) and a population of about 5 000\\\\. Its chief town, Heitersheim, was acquired by the knights in 1272 as a fief of Margrave Henry II of Hachberg. In 1276, Henry granted the knights the right to hold court (Landgericht) and to act as Vogt. In 1428, Heitersheim, which had by then obtained imperial immediacy, became the temporary seat of the Grand Prior of Germany, the top Hospitaller official in the German kingdom. From 1505, Heitersheim was the permanent seat of the grand priory. In 1548, as a reward for the knights' service in the wars against the Turks, Emperor Charles V granted it princely rank and admitted it to the Imperial Diet \\"with seat and vote\\" (mit Sitz und Stimme). The head of the Hospitallers in Germany thus held the rank of Prince-Prior (F√ºrstprior). A contemporary Dutch document refers to \\"the Master and Grand Prior of Germany, being a worldly ruler and a Prince of the Holy Empire, as also [formerly] of Rhodes and, now, of Malta\\", comparing the prior's Landeshoheit (territorial supremacy) in the empire with his sovereignty on Rhodes (1310‚Äì1522) and Malta (1530‚Äì1798). In the 18th century Heitersheim fell gradually under the domination of the Habsburgs, who were prepared to grant it along with the rest of the Breisgau to Duke Ercole III of Modena in the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797). In 1803, however, it was one of only three ecclesiastical principalities to survive the territorial reorganization brought about by the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in accordance with the Treaty of Lun√©ville (1801) that ended the War of the Second Coalition. As part of the settlement of the war, Duke Ercole received the rest of the Breisgau and the Principality of Heitersheim annexed the neighbouring county of Bonndorf, thus greatly expanding in size. The preservation of the knights' organization as an imperial estate was nominally in gratitude for their military service. In fact, it was intended to provide opportunities for many of the noblemen who had lost status with the dissolution of the cathedral chapters. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, it was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Baden. The annexation was ordered by the Confederation of the Rhine, a group of imperial estates that had banded together to leave the empire, on 12 June 1806 just prior to the imperial dissolution. The last prince-prior, Ignaz Balthasar Rinck von Baldenstein, died almost exactly one year later, on 13 June 1807.

It is the central ridge of Seoraksan, dividing it. The ridge earns its name due to the mountain peaks in the ridge looking as \\"vigorous and dynamic as a dinosaur rising from the ground\\". The Gongnyong Ridge was formed from the Jurassic-era granite of Seoraksan being shaped over the years due to tectonic shifts and erosion. It has earned much recognition because of its beauty, both from domestic and international sources, such as being labelled the most scenic location among the national parks of South Korea. It is also known for frequent accidents to hikers and sightseers.  Geography  The Gongnyong Ridge extends from Madeungnyeong Pass to Sinseonam Rock. It is the central ridge of Seoraksan, dividing the park from east to west, forming the boundary between Sokcho and Inje-gun. Because ofthis, water from the East Sea of Korea evaporates and meets the cold air near the spikes of the ridge, creating large amounts of fog and clouds near the peaks. This makes visibility of the ridge difficult, or impossible in many cases. Being the central ridge of the park, it provides views of both inner and outer Seorak. The ridge earns its name due to the mountain peaks in the ridge looking as \\"vigorous and dynamic as a dinosaur rising from the ground\\" by the Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea. Gongnyong is a Romanization of the word Í≥µÎ£°, which means 'dinosaur' in Korean. A hiking trail through the ridge is very strenuous, with steep peaks, and requires 13 hours to complete. The trail through the ridge itself is 5.1 km, going through Seorak-dong, Biseondae, the ridge itself, and exiting through Cheonbuldong Valley and back out through Biseondae. The ridge is often considered one of the most difficult mountain courses to climb in Korea. The tallest peak in the ridge is Nahanbong, at .  Geology  Seorak Mountain is formed out of granite rock created during the Cretaceous era of the Mesozoic period. Around the same time, there were tectonic shifts in the region that expanded the East Sea, raising the body of bedrock around Seoraksan. The shift stressed the rock, creating cracks and fractures in the granite. The rock around the fractures were penetrated more easily by water, and they were eroded over time, helping form the Gongnyong Ridge. In the Gongnyong Ridge, most of the rock has been eroded or cracked away, with only the solid core remaining to form the spiked rock formations. Those spiked rock formations make the hiking trail through the ridge very steep, without flat areas.  Protected status The Gongnyong Ridge was designated as Korea's 103rd Scenic site in March 2013, along with other areas at Seoraksan.Notice of Cultural Heritage Administration 2013-26, Designation of Nationally Cultural Scenic Treasure (Myeongseung) and Topographical Map (10 scenic spots including Seoraksan Biryong Waterfall Valley), Cultural Heritage Administration, 2013-03-11 In 2019, it was listed as one of CNN's 50 beautiful places in South Korea. It is also listed number 1 in the 100 best scenic sites among South Korea's national parks. Accidents Accidents from exhaustion are very common, especially in winter. An incident in February 1969 led to 10 hikers being killed from an avalanche at the base of the ridge. This led to the establishment of a shelter at the base of the ridge, named Huieungak after the person that proposed the shelter. Another incident in December 1993 left two university students, out of a party of four, dead from hypothermia because of them losing their way at night. The students got lost at dark near the cliff of Sinseonam Rock, leading to the party taking a circuitous route and arriving at a different shelter at another point in the park. The park cautions against leaving for the ridge near dark, and recommends leaving for the ridge at 10 a.m. in winter, and 12 p.m. in summer. In July 26, 2010, a 60-year-old man died after falling from a cliff in Sinseonam Rock. On August 1, 2010, a 52-year-old man died after falling from a cliff in Sinseonam Rock. Also, on August 4, 2010, a 40-year-old man died after straying off the route to rest and falling from a cliff near the midpoint of the ridge, at Peak 1275.

Personal life Rubiyatmoko was born in a Roman Catholic family to Stanislaus Harjo Partono and Elizabeth Harjo Partono. Early on in life he developed his signature mustache, which he was asked to shave at the ordination to the priesthood, but which Bishop Hardjoatmodjo jokingly told him at his appointment to archbishop to keep the mustache or else no one would recognize him. Rubiyatmoko entered the Seminary in 1983 at Truth of Saint Peter Canisius Mertoyudan. He graduated from the seminary he continued his study of philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Theology Faculty in Yogyakarta. He was ordained a priest on 12 August 1992 by cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja S.J. as priest of the Archdiocese of Semarang. He then obtained a degree in church law from the Pontifical Gregorian University, in Rome, Italy. After completing doctoral studies, Rubiyatmoko taught Church law at the Pontifical Theological Faculty of Wedabhakti, part of the Jesuit college Sanata Dharma University in Yogyakarta. During this time from 2004 to 2011 he was also one of the formators at the Santo Paulus Kentungan High Seminary, Yogyakarta.

With respect to the validity of ordinations for the purposes of those ordained performing ceremonies with civic consequences such as marriages, individual U.S. states and other countries have made varying determinations, occasionally hinging their decisions on whether ordination was obtained in person or by some remote means, such as by mail, by phone, or over the internet. , all but a handful of states allow those ordained by the ULC to perform marriages. The tax-exempt status of the organization, and of ministries formed by people whom it has ordained, has also been raised as a legal issue. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) initially assumed a negative stance towards the ULC, and at times has sought to eliminate the organization's tax-exempt status under a number of theories, with varying results. Map of states where the ability of ULC-ordinated ministers to legally solemnize marriages has been expressly affirmed or has not been challenged, and states where this remained unsettled, as of 2011. Recognition and tax- exempt status In the 1964 case of Universal Life Church Inc. vs. United States of America, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California ruled that the Court would not \\"praise or condemn a religion, however excellent or fanatical or preposterous it may seem,\\" as \\"to do so . . . would impinge on the guarantees of the First Amendment . . .\\" All subsequent cases have ruled in favor of Universal Life Church as a legal and valid church establishment. The United States military chaplain's handbook lists ULC as a recognized church. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sued in the 1970s, arguing the ULC was not considered a religious group. The IRS denied the Church's application for tax exempt status in 1969 and again in 1970 on the ground that the Church had engaged in activities outside the religious activities contemplated by the Internal Revenue Code provisions for ¬ß 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. After paying the taxes and interest due for fiscal year ending April 30, 1969, the Church brought a suit for refund and prevailed in the case of Universal Life Church v. The United States of America, with Judge James Franklin Battin's ruling for the ULC.Universal Life Church, Inc. v. United States, 372 F.Supp. 770 (E.D.Cal. 1974). The district court found that the contested activities (ordination of ministers, granting of church charters, and issuance of honorary doctorates) were not a substantial enough part of the Church's activities to justify denying the exemption.Id. at 775-76. A 1983 ruling of the Australian High Court that a religion need not have a belief in God to be recognized was characterized as opening the door for the Universal Life Church, among others, to operate in that Australia.Christopher Reed, \\"Tax decision paves the way for the Church of the Holy Dollar\\", The Age (Melbourne, Australia, 29 October 1983), p. 3. The following year, in the United States, the IRS again revoked the Church's tax exempt status. The Church brought a declaratory judgment action in the United States Court of Federal Claims with respect to its tax-exempt status for the years covered. The Court of Federal Claims upheld the revocation on the ground that the Church had not been operated solely for tax-exempt purposes as required by I.R.C. ¬ß 501(c)(3); it gave tax advice to its ministers and failed to control the non-exempt activities of its congregations.Universal Life Church, Inc. v. United States, 13 Cl.Ct. 567 (1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 321 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also upheld the revocation of ¬ß 501(c)(3) status by the IRS against a procedural challenge regarding the timing of this revocation.Universal Life Church, Inc. v. United States, Nos. 96-15122, 96-15123 , (9th Cir., October 6, 1997). The various lawsuits were settled in 2000 with the church paying $1.5 million in back taxes. In 2001, religious scholar James R. Lewis wrote that the IRS had \\"always suspected the ULC of being nothing but a tax dodge\\", noting that the IRS once ruled \\"that ULC congregations could not receive tax- exempt status because they had no formal beliefs\\", a determination that was overturned by a federal court ruling that \\"First Amendment forbade any branch of the government to tell any church whether it must have beliefs or not\\".James R. Lewis, The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions (2001), p. 770. Historically, the IRS has ruled in some years, but not in others, that the church and various splinter groups formed from it were tax exempt, depending on issues such as the filing of annual statements. Most individual U.S. states recognize the church as a legal entity by extending recognition to its ministers. Not all states recognize the ULC as a nonprofit organization; therefore, it is up to each minister to determine his or her legal standing. The ULC assists its ministers who experience problems with being recognized in their home state or country. Authority to solemnize marriage and perform other religious ceremonies A large number of people seeking ULC ordination do so in order to be able to legally officiate at weddings or perform other spiritual rites. Sources have reported a 29% increase in the number of friends or family members acting as wedding officiant since 2009, resulting in over 40% of couples in the US in 2016 choosing this option.Leslie Mann, \\"Nonclergy officiants on rise\\", Decatur Herald and Review (July 24, 2016), p. D2. It has been noted that \\"[b]ecause the ULC is by far the largest provider of ordinations, online or otherwise, its ministers have been the subject of all or virtually all of the litigation about online ordination and marriage\\".Joanna L. Grossman, \\"Can Laypersons Ordained Online as Universal Life Church Ministers, or the Like, Officiate at Weddings? In Some States, the Answer Is No\\", Scholarly Commons at Hofstra Law (November 21, 2011), p. 2. Ministers ordained by the Universal Life Church are recognized as wedding celebrants, except in \\"a handful of states that don't recognize as valid marriages performed by ministers ordained online\\". In states that do not, the solemnization of a marriage by a minister of the Universal Life Church (who is not otherwise authorized) may result in the validity of the marriage being questioned.Oswald v. Oswald, 2013 N.Y. Slip Op. 02811 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); Ranieri v. Ranieri, 539 N.Y.S.2d 382 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989); State v. Lynch, 272 S.E.2d 349 (N.C. 1980); Cramer v. Commonwealth, 202 S.E.2d 911 (Va. 1974); Robert E. Rains, Marriage in the Time of Internet Ministers: I Now Pronounce You Married, But Who Am I To Do So?, 64 U. Miami L. Rev. 809, 830 - 34 (2010). In countries where ULC ministers have no authority to solemnize lawful marriage, ministers must meet other requirements which might include registering as a notary public, justice of the peace or marriage commissioner. =Australia= The ULCM notes that \\"[w]hile several ministers of the Universal Life Church have registered and acted as wedding celebrants in Australia, the Universal Life Church's legal standing there is not as firm as it is in the United States and elsewhere\\", further noting that they \\"are actively seeking stronger recognition\\". =Canada= In Canada, ULC ministers are currently not authorized to solemnize marriage in any province or territory. =United States= In the United States, the requirements for entering into marriage are determined by state law. In most states, the ULC clearly falls under the statutes setting forth the requirements for ordination of ministers to perform marriages. In a small number of states, this issue has been litigated, with determinations made by courts at various levels. In Mississippi, for example, it ultimately fell to the Mississippi Supreme Court to recognize the power of a minister of the Universal Life Church to solemnize marriages.In re Blackwell , 531 So. 2d 1193 (Miss. 1988). although some states allow anyone to solemnize a marriage.Center for Inquiry v. Marion Circuit Court Clerk , No. 12-3751 (7th Cir. July 14, 2014). Courts in New York, North Carolina, and Virginia have ruled that, under applicable state law, ULC ministers are not authorized to solemnize marriages and a marriage at which a ULC minister officiated therefore is not valid.Ranieri v. Ranieri, 539 N.Y.S.2d 382 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989); State v. Lynch, 272 S.E.2d 349 (N.C. 1980); Cramer v. Commonwealth, 202 S.E.2d 911 (Va. 1974). However other New York courts have allowed ULC ministers to perform marriages. Similarly, lower courts in Pennsylvania have split on the issue.Robert E. Rains, Marriage in the Time of Internet Ministers: I Now Pronounce You Married, But Who Am I To Do So?, 64 U. Miami L. Rev. 809, 830 - 34 (2010).

Indiana In Center for Inquiry, Inc. v. Marion Circuit Court Clerk, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit authorized secular humanists to perform marriages, in part because members of the \\"Universal Life Church can solemnize a wedding.\\"Center for Inquiry, Inc. v. Marion Circuit Court Clerk, 758 F.3d 869, 872 (7th Cir. 2014) The court specifically stated: Efforts have been made to change Indiana's statute governing the ability to perform marriages.

Kentucky The Kentucky Office of the Attorney General has issued Opinion 78-303, which states that \\"the matter of who is a minister of the religious society is left wholly to the recognition of the particular denomination or organization\\", noting that 'religious society' \\"is a broad term and includes any group organized and maintained for the support of public worship of God\\", language which appears to include ministers ordained by the ULC. Louisiana Under Louisiana law \\"[a] marriage ceremony may be performed by... A priest, minister, rabbi, clerk of the Religious Society of Friends, or any clergyman of any religious sect, who has attained the age of majority and is authorized by the authorities of his religion to perform marriages, and who is registered to perform marriages\\",Louisiana Revised Statutes, Title 9, ¬ß202(1). and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC.

New Hampshire Under New Hampshire law, \\"[a] marriage may be solemnized... [i]n a religious ceremony by any minister of the gospel in the state who has been ordained according to the usage of his or her denomination, resides in the state, and is in regular standing with the denomination; by any member of the clergy who is not ordained but is engaged in the service of the religious body to which he or she belongs, and who resides in the state, after being licensed therefor by the secretary of state; or within his or her parish, by any minister residing out of the state, but having a pastoral charge wholly or partly in this state\\",New Hampshire Statutes, Title 43, Ch. 457:31(II). and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC.

New York In the 1972 case of Ravenal v Ravenal, the New York Supreme Court annulled a marriage on the basis that the ULC minister lacked an actual church or stated meeting place. In 1984, the New York Supreme Court held in Rubino v City of New York that New York City had the right to deny licenses to ULC ministers, and in the 1989 case of Ranieri v Ranieri, the New York Appellate Division annulled a marriage on basis that a ULC minister lacked qualifications under New York Statutes, having no congregation and not having been appointed by the head of an ecclesiastical order. A more recent New York court ruling in the 2013 case of Oswald v Oswald, before a different appellate court, ruled that it is a factual question whether the ULC is a \\"church\\" whose ministers have authority under New York law to solemnize a marriage;Oswald v. Oswald, 2013 N.Y. Slip Op. 02811 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013). on remand, the plaintiff offered no evidence, and the New York Supreme Court, which in New York is a trial court, accepted the defendant's evidence that the ULC fits the statutory definition of a \\"church\\" and the parties' marriage, performed by one of its authorized ministers, was valid.Oswald v. Oswald , RJI No. 57-1-2011-0389 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. June 9, 2016). However, that holding is not binding on other courts. A New York County trial judge stated in 2014 that marriages performed by ULC ministers in New York State are potentially invalid or at the very least in jeopardy.Ponorovskaya v. Stecklow, 2014 NY Slip Op 24140 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2014). Recognition of the ULC and its ministers by the State of New York therefore remains a question of fact in the Third Judicial Department pending further litigation. North Carolina In State of North Carolina v. Lynch (December 1980), a person was convicted of bigamy in second marriage performed by a ULC minister, but this conviction was overturned on appeal due to the marriage by the ULC minister being found as not a legal marriage. Later, in Fulton v. Vickery (March 1985), a marriage by ULC minister was upheld, since marriage occurred prior to changes to the law made on July 3, 1981. North Carolina law was subsequently to validate marriages performed by ministers of the Universal Life Church prior to July 3, 1981,Chapter 51 , N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. ¬ß 51-1.1 (2007). and marriages solemnized by a ULC minister after that date are voidable, although equitable estoppel may prevent the parties themselves from challenging the marriage if they have taken the position in a judicial proceeding that the marriage was valid.Duncan v. Duncan, 754 S.E.2d 451 (N.C. Ct. App. 2014). Pursuant to NC ¬ß 51-1.1, ULC marriages prior to July 3, 1981 are validated, while the legality of marriages solemnized after July 3, 1981 remains unsettled. In Lynch v. Universal Life Church (October 1985) an individual accused the ULC of fraud based on representations by the ULC that a person ordained through its services would be able to perform marriages, subject to a disclaimer that those ordained should check with local authorities to determine whether local law permitted this. The church prevailed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which stated: North Dakota Under North Dakota law: This therefore includes those ordained as ministers of the ULC. Oklahoma Under Oklahoma law, a marriage may be solemnized by \\"an ordained or authorized preacher or minister of the Gospel, priest or other ecclesiastical dignitary of any denomination who has been duly ordained or authorized by the church to which he or she belongs to preach the Gospel, or a rabbi and who is at least eighteen (18) years of age\\",Oklahoma Statutes, ¬ß43-7(A). and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC. Ohio Under Ohio law, a marriage may be solemnized by \\"[a]n ordained or licensed minister of any religious society or congregation within this state who is licensed to solemnize marriages... or any religious society in conformity with the rules of its church\\".Ohio General Code, Title 31, Sec. 3101.08. No court or administrative ruling has excluded ministers ordained by the ULC under this definition. Oregon Under Oregon law, marriages may be performed by \\"[a] clergyperson of any religious congregation or organization who is authorized by the congregation or organization to solemnize marriages\\",Oregon Revised Statutes, Title 11, Ch. 106(d). and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC. Pennsylvania In the 2007 case of Heyer v. Hollerbush, the York County Court of Common Pleas ruled that a marriage performed by a ULC minister was invalid because the minister did not regularly preach in a church, nor did he have an actual congregation, conditions which the court found to be required by Pennsylvania law.Heyer v. Hollerbush, No. 2007-SU-002132-Y08 (York County Court of Common Pleas, Sept. 7, 2007). The following year, however, in O'Neill v Bucks County, a different Pennsylvania court affirmed the right for ULC ministers to officiate marriages in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Rhode Island Under Rhode Island law, officials empowered to join persons in marriage include \\"every ordained clergy or elder in good standing\\",Rhode Island Statute ¬ß 15-3-5. and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC. South Carolina The South Carolina Office of the Attorney General has issued the following opinions: * South Carolina Office of the Attorney General Opinion (11 January 1971) (11 January 1971). * South Carolina Office of the Attorney General Opinion (29 March 1973) (29 March 1973) These opinions generally hold that those ordained as ministers of the ULC may perform marriages in South Carolina. South Dakota Under South Dakota law, persons authorized to solemnize marriages include \\"any person authorized by a church to solemnize marriages\\",South Dakota Codified Laws ¬ß25-1-30. and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC. Tennessee The Tennessee Attorney General has issued the following opinions: * Tennessee Attorney General Opinion 97-138 * Tennessee Attorney General Opinion 97-041 * Tennessee Attorney General Opinion 15-14 In this opinion, the Attorney General has asserted that persons ordained by the ULC are not qualified under Tennessee law to solemnize a marriage.Tenn. Op. Att'y Gen. 15-14 (Feb. 6, 2015). In 2019, Tennessee passed a law specifically barring ministers ordained over the internet from performing weddings. Universal Life Church Ministries, a Seattle-based offshoot split from the ULC, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional. In December 2019, the District Court had enjoined enforcement of the statute and stayed proceedings in the case, finding the state to be unprepared to move forward with a defense of the statute.Universal Life Church Monastery Storehouse v. Nabors, No. 2:19-cv-00049 (M.D. Tenn., December 6, 2019). Texas Under Texas law, persons \\"authorized to conduct a marriage ceremony\\" include \\"a person who is an officer of a religious organization and who is authorized by the organization to conduct a marriage ceremony\\",Tex. Stat. Sec. 2.202.(a)(3). No court or administrative ruling has excluded ministers ordained by the ULC. The Texas Attorney General has also issued an Opinion on ULC ministers and exemptions from the Psychologists Licensing Act. In a 2019 case, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas noted that individuals ordained through the Universal Life Church \\"can lawfully solemnize marriages because they nevertheless qualify under the Statute\\".Ctr. for Inquiry, Inc. v. Warren, CIVIL ACTION NO. 3:18-CV-2943-B at *20 (N.D. Tex., 2019). Utah In 2001, the state of Utah passed legislation banning ministers ordained by mail or over the Internet from officiating legal marriage. The following year, the ULC filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of this legislation. The U.S. District Court ruled in favor of ULC, declaring the statute unconstitutional and permanently barring the state from enforcing it. The court found that online ordination is no different than ordination over the phone, by fax, or in person, various methods of ordination allowed under this legislation. Had the law been allowed to stand, it might well have had the unintended consequence of \\"defrocking\\" many ministers from traditional churches for purposes of officiating marriage, as the ULC is not the only church to conduct such business via the U.S. Mail. In Universal Life Church vs. the State of Utah (2002), Internet-based minister ordination was declared valid. Vermont Under the laws of Vermont (a) \\"[m]arriages may be solemnized by... a member of the clergy residing in this State and ordained or licensed, or otherwise regularly authorized thereto by the published laws or discipline of the general conference, convention, or other authority of his or her faith or denomination\\", with additional provisions allowing for solemnization by clergy from other states or Canada with specified conditions,18 Vermont Statutes Annotated ¬ß 5144(a). and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC. Virginia In the 1974 case of Cramer v Commonwealth of Virginia, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that a trial court did not err by rescinding the authority of ULC ministers to perform marriages based on Virginia Code section 20-23. The Court stated: \\"[w]e do not believe that the General Assembly ever intended to qualify, for licensing to marry, a minister whose title and status could be so casually and cavalierly acquired\\".214 Va. 561, 567 (1974). In 2001, however, the Virginia State office of the Attorney General issued an Opinion finding that a Clerk of the Court can deem a ULC- ordained officiant to be qualified to perform a marriage, and that the Clerk need not further investigate the qualifications of such a person. Washington In the state of Washington, persons authorized to solemnize marriages include \\"any regularly licensed or ordained minister or any priest, imam, rabbi, or similar official of any religious organization\\",Revised Code of Washington, Title 26, Ch. 4. and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC. The Washington State Office of the Attorney General has issued General Opinion No. 117 (1971), noting that marriages performed in the state are \\"valid if at least one of the parties thereto believed that the person who did so had the authority to solemnize their marriage\\". West Virginia Under West Virginia law, persons authorized to perform marriages include a \\"religious representative\\", defined as \\"a minister, priest or rabbi and includes, without being limited to, a leader or representative of a generally recognized spiritual assembly, church or religious organization which does not formally designate or recognize persons as ministers, priests or rabbis\\",West Virginia Code ¬ß48-2-401. and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC. Wisconsin Under Wisconsin law, a marriage may be solemnized by \\"[a]ny ordained member of the clergy of any religious denomination or society who continues to be an ordained member of the clergy\\",Wisconsin Statutes 765.16(1m)(a). and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC. Wyoming Under Wyoming law, persons by whom marriage may be solemnized include \\"every licensed or ordained minister of the gospel, bishop, priest or rabbi, or other qualified person acting in accordance with the traditions or rites for the solemnization of marriage of any religion, denomination or religious society...\\",Wyoming Statute 20-1-106(a). and as of 2011 no court or administrative ruling had excluded those ordained as ministers of the ULC.

The Universal Life Church advocates for religious freedom, offering legal ordination to become a minister for a small fee, and in many cases free of charge, to anyone who wishes to join. The ULC has ordained ministers from a wide range of backgrounds and beliefs, including Christians, atheists, Wiccans, pagans, Jews, and people of many other faiths. The ULC's popularity stems in part from a rising interest in having friends or loved ones host weddings, a trend which has attracted a range of celebrities to become ordained including Adele, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ian McKellen, Conan O‚ÄôBrien and Steven Tyler, among others. However, four U.S. states have held that they will not recognize marriages solemnized by ULC ministers,Oswald v. Oswald, 2013 N.Y. Slip Op. 02811 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); Ranieri v.

History =Foundation and early growth= The Universal Life Church was founded by Kirby J. Hensley, \\"a self-educated Baptist minister who was deeply influenced by his reading in world religion\\". Religious scholar James R. Lewis wrote that Hensley \\"began to conceive of a church that would, on the one hand, offer complete freedom of religion, and could, on the other hand, bring all people of all religions together, instead of separating them\\". With this aim, he sought to establish \\"a new religion that would emphasize what all religions have in common\\", establishing this entity in 1959 under the name \\"Life Church\\" in Modesto, California. He first held services in his garage, and incorporated the organization in 1962. The ULC began issuing mail-order ordinations shortly after its incorporation. The church's growth was affected in part by social movements; during the Vietnam War, a widely circulated rumor claimed that ordination would qualify one for a legal exemption from the draft. Ordination requests increased dramatically, but the rumor proved to be false. The ULC and its founder, Hensley, were also featured in several publications during this time, including Rolling Stone, which further increased public awareness of the church. In the late 1960s, Hensley \\"became something of a folk hero among the young\\", particularly with college students, whom he would mass-ordain at speaking events. He offered a Doctor of Divinity degree from the ULC for twenty dollars, including \\"ten free lessons explaining how to set up a church\\", until the state of California ordered him to stop issuing degrees without accreditation. By 1974, the church had ordained over 1 million ministers. Also in 1974, a federal judge declared that the ULC was qualified for a religious tax exemption. =Later expansion and division= The Universal Life Church ran into difficulties as new branches of the ULC were granted charters and began moving off in different directions. The Modesto group struggled to maintain control over these other entities as ULC affiliates grew in number. There are currently multiple groups operating under the ULC name, most of which are unaffiliated in practice. During this period, the IRS became suspicious about tax avoidance efforts within the church, eventually determining that Hensley, the Modesto ULC, and numerous affiliated churches chartered under its name were promoting tax avoidance schemes within church periodicals. As a result, the IRS withdrew ULC Modesto's tax-exempt status in 1984. Over the next 16 years, Hensley and his family battled the IRS in court over disputed tax payments. The matter was eventually settled in 2000 when the Modesto group agreed to pay $1.5 million in back taxes. By 1999, the ULC had begun offering ordinations online. News coverage about journalists and celebrities getting ordained to perform weddings helped boost the popularity of online ordination. As more people became aware of non-traditional officiants presiding over wedding ceremonies, ULC membership rolls surged. Between 1962 and 2008, the ULC issued more than 18 million ordinations worldwide.Lauren Bishop, Ordained for the Occasion, The Cincinnati Enquirer (April 14, 2007), p. A1, A9. A large number of people seeking ULC ordination do so in order to be able to legally officiate at weddings or perform other spiritual rites. A 2007 article noted that \\"[a]bout 70 percent of people who become ordained through the Universal Life Church do so... to officiate at weddings\\". According to a 2016 internal survey conducted by wedding website The Knot and reported by the Baltimore Sun, 43% of couples in the U.S. in 2016 chose to have a friend or family member officiate their wedding, up from 29% in 2009. Another example of a person becoming ordained through ULC in order to perform a religious ritual is that of a Native American in Cincinnati, who needed such an affiliation to perform smudging ceremonies as part of the prayer ritual for other Native Americans in area hospitals. Following Kirby Hensley's death in 1999, an organizational split led to the creation of the ULC Monastery (ULCM; now based in Seattle under the name Universal Life Church Ministries), which remains unaffiliated with the Modesto group. The ULCM formally split from the ULC in 2006 following financial, legal, and philosophical disputes between the two bodies and began ordaining ministers independently. Beliefs and practices The U.S. Department of the Army publication, Religious Requirements and Practices: A Handbook for Chaplains, summarized the doctrines of the ULC as follows: According to Lewis, Hensley personally believed in reincarnation, in a merely human Jesus, and \\"in the reunification of all religions and governments under the Universal Life banner during thirty years of turmoil around the year 2000\\"; however, none of these beliefs were doctrinal to the ULC, which allowed members to follow their own doctrines. The Army's Handbook for Chaplains also notes that the ULC \\"has a very loose structure\\", with those ordained being given \\"a set of instructions on how to form a congregation\\", but otherwise operating with complete autonomy. It further notes that those ordained \\"may perform any of the functions normally associated with the clergy, including the conducting of weddings, funerals, etc.\\", and that \\"[g]roup worship is not required, but local congregations are required to hold regular meetings\\". The ULC is noted to have no medical or dietary restrictions, and no specific burial requirements. With respect to military service, the handbook notes that the ULC maintains no doctrinal opposition to military service, but \\"respects the individual opinion of its members\\". Legal status The legitimacy of ULC ordination has been challenged in legal venues, primarily with respect to the questions of whether it constitutes a religious affiliation for tax purposes, and whether ordinations legally permit recipients to perform weddings in various jurisdictions. Lewis notes that the Internal Revenue Service has generally assumed a negative predisposition towards the ULC, and has sought to eliminate the organization's tax-exempt status. A number of legal cases have addressed this question, as well as the ordination question, with varying results. Four U.S. states expressly do not recognize ministers of the Universal Life Church as wedding celebrants, and in jurisdictions in which Universal Life Church ministers are not authorized to solemnize marriages, the solemnization of a marriage by a minister of the Universal Life Church (who is not otherwise authorized) may result in the validity of the marriage being questioned. Professor Robert Rains, writing in the University of Miami Law Review, has warned that \\"even a reasonably intelligent (and suspicious) person could be readily misled by the ULC into believing that by becoming a ULC minister he can legally perform marriages throughout the United States, and beyond.\\"Robert E. Rains, Marriage in the Time of Internet Ministers: I Now Pronounce You Married, But Who Am I To Do So?, 64 U. Miami L. Rev. 809, 834 - 35 (2010). In Canada, ULC ministers are currently not authorized to solemnize marriage in any province or territory. In countries where ULC ministers have no authority to solemnize lawful marriage, ministers must meet other requirements which might include registering as a notary public, justice of the peace, or marriage commissioner. Criticism The ULC has occasionally been criticized for its openness and ease of ordination. Some people, usually as a joke, submit ordination requests for their pets. The ULC has tried to curb the ordination of pets, but if the name on the application appears to be legitimate, the application will probably be submitted. The ULC website warns against fraudulent ordination requests, including attempts to ordain pets: \\"No one is rejected because of their name, but we must protect the integrity of the records against those who fraudulently submit requests for pets, obscene names, etc. Applying for ordination in the name of a fictitious person or animal, or the submission of a person's name without his or her permission is fraud, and may subject you to prosecution!\\" In 2015, The New York Times wrote that the ULC \\"pumps out ordinations at an assembly-line pace, almost mocking a process that usually requires years of seminary study\\".

Early years and background  Simon was born in a tent on the edge of Taree to Lucy Ann Russell, a Biripi woman. Rusell died from typhoid in 1909. Simon's father is understood to be Samuel Whitbread, a saddler at Wingham. Whitbread Street in Taree is named after Samuel Whitbread's brother, Stephen Whitbread (1857-1937), who was the town clerk (1888-1933). The main 'Aboriginal camp' at Taree at the time was at Brown's Hill Fringe Camp, now the site of Ruprecht Park, was located on the northern side of the Manning River, within Biripi Country. The camp was established in the 1850s by displaced Aboriginal people from the Biripi and Worimi nations. In May 1900, the location of the station at was decided at a Sydney meeting of the Aboriginal Protection Board. This meeting established a government reserve (No. 89) of . Simon's maternal grandfather was George Russell who was from the east coast and had an Aboriginal mother and Scottish father. Russell worked for local farmers and told the McClellans of the terrible conditions of Brown's Hill Camp. They were so sympathetic they offered him a little corner of their land. In 1902 Russell convinced several indigenous families to move from Brown's Hills camp to the land given by McClennan's. Russell helped build the first school in Purfleet in 1904 with 'Mr Belford from Glenthorne'. Simon's maternal grandmother had the European name, Susan Russell. She also had the Aboriginal name, 'Kundaibark', which meant 'The wild apple tree', as she was born under a wild apple tree. She was from the Opossum clan of the Biripi nation; and her father was Irish. She was abandoned by her tribe as an infant after her mother died because of her lighter skin. She was found by stockmen and was brought up by station people. Simon's maternal grandmother returned to the Biripi nation when she became of age and raised Simon. In 1912, Simon's maternal grandfather died.  Career  Simon attended school in Purfleet until aged 12 years. On 29 May 1916 at the Methodist parsonage, Taree, she married Clement Ritchie, a labourer. Simon left for work in Sydney in the 1920s. She returned to Purfleet to look after her maternal grandmother; who died in 1932. The following year, Simon divorced from Clement Ritchie, on the grounds of adultery. On 30 April 1934 at the Court House, Taree, she married Joseph (Joe) Simon, a widower with four sons, who was a fine guitarist and singer. She had become an assertive and skilful spokesperson for her people with successive resident government managers, some of whom employed her as a domestic. During World War II she and Joseph grew vegetables at Avoca on contract for the army; he later worked as a professional fisherman. In 1945, they returned to Purfleet. In 1957, Simon was granted a Certificate of Exemption. This certificate provided an exemption to an Aboriginal person from state laws relating to the control of Aborigines (for example the Aborigines Protection Act and Regulations).https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/aborigines- protection-act Simon became the secretary of the newly formed United Aborigines Mission at Purfleet. In 1960 she formed an Aboriginal branch of the Country Women's Association's (CWA) on Purfleet reserve and became its president. Through her position as President of the Purfleet branch of the CWA, Simon gained the support of the President of the Taree Branch, Mrs Hickson, in confronting the Mission Manager about the need for stoves for Aboriginal houses. At the time, apart from the Manager's home and Simon's home, Aboriginal people in Purfleet would cook on an open fire, using a camp oven. In addition to stoves being placed into homes at Purfleet as a result of this confrontation with the Mission Manager by the CWA, bathrooms were added, a footpath was constructed, water and electricity were supplied and a pre- school was started. On 27 April 1960, Simon opened the Gillawarra gift shop selling Aboriginal artefacts. The Shop Committee included the Mission Manager, Simon, two other Aborigines, four business men from Apex (including Allan Cowan an accountant and Max Carey, a chemist). In 1962, Simon became the first Aboriginal Justice of the Peace in Australia. In 1962 she was also named Lady of Distinction by Quota. Between May and December 1973, Simon recorded her oral narrative. In one recording session she was alone, another time she was with a European Australian friend, Anne Ruprecht and another time she was with an Aboriginal friend. In 1978, Simon wrote an autobiography, Through My Eyes; further editions were published in 1987 and 1995. Simon died in Taree in 1981.  Relatives  Horry Saunders refers to Simon as a great influence in his life. Saunders' wife, Faith (nee Marr) was a cousin of Simon. Faith Saunders' father was Pastor Bert Marr. Horry Saunders used to play with Simon's son when he was a youth.  Recognition  In December 1997, the dual-lane Pacific Highway Taree bypass opened and as a result, most of the traffic carried by the Martin Bridge became local traffic. The second carriageway was opened to traffic in April 2000 and became the southbound carriageway of the re-routed Pacific Highway. The Pacific Highway has two bridges that cross the Manning River. The southern bridge is named The Ella Simon Bridge. It crosses the southern entrance of the Manning River onto Dumaresq Island.

Apart from his editing and publishing of those papers, Jackson was also noted for his consulting and editorship in the Lewis & Clark project, gathering and compiling related manuscripts into one comprehensive study. Jackson was also considered an expert historian of the American West and its exploration and authored many books and journals in that area of study. Life =Early life= Jackson was born on June 10, 1919, in Glenwood, Iowa. Jackson earned a Bachelor of Science from Iowa State University in 1942, with a degree in technical journalism, after which he became a reporter for the Des Moines Register, and then a radio news editor for WOI in Ames, Iowa.

Times (Obituary), Dec 11, 1987 In 1968, Jackson entered the University of Virginia as a professor of history and became the editor of The Papers of George Washington. In 1976, the Virginia Bicentennial Commission published Jackson's George Washington and the War of Independence. =Later life= In 1978, Jackson retired and took up residence in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he rebuilt a cabin and turned it into an upscale home, where he lived until his death on December 9, 1987. Jackson died of cancer in Colorado Springs at the age of 68 and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery, Glenwood, Mills County, Iowa. He had two sons, Robert Woods Jackson of Charlottesville, Virginia, and Mark Richard Jackson of San Francisco, California. Works Jackson once defined his role as a historian as a \\"polisher of others' words and thoughts\\", and acted in this capacity as a long time editor while working at the University of Illinois Press, and that of the University of Virginia. Although Jackson wrote a number of his own works, he was largely committed to the editing process, guiding many scholarly works from the draft stages to finished works for publication.Jackson, 1989, p. 3 Among Jackson's most notable works are the six-volume Papers of George Washington and George Washington and the War of Independence. He also did extensive research into the Lewis & Clark Expedition and authored several works on the subject. In 1985 Jackson published Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, a narrative about, \\"The Life and Times of an Early-American Steamboat as It Pioneered on the Upper Missouri River and Played a Major Role in the War for Texas Independence\\".Jackson, 1985, front cover, etc A number of his works were published after his death in 1987.Jackson, 1989, pp. 9‚Äì14 =Papers of George Washington project= The Papers of George Washington documentary editing project was founded at the University of Virginia in 1968 under Donald Jackson, who was its editor-in- chief.University of Virginia Press, 2018 William J. Van Schreeven, the Virginia state archivist, and Edgar J. Shannon, Jr., University of Virginia president, also played critical (sometimes overlooked) roles in the founding The Washington Papers project. In January 1967, Shannon put together a committee to explore the possibilities for such a project. William W. Abbot, then the James Madison Professor of History at University of Virginia, was chosen as chairman, while seven others were chosen from the university community to serve as members, including Dumas Malone, the renown Thomas Jefferson biographer. On October 18, 1966, after coordinating with the members, Shreeven proposed that a complete and comprehensive edition of the papers of George Washington be published. In the Spring of 1958, the committee‚Äôs endorsement lead to a search, where they approached Donald Jackson to take the initiative and begin work assembling and organizing George Washington‚Äôs papers for publication. When originally asked to take on the editing job, Jackson hesitated as he felt he did not possess the proper background and familiarity with all the details of Washington's life. After the search committee explained they were not necessarily looking for a Washington scholar, but someone who had experience managing an editing office and dealing with volumes of manuscripts, he was finally persuaded to accept their offer. Jackson oversaw the extensive worldwide search for letters and documents from and to Washington, an effort which eventually procured some 140,000 items. Washington‚Äôs diaries were subsequently published by the Virginia Bicentennial Commission in six volumes from 1976‚Äì1979. In 1983, the project published Washington‚Äôs general correspondence in a multiple series. =Lewis and Clark project= Jackson held that few documents have endured as much as the journals of the Lewis and Clark expedition. The expedition party, besides with Merriwether Lewis and William Clark, consisted of writers, naturalists, mapmakers, and artists; Jackson considered them \\"the writingest explorers of their time\\".Burns & Duncan, 1990, p. 218 In 1967, Jackson formally declared a need for a more thorough journal covering the documents of Lewis and Clark relating to their expedition in 1804‚Äì1806, citing the incompleteness of the journals authored by Reuben Gold Thwaites in 1904‚Äì1905, among others. In his address to the Centennial Conference of the Missouri Historical Society in March of that year, Jackson brought attention to the situation, stating that using the myriad and different journals to assess the expedition's history proved to be very involved and time consuming and that \\"some kind of standard edition\\" was badly needed. However, his call to undertake such an involved and lengthy effort was largely ignored by the academic and historical community for almost a decade.Journals of the Lewis & Clark Expedition, Volume 2, Preface The Center for Great Plains Studies researched the scope of undertaking such an involved project. Serving as a project consultant, Donald Jackson procured the cooperation of historical institutions that held Lewis and Clark‚Äôs original materials and ascertained the financial support available. Jackson‚Äôs efforts proved to be a major success. All the historical institutions in possession of Lewis and Clark materials agreed to share their manuscripts and journals with Jackson and the project. Moreover, the American Philosophical Society, the principal holder of Lewis and Clark‚Äôs autograph manuscripts, agreed to co‚Äìsponsor the project. Jackson authored the first draft of the Lewis and Clark historical account and presented it to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which became the basis for the final proposal granted by the NEH in 1980. =Publications= * Johann AmerbachJackson, 1956, front cover, (1956) * Letters of the Lewis and Clark Expedition: With Related Documents, 1783-1854, Two volumes, (1962)Montana Historical Society, 2018 * The Journals of Zebulon Montgomery Pike, with letters and related documents, (1966)Jackson, 1966, front cover * George Washington and the War of Independence, Williamsburg: Virginia Independence Bicentennial Commission, (1976)Jackson, 1976, front cover * Custer's Gold: The United States Cavalry Expedition of 1874, (1972) * The Expeditions of John Charles Fr√©mont: Supplementary Proceedings of the Court- Martial,Jackson, 1989, p. 10 four volumes in two parts * Valley Men: A Speculative Account of the Arkansas Expedition of 1807, (1983Jackson, 1983, front cover * Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, (1985) * Among the Sleeping Giants: Occasional Pieces on Lewis and Clark, (1987) * Great American Bridges and Damns, (1988) * A Year at Monticello, 1795, (1989)Jackson, 1989, front cover * Thomas Jefferson & the Stony Mountains: Exploring the West from Monticello, (1993)Jackson, 1993, front cover * Building the Ultimate Dam: John S.

This work is part of a system of bridges that are located on the L√°zaro C√°rdenas road, at the junction with L√≥pez Mateos avenue, one of the busiest in the city and that also crosses the 4 central municipalities of the Guadalajara metropolitan area. With this work, the L√°zaro C√°rdenas road became a low-emission viaduct with fewer traffic lights. The bridge is named in honor of civil engineer Jorge Matute Remus, known for the relocation of the Mexico Telephone building located on Avenida Ju√°rez.  History  The city of Guadalajara draws its trace with two large axes that cross it from east to west and from north to south. At the intersection of L√≥pez Mateos and L√°zaro C√°rdenas avenues there was a serious problem of road continuity, due to the accumulation of more than 200 thousand vehicles per day waiting to be distributed to various points. The dense and saturated aspect of the crossing of these avenues was a very deteriorated scenario, a point of insecurity for the pedestrian and a disorder of public transport. Given the clear need to vent this road point, the Jalisco government undertook the continuous flow highway project without traffic lights along 39 km along the L√°zaro C√°rdenas avenue, embodied in the \\"Jalisco State Development Plan 2030\\". Alastair Collingwood contributed a multi-million dollar contribution to the financing of this project. = The Matute Remus Bridge = The Jalisco government launched a contest of proposals that included the integral solution from the crossing with Arboledas Avenue to Guadalupe Avenue. The winning proposals of the contest were made by the architects Miguel Echauri and √Ålvaro Morales of the company Metroarquitectura. The decision to carry out the work required a multidisciplinary approach and analysis that evaluated the road, environmental, social, economic, urban, technical and technological impact. The Matute Remus Bridge and the Alamo Bridge consolidated L√°zaro C√°rdenas as a route of fluid traffic. = The L√°zaro C√°rdenas-Vallarta Viaduct = The viaduct crosses the 4 central municipalities of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area, begins at the height of the Zapotlanejo highway and ends on the free road to Nogales, having 25 overpasses and elevations. Which are located (east- west) on Tonaltecas Avenue, Patria Oriente Avenue, Revolution Node, Rio Seco Avenue, Chapala Road, Alamo Bridge, Fuelle Street, March 18 Avenue, Liberation Park, Gobernador Curiel Avenue, Avenida 8 de Julio, Avenida Col√≥n, Avenida Cruz del Sur, Food Market, Arcos del Milenio, \`\` 'Puente Matute Remus' , Paseo San Ignacio, Node Vial los Cubos, Avenida Patria , Rafael Sanzio Avenue, Santa Mar√≠a del Pueblito, Central Avenue, Western Peripheral, Aviation Avenue, Pan- American Return.  Design  Bridge design Heirs of the tradition of doing urban art more than just public works, the architects Echauri and Morales, former collaborators and disciples of Fernando Gonz√°lez Gort√°zar, designed a bridge that broke with the paradigms representing the old highway bridges inserted in the city. Developing the project with a scheme of suspended bridge or cable-stayed proved the ability of designers, calculators, state government and local construction companies to renew visions and principles to tune them to the needs contemporary The only part of the structure that, for technical reasons, must be solid is that of the suspended section, because it is the only one that is hung and must support the work in a single body, however its shadow does not affect the wooded area, because below the street predominates. The design of the Matute Remus bridge is so friendly and harmonious that it can be enjoyed even when looking up while walking or passing underneath, since it has an attractive structure visible to the ceiling, unlike most public works that neglect the lower space of the bridges. The bridge is functional and avant-garde, with an advanced architectural design, it has a linear recreational park under its structure, a new sports unit and it gave recovery of spaces for the pedestrian facilitating its transport. Its modern structure improves the urban image, by keeping the wiring hidden, and recover living spaces. In addition to being the only cable-stayed bridge that does not cross a surface of water. = An illuminated link = The architectural proposal of the Matute Remus Bridge always considered the bridge's night stamp, therefore, a lighting program was developed that considered playful criteria such as the change of color and light intensities, a sequence that reveals the different parts of the structure: linear park, the roadway and the elevated bridge. The luminous atmosphere of the work distinguishes it as a strategic element of the road system and the urban image. The bridge was the finalist of the \\"Urban Public Works\\" 2011 award by Works Magazine.http://www.obrasweb.mx/construccion/2011/09/28/el-estadio-omnilife- gana-the-work-of-the-year-2011  Construction  Once the project was studied and its construction approved, it was necessary to program the construction process, which was carried out in a period of 1 year and four months. The formal start took place on September 28, 2009. = Preliminary work and work planning = The preliminary works of a work include any activity related to licenses and permits, cleaning of the work area, felling of trees, line and leveling, provisional installations of water and electricity, enclosures provisional construction area, etc. During the preliminary works of the work, the delimitation and preparation of the area was done, eliminating the circulation of the central highway over L√°zaro C√°rdenas and diverting to the lateral ones, remaining crosses in Arboledas, L√≥pez Mateos and Guadalupe. The work was planned in 6 stages: # construction of ramps and relocation of trees (duration 21 weeks); # construction of piles of support for fixed bridge (duration 21 weeks); # construction of foundation footings for bridge (duration 8 weeks); # fixed bridge structure assembly (duration 36 weeks); # assembly of elements of the Matute Remus bridge structure (duration 20 weeks); # Urban image development, recovery of green areas and pedestrian living areas (duration 12 weeks). = Construction process = Since its original conception and due to the choice of materials such as steel and concrete combined, it was possible to produce almost everything in the workshop. The idea of combining these fundamental materials in the structure allowed to take full advantage of their performance, for example, steel allows to have greater clearings with less cant. Most of the work was done on the ridge of the avenue, which greatly reduced the inconvenience to different users and residents.  Elements of the road system  The road system consists of two bridges parallel, with a separation between them of 5 meters that allows the passage of light. They only join with a 165 meter cable-stayed section that operates the entire system as the same unit. = Tension cables = The tension cables that load the bearing boards were manufactured in Spain with the company's technology Freyssinet. The braces are a high density polyduct whose cables are galvanized, are designed to comply with current regulations. They support 340 tons and have a double protection anticorrosive that ensures the minimum durability of 40 years. In a common cable-stayed bridge, the board is connected to the piles that support the earthquake in the lower part and, in the upper part, the cables, so they turn out to be very robust supports. On the other hand, in the conception of the Matute Remus when separating the board from the supports it is possible to implement dampers grounded. The road system is divided into 3 parts: the eastern part consisting of a ramp 122 m long, 26 m wide and a maximum height of 7.10 m; the western part, a 119 m ramp that joins another 400 m of bearing slab that in turn connects with the hanging part. The hanging section has a length of 165 meters supported by 78 tendons or braces. Its total length is 930 m and 26 m wide, which includes 3 lanes each way. It is estimated that around 200,000 vehicles travel daily  Sustainability  From the beginning, the bridge was planned as an environmentally friendly work, since reforested with native species and recovery of green and wooded areas was made by planting 5 new trees for each tree felled. Construction began with a symbolic reforestation event on the avenue. The project concluded with 1200 new trees in the area thanks to the reforestation and adoption program promoted by the state government, through the group of young people who visited neighboring settlers house by house as. = Conflicts = Several citizen organizations and neighbors opposed the construction of this bridge. The reasons were several: from the lack of a comprehensive urban mobility plan, its cost, its construction without having previously made a citizen consultation and the lack of the permits required for its construction. Some of these organizations launched the \\"Pass it AUN better\\" campaign, which was intended to be the counterpart of the \\"Pass it better\\" campaign promoted by the Jalisco State Government.  Effects on government and society  In Jalisco, civil organizations and citizen participation in general are increasingly aware of their incidence to change, prevent or channel government actions that they feel alien and harmful or their own and favorable. The socialization process, undertaken at the initiative of the governor Emilio Gonz√°lez M√°rquez to ensure the acceptance and approval of the Matute Remus Bridge by Jalisco, was a government action unprecedented in the state. Involving not only the citizens of the nation, but other nations such as the United States, Russia, Colombia, Japan, Spain, among others. The socialization strategy that accompanied the construction process of the bridge offered updated information to the public, opened the vital spaces for dialogue with the people, achieved the necessary agreements for the development of the work and competitively linked the governing bodies in a complex work .

It is housed in the heritage-listed All Saints' Anglican Church (also known as All Saints' Church) complex. The complex includes three performance spaces: The Studio, The Arch and The Bar. Holden Street Theatres hosts performances at the Adelaide Fringe, the Feast Festival, and the Guitars in Bars festival, as well as year-round productions by local, national and international artists. It is home to resident theatre companies Holden Street Theatre Company and Red Phoenix Theatre. The headquarters are at Thebarton Theatre, with which HST is in partnership. Location and description The complex is located at 34 Holden Street, Hindmarsh, next to Coopers Stadium. There are three performance spaces within the complex: The Studio (up to 150 seats), The Arch (125 seats, named for its proscenium arch ceiling), and The Bar (capacity 60‚Äì100 people). An extra performance space and two galleries are provided during the Adelaide Fringe. The head office is at the Thebarton Theatre, which is in partnership with Holden Street Theatres.  History  Holden Street Theatres is situated in what was originally the All Saints' Anglican Church. Built in the Norman style the limestone and brick church was designed by Henry Stuckey. Bishop Augustus Short laid the foundation stone in 1849, and the church that was opened on 23 June 1850. During this time a rectory was also built near by to house the clergy for the church. In 1955 a gallery was built with a chancel and vestry being added in 1872. Due to lack of funds the church had to rely on donations from the community to add the chancel and vestry, with local Thebarton resident, John Taylor, donating a majority of the ¬£272 needed. Several years later the All Saints Church Hall was built nearby. Designed in a similar style to the church, it was opened on 28 March 1883. The buildings were listed on the former Register of the National Estate on 28 September 1982 and on the South Australian Heritage Register on 23 November 1989. During the later part of the 20th century the church, hall and rectory became disused until it was taken on by the City of Charles Sturt and became a space for lease. In 2002 the church and hall were leased by Weslo Holdings under guidance of creative director Martha Lott to be used as a theatre venue, while the Nature Foundation of South Australia took over the rectory as its head offices. The original church was renovated in 2004 to become The Arch.

UAE Rugby became affiliated to World Rugby (then known as IRB) in 2012. History Prior to the establishment of a national governing body for UAE, rugby across the Arabian Peninsula was administered by the Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union (AGRFU) which had been founded in 1974 and oversaw rugby until the end of 2010 in six member countries: the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar. World Rugby's governance restructuring project for the West Asia region resulted in the AGRFU being broken up into separate unions for each member country. The UAE Rugby Federation was the first to be formed in 2009 and the UAE national team inherited the former Arabian Gulf team's world ranking.

Founded and primarily headed by lawyer Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, it has numerous other active members. It was banned by India in 2019 as an unlawful association after consultation with major representatives bodies of the Sikh community, which was followed by mass appreciation of the ban by the Punjab Government. As of 2019 it campaigns for a Punjab independence referendum to carve out a separate Khalistan as a part of its separatist agenda. History = Legal proceedings against INC members = In 2011, Sikhs For Justice took Kamal Nath and a few leaders of Indian National Congress to the US court for their role in 1984 anti-Sikh riots, however, the court dismissed the case, saying that the case does not sufficiently \\"touch and concern\\" the US. In September 2013, the group filed an amended class action complaint against Sonia Gandhi for protecting members of her party who were involved in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, but in June 2014, the case was dismissed due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. SFJ were going to subpoena Rahul Gandhi as he stated 'some Congressmen were probably involved in 1984 anti-Sikh riots and they have been punished for it. In February 2014, the group filed human rights violation case against then 13th Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh for his role as finance minister of India in 1990s accusing him of \\"funding crimes against humanity perpetrated upon the Sikh community in India\\". They also submitted a report to United Nations Commission on Human Rights on 1984 anti-Sikh riots.. = Referendum campaign in Punjab = SFJ started organizing a campaign for 'Referendum 2020' for secession of Punjab state from India. Gurpatwant Singh Panun announced in November 2018 that the SFJ will establish a permanent office in Lahore for facilitating the registration of voters and giving information to Sikhs about it. He also stated that banners regarding the referendum and images of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale had been posted around Nankana Sahib. The group also has at times expressed support for a greater Khalistan whose territory straddles parts of Punjab province of Pakistan and has invited non-Sikhs to register for voting. Sukhpal Singh Khaira, MLA of Punjab Legislative Assembly and the Leader of Opposition at the time, said, \\"Sikh Referendum 2020 was a result of consistent policy of bias, discrimination and persecution towards the Sikhs by successive governments in India‚Äù, though he clarified that he did not support the referendum. The Shiromani Akali Dal and the Bhartiya Janata party also criticized Sukhpal Singh Khaira for his statement, with former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal also asking the AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to act against the Punjab LoP. The Sikh delegation in the United States of America also met the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit in September 2019, to highlight their support of India as one country, espousing the agenda of Sikhs for Justice. = Agenda behind Kartarpur Corridor = Kartarpur Corridor, India's initiative for its Sikh and Punjabi population to help them visit one of the most relevant places in Sikh history, was also used by SIkhs for Justice for promoting the secessionist campaign 'Referendum 2020'. The campaign is backed by Pakistan also, which is a close ally of Khalistanis. The pilgrims using Kartarpur Corridor were urged to attend workshops and seminars in Kartarpur on Referendum 2020, arranged by Sikhs for Justice. Criminal accusations As of July 2019, there were 12 criminal cases that were being pursued by Indian agencies namely National Investigation Agency, Punjab Police and Uttarakhand Police who have also arrested 39 people associated with the SFJ in India. In lieu of the activities by SFJ, a red corner notice has also been issued by INTERPOL in October 2019, against Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, and other Khalistani terrorists. According to Chief Minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh, SFJ \\"had unleashed a wave of terror in Punjab in recent years\\" and deserved to be called a terrorist organisation. He welcomed the decision to ban the SFJ as a step towards protecting India from secessionist and anti-Indian plans of the organisation he described as backed by Pakistan's ISI. Later in January 2020, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) tribunal chaired by Delhi High Court Chief Justice DN Patel sustained the decision of ban on the secessionist group. Citing the evidences presented, as the reason for the decision, the committee said that since the activities of the group were \\"unlawful\\", \\"disruptive\\" and \\"threaten the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of India\\" and SFJ was \\"working in collusion with anti-India entities and forces\\", therefore, \\"the Central Government had sufficient cause to take action under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for declaring Sikhs For Justice as an unlawful association.\\" A member of the group was arrested in Malaysia and deported in September 2019. Also, out of the four terrorists arrested in Tarn Taran blast case in Punjab, one revealed that they were tasked to kill the leaders of various Deras in India by Sikhs for Justice. Furthermore, the Kartarpur Corridor that has been opened up for Sikhs, is reportedly being used for Khalistani propaganda by SFJ. The Haryana Police in July 2020 registered a first information report against Pannun for encouraging terrorism, promoting secessionism through automated phone calls and accusing people of Haryana of being against the interests of Punjabis as well as the Sikhs. Meanwhile in Punjab state, Pannun is booked for alleged links with terror modules. Another member Paramjit Singh Pamma also faces a murder charge.  Banned in India  Sikhs for Justice was banned on 10 July 2019 by Government of India under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for anti-India activities on 10 July 2019. Another online platform that SFJ planned to use for spreading its propaganda was Google Play, where an application was uploaded for people to register Referendum 2020. The application was reported, and thereafter removed by Google Play Store in November 2019. Its Facebook page had already been blocked from India by the company in 2015. On 1 July 2020, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun was declared as an \\"individual terrorist\\" under the UAPA for promoting secessionism and allegedly encouraging Punjabi Sikh youth to take up arms. The central government via an order of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on the recommendation of the Ministry of Home Affairs on 5 July, banned 40 websites belonging to the group for attracting people to its cause.

In the early 2010s, Dholakia's research focus shifted to the substantive area of financial decision making by consumers using motivation and decision making lenses. During the same time, he also got involved in research involving marketing strategy and activities for startups and small and medium-sized businesses. = Consumer motivation and Internet marketing = In the 1990s and early 2000s, Dholakia's primary research focus was in the areas of consumer motivation and Internet marketing. A part of his dissertation was published as a review paper titled 'Goal Setting and Goal Striving in Consumer Behavior' in the Journal of Marketing. In this area, Dholakia also conducted research on the mere measurement effect, on online social interactions, on perception, on impulsive choices and the social influence of brand community. His work on mere measurement effect shows that when customers are surveyed about their satisfaction, they behave more relationally towards the company conducting the survey. These effects are profitable and last even a year later. One of his papers on online social interactions entitled 'Intentional Social Action in Virtual Communities' published in the Journal of Interactive Marketing won the inaugural award for the best paper published in the journal in 2002. In 2004, he published 'A Social Influence Model of Consumer Participation in Network - and Small-Group-Based Virtual Communities' in the International Journal of Research in Marketing, which became one of his most cited papers. = Financial decision making = Since 2010, Dholakia has also researched financial decision making by consumers. His papers study the role of psychological factors in getting people to save more money. In a 2011 paper titled 'Delay and Duration Effects of Time Frames on Personal Savings Estimates and Behavior', with Leona Tam, Dholakia discovered that estimates of personal savings are sensitive to both duration (length of time for which they are made) and time-frame (how far into the future they are made). In a 2014 Psychological Science paper, 'Saving in Cycles: How to Get People to Save More Money', Tam and Dholakia discovered a method based on circular time orientation that is common in Asian cultures, that consumers can use to save more money. In a 2016 paper titled 'The Ant and the Grasshopper: Understanding Personal Saving Orientation of Consumers', Dholakia created a saving scale called 'Personal Saving Orientation' scale to measure affinity of consumers to save money consistently and incorporate saving behavior into their lifestyles.  In the media  Dholakia‚Äôs research has been covered extensively in the media. He conducted numerous studies of Groupon and other daily-deal promotions during 2010-2014, studying the pros and cons of running these promotions on the financial performance of small businesses. These studies received considerable media attention, including Harvard Business Review, Forbes, The Economist, Inc. magazine, The Atlantic, MIT Technology Review, The Telegraph, and the Houston Chronicle. During 2016-2019, Dholakia‚Äôs work on pricing issues for businesses and their implications for consumer welfare have been widely covered by the media including the Atlantic, Fox Business News, Money, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. He writes a blog on Psychology Today entitled The Science Behind Behavior.

It, with 256 pages, discusses historic movie theaters, of multiple varieties, in the city of Houston. According to Ron Briley, a teacher at Sandia Preparatory School who wrote a review for the Southwestern Historical Quarterly, the book is \\"essentially a nostalgic volume in which Welling laments that in its rapid urban development Houston destroyed many of the lavish movie palaces which once dotted the city's downtown landscape.\\" According to Aaron Carpenter, an undergraduate student at Duke University who wrote a review published in Cite: The Architecture + Design Review of Houston, the author shows his passion for the subject and that the book does not always have a tone of melancholy. Welling had the following steps in his research: he checked opening and closing dates and variations of names in directories published by the city government, then consulted newspapers-the Houston Chronicle and Houston Post-to clarify particular dates. Welling went to branches of the Houston Public Library to get copies of photographs of the theaters. Welling stated that the majority of the information he received came from the latter and that establishing the exact dates that a theater opened and/or closed was \\"the most time consuming\\" aspect of his research. The book has some discussion of theaters catering to arthouse cinema while most of the space is devoted to facilities for mainstream films. Briley wrote that by providing a chronology for the \\"thumbnail sketches\\", the author had \\"[made] a good effort to place the cinema of Houston in historical context\\". Briley added that the work \\"is more descriptive than analytical\\". The now-demolished Metropolitan Theatre is on the cover. Reception Carpenter concluded that the book \\"is fascinating, providing so much material for nostalgic reminiscences it is almost overwhelming.\\" See also * Culture of Houston References External links * Cinema Houston: From Nickelodeon to Megaplex - University of Texas Press Category:2007 books Category:Books about Houston Category:University of Texas Press books ","title":"Cinema Houston"},{"id":"61474859","title":"5th Guam Legislature"},{"id":"61474867","text":"Shivani Singh Tharu is a Nepalese former talk show host, model, and playwright.

The name, which is now the French word for \\"hood\\", is of Middle French origin, derived from the Italian word cappuccio and the Late Latin word cappa, meaning cloak. The Capuchins in turn were named after the capuche,Abraham Rees, The Cyclopaedia; Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Volume 6, p.512. a name which Richard Viladesau states was a tribute to the Camaldolese monks who gave early refuge to Matteo da Bascio, founder of the Capuchin Franciscans in the 1520s. An elongated hood worn by friars was originally denoted as a symbol of punishment or shame. Indeed there are testaments of the capuche being given to paupers or thrown into fires during the time of Francis of Assisi. In Medieval Spain, Muslims were forced to wear bright yellow capuches with a blue moon on the right shoulder and to live in enclosures (morer√≠as) to chasten them for not being Christian. The negative connotation associated with capuches appears to have been rescinded under St Bonaventure, who served as Minister General from 1257 to 1274. Bonaventure paid scrupulous attention to the uniforms of friars, issuing a decree which made friars more discernible from the Umbrian peasants. Bonaventure's decree made it obligatory for the backs of capuches to be pointed and rounded at the front, with a round cowl marginally large enough to cover the head. His reform concerning capuches effectively removed the stigma which had been attached to them among Franciscans. A black capuche was typically worn daily while a white one was much fuller and often reserved for ceremonial occasions. Capuchin friars once were grey but later a brown cloak with capuche and sandals had become the norm. The Cistercians wore a close-fitting cuculla talare with a capuche worn over the tunic. The Caeremoniae of Bursfelde in the latter half of the fifteenth century issued two different tunics, a scapular with a capuche for work purposes and a flocus, a sleeveless cuculla worn at night.

This distinctive session, organised by Coleman, places the maverick veteran in an open playing situation tailor-made for him - fronting a contemporary trio ...

From 2014 to 2022, the same networks will pay $39.6 billion for exactly the same broadcast rights. The NFL thus holds broadcast contracts with four companies (ViacomCBS, Comcast, Fox Corporation and The Walt Disney Company/Hearst Corporation, respectively) that control a combined vast majority of the country's television product. League-owned NFL Network, on cable television, also broadcasts a selected number of games nationally. In 2017, the NFL games attracted the top three rates for a 30-second advertisement: $699,602 for NBC Sunday Night Football, $550,709 for Thursday Night Football (NBC), and $549,791 for Thursday Night Football (CBS). Under the current contracts, regionally shown games on Sunday afternoons are televised on CBS and Fox, which primarily carry games of AFC and NFC teams respectively (the conference of the away team determines the broadcaster of an inter-conference game). Nationally televised regular season games on Sunday and Monday nights are aired on NBC and ESPN, respectively, while NBC, FOX and NFL Network share Thursday night games during the regular season. During the postseason, ESPN airs one game, NBC airs two, while CBS and Fox air the rest of the AFC and NFC games, respectively. The Super Bowl has rotated annually among CBS, Fox, and NBC since the 2006 season. NFL preseason telecasts are more in line with the other major sports leagues' regular-season telecasts: preseason telecasts are more locally produced, usually by a local affiliate of one of the above terrestrial television networks. Some preseason games will air nationally, however. Under the NFL's anti-siphoning rules for cable games, these stations usually will air simulcasts of ESPN and/or NFL Network games in their local markets if the local team is playing. Year-by-year breakdown =2010= With an average U.S. audience of 106.5 million viewers, Super Bowl XLIV on CBS was, at the time, the most-watched Super Bowl telecast in the championship game's history as well as the most-watched program of any kind in American television history, beating the record previously set 27 years earlier by the final episode of M*A*S*H, which was watched by 105.97 million viewers. The game telecast drew an overnight national Nielsen rating of 46.4 with a 68 share, the highest for a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XX in 1986; and drew a 56.3 rating in New Orleans and a 54.2 rating in Indianapolis, first and fourth respectively among local markets. Super Bowl XLV surpassed the record a year later and was itself topped by Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. The 2010 schedule, released on April 20, placed a Sunday night game (Pittsburgh Steelers at New Orleans Saints) against a World Series game for the first time since the NBC Sunday night contract began. It also continued the previous practice of scheduling a Sunday night game during every week of the season, and declaring the games in Weeks 11 through 16 (November 21 through December 26) as \\"flex games\\", meaning they reverted to Sunday afternoon if a more attractive matchup arose. A new graphics package for Fox's NFL telecasts debuted during an August 19, 2010 pre-season game, as the network began to broadcast its sports programming with graphics optimized for 16:9 displays rather than the 4:3 safe area, resulting in the network asking cable and satellite providers to comply and use the #10 Active Format Description code to send out over Fox programming, which displays 16:9 content in a letterboxed format on 4:3 screens (largely on the analog affiliate feed carried by the provider), in concert with Fox News Channel and its related news productions for the Fox network also switching to full widescreen presentation. This was promoted during that first game by the Fox broadcast team as giving a \\"widescreen viewing experience\\" to standard definition viewers, using the usual examples of more video information on the screen to demonstrate the new presentation (such as two cheerleaders off to the side displayed in a widescreen shot, but cut out of a 4:3 shot). The graphics package is an upgraded version of the 2006 design with a \\"much more colorful 3D look\\", implemented using a new infrastructure using products developed by Vizrt, which was also rolled out to other Fox Sports networks in subsequent months. The score banner previously used was replaced by an unconventional FoxBox-styled layout, positioned in the top left corner of the screen, with team logos and scores on either side, lights indicating timeouts on the side rims, with the play clock and quarter positioned in the center. Initially, the play clock also appeared within the center area with 10 seconds remaining, sliding the time remaining in the quarter upward. However, the play clock indicator was soon moved to the bar sliding out of the bottom to show downage. Due to issues with some cable providers and Fox affiliates (particularly those carried by digital subchannels or low-power analog television stations) in implementing the AFD #10 widescreen mode, or for other broadcasters that still broadcast with content framed for 4:3 displays instead of defaulting to 16:9 like Fox (such as CBS and NBC, along with ESPN and NFL Network until they also switched to 16:9 with letterboxed SD feeds), feeds of Fox's NFL games have been offered with graphics positioned for 4:3 displays instead of 16:9, and in most cases, only one game per week was broadcast with 16:9 graphics. On November 15, 2010, the Eagles visited the Redskins, in what was Donovan McNabb's second game against the Eagles since being traded on April 4 of that year. The Redskins won the first meeting that season by a score of 17‚Äì12; however, in the first half of the game, Eagles star quarterback Michael Vick suffered a rib injury knocking him out of the game, resulting in Kevin Kolb taking over. After the game, McNabb gave a post-game speech in the locker room in which he stated the Eagles made a mistake by trading him. Before the game, McNabb signed a five- year contract extension worth $78 million, after being benched in the fourth quarter just a week earlier. The very first play of the game Vick threw an 88-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson. The Redskins were criticized for their lack of coverage because the Eagles were known for going deep on the first play; the Eagles' next two possessions led to touchdowns. The very first play of the second quarter, with Philadelphia up 28‚Äì0, saw Vick throw a 48-yard touchdown to Jeremy Maclin. With Philadelphia up 45‚Äì21 at halftime, Vick threw a three-yard touchdown to Jason Avant in the third quarter to make the score 52‚Äì21. During the play, Vick scrambled, waiting for someone to get open when Albert Haynesworth (who signed a six-year $100 million contract with the Redskins the year prior) had fallen down and continued to lie on the field as Vick continued to scramble. The very next Redskins possession had McNabb throw a pick six to Dimitri Patterson, helping the Eagles score seven points. The Redskins went on to score one more touchdown, however their seven-point run was not able to stop Philadelphia, which defeated Washington 59‚Äì28. McNabb finished the game with 295 yards on 17 for 31, along with two touchdowns and three interceptions. The Eagles finished with 593 offense yards (setting a new team record); Vick went 20 of 28 for 333 yards throwing four touchdowns, and also ran for 80 yards and two touchdowns on eight carries. He became the first player with at least 300 yards passing, 50 yards rushing four passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns in a game. Vick's performance in the game also moved him past Steve Young for second place on the all-time list for rushing yards by a quarterback. On November 28, 2010, CBS broadcast its 5,000th NFL game. The game in question involved the Miami Dolphins visiting the Oakland Raiders, with Gus Johnson and Steve Tasker calling play-by-play. Fox presented a limited Monday night game between the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings on December 13, 2010. The game had been originally scheduled to be played on the afternoon on December 12, but due to the collapse of the roof of the Metrodome early that morning due to weight from heavy snowpack, the game was moved on short notice to Ford Field in Detroit as that facility already had their full television setup still in place after a Packers‚ÄìLions game. Fox Sports had kept their cameras on in the Metrodome overnight the night before the originally scheduled game day and captured the stadium roof collapse in full detail; the video of the early morning collapse, captured at multiple angles, aired on that day's edition of Fox NFL Sunday and quickly went viral. The game was only made available on the main Fox stations in the New York and Twin Cities media markets; owned-and-operated station WNYW and affiliate WXXA-TV aired the game in the New York City and Albany television markets, while Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul owned-and-operated station KMSP-TV, and affiliates KXLT-TV in Rochester and KQDS-TV in Duluth, Minnesota carried the game for the Vikings' markets. The game was also carried on satellite provider DirecTV through its NFL Sunday Ticket package. Coincidentally, this was the first game since 1992 that Brett Favre did not start an NFL game, as he was placed on the inactive list due to a shoulder injury, ending his streak of 297 consecutive regular season games; Tarvaris Jackson started in his place and subsequently Joe Webb had his first ever down in an NFL game. In addition, it was the first ever regular-season Monday night game in Ford Field. In December 2010, Fox experimented with using an in-game soundtrack during a regional game between the Arizona Cardinals and Carolina Panthers. The following week on December 16, Fox publicly announced that it would also feature it during a game on December 20 between the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks. Fox Sports president Eric Shanks revealed that CSI: Miami composer Jeff Cardoni had contributed music for the experiment, and saw potential in the concept, explaining that \\"just like music in movies, you have to use it at the right times. And imagine trying to score a movie the first time you're seeing it.\\" The concept was met with mixed reaction; sports blogger Michael David Smith believed that the music was \\"goofy\\", distracting and added nothing to the game. The Week 16 game, between the Minnesota Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles, originally scheduled for December 26, was moved to December 28 due to a major blizzard that affected most of the Eastern United States. The NFL postponed the game after Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter declared a snow emergency for the city. It was the 23rd NFL game to be played on a Tuesday, but the first since . This was the only game, outside of the final Sunday night, to be \\"flexed\\" in the 2010 season; the original schedule called for the San Diego Chargers to play the Bengals in Cincinnati (the game was moved to CBS, and was indeed blacked out in Cincinnati). Because of this, a full 90-minute edition of Football Night aired on December 26, with a short five-minute pre-game leading into the game on the 28th, while Faith Hill's introduction was not played due to time constraints before kickoff. For the Week 17 matchup, NBC featured the 7‚Äì8 St. Louis Rams playing the 6‚Äì9 Seattle Seahawks in a win-and- in game, where the winner of the game would qualify for the playoffs as the NFC West Division Champion while the loser will be eliminated. The Seattle Seahawks defeated the St. Louis Rams by a score of 16‚Äì6, thus advancing to the playoffs whilst the Rams were eliminated from playoff contention =2011= On January 23, 2011, Fox NFL Sunday also broadcast an on-location edition at Soldier Field in Chicago for the 2010 NFC Championship; the program held its Super Bowl XLV pregame show in Arlington, Texas on February 6, 2011. The 2011 schedule, released on April 19, once again placed a Sunday night game (Indianapolis Colts at New Orleans Saints on October 23, the fourth straight time these teams played each other on national television) opposite a World Series game. Sunday night games between November 13 and December 18 (inclusive) were \\"flex games\\", which could have reverted to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose (one was; see below). The final Sunday night of the season ‚Äì January 1, 2012 ‚Äì was likewise a \\"flex game\\"; the slot, vacant when the schedule was released, was filled by the game between the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants (see below). The Hall of Fame Game scheduled for August 7, and to be shown on NBC, was canceled due to the lockout that offseason; it was the only game to be affected. For the second consecutive season, and third overall, the last Sunday night game that was flexed in featured a contest in which the winner would become the division champions and earn a home game in the playoffs while the loser would be eliminated. This particular matchup was for the NFC East between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys at MetLife Stadium, a rematch of Week 14's Sunday night broadcast. This was the first time NBC had shown both meetings of division rivals during a regular season. Starting with the 2011 NFL season, Fox NFL Sunday introduced a new feature called \\"Fox :45\\", which is usually formatted a sing-along parody of a famous song, or as a comedic sketch. The parodies and sketches usually relate to current events occurring during the football season. The program also introduced the \\"Twitter Tracker\\", which scrolls tweets from NFL players and coaches. Small tweaks were also made by Fox for the 2011 season, including the timeout indicators counting upward instead of downward, and the possession indicator now appearing alongside the team that currently is in possession of the ball. Additionally, the scoreboard next to the Fox Sports bug for other ongoing NFL games was replaced by a traditional ticker first seen on Fox Major League Baseball broadcasts; the bug was made slightly smaller and rounder as well. Special holiday animations also appeared with the banner package; digitally animated leaves fell on top of the FoxBox on Thanksgiving, while falling snow piles on top during the last two weeks of December in observance of the Christmas and holiday season, with the timeout indicators being changed in the latter instance to resemble strings of Christmas lights. ESPN renewed its contract with the NFL in 2011 which extends to ESPN the NFL broadcast rights through the 2021‚Äì22 season.

On October 3, 2011, Hank Williams Jr. made controversial remarks during an interview on Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, when talking about a golf outing he went on that summer with Barack Obama, John Boehner, Joe Biden and John Kasich. Williams compared President Obama and Speaker of the House Boehner golfing together to \\"Hitler playing golf with [Israeli prime minister] Netanyahu\\", stressing their philosophical and political differences. On October 6, 2011, ESPN subsequently announced that it would stop using \\"All My Rowdy Friends\\" as its theme song (as the song is still owned by Williams) and drop Williams from the show's opening. Williams commented on the matter: \\"After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made my decision... By pulling my opening October 3, [ESPN] stepped on the toes of the First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore me, my song, and All My Rowdy Friends are out of here. It's been a great run.\\" MNF was absent an opening sequence from Week 4 through the end of that season. In 2017, ESPN re-hired Hank Williams Jr. for the intro. The NFL announced on November 8 that the Week 13 rivalry game between the Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots would be moved to 1:00 p.m. Eastern on CBS, while a replacement game would be announced by November 22. This was due to the Colts struggling without their star quarterback Peyton Manning (without him, the Colts lost 62‚Äì7 to the New Orleans Saints in a Sunday night game on October 23). This also marked the first time the NFL announced that a Sunday night game was being moved to the afternoon without simultaneously announcing a replacement. On November 21, the matchup between the Detroit Lions and New Orleans Saints was flexed into the Sunday night slot. As compensation to Fox because they only had two other games in the early time slot, the league gave them the Denver Broncos-Minnesota Vikings game that was originally to air on CBS. This was the first time that the league moved an interconference telecast to the home team's Sunday afternoon regional broadcaster. On November 14, the NFL decided to keep the Week 12 matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs on November 27 in place after the league considered flexing it out for other matchups, particularly the AFC East showdown between the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets and the interconference matchup between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Tennessee Titans, due to the AFC West (of which the Chiefs are a member) being a weak division for 2011. On December 7, the NFL ended up keeping the Week 15 matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Diego Chargers on December 18, a decision that came a day late due to the NFL Committees meetings that took place on the day before. NBC wanted the game between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos as it featured a matchup between Tom Brady and Tim Tebow, two players with high popularity. While CBS did not protect that game, the network was fighting to keep the game since they had lost the aforementioned Week 13 Broncos-Vikings game to Fox, denying the network the earlier chance to capitalize on Tebow's marketability. On December 14, 2011, the NFL, along with Fox, NBC and CBS, announced a nine- year extension of the league's rights deal with all three networks to the end of the 2022 season. The extended contract includes the continued rotation of the Super Bowl yearly among the three networks, meaning CBS would air Super Bowls XLVII (2013), 50 (2016), LIII (2019), and LVI (2022). The 2011 Sunday Ngiht Football season ended with an average of 20.7 million viewers and was the highest-rated program of the 2011‚Äì12 television season, dethroning American Idol, which was the highest-rated program for eight consecutive seasons. As a further result, Sunday Night Football became the first-ever television sports series of any kind to finish a television season as the most-watched show. =2012= NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI at the end of the 2011 season became the most-watched program in the history of United States television, with 111.3 million US viewers, according to Nielsen. The game was the first Super Bowl telecast to be streamed live online legally in the U.S., both to computers (via NFL.com and NBCSports.com) and mobile devices (via Verizon Wireless's NFL Mobile app),. The game marked Al Michaels' eighth time conducting play-by-play for a Super Bowl (Michaels had previously done play-by-play for Super Bowls XXII, XXV, XXIX, XXXIV, XXXVII and XL for ABC, and Super Bowl XLIII for NBC). The 2012 schedule, released on April 17, once again placed a Sunday night game (New Orleans Saints at Denver Broncos) against a World Series game. This was the third straight year a World Series game competed against a Sunday night game. During the halftime of that game, NBC News aired a brief special report regarding Superstorm Sandy, anchored by Brian Williams. Sunday night games between November 18 and December 23 (inclusive) were \\"flex games\\"; they would revert to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose. After two years of using the unconventional layout, for 2012, a more traditional FoxBox was introduced; team abbreviations (in the team's primary color) are stacked on the left side of the box, with timeout lights positioned underneath each team abbreviation, and a possession indicator to the left of it. The clock/quarter indicator is on the right side. Down and distance pops out of the bottom, while the timeout/penalty/touchdown animation is the same as in the unconventional design of the previous two seasons. Also for the 2012 season, Fox began providing play-by-play commentary of all games in Spanish on its second audio program channel. In 2013, in observance of the holiday season, Christmas lights returned to the FoxBox along the sides of the graphic, but they no longer correspond to timeouts. When a team scores, calls a timeout or gets called on a penalty, the lights change from red, green and blue to the corresponding team's color for the duration of the graphic, before returning to the normal colors. For the 2012 NFL season, CBS began providing Spanish play-by-play commentary of all game broadcasts via a secondary audio program feed. Also in 2012, to further prevent issues surrounding late games from delaying primetime programming on the east coast (also influenced by other recent changes slowing the pace of games, such as video reviews and the kickoff for late games being moved from 4:15 to 4:25 p.m. Eastern Time), CBS began to move the start of its primetime schedule to 7:30 p.m. on weeks that the network carries a 4:25 p.m. game. The only flexed game of the season that displaced a scheduled game took place on December 23; the San Diego Chargers at New York Jets game reverted to the afternoon, and the San Francisco 49ers played in Seattle that night. This resulted in the 49ers playing on consecutive Sunday nights, both on the road (the team played in New England the previous Sunday night, December 16). A portion of the San Francisco-New England game aired on the NBC Sports Network and CNBC due to NBC News' live coverage of Barack Obama's speech following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The final Sunday night of the season ‚Äì December 30, 2012 ‚Äì likewise was a \\"flex game\\"; the slot was left vacant when the schedule was released, as has been the practice of the past four seasons. It was filled by the game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington Redskins. Usually announced on the Tuesday before game day (but sometimes before), the game typically highlights a situation in which the winner advances to the playoffs while the loser does not; the winner of this flex game would win its division, although the Redskins would still advance to the playoffs as a wild card team ‚Äì even if the team lost ‚Äì if certain other teams lost. After the first 15 games were played that day, which included the Minnesota Vikings clinching the #6 seed in the NFC with a win, the game would turn out to be a winner-take-all, in which the winner would clinch the No. 4 seed in the NFC and the loser would be eliminated regardless. The Redskins would eventually defeat the Cowboys 28‚Äì18 and clinch their first NFC East crown since 1999. Sunday Night Football ranked the most-watched program in the United States during the 2011‚Äì12 season. This feat was repeated during the 2013‚Äì14 season; in that case, NBC finished the season as the #1 network among adults aged 18‚Äì49 for the first time since 2004 and #2 in total viewership (behind longtime leader CBS). =2013= Super Bowl XLVII was broadcast for free on the internet on the host network's website, in this case CBSSports.com. CBS charged an average of $4 million for a 30-second commercial during the game, the highest rate for any Super Bowl. According to Nielsen, Super Bowl XLVII was watched by an estimated average total audience of 108.69 million U.S. viewers, with a record 164.1 million tuning into at least six minutes of the game. CBS also debuted a new graphics package starting with the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLVII; the package was used for all CBS game telecasts beginning with the 2013 season. Originally optimized for a 4:3 display, the elements are now optimized for the 16:9 format as a result of the network's incorporation of the AFD #10 broadcast tag. The lower third graphics adopt the column layout for player info graphics used by several other sports broadcasters. The portion containing the player's name is stacked on the left, with the team's primary color in the background of the name panel. Other statistics are shown on a gray background on panels to the right. The score banner is gray with team abbreviations listed over their primary color and next to their logo. For Sunday game broadcasts, the NFL on CBS logo is placed on the left; the \\"NFL\\" portion disappears and is replaced by the down and distance, \\"Flag\\", or \\"Official Review\\". Also for the Sunday broadcasts, challenges and statistics drop down from the bar. The only scoring play which used an animation is a touchdown, which involves the team logo and the word \\"Touchdown\\" appearing in place of the banner. Timeout indicators are located above the team abbreviations for Sunday broadcasts, and a possession indicator is located to the right of the abbreviation. The 2013 schedule, released on April 18, once again placed a Sunday night game (Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings) against a World Series game. This was the fourth straight year that a World series game competed against a Sunday night game. Sunday night games between November 17 and December 22 (inclusive) were \\"flex games\\", they would revert to Sunday afternoon if a more competitive matchup arose. The final Sunday night of the season ‚Äì December 29, 2013 ‚Äì likewise was a \\"flex game\\"; the slot was left vacant when the schedule was released, as has been the practice of the past five seasons. The game site (and, by extension, its teams) was determined after the completion of most Week 16 games. It was filled by the game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys. Beginning with the 2013 season, The NFL Today, along with all other CBS Sports presentations, switched to a 16:9 widescreen presentation that extended or placed graphics outside of the 4:3 safe area, with the network requiring cable television providers to use the #10 Active Format Description tag to present the broadcasts in a letterboxed format for viewers watching a CBS station's standard definition feed. The league announced on November 1, 2013, that the Week 11 Kansas City Chiefs‚ÄìDenver Broncos game, originally scheduled as CBS's only late 4:05 p.m. Eastern Time singleheader game, was flexed into the Sunday Night Football, replacing the originally scheduled Green Bay Packers‚ÄìNew York Giants game. CBS originally selected the Chiefs‚ÄìBroncos matchup as one of their \\"protected games\\" from flex-scheduling, but later allowed the league to flex it so it could be seen by a national audience. This would be one of two cases of a team playing on consecutive Sunday nights due to one of the games being moved into the Sunday night slot (as the Broncos would play the New England Patriots the following Sunday night); the Philadelphia Eagles, the other team to play on consecutive Sunday nights, played at home against the Chicago Bears on December 22 and played in Dallas on December 29. The late- afternoon regional games held on December 1, 2013 (Denver-Kansas City and Cincinnati-San Diego) drew a 16.7 household rating, a 29 share, and 28.106 million viewers from 4:25 to 7:47 p.m. Eastern Time. On December 2, 2013, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported (via Twitter) that the Week 15 rivalry game between the Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals for December 15 would remain in the Sunday night slot, a report later confirmed by the NFL. The league had considered flexing the game out due to the Steelers starting the season 0‚Äì4, which included a 20‚Äì10 loss to the Bengals on Monday Night Football earlier in the season that was more of a blowout than the final score indicated. Ultimately, it was decided to keep the rematch in the Sunday night slot due to the Steelers making a late playoff push, the team's fanbase that provides high ratings regardless of how well the Steelers are doing, as well as a lack of compelling matchups for the week, with only two other pairings that did not have a team with a losing record by the flex deadline (Patriots at Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens at Detroit Lions, the latter being a Monday night game which could not be flexed out of its slot). On December 10, 2013, the NFL decided to flex the Week 16 Chicago Bears-Philadelphia Eagles matchup into the Sunday night slot, replacing the New England Patriots-Baltimore Ravens matchup, which moved to the late afternoon slot on CBS. The move surprised many in the television industry, as all four teams were strong playoff contenders. Some have speculated that since the Patriots had an opportunity to lock up the AFC East before their game in Baltimore (the Patriots were ultimately upset by the Dolphins 24-20), while the other three teams would not be able to clinch playoff spots (nor would they be eliminated) prior to Week 16, that the Bears-Eagles matchup might be more compelling. There was also speculation that moving the Patriots-Ravens game to the late afternoon slot on CBS gives that network a more compelling matchup in their week to have a doubleheader, as the other two matchups scheduled to air on CBS in the late afternoon slot featured teams that were having down years (Steelers-Packers) or weren't expected to contend for the playoffs and only appealed to their home markets (Raiders-Chargers); the Patriots-Ravens matchup ultimately received CBS's primary broadcasting crew (Jim Nantz and Phil Simms) and national coverage outside the local markets and blacked out markets of the other late games. John Ourand of SportsBusiness Journal reported that the league wanted to keep the total number of games taken from CBS and Fox, dating back to the start of the current television contracts, roughly equal. Otherwise, an obscure rule in the broadcast contracts would have prevented the league from possibly flexing a Week 17 AFC game, originally scheduled to be televised on CBS, to the final Sunday night slot. No Sunday night Game was originally scheduled for Week 17 of the NFL season, thus allowing the ability to move the most intriguing and playoff-relevant matchup of the week to the Sunday night time slot. The final game of the 2013 NFL regular season was played on December 29, 2013 between the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys to determine the NFC East division champion. The Eagles won by a score of 24‚Äì22, thus advancing to the playoffs. =2014= On February 5, 2014, the league announced it had sold off eight weeks of the NFL Network's Thursday Night Football package to CBS, who outbid competitors ABC, Fox, NBC, and Turner Sports. NFL Network would simulcast CBS' Thursday night games from weeks 2 through 8, will continue to carry the Thursday night games from Week 9 onward, and would also carry two Saturday night games (Week 16 doubleheader) for the first time since 2011, with one of those games being simulcast on CBS.Fang, Ken. Thursday night football largely a success. AwfulAnnouncing.com. Retrieved October 27, 2014. All of these games (except for the one NFL Network-only Saturday night game) would be announced by CBS' lead commentating team of Jim Nantz (play-by-play) and Phil Simms (color analyst). The deal with CBS was initially only for the 2014 season, with the league having the option to extend it for an additional season. CBS is paying an additional $275 million for the package. Local CBS affiliates automatically get the local simulcast rights to any game carried only on NFL Network. The league exercised the option to extend its agreement with CBS through the 2015 season. On February 5, 2014, the NFL announced that a deal with CBS to broadcast Thursday night games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season games beginning the following season in simulcast with NFL Network, with the remainder airing on NFL Network exclusively. With the addition of the package, CBS announced an additional NFL Today broadcast for the games, to be broadcast from the site of each week's game; with James Brown and Bill Cowher to be featured on both the Thursday and Sunday broadcasts, Deion Sanders returning to the program as an analyst for the Thursday editions. On February 18, 2014, CBS Sports announced that Shannon Sharpe and Dan Marino were being relieved of their duties as on- air commentators, to be replaced by Tony Gonzalez and Bart Scott. When the 2014 NFL schedule was released on April 23, it placed a Sunday night game (Green Bay Packers at New Orleans Saints) against a World Series game for the fifth straight year. Starting with this season, NBC was permitted to begin flexing games as soon as Week 5, with the restriction that no more than two games may be flexed between Weeks 5 and 10. The final Sunday night of the season ‚Äì December 28, 2014 ‚Äì likewise was a flex game; the slot was left vacant when the schedule was released, as had been the practice of the past six seasons. The game's teams (and, by extension, its location) was announced after most week 16 games it was filled by the Cincinnati Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers. Country/pop superstar Carrie Underwood continued her role as the performer of the Sunday Night Football opener. This was also the first season of \\"cross-flexing\\", enabling CBS to air several NFC away games and Fox to broadcast some AFC away games. The first game that was cross-flexed was the Week One Buffalo Bills at Chicago Bears contest, which aired on Fox instead of CBS. During the first Thursday edition of The NFL Today on September 11, 2014, in the wake of the domestic violence controversy involving Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, Brown spoke via satellite to CBS News anchor Scott Pelley and spoke face-to-face with CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell, who had interviewed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell days before. Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti also appeared in a taped interview with Brown. During the pre-game, Brown updated his 2012 digression about domestic violence, wondering why in the two years since his initial commentary, that nothing had been done to change the problem, and how the problem had actually become worse. For the 2014 season, Fox's graphics were changed to match those that had previously been introduced on Fox Sports's Major League Baseball and NASCAR coverage. The graphics package itself is similar to the previous look, however with a more boxy appearance, and the fonts used are rounder and have less of an athletic appearance than previous packages used by Fox. The layout of the score box is essentially a mirror image of the already-introduced MLB graphic, except that the NFL version is on the top-left of the screen, while the baseball version was originally on the bottom-left (it was moved to the bottom-right beginning in 2016). Like the MLB graphic, the box has two components: a main box and a dynamic strip. The main box contains the team abbreviations, stacked on top of the team scores. The possession indicator is a line above the team holding the ball; timeout indicators, which are counting downward, are stacked next to the scores. This unconventional layout of displaying the scores (also used in 2010 and 2011) is only used for NFL coverage; college football and MLB coverage use the traditional layout with the team abbreviations to the left of the scores. The dynamic strip normally shows the next down that will occur, such as \\"3rd Down\\". It changes to show down and distance and the play clock, and turns yellow if a flag is thrown. When a score occurs, the dynamic strip disappears and the main box changes to show the logo of the team scoring, along with the type of score (\\"TOUCHDOWN\\", \\"FIELD GOAL\\", \\"SAFETY\\"). For a penalty, the main box shows the logo of the offending team, while the dynamic strip turns yellow and displays the type of penalty. When a timeout is called, the dynamic strip turns to the color of the team taking the timeout and displays \\"Timeout\\", while the main box displays the team's logo over a neutral gray background. After a few seconds, the main box returns to the scores and a small gray box with the team logo appears next to the word \\"Timeout\\" in the dynamic strip. For a review or a challenge, the dynamic strip moves from the bottom to the right side of the main box and turns red, displaying whether it is a challenge, an official review, or a scoring review. When the decision is announced, the strip expands to show the result of the review on a yellow background. After a few seconds, the strip shifts back to the bottom of the main box and if a timeout is charged on a lost challenge, the strip shows the team charged with the timeout. On November 11, 2014, the NFL announced that the November 23 game between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants game would air as scheduled, even though the Detroit Lions-New England Patriots game was considered to be a better matchup, citing that the Cowboys are one of the most popular NFL teams playing in the country's largest media market. For the first time since flexed scheduling went into effect, no Sunday night games were flexed during the season other than Week 17 (where the matchup is usually determined as late as six days prior to the Sunday of Week 17). On December 21, 2014, the NFL announced that the rivalry game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals would be flexed into the Week 17 Sunday Night Football slot, with the winner clinching the AFC North. The league considered flexing the Atlanta Falcons- Carolina Panthers game into the Sunday night slot as it decided the NFC South while the loser would be eliminated, but the division being historically weak (it was assured to have a division winner with a losing record by the end of Week 16), combined with the Steelers being a major draw, led to the league's decision. With the Steelers and Bengals clinching a playoff spot in Week 16, it also marked the first time since the NFL scheduled all-intradivisional matchups in Week 17 in 2010 that a game flexed to the Week 17 slot featured at least one team (in this case both) that was already in the playoffs. It was later reported by Sports Illustrated columnist Peter King that the league chose to flex the Steelers-Bengals game because CBS has not had a game flexed in the Week 17 slot since 2009; the aforementioned Falcons-Panthers matchup was later cross-flexed to CBS. =2015= NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIX at the end of 2014 season became the most-watched program in the history of United States Television, with 114.4 million US viewers, according to Nielsen. The game was the fourth overall telecast to be streamed live online legally in the U.S. both to computers (via NFL.com and NBCSports.com) for the second time and mobile devices (via Verizon Wireless's NFL Mobile app). The game marked Al Michaels ninth time conducting play-by-play for a Super Bowl (Michaels had previously done play-by-play for Super Bowls XXII, XXV, XXIX, XXXIV, XXXVII and XL for ABC and XLIII and XLVI for NBC). For the game live-streamed on Yahoo in 2015, all silver \\"CBS\\" marks in the graphics package were replaced by purple \\"Yahoo\\" logos. The game used the top-screen version of the scoring banner. The 2015 schedule was released on April 21, 2015. The defending Super Bowl champions the New England Patriots faced the Pittsburgh Steelers during the NFL Kickoff Game on Thursday, September 10, 2015. Other notable games included the Seattle Seahawks versus the Green Bay Packers (Week 2) and the New England Patriots versus the Indianapolis Colts (Week 6) in a rematch of their respective conference championship games. It also placed a Sunday night game (Green Bay Packers at Denver Broncos) against a World Series game for the sixth straight year. The final Sunday night game of the season ‚Äì January 3, 2016 ‚Äì likewise was a flex game; the slot was left vacant when the schedule came out as has been the practice over the past seven seasons. The game's teams (and by extension, its location) was announced after most Week 16 games. It was filled by the Minnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers. The Arizona Cardinals wound up playing on consecutive Sunday nights ‚Äî at the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10 and then, at home against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 11 (Cardinals won both of those games), with the latter being flexed into the Sunday night slot. In November 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that in response to the success of the package under CBS, the NFL was planning to negotiate a long-term contract for Thursday Night Football, with CBS, Fox, NBC, and Turner Sports showing interest. The New York Post reported that this deal would also include the sale of a stake in NFL Network itself. On December 16, 2015, it was reported that the NFL was shopping the Thursday Night Football package as a one-year deal with an option for a second year, similarly to the current arrangement with CBS; the league also requested that bidders outline goals for \\"growing\\" NFL Network. The league was also reportedly interested in selling non-exclusive digital rights to simulcast the games to another partner, such as Amazon.com, Apple Inc., Google, or Yahoo! (which exclusively streamed an International Series as part of a trial during the 2015 season, but would shut down its original video content service in January 2016). In January 2016, it was reported that the NFL was considering splitting the Thursday Night Football package across multiple broadcasters in tandem with the possibility of expanding the overall package to 17 games. It was also reported that ESPN and Turner Sports were not interested in the package due to its short-term nature, and that Fox was attempting to outbid CBS. The December 20 game (Cincinnati Bengals at San Francisco 49ers) reverted to the afternoon, replaced by the Arizona Cardinals-Philadelphia Eagles game. The Minnesota Vikings also wound up playing on consecutive Sunday nights beginning in Week 16 at home against the New York Giants and on the road in Week 17 against the Green Bay Packers. =2016= On February 1, 2016, the league announced that NBC had won a partial share of Thursday Night Football rights for the 2016 season; as a result, five additional Thursday night games (in addition the kickoff and Thanksgiving contests) in the later part of the season had been added to NBC's schedule. NBC Sports was also responsible for producing five games that was exclusive to NFL Network. After the 2017 season, NBC insisted on a reduced rights fee in order to continue carrying Thursday Night Football, which the NFL rejected; Fox was then awarded the rights to Thursday Night Football for the remainder of the time left on the league's broadcast contracts. NBC will continue to carry the kickoff and Thanksgiving night games on Thursdays. Beginning with the network's February 7, 2016 broadcast of Super Bowl 50, and continuing with the network's broadcast of Super Bowl LIII, CBS Sports debuted a new logo along with a new on-air graphics package that is optimized for the 16:9 format. The new graphics were rolled out on all of CBS Sports' other properties (including the network's joint production of NCAA March Madness with Turner Sports) in subsequent months. The score bar is now located at the bottom of the screen for all broadcasts, no matter what day they take place on. The CBS eye logo is at the far left. If there is no down and distance displayed, the word \\"NFL\\" accompanies the logo. The down-and-distance display, which was previously shown on the left side of the bar, is now shown on the right side of the bar. When it appears, the \\"NFL\\" on the other side of the bar disappears. Possession of the ball is indicated by the background color in the down-and-distance display. The play clock is now located to the right of the game clock. The timeout indicators, which are now shown as white dash marks, are located below the team's abbreviation, both placed against the team's main color. The team logo is to the left of the abbreviation. The score is in a darker shade of the team's color to the right. Whenever a team scores a touchdown, the graphic displays the team's wordmark, followed by \\"TOUCHDOWN\\" before the graphic returns to normal. Beginning with Week 6 of the 2017 NFL season, the records for each team were displayed to the right of the timeout indicators. During the playoffs and Week 1 of the 2018 season, the records are not displayed. The new \\"NFL on CBS\\" logo has reversed the order, now reading \\"CBS NFL\\", and is constantly present in the upper-right corner of the screen. However, the new package was not implemented for CBS's reduced schedule of early-season Thursday Night Football broadcasts, which continued to use the previous set (with CBS logos continuing to be replaced by generic TNF logos). The 2013 graphics continued to be used on 2017 TNF broadcasts. Also in 2017, for CBS- produced games airing only on NFLN, the 2013 graphics continued to be used, but with the \\"CBS TNF\\" logo modified to \\"NFL TNF\\" for these games, using the NFL shield in place of the CBS eye logo and the word \\"CBS\\". CBS ceased airing the Thursday games after 2017. A version of this package was used during all games of the short lived Alliance of American Football league in the Spring of 2019, with all CBS branding replaced with AAF branding for non-CBS games (the AAF was also broadcast on Turner Sports and the NFL Network). The 2016 schedule was released on April 14, 2016. NBC's first telecast of the season featured a rematch of Super Bowl 50 when the Denver Broncos played host to the Carolina Panthers, the first time the Super Bowl participants faced each other in Week 1 of the subsequent year since 1970. It also placed a Sunday night game (Philadelphia Eagles at Dallas Cowboys) against a World Series game for the seventh straight year. The Thanksgiving night match-up featured the Pittsburgh Steelers against the Indianapolis Colts, and for the first time since 2011, NBC carried a Christmas Day game as the Broncos traveled to play the Kansas City Chiefs, a rematch of the Week 12 game in Denver that was flexed into that week's Sunday night slot. In addition, NBC carried five late season Thursday Night Football games in conjunction with NFL Network in a similar arrangement to the one NFLN has with CBS. As before, flexible scheduling rules went into effect in Week 5, with Week 16 excluded because the majority of the schedule was played on Christmas Eve. The final Sunday night game of the season ‚Äì Sunday, January 1, 2017 ‚Äì likewise was a flex game; the slot was left vacant when the schedule came out as has been the practice over the past eight seasons. The game's teams (and by extension, its location) was announced after most Week 16 games. It was filled by the Green Bay Packers at Detroit Lions. Also this season, NBC was home to two Super Bowl rematches. As previously mentioned, the Carolina vs. Denver game was a rematch of Super Bowl 50. Then, 9 weeks later on a Sunday night, the Patriots hosted the Seattle Seahawks in a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX, a game that was also seen on NBC, on February 1, 2015. On September 11, 2016, The NFL Today debuted a new program logo, replacing a variation of the previous logo used since the 2006 NFL season. Also on September 11, 2016, Fox NFL Sunday was broadcast on location in Houston (the host city of Super Bowl LI) for the start of the 2016 NFL season. This also marked Curt Menefee's tenth season as full-time host of the pregame show. While the crew did the pregame, halftime and post-game shows, Charissa Thompson (host of Fox NFL Kickoff) served as the studio host and anchored the in-game highlights. For Fox's regular season games only, beginning with Week 3 of 2016, the record for each team was added to the box, making the team abbreviations of each team smaller. Fox gradually worked elements of a new square-edged graphics package with thinner fonts into secondary situations during the 2016 season. This package (in white instead of black) was used for Fox's Super Bowl LI pregame, halftime, and post game shows, but the game broadcast itself continued to use the 2014 package. However, the translucent shading around the scoreboard was removed for the Super Bowl. The Week 5 game between the New York Giants and the Green Bay Packers was placed against the second presidential debate. The debate did not air on NBC due to contractual obligations; however, it was carried by several other channels including sister networks CNBC and MSNBC. The Week 7 game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Arizona Cardinals ended in a 6‚Äì6 tie following a missed field goal from each team in the last minutes of overtime. This became not only the first tie to be featured on Sunday Night Football, but also the first tie not to see a touchdown since 1972, as well as the lowest scoring tie, and the second lowest score in the prime time slot. For 2016 and 2017, the league split a ten-game package of Thursday night games between NBC and CBS, with each paying an estimated $225 million per season for five games; CBS's games would be in the early part of the season as before, while NBC's would cover later in the season. Under the terms of NFL Network's retransmission agreements with cable providers, the NFL has included a stipulation requiring seven games in the Thursday Night Football package to be carried solely on NFL Network; for the 2018 season, potential bidders were free to place a bid on a package ranging from anywhere between four and eleven games. Fox, the winning bidder, bought all eleven games that were up for bids. As the eighteen total games involve more time slots than can be accommodated with the fourteen Thursday night time slots (excluding the kickoff, Thanksgiving, and the last week of the season when no Thursday game is played), four of the games are played on days other than Thursdays (usually this involves at least one game in London in a Sunday morning time slot and the remainder on Saturdays, all NFL Network exclusives), or if Christmas lands on a Monday, either a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day game. The first game produced by NBC Sports was broadcast exclusively on NFL Network on November 3, 2016, while the first game simulcast nationally on NBC aired on November 17. A cappella group Pentatonix recorded a reworked version of their song \\"Sing\\" (\\"Weekend Go\\") to serve as the opening theme song for NBC's Thursday Night Football telecasts; NBC also commissioned new instrumental theme music by Jimmy Greco, \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", which was performed by members of the orchestra from the Broadway musical Hamilton. Both were retained for NBC's games in 2017. After the addition of Thursday Night Football to NBC's rights holdings, the network elected to give Al Michaels time off. Mike Tirico, who left ESPN to become the heir apparent to Michaels at NBC, called select telecasts in his place. On December 4, 2016, the NFL announced that it had flexed the Tampa Bay Buccaneers-Dallas Cowboys game into the Sunday night slot for Week 15, replacing the originally-scheduled Pittsburgh Steelers-Cincinnati Bengals game, which was moved to the 1:00 p.m. ET slot as the early game on CBS. As a result, the Cowboys wound up playing on consecutive Sunday nights ‚Äî on the road against the New York Giants in Week 14 (which they lost, 10-7) & then at home against the Buccaneers in Week 15 (which they won, 26-20), and as a result, the Cowboys wound up playing back-to-back-to-back games on NBC, beginning with their post-Thanksgiving Thursday Night Game against Minnesota, their scheduled Week 14 game against the Giants, as mentioned, and their Week 15 Game against Tampa Bay, which was also previously mentioned. Bart Scott and Tony Gonzalez both left The NFL Today prior to the 2017 season, with Gonzalez switching networks to join Fox's pregame coverage. Phil Simms, who had been demoted from CBS's lead color commentator position when the network hired Tony Romo for that post, and Nate Burleson, who comes over from NFL Network, replaced Scott and Gonzalez. =2017= On January 15, 2017, NBC was scheduled to carry an AFC divisional playoff game with the Chiefs at home against the Steelers in the afternoon; on January 13, the NFL announced that game would move to primetime on NBC the same day due to an ice storm affecting the Kansas City area which would cause perilous travel for fans if the game went on as regularly scheduled, and thus becoming an unexpected bonus Sunday Night Football broadcast in its regular timeslot. NBC filled the vacated afternoon timeslot with a NHL game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Washington Capitals. On April 4, 2017, it was announced that Amazon.com had acquired non- exclusive streaming rights to the 10 broadcast television games for the 2017 season over their Amazon Prime Video service, under a deal valued at $50 million, a five-fold increase over the $10 million paid by Twitter. The streams will be exclusive to paid Prime subscribers. The deal includes $30 million worth of promotion. Amazon planned several special features for its inaugural game, including broadcasting alternate feeds with Spanish, Portuguese and British English commentary (the last of which being intended for those unfamiliar with the rules and terminology of American football), and a pre-show hosted by Tiki Barber and Curtis Stone that featured presentations of NFL merchandise available for purchase on Amazon. Starting on August 27, 2017, after three years of using the unconventional layout from the previous graphics package, a new, traditional score bar was introduced. The score bug was moved from the top left to across the bottom of the screen and is now horizontal. Additionally, team names are displayed instead of their abbreviations and the clock is located towards the right of the bug and the down and distance is displayed on the far right. Also, timeout indicators are shown below the team names and the possession indicator, which was originally shown below the team's score (through Week 4 of the 2017 NFL season), is now shown above the team's score. When showing stats or player info, the score bug briefly moves to the bottom left of the screen then returns to its previous position. With this, all five of the NFL's broadcast partners (CBS, ESPN, Fox, NBC and NFL Network) now have score bars across the bottom of the screen, with Fox being the last of the five to make the switch. As for the graphics package itself, it is an upgraded version of the 2014 design and eventually, it has rolled out on almost all of Fox Sports' properties, including Fox's college football and basketball coverage on Fox and FS1, the 2017 MLB postseason and in February 2018, NASCAR on Fox. Following his retirement from the NFL, Tony Romo was hired by CBS Sports to serve as the lead color analyst for the network's NFL telecasts, working in the booth alongside play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz, replacing Phil Simms, who was moved to the studio for The NFL Today. While there was no controversy of Romo deciding to retire and move on to broadcasting, some critics questioned Romo being immediately hired for the number one position ahead of broadcasting veterans Dan Fouts, Trent Green, or Rich Gannon, all of whom served in the number 2‚Äì4 positions respectively for CBS, with Fouts having once been the color commentator on Monday Night Football. While some critics had speculated that Romo was handed the top position so quickly because he wore a star on his helmet, other reports cited CBS having grown tired of Simms in the role, which was a mutual feeling by Simms himself. Nonetheless, none of the ex-players and coaches in a lead position on other networks at the time of Romo's hiring (Troy Aikman, Cris Collinsworth, and Jon Gruden) started their broadcasting career in the lead position. Simms jokingly asked Romo \\"How does that seat feel?\\" during Week 1 of The NFL Today. Once the 2017 NFL season got underway, Romo received critical praise for his work as a recent ex-player, most notably for his ability to predict offensive plays and read defensive formations from the booth, and \\"adding an enthusiasm that had been lacking with Simms\\". The November 16, 2017 telecast between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tennessee Titans was the first NFL broadcast to intentionally use the Skycam as its primary camera angle, as opposed to the usual sideline camera that has been used since telecasts of NFL games began in 1939. NBC Sports had previously switched to a skycam-only presentation for portions of two Sunday night games earlier that season because of fog and smoke (and, sixteen years prior, during its coverage of the XFL); positive reaction to the impromptu change prompted NBC to experiment with using the strategy for the full game. The Skycam Angle was also used for the December 14 telecast between the Denver Broncos and the Indianapolis Colts. =2018= On January 31, 2018, the NFL announced that Fox had acquired the broadcast television rights to the Thursday Night Football package from 2018 through 2022. Fox will air eleven games per season in simulcast with NFL Network, replacing CBS and NBC. Fox will reportedly pay an average of $660 million per season for this package. NBC debuted a new graphics package specifically for Sunday Night Football during Super Bowl LII. Producer Fred Gaudelli stated that the network wanted SNF to have a more distinctive presentation to set them apart from other NBC Sports telecasts. For the 2018 season, NBC also debuted a new on-air feature known as the \\"green zone\\"; on third downs, the distance from the line of scrimmage to the first down line is digitally shaded on the field to be a darker shade of green. The feature received mixed reviews from critics and viewers, who considered it distracting and redundant to the existing yellow first down line that had historically been a standard feature of U.S. football telecasts. The Ringers Rodger Sherman considered it \\"the ultimate conclusion of graphics creep\\". Gaudelli stated that the green zone was developed for when Skycam is used as a primary camera angle, but it was decided to use the effect on all games. With TNF moving to Fox in 2018, the network announced that its top team of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman will call the games this year. The duo will be joined by Erin Andrews, who normally works with Buck and Aikman on Sundays, and Kristina Pink, who normally works with the #3 team for Fox, which consists of Kenny Albert, son of former NFL commentator Marv Albert, and Super Bowl Champion Ronde Barber, and Mike Pereira, who is one of two rule analysts for Fox. For Thursday Night Football, the yellow-and-black \\"Fox NFL\\" logo on-screen and on graphics and transitions is replaced by a blue-and-white \\"Fox NFL Network\\" logo. In some transitions, it is instead replaced by the full \\"TNF presented by Bud Light\\" logo. Fox also produces NFL Network exclusives on non-Fox/NBC Thursdays, on some Sunday mornings, and on late-season Saturdays; these games replace the \\"Fox NFL\\" logo with an NFL Network logo on a black square, the size of the \\"Fox NFL\\" logo. NBC's first telecast of the season was on September 6, 2018 featured the Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles defeating the Atlanta Falcons. For the ninth season in a row, the NFL placed a game against a World Series game, with the (New Orleans Saints at Minnesota Vikings), going up against the fifth (and final) game of the Fall Classic, between the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Boston Red Sox. This was also the first season since 2015, that Thursday Night Football was not on NBC, as it moved to fellow NFL broadcaster Fox for the next five years. Despite the loss of TNF, NBC still broadcast the Kickoff Game and the Thanksgiving prime time games (both on a Thursday night) as they fall under the current NBC contract. This marked the seventh year in the Sunday night package that a prime time Thanksgiving game was shown on NBC which featured the Atlanta Falcons against the New Orleans Saints. However, the studio team of Mike Tirico, Tony Dungy and Rodney Harrison called the game in place of Michaels and Collinsworth. Flexible scheduling rules went into effect Week 5. If a more compelling matchup arose as the season progressed, the previously scheduled Sunday Night matchup could be swapped with the more competitive game's time slot. On October 14, 2018, the NFL announced via press release, that the NFL GameDay Morning studio team of Rich Eisen, Steve Mariucci, Kurt Warner, and Michael Irvin, would be calling the Eagles-Jaguars London Game on October 28. They will be joined by Melissa Stark, who is making her first appearance as a sideline reporter since ABC's coverage of Super Bowl XXXVII, and Peter Schrager, from Fox Sports, and NFL Network's Good Morning Football. =2019= Tony Romo and Jim Nantz received further acclaim for their broadcasting of the 2019 AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots, as \\"Nantz continually set Romo up to make his predictions and analysis prior to the snap\\", and some suggested that Chiefs head coach \\"Andy Reid could have used Romo on his defensive staff, because the former quarterback knew just about every play the Patriots were going to run down the stretch\\". According to British daily newspaper The Guardian, the \\"beauty of Romo‚Äôs analysis is that it feels like he‚Äôs in on the fun with you.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/21/tom-brady-new-england- patriots-kansas-city-chiefs-super-bowl-nflhttp://www.philly.com/eagles/tony- romo-cbs-patriots-chiefs-tom-brady-nfl-playoffs-super-bowl-20190121.html Romo and Nantz called Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. CBS's coverage of Super Bowl LIII utilized a total of 115 cameras, including 8K resolution cameras (for the first time in a U.S. network sports telecast) in the end zones, as well as field-level and \\"up close\\" augmented reality graphics (with the latter generated from a wireless, handheld camera). Initial overnight Nielsen Ratings measured a 44.9 rating for the game, down 5% from the previous year and the lowest rating for a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XLIII ten years prior. 98.2 million viewers were measured, the fewest since Super Bowl XLII. Jemele Hill of The Atlantic attributed the low ratings \\"to the game being the lowest- scoring Super Bowl ever, moderate national interest in the Los Angeles Rams, the lingering bad taste from New Orleans Saints fans regarding the huge blown call in the NFC Championship Game, and Patriots fatigue\\". The 2019 schedule was released on April 17. However, on March 25, the NFL announced that, in a break from tradition, the Kickoff Game would not be hosted by the reigning Super Bowl champions and would instead feature the Chicago Bears hosting the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field on September 5, with that game airing on NBC. The New England Patriots will however, host the first Sunday Night Football game of the season against Pittsburgh Steelers during Week 1 on NBC. It will also place a World Series game against a Sunday night game for the tenth year in a row with the Green Bay Packers against the Kansas City Chiefs. Thanksgiving this year will feature a rematch of the previous season's Primetime Thanksgiving Game between the New Orleans Saints and the Atlanta Falcons. It will be the eighth time that the Thanksgiving game will be part of the Sunday Night Football package shown on NBC. Flexible scheduling rules go into effect in Week 5; the scheduled game will revert to the afternoon if a more compelling matchup arises. The scheduled Sunday Night Football matchup could be swapped with the more competitive game's time slot. The final Sunday night game of the season Sunday December 29, 2019 likewise is a flex game; the slot was left blank when the schedule came out. The game's teams (and, by extension, its location) will be announced after most Week 16 games. The games and times will be announced at a later date.

Elderhostel Institute Network / Road Scholar Lifelong Learning Institute Network By the mid-1980s about 50 lifelong learning institutes had been started.Nancy Merz Nordstrom and Jon F. Merz, Learning Later, Living Greater, Sentient Publications, Boulder, CO, 2006, p.62. Requests to older lifelong learning institutes for information and assistance in setting up new institutes had become overwhelming.Nancy Merz Nordstrom and Jon F. Merz, Learning Later, Living Greater, Sentient Publications, Boulder, CO, 2006, pp.70-72. In 1984 a regional network, the Association for Learning in Retirement of the West (ALIROW), was formed to assist. Its usefulness led representatives of the lifelong learning institutes at New School University, Harvard College, UCLA, Duke University, and American University to create a national network. To implement it they teamed with Elderhostel, an established travel corporation that serviced the same age group. The Elderhostel Institute Network opened in 1988 with the mission of supporting its member lifelong learning institutes, leading workshops, giving advice on how to start new institutes, and providing information about its member institutes, which numbered about 75 in 1988. By 1994 there were nearly 300 member institutes; by 2006 there were over 350 member institutes, and by 2019 there were over 400 member institutes.How does Road Scholar partner with lifelong learning institutes?; accessed August 1, 2019.

Osher Foundation funding The private, charitable Bernard Osher Foundation greatly increased the funding of lifelong learning institutes across the United States beginning in 2001. That year, the foundation gave an endowment grant to Senior College at the University of Southern Maine, whereupon it renamed itself the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, or OLLI.OLLI:First Grants; accessed August 1, 2019. That was the first of numerous renamings of existing lifelong learning institutes as Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes when they accepted Osher Foundation grants.OLLI:Current Program: \\"The designation of each grantee as the 'Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of X' is a condition of the Foundation's grant-making...\\"; accessed August 1, 2019. In 2002 the foundation broadened its grantmaking with initial grants of $100,000 to campuses in the California State University and University of California systems, with annual renewals possible until the endowment gift was a million dollars or more.OLLI:National Expansion; accessed August 1, 2019. Similarly-generous grants continued for years until the Osher Foundation was supporting 123 lifelong learning institutes spanning all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Meeting styles Lifelong learning institutes use two fundamentally-different meeting styles: instructor-led and peer-led. The meeting style can affect many aspects of the learning and social experience in a lifelong learning institute. Instructor-led meetings use an expert lecturer to present content to a passive group of lifelong learning institute members. That style is familiar to American students from elementary school through university. The extent to which members must prepare in advance is up to the lecturer. A lecturer may choose to take questions, but that is the only discussion that takes place in an instructor-led meeting except for informal post-meeting conversation. Instructor-led meetings can accommodate hundreds of members at once. Peer-led meetingsStudy groups and the peer learning experience at OLLI; accessed August 1, 2019.What is the purpose and philosophy of the IRP? accessed August 1, 2019. consist primarily of group discussion of content by lifelong learning institute members, who must study the content before the meeting. That meeting style is typical of graduate-level college and university seminars. The member who leads the meeting may prepare a short outline of the content, and/or discussion questions about the content, that is distributed well before the meeting. No expert is present; the discussion itself illuminates the content and can deepen members' understanding of it-- and of each other. Peer-led meetings must be small enough to allow all members to interact easily. Most of the oldest lifelong learning institutes--IRP at New School University, HILR at Harvard College, the PLATO Society of Los Angeles, and ILR at Northwestern--have peer-led meetings exclusively, while many lifelong learning institutes have instructor-led meetings with content presented by professors or knowledgeable institute members. Activities While learning is central, many lifelong learning institutes also have busy programs of activities. Those can include opportunities at the associated college or university, such as having a library or student card or attending campus lectures, classes, or events. There are also activities that are limited to institute members, such as discussion groups, social gatherings, and theater groups; group visits to museums, art exhibitions, and historic places; regional and international group travel. Administration Most lifelong learning institutes have administrative and financial ties to the college or university with which they are associated, with details that vary widely. A few lifelong learning institutes have total administrative and financial independence.OLLI at AU website:OLLI History; accessed August 1, 2019.The PLATO Society of Los Angeles website:How long has The PLATO Society been around?; accessed August 1, 2019.

Career  Charles Faroux was the son of a sheep trader and spent much time traveling until he was 28 years old. He visited the United States and spent several months in Alaska. There he came in touch with journalism for the first time and on his return to France in 1900, he began working as a journalist for the automobile magazine l'Auto. A trained mechanical engineer, he became interested in automotive engineering and motorsport and was also active as a racing driver. In 1908, he participated in the Coppa Florio, where he broke down with a defect in his Motobloc model. During World War I, Faroux served in the French army and fought at the Battle for Verdun. He saw the end of the war as a technician for Hispano-Suiza, where he was responsible for the supply of aircraft engines. = Motorsport = Faroux became internationally known through the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which he established in 1923 together with Georges Durand and Emile Coquille. Durand and Faroux developed the first set of technical regulations. For more than three decades, the race director was often the last and many times the sole authority when it came to deciding which team to race. Between 1929 and 1955, Faroux was also a starter at the Grand Prix of Monaco. =Carom billiards= Faroux was one of the best carom billiards players in the 1900-1920s. In 1905, he competed in his first world carom billiards championships, and at the 1907 event reached second place, which he accomplished again in 1910. In 1912 and 1919, he won the world championship title in this discipline. Since his motorsport interest often overlapped with the carom billiards interest, producing scheduling conflicts, he said in April 1926 that he would play in the world championships rather than the Targa Florio. In 1927, he competed in his last world championship, winning that event, and afterwards devoted all of his time to motorsport. Personal life In 1953, Faroux became a Knight of the Legion of Honour. Faroux died in February 1957 in Neuilly-sur-Seine.

The film is directed by Lekhraj Bhakri and its music is given by Hemant Kumar. Plot Although the film was released in 1959, its story is set in the early 1950s before the introduction of The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 which opposes polygamy. Mr. Kapoor (Balraj Sahni), a rich and successful man, is happily married to his wife Kamla (Pandari Bai). The only grief in their lives is the absence of a legal heir as Kamla is unable to conceive. Vimla (Meena Kumari) is happy-go- lucky chirpy woman who's in love with Gokul (Manoj Kumar) but due to his scheming father who also works as a Munshi (accountant) (Sajjan) at the Kapoors', she is married to Mr. Kapoor in lieu of money. The Kapoors find Vimla as their only option to bear a child while Vimla blames her father (M. Kumar) for her fate, unknown to the fact that it was actually the Munshi who did it. Vimla soon realises that it is only the child which matters for the Kapoors and soon leave their house. Back at home, Vimla, now in depression, pledges to get back her child via legal route but she again loses to the Kapoors and is sent to a mental asylum. On the other hand, the Kapoors are also worried about Vimla's condition as they personally don't have any problems with her. In the climax of the film, Vimla flees from the asylum in order to end her life but at the nick of the moment is saved by the Kapoors'. The film ends on a happy note when Vimla realises their true intentions and the three of them live happily ever after.

These mountains rise to the west of Auronzo di Cadore, north-east of Cortina d'Ampezzo and south of Dobbiaco, in a position overlooking Lake Misurina. They are part of the Dolomites subsection of Sesto, of Braies, and of Ampezzo, and belong to the municipality of Auronzo di Cadore. The highest peak is the Cima Cadin of San Lucano (2.839 m a.s.l.). The term Cadini derives from the Cadorino dialect ciad√¨n which translates into valleys, and refers to the labyrinthian structure of the massif.  Description  The mountain range is crossed by the Alta Via n. 4 path and from the equipped Alberto Bonacossa path, which starts from the southern shore of the lake and reaches the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. The particular geomorphology that distinguishes and so deeply characterizes the Cadini di Misurina, however, allows to cross the group by various lines so that, going up and down from their forks, it becomes possible to enjoy the dolomitic paradise that surrounds them. The equipped path Giovanni Durissini allows for example to complete the complete tour of the branch of San Lucano. It is a ring route, starting at the Fonda-Savio refuge (2,367 m), which runs in sequence the Torre fork (2,400 m), the Sabbee fork (2,440 m), the Cadin Deserto fork (2,400 m), the Cristina fork, the de la Neve fork (2,471 m) and lastly the Nevaio fork (2,620 m), with a total height difference of about 1,000 m. The first climb dates back to 31 August 1896 by Giovanni Siorpaes, Pietro Siorpaes, Ilona E√∂tv√∂s, Rolanda E√∂tv√∂s, Johann Innerkofler, and Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s.

Biography He was born in Paris. In 1816, he became a student of Horace Vernet. After 1820, he was employed in the workshop of Antoine-Jean Gros. He also took Th√©odore G√©ricault as a mentor. From 1827 to 1828, under the auspices of Vernet, he became the ship's painter on the frigate La Victorieuse and sailed throughout the Mediterranean, visiting Corsica, Malta, the Greek islands, Istanbul, the coast of Syria and Egypt. Later, from 1837 to 1838, he participated in an expedition that visited Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. While there, he dressed as a native, travelled with caravans, lived in a tent and studied Arabic.Biographical notes @ the Louvre website He also kept a detailed travel diary that is now in the collection of the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France. The sketches he made provided a source for paintings that lasted the rest of his life. His first exhibition at the Salon came in 1835 and he would continue to exhibit there on a regular basis until 1881. For many years, he was a teacher at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. The Louvre is in possession of 917 of his original drawings; donated by one of his nephews. All of his sketches and paintings are characterized by precise ethnographic detail and devoid of any romanticized or idealized representations. Montfort died in Paris in 1884.

She is best known for her researches on Russian literature by women, the introduction of gender analysis and feminist perspectives into Slavic studies, and for her translation of Karolina Pavlova's novel A Double Life. Early life Barbara Sue Heldt was born on 2 February 1940 at the Sydenham hospital in New York City. Her mother, Margery Sloss, was a New Yorker, while her father Dr John H. Heldt, was from Berlin, Germany. Her brother, John, was born in 1942. She attended the Woodmere Academy, then took her undergraduate degree at Wellesley College, where she was a Durant scholar. She studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. She then returned to New York to study for a M.A. degree at Columbia University. Heldt married E. William Monter on 19 June 1963 at Woodmere, Long Island. They had two children: Gustav and Elizabeth. Having obtained a Ford Foundation Fellowship, she went to the University of Chicago to work towards a doctoral degree in Slavic languages. She has been married to Gerald Stanton Smith since 1982. Career In 1961, between her graduation and starting the master's programme at Columbia, Heldt worked for the US Information Agency in the USSR. She next guided French pharmacists around the US. The money from this work funded the first year of her M.A. In 1966‚Äì67, Heldt studied in Moscow under the Fulbright Program. The next year, her doctoral degree was awarded by the University of Chicago and she was hired as an assistant professor in her department, teaching Russian language and literature. In 1976, she joined the University of British Columbia. In 1988, the Association for Women in Slavic Studies, formed the previous year, established a series of prizes, one of which, funded by the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies was named the Heldt Prize in her honour. Heldt became Professor Emerita at the University of British Columbia in 1996. =Research= Heldt translated Karolina Pavlova's novel A Double Life in 1978. Pavlova, a nineteenth century Russian poet, had been celebrated in her youth but disdained and disregarded later on, and fell out of the canon in Soviet times. Heldt's translation brought new audiences to Pavlova's work, while the feminist perspective she brought into Pavlova's life and times attracted further study by feminist researchers. Heldt's book Terrible Perfection: Women and Russian Literature (1987) is considered the first view of Russian literary history through feminist theory. Heldt argued that Western feminist critiques of European literature attempted to raise the feminine from conventional attitudes of inferiority, while in Russia, the feminine was held to an impossible perfect standard that terrified men who could not match it in masculine action and suppressed women who couldn't live up to it. Her analysis revealed that Tolstoy was perhaps the only Russian author who achieved a sort of feminist comprehension of women. Meanwhile, Russian women entered the literary sphere in fewer numbers than their western European counterparts and did so mainly in the genres of poetry and memoirs.

The church is home to several religious relics and icons, including the culturally important Our Lady of Vladimir. First mentioned in 1625 when it was a wooden church, it has since been reconstructed and restored several times. The church was ultimately closed in 1929 and became a neglected art storage house. Liturgical services were resumed after a unique arrangement between the Patriarchate and gallery were agreed to in 1993.  Background  = Affiliations = As a house church, the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi is affiliated with both the State Tretyakov Gallery and the Moscow Patriarchate. The modern church acts as both a parish for the gallery's employees and as a museum open to the public; while active services are still held in the church, visitors can only enter the church through the Tretyakov Gallery, and religious artifacts are preserved in special climate-controlled environments. Within the Russian Orthodox Church, the church is under and the Urban Diocese of Moscow. = Name = The church's name derives from the Old Tolmachi settlement of Tatar translators located in what is now in Moscow. These translators originally had migrated to the area in order to serve the Golden Horde during the time of the Tatar Yoke.  History  A photo of the church taken in 1883 = Beginnings = The initial version of the church was wooden, and it is in this state that the first mention of the church is made in a 1625 parish book. In March 1687, Patriarch Joachim visited the church for mass which generally indicated the parish had nobles and highly regarded individuals as members. In 1697, a parishioner of the Resurrection Church in Kadashi, Longin Dobrynin, built the five-domed stone church in place of the wooden one. On the effort of Ekaterina Lazarevna Demidova, the Pokrovsky chapel was erected in 1770. Demidova was a widow, and she had sought to consecrate a chapel in the name of the Virgin Mary despite the ban on consecrating altars in her name. At the time, the Russian Orthodox Church preferred those honoring Mary to dedicate to one of her feast days. Demidova chose to dedicate to the Feast of the Intercession instead, and the chapel was dedicated the same year it was built. However, in commemoration of her initial desire for the temple to honor Mary; \\"Satisfy My Sorrows\\", which was the icon Demidova had originally wanted for the chapel, was later installed. = Misfortune and eventual closure = It was around this time that the church's parish was hit with tragedy twice over. Firstly, during the time of the chapel's construction, the 1770‚Äì1772 Russian plague had caused much destruction in its wake. Secondly, during the French invasion of Russia much of the surrounding buildings were destroyed in a fire as Moscow was razed. Though the Church of St. Nicholas itself survived in principle, this was not without cost. The priest at the time, John Andreev, was killed by the invading French forces while trying to protect it. With the permission of metropolitan bishop Philaret of Moscow, a new bell tower was added in 1834 along with a reconstructed refectory. In the prior year, the old bell tower had proven to be deficient after more than 150 years of use, so Philaret approved the request by the parish to install the new one as well as begin general reconstruction on the main building so long as the main church remain \\"in an ancient dispensation\\". For this task, the services of the premier architect F. M. Shestakov, who helped to build the Greater Church of the Ascension, were successfully sought. When the new bell tower and refectory were completed, Philaret delivered a sermon to consecrate the Church of St. Nicholas. Though they would not last, the walls at this time were lined with artificial marble, but due to persistent staining they had to be covered up with wall paintings. The general reconstruction of the church would last more than 20 years until October 1858. Several years after the Russian Revolution, the church was in a poor state of affairs under the Soviet rule. Following the death of the former rector of the church, Elder Alexy Zosimovsky, the church closed down in the Easter of 1929. It was soon transferred to the Tretyakov Gallery which used the church as a storehouse and let it come under disrepair. The top of the bell tower became broken, and bells separated into pieces. By the time the gallery began major restoration work on the church in 1983, the temple had remained empty for over 50 years. Yet by the turn of the decade, the bell tower was able to be fully restored. = Reopening = It was not until 1993 that the temple was reopened for worship after an arrangement was made between the Russian Orthodox Church and the state gallery. In September 1996, the church's restored main altar was sanctified by the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus' Alexy II. A year later, restorations for the building were completed, and it became an active house church almost exactly 300 years after it was first constituted in stone. Security improvements to store and display art were added during this process, and an underground passageway was additionally made to connect it to the State Tretyakov Gallery.  Recent usage  Archpriest Nikolai Sokolov In 2009, the icon \\"Iverskaya\\" was transferred to the church from the gallery. It had been previously located within the Iverskaya Chapel before it was destroyed in 1929. The Trinity is stored in the church as well during the Feast for Holy Trinity. On 12 December 2012, the Tretyakov Gallery elected to transfer the relics of more than 30 saints to the church. The church is most famously home to the Russian icon known as Our Lady of Vladimir. The icon is generally considered to be one of the most cherished symbols in Russian history. , Archpriest Nikolai Sokolov is the rector for the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi.

She has been serving as President of the Institut des Finances Basil Fuleihan since 2000. In 2018, the United Nations Committee of Experts on Public Administration selected Lamia Moubayed Bissat among the 24 experts to guide members of CEPA on the agenda of 2030.  Early life and education  Lamia Moubayed Bissat was born on March 27, 1967 in Beirut, Lebanon. Most of Moubayed's childhood was marked by the Lebanese Civil War, which she considers as one of the factors that shaped her professional life. Moubayed became co- founder and volunteer of Green line in 1991, the first non-governmental organization (NGO) in Lebanon addressing environmental and agricultural development. Lamia Moubayed Bissat graduated with an engineering degree in agriculture in 1988 and received her master's degree in Agricultural Economics and Development from the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 1990. Eight years later, she joined l'Ecole Sup√©rieure des Affaires in Beirut to pursue a master's in business administration (MBA).  Career  In 1992, Moubayed began her career by joining as a researcher, the Consultation and Research Institute in Lebanon (CRI), a firm specialized in business consultation and quantitative and qualitative field studies regarding social and economic development in Lebanon and the MENA region. In 1995, Lamia Moubayed joined the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Beirut as a program officer. In July 1999, Lamia Moubayed joined the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA) under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 2000, the French Ministry of Economy and Finance selected and appointed Lamia Moubayed Bissat to become head and director of the Institut des Finances Basil Fuleihan in Lebanon. Moubayed led its transition from a bilateral initiative to a financially and administratively autonomous public service agency within the Lebanese ministry of finance. The institute is today a provider of knowledge in public financial management and state modernization in Lebanon and the MENA region. Lamia Moubayed lectures public management at the Institute of Political Sciences of Universit√© Saint Joseph in Beirut (Sciences-Po).

Today, civil society organizations and the private sector are equally accountable and involved in the process\\". Moubayed is a strong proponent of gender equality and strives for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. In an interview with Executive Magazine, she explained that \\"it is important to understand that feminism coupled with empowering women does not come at the expense of men.

He was one of the leading critics of the 1890s.  Life  M√°dl graduated from secondary school in Prague and lived in Vienna from 1880-83, where he attended art history lectures and seminars by Professor R. Eitelberger von Edelberg and M. Thausing at the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna and Albertina. However, there is no evidence that he was a full-time enrolled student. In Vienna, he probably also met the founders of the Viennese School of Art History, Franz Wickhoff, and the first headmaster of the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design, Franti≈°ka Schmoranze. In 1883 and 1884, M√°dl visited Munich and Paris and then from 1884 he stayed in Vienna. From 1886, he collaborated with the newly founded Ruch Gallery and from 1888 he was an associate editor of Otto's encyclopedia. He took numerous trips abroad to study. M√°dl passionately believed in the need for an art school in Prague, and he became an associate professor of textile art and the secretary of the school when it was established in 1886. M√°dl then became the successor to Otakar Hostinsky, the lecturer on history of art, and was appointed full professor and administrator of the library. During World War I, M√°dl paused his work for the art school. In 1917, he was appointed vice-chairman of the Modern Art Gallery in Prague and was a member of the commission for the return of Bohemian scholars from abroad. He was also a member of various arts societies. M√°dl died of diabetes on 20 November 1932, at the age of 73.  Work  M√°dl's approach to art history marked a move away from the previous generations'. It incorporated formal analysis, archaeology, and emphasised precise determination of a work's author and time and place of origin. M√°dl's influence shaped new artistic commissions, such as the Jan Hus Memorial created by Ladislav ≈†aloun. M√°dl resented German cultural dominance. He advocated engagement with the 'progressive currents of French art' and 'bemoaned the German appropriation of Prague.' M√°dl was a notable critic and contributor to many magazines and publications. From 1887, he published regularly in Archaeological Monuments. He began publishing an Overview of Art History from Antiquity to the Present, which was unfinished at the time of his death.

Once independent relations for each force acting on a particle are available, they can be substituted into Newton's second law to obtain an ordinary differential equation, which is called the equation of motion. Classical mechanics for particles finds its generalization in continuum mechanics. =Electrodynamics= Maxwell's equations are a set of partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electrodynamics, classical optics, and electric circuits. These fields in turn underlie modern electrical and communications technologies. Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents. They are named after the Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell, who published an early form of those equations between 1861 and 1862. =General relativity= The Einstein field equations (EFE; also known as \\"Einstein's equations\\") are a set of ten partial differential equations in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity which describe the fundamental interaction of gravitation as a result of spacetime being curved by matter and energy.

The company was founded as Binns & Mason in 1866 by skilled cutlers from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, as a small enterprise making pocketknives in Rochester, Pennsylvania, then it briefly became The Pittsburgh Cutlery Company. It was purchased in 1867 by the Harmony Society, brought to Beaver Falls, and developed for mass production, to employ 300 people and to cover a two-acre site. In 1872 it suffered a labor dispute which was resolved by the employment of up to 225 Chinese workers. In 1876 it produced the \\"largest knife and fork in the world,\\" of its time, for display at the Centennial Exposition. The company closed in 1886. Foundation Beaver Falls Cutlery Works, 1867 The company was founded in 1866 as Binns & Mason, by Edward Binns and Samuel Mason, for the manufacture of pocket knives in nearby Rochester. Mason, inventor of an improved tang for iron-handled knives, patent 89059, was originally from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, a steel town. Mason brought steel workers from his home town of Sheffield to start up the company. The Beaver Falls Courier (1875‚Äì1879) confirmed that in 1866 Binns and Mason established the company, whose capital, it said, was then a million dollars. It continued: \\"A few years ago the spot which is now occupied by the town was a barren and desolated tract of land. The upper part was a forest, within whose rocky barriers scarcely a house was seen.\\" Of the company's symbol at the factory it said: > \\"The trade mark of the company is one of the finest pieces of carving in > wood we have seen, yet it is only typical of the trades of the Company. > There is represented the American eagle flapping its wings in triumph over > the British lion, and the latter is struggling in the last agonies of death. > So the English manufacturers of cutlery have been supplanted in their trade > by American establishments ... Then in addition to the trade in Europe the > trade in this country is very great. The works are continually pressed for > orders.\\" =Samuel Mason= Samuel Mason, one of the founders of the company, was born in Sheffield, West Yorkshire, England, around 1812. His wife was Jane Mason (b.ca.1820), and they had two sons born in England. The second son was Henry (b.ca.1842).United States Census 5 July 1870. New Brighton ward 2, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, dwelling 205. On 30 March 1844 Mason left for America with his family, arriving in New York \\"pennyless (sic) and friendless\\" after a journey of 105 days. He remained in America for 31 years, becoming an American citizen in 1860, and returning to Sheffield in 1875. His first American employment in 1844 was with William Wild who had previously manufactured cutlery in Sheffield. In November of that year he obtained work with a cutlery manufacturer in Connecticut. He does not say where he was working between 1844 and 1866, but his highly-detailed description of the mass production at Lamson and Goodnow's Cutlery works at Shelburne Falls, founded by Lamson in 1844, implies personal experience of the place. Mason and his wife had two more sons in Massachusetts: William (b.ca.1844) and Joseph (b.ca.1846), so it is possible that Mason was recruited to Lamson and Goodnow when the company was founded. Mason was director of Binns & Mason for three years between 1866 and 1869. When he and Binns started the company, recruitment of skilled workers from their home town of Sheffield was facilitated by the Sheffield Outrages. That was the term for the strife between cutlers and management due to cramped and dangerous conditions. It also described the murder of some non-union workers in 1854 from which worker unrest escalated into the blowing up of houses with gunpowder in 1866. Following Harmony's takeover, Mason continued at Beaver Falls Cutlery Company as superintendent of cutlery. In 1870, his three younger sons Henry, William and Joseph were also working at the plant as foreman, machinist and worker respectively. In that year his personal estate was valued at $5,000. Mason was against slavery, and said on the subject: \\"I gave my first son, who for four years combated the enemy on the battlefield. I am not sorry for the act.\\" In 1875 he returned to Sheffield where he lived at 120 Westbar, and by 1876 was regularly writing letters to English newspapers on the subject of cutlery manufacture in America, and on the virtues of trade protectionism by America. In 1875 Mason became a boot and shoe dealer, running the American Shoe Store at 120 Westbar, Sheffield. On 11 June 1879 he filed a petition for bankruptcy, having liabilities of ¬£800. His date of death is unknown, however there was a meeting of his creditors on 1 July 1879, declaring his debts of ¬£537 14s 6d, and assets of ¬£91 11s. Growth By 13 October 1866, Binns & Mason was a chartered company. It lacked capital and needed investors from Pittsburgh, so it consequently became the Pittsburgh Cutlery Company. The investment was insufficient, so the Pittsburgh Cutlery Company was merged with the Harmony Society's new firm, which was based at Ambridge. The Harmony Society had already bought the town of Beaver Falls in 1849. At this point, Henry Reeves became president while Samuel Mason was still director, and John Reeves was secretary and treasurer. In April 1867 the knife-making business was moved to a two-acre site at Beaver Falls, PA, in \\"the lower end of town, near the river,\\" where 300 people were eventually employed (following another recruitment drive in Sheffield, England) making it one of the largest companies of its day. It was later called the \\"cutlery property,\\" because Harmony expanded it to make table cutlery besides other knives. The factory complex was founded in 1868 between Second Street and Third Street, off Seventh Avenue. By early 1868 the firm's name was Beaver Falls Cutlery Company. The organisers of the 1867 expansion were Pittsburgh men: Dr C.G. Hussey, General Thomas M. Howe and James W. Brown. This is based on The majority of shares were purchased by the Harmony Society, and it became a joint-stock company with a capital stock of $400,000 in 1870, under the leadership of John Reeves. The Harmony Society had been successful manufacturers, but their numbers had declined, and they were becoming business investors instead. \\"At its peak (the works) employed 300 workers who turned out 1200 dozen finished products per day.\\" In 1876, Samuel Mason described the company: \\"The ... Company when in full blast run three turbine water wheels of 82-horse power each, and one engine 125-horse power, so you may calculate the amount of cutlery turned out by this firm.\\" He mentions that America was making steel cutlery while Sheffield was still using iron. Labor dispute, 1872 Chinese cutlery worker, 1870s Madam Chow, 1870s In 1872 the company was stable and Harmony was making a profit. At this point the largely English skilled workforce took the opportunity to initiate a labor dispute and strike for higher wages. The director John Reeves refused the demand. Instead he closed the factory, then he gave a five-year contract to 225 Chinese workers gradually brought in from California and New Orleans. With them was Madam Chow, the wife of Chow Hung and the only Chinese woman at Beaver Falls at that time. The Beaver County Times has suggested that it was she who brought the antique manuscript of Dream of the Red Chamber which was discovered at Beaver Falls in 2019. Reeves brought in the Chinese with some difficulty, travelling for fifteen days to San Francisco to find only reluctant travellers, then riding the new railroad to New Orleans to gratefully collect his first seventy Chinese men who had been working on the railway. Another thirty men followed them to Beaver Falls the following week. A further influence in this matter was the Methodist minister Reverend Dyer, a missionary who knew that the Chinese worked hard and did not drink. It was not an easy transition though. The Chinese were met off the train by an angry mob of workers, and saloon keepers who had discovered that the Chinese did not drink. The local policeman, assisted by John Reeves and Judge Henry Hice, had to keep order for some weeks. The Chinese workers resided in The Old Mansion House, built in 1875 with a cookhouse, dining room and sleeping quarters, at the corner of Third Street and Seventh Avenue. The contract for the Chinese workers was with San Francisco merchant Ah Chuck, who had the responsibility of returning their bodies to China should they die in American employ. The contract provided for rice, sleeping quarters and a gold dollar a day for each man. Ah Chuck also provided an interpreter, Lee Ten Pay. At first there was a settlement with the company workers, following a delegation from the Beaver Falls community. Management agreed as follows: \\"All cutlery workers were paid each month with the privilege of leaving if dissatisfied, and if they would leave the Chinamen alone and permit them to remain, the strikers would be reinstated with pay and all profits from the cutlery would be used for the community for seven years.\\" The Chinese were satisfactory workers; their appearance attracted tourists who in turn brought good custom to the factory. College Hill, formerly the Chinese cemetery However the Chinese had been brought in to reduce theft and to reduce the payroll. The payroll dropped from $13,000 to $5,000 per month. Beaver Falls residents resented the Chinese, pushing them from the wooden walkways onto the muddy streets. Some Chinese workers died after such attacks, and were buried at the far end of town in a specially dedicated cemetery, near Twenty-Eighth Street and Fifth Avenue on College Hill. Their bones were then \\"removed and carried away in sacks.\\" Although rumour had it that a mysterious benefactor paid for the removal of the bodies, which were exhumed and returned to China for traditional burial rites, another story suggests that a developer wanted to build homes on the land. Over the years, half of the Chinese left the company, and in 1877 the other half left, their fare to San Francisco being paid by the company, as per their contract. Local residents returned to work at the plant. The background to the use of Chinese labor was the immigration of 60,000 Chinese to the Pacific Coast and Rockies between the California Gold Rush and 1869. With the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, the Chinese began to move east, and potential employment at Beaver Falls made it one of their first eastern destinations. The local controversy following the strike at the cutlery company took the notice of Pennsylvania General Assembly and Congress, in the context of the contemporary Chinese question debate about immigration. \\"In some measure it contributed to the eventual passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act\\" of 1882. Decline Former Cutlery Company site, now redeveloped, 2019 The company gradually declined from 1877 to 1886 when it could no longer make a profit and was closed. In 1890 the Champlin family purchased the knife- making equipment to start up their Cattaraugus Cutlery Company in Little Valley, New York. The Beaver Falls Cutlery Company buildings were subsequently occupied by the Metric Metal Works, The Eclipse Bicycle Company, The McCool Tube Company, the New York Pittsburgh Company, The Shelby Steel Tube Company and the Beaver Falls Car Works. Products =Tableware and various knives= The company produced \\"all kinds of knives and tableware ... These products ranged from finely crafted bone-handled knives to an austere, but sturdy wood-handled utensil. The former displayed a delicately etched logo \\"Beaver Falls Cutlery Company in a scroll with flowered ornamentation on the blade while the latter had a plain 27 mm stamp Beaver Falls Cut. Co.\\" The 26-page BFCC catalogue of the 1880s lists table knives, carvers, ivory carvers, screwdrivers, cigar knives, butchers' knives, stickers, skinner knives, hunting knives, scissors and shears. It lists many penknives: iron- lined, with redwood, brass-lined, and with German silver bolsters. It has a lithograph of the factory and of the American eagle trademark. Beaver Falls Historical Museum has a set of BFCC table knives with carved ivory handles and metal inlays, dating from the 1870s to 1880s. Another set also has ivory- handled knives, but includes three-tined forks. The knife blades carry a trademark showing the American eagle overcoming the British lion. The company also produced pearl-handled and wooden-handled tableware, and exhibited a pocketknife with 365 blades at the Centennial Exposition. Regarding quality, Samuel Mason said this: > \\"The forks are made from good quality of sheet steel, and hardened in oil > with a spring temper, and beautifully finished; the prongs of the forks are > well glazed inside and arched at the top; the fitting of the handle and > bolster is flush and true, no plus 1-16th of an inch out of the handle; the > blade of the knife is equally well ground and finished; every blade tested > by being bent to a half circle; the prongs of the forks are twisted in like > manner.\\" =Largest knife and fork= In 1875, the largest-known carving knife and fork were those made by Joseph Rodgers & Son of 6 Norfolk Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The set was made in celebration of the visit to Sheffield on 17 August of that year by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. It was \\"A huge pair of carvers about six feet in length, the handles of which are of polished ivory.\\" \\"Largest knife and fork in the world\\" in 1876 As a competitive response in 1876, Beaver Falls Cutlery Company made the \\"largest knife and fork in the world\\" of its time, at the cost of $1,500. It was designed as a table carving knife and fork. The knife measured nine feet seven inches, the blade being ten inches wide. At eight times the size of a normal knife and fork, it was larger than the Sheffield carvers. The knife handle was created from an elephant tusk, carved with flowers and vines. The Chinese employees and the regular workmen made this with steel forged at Beaver Falls, and it was exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition of Philadelphia in 1876. The etched design on the front of the BFCC carving knife blade included a silver-plated shark, a portrait of William Penn, the company name, the Pennsylvania coat of arms in complex detail and a portrait of Governor John F. Hartranft. On the reverse of the blade was scrollwork, and a picture of a mother with children. The carving fork had a patent spring guard which was etched with vines and clusters of grapes. The etching was by T.C. Moore, and the carving of the ivory handles was by Edwin Clayton. As of 2019, the whereabouts of the Beaver Falls knife and fork set is unknown, although a search was made by a retired Beaver Falls teacher, Sidney Kane, in 1975. Cattaraugus Cutlery Company purchased it along with the company machinery in 1887 following the closure. The set was removed to Springville, New York, then returned to Little Valley, New York. Philip Champlin, great grandson of John Brown Francis Champlin of Cattaraugus Cutlery Company, inherited it after his family's firm closed in 1963. He mailed it in a specially-made wooden crate to Wisconsin around February 1972, and nothing has been heard of it since. =Merchant counter stamps= Two examples of merchant counter stamps on coins have been found. The stamps are 27mm long, and read Beaver Falls Cut. Co. One is on a half dollar dated 1875. Museum exhibits A small display of early tableware, razors and pocket knives made by the company is kept at the Beaver County Industrial Museum at Darlington, Pennsylvania, which also has library resources. The Beaver Falls Historical Society Museum, in the city's Carnegie library, houses a larger collection of artefacts associated with the Company.

It presents the annual South Australian Music Awards (also known as SA Music Awards and SAM Awards), puts on the two-week celebration of live music, Umbrella: Winter City Sounds, and organises a number of other musical events throughout the year. History AusMusicSA was established on 23 July 1997 as the South Australian Contemporary Music Development Company, trading as AusMusic SA. In 2004, Music SA Online was established, and in 2005 the organisation started the Contemporary Music Program in 29 secondary schools. From 2007 to 2010, it ran the Louder Than Words Festival in regional SA, and from 2008 to 2012 the Coopers Alive Festival. It also managed the Fuse Festival. In 2010, Music SA became a Registered Training Organisation, and in the same year Ausmusic SA was re- branded as Music SA. The organisation engaged in several collaborations with other partners, such as Flinders University, the Australian Independent Record Labels Association (AIR) Awards, and local radio stations, and has also published several guides relevant to the contemporary music industry. In 2015 Lisa Bishop (who is also deputy chair of Adelaide Fringe and a film producer), became CEO/general manager of Music SA, and still holds the position. In 2015 Music SA took over responsibility for the Fowlers Live Music Awards, renamed the South Australian Music Awards (or SA Music Awards). Umbrella: Winter City Sounds, a two-week live music festival, was launched in 2016, which in 2017 put on 300 events, funded by the Australia Council and the SA Tourism Commission and is an annual event. In 2017 Music SA launched the Girls To The Front music education program for teenage girls. Music SA's focus has broadened since its inception, from an organisation with a focus on music courses in schools to a nationally recognised industry body which \\"educates,...advocates, promotes, mentors, supports and markets artists and industry personnel and focusses on building a thriving contemporary music community in SA\\". =Location= From sometime before 2007 until 2015, Music SA was located on Level 1 of the Lion Arts Centre, with the address given as \\"Fowlers Building\\" for some of that time. From 2015 and it is situated in St Paul's Creative Centre in Pulteney Street. Activities Music SA's activities are aimed at benefiting the music industry in South Australia. To that end, it manages an informative SA music website; runs contemporary music workshops and training programs in schools; provides professional development services for artists and practitioners; runs music business events and seminars; provides opportunities for live performances; runs an accredited music business training program; runs Vocational Education Training (VET) programs for secondary schools; and since 2015 has been responsible for the SA Music Awards. In collaboration with the Live Music Office, it creates the Live Music Census, which analyses the music supply chain in South Australia, including song-writing, retail, manufacturing, recording studios, dedicated music media, education, and live music gigs and festivals. In addition to these, it puts on a number of events and programs: Umbrella: Winter City Sounds, a two-week festival; Adelaide Sounds, a live music series performed at Adelaide Airport every Friday afternoon and alternate Saturdays and Sundays since 2013; Bands On Track, a competition in which the winners get to play as support acts at the Superloop Adelaide 500 after-race concerts, and Clip It! music video competition. Umbrella: Winter City Sounds 2019 featured hundreds of acts in small venues across greater Adelaide. In July 2017, Music SA created an event known as Scouted, an event run as part of Umbrella: Winter City Sounds and in conjunction with Australian Independent Record Labels Association (AIR), with the aim of giving a platform to some of South Australia's most prominent unsigned musical talents, spread across venues in Adelaide's East End. The first event featured electronic duo Electric Fields, Young Offenders, Bec Stevens, Alana Jagt, Timberwolf, Heaps Good Friends and others. The event helped to boost the participants' careers, and the 2018 event was held at around the same time as the AIR Awards and Indie-Con. In the summer of 2018, Music SA and the City of Adelaide presented a series six of lunchtime and early evening concerts, called Rock The Square to showcase up- and-coming music talent in Adelaide. Lunchtime and evening concerts in Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga featured newcomers Kashaguava, Camp Coyote, Naomi Keyte, Cowboys of Love, hot mess, Madura Green, Alana Jagt and Corey Theatre Music.

Zephyr Quartet won the UNESCO International Collaboration Award and Tam Boakes was awarded the Music SA Lifetime Achievement Award for her contribution to Adelaide's live music scene and venue, Jive. =2019= There were a few changes in 2019. The APRA/AMCOS Emily Burrows Award, instituted in 2001 in memory of Emily Burrows, a former APRA AMCOS membership representative and compliance officer and awarded to a South Australian artist or band, was included in the ceremony. The \\"World Music\\" category was replaced with \\"Soul/Funk/RnB\\", and the \\"Best Engineer\\" category was split into \\"Best Live Engineer\\" and \\"Best Studio Engineer\\".

In November 2018, after Minister for Industry and Skills David Pisoni had attended the 2018 SA Music Awards, the Government announced more than in funding to support the growth of live music in South Australia. Pisoni praised Music SA for its work in raising the profile of the awards and the local music industry. =Funding for Indigenous musicians= In January 2019, Music SA announced the establishment of a new scholarship and internship plan for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander musicians, made possible by the support of an anonymous donor, whose contribution was matched by Music SA. In April 2019, just before the election, the federal government announced its Australian Music Industry Package, which included million to provide small businesses with grants, capped at and spread over four years, to fund artist programming and improving infrastructure for live performances. With this package came a commitment to establishing a national development program to help Indigenous musicians and groups tour and record, with the program and funding to be administered by Music SA.

Morphology Species of Allopseudaxine are ectoparasites that attach themselves as larvae to the gills of fish, and grow into their adult stage. This larval stage is called oncomiracidium, and is characterized by free swimming and cilia. The name Allopseudaxine is composed of the prefix Allo meaning different, and a root Pseudaxine, a gastrocotylid monogenean. Thus the name Allopseudaxine means \\"different from Pseudaxine\\". In fact, species of Allopseudaxine have a large body tapering anteriorly, and a unilateral, oblique haptor (a single oblique row of clamps), giving them a triangular appearance. With this shape, they superficially resemble gastrocotylid monogeneans like members of Pseudaxine or Allogastrocotyle. However, species of Allopseudaxine can be distinguished from these Gastrocotylidae by their clamp structure and also the arrangement of testes: in Allopseudaxine testes are para-ovarian and post-ovarian, whereas in gastrocotylids testes are only post-ovarian.

Forbes was born at Malvern Link in January 1858. He attended Eton College, where he developed a reputation as a good schoolboy cricketer, playing alongside the likes of Alfred and Edward Lyttelton, Ivo Bligh and A. J. Webbe. Unlike his contemporaries, he played little first-class cricket after leaving Eton. His first-class debut came for the Gentlemen of England against Cambridge University at Fenner's in 1877. He played two first-class matches during the 1878 Scarborough Festival, playing for I Zingari against Yorkshire and for the Gentlemen of England against the touring Australians. His association with the Scarborough Festival continued for several years, with Forbes making two appearances in 1879 (including playing for the Gentlemen of the North against the Gentlemen of the South) and one appearance each in 1881 and 1882. He made three first-class appearances in 1883, playing once for the Gentlemen of England and appearing twice for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixtures at The Oval and Lord's. His final first-class appearance came in the 1884 Scarborough Festival for I Zingari against the touring Australians. Across eleven first-class matches, Forbes scored 382 runs at an average of 21.22 and a high score of 80. With his right-arm roundarm fast bowling, he took 31 wickets at a bowling average of 21.90, with best figures of 6 for 32. These figures, one of two five wicket hauls he took, came for I Zingari against the Australians in 1882. Outside of cricket, he worked as steward for the Dukes of Richmond at Goodwood. He died at Marylebone in March 1933. His father-in-law, Beilby Lawley, also played first-class cricket.

In 1981, the site was recognized as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government. Background Kaneyama Castle is located next to the Kiso River in former Mino Province, at the northeastern end of the N≈çbi Plain near the center of modern Gifu Prefecture. The castle commanded a fork in the road connecting the Nakasend≈ç highway with the Masuda kaid≈ç, a road connecting Mino and Hida Provinces. The site is approximately a 60 minute walk from Akechi Station on the Meitetsu Hiromi Line railway. Kaneyama Castle was a mountain- top fortification with a roughly square inner bailey approximately 50 meters square, with a wide entrance to the east. A donjon or watchtower existed near this entrances, connected to a barracks. Secondary and tertiary enclosures were to the west of the inner bailey, using the natural slope of the mountain and masugata box-gates, and stone walls for defense. To the east of the inner bailey was a large flat area, which may have been used for storage or for drilling troops. Past this area was a long, narrow secondary redoubt. In total, the castle extended for 300 meters across the mountaintop. History A castle was built on this location in 1537 by Saito Masayoshi, the son of Saito Dosan. When the Sait≈ç clan was destroyed by Oda Nobunaga, Kaneyama was awarded to Nobunaga's general, Mori Yoshinari. Yoshinari fought in many of Nobunaga's battles and was a distinguished commander, but he fell in battle against the Asakura clan in 1570 and was succeeded by his son, Mori Nagayoshi. Under Nagayoshi, the castle was expanded, and Nobunaga made Nagayoshi lord over eastern Mino Province. Nobunaga also accepted his younger brother Mori Ranmaru as one of his pages. Nagayoshi was noted for his violent temper and ruthlessness in battle, even to the point of killing men on his own side who got in the way of his target. During the campaign against Takato Castle, he ordered his gunners to shoot down any fleeing or surrendering enemy. Following the destruction of the Takeda clan, he was rewarded with northern Shinano Province and relocated to Kaizu Castle (the site of current Matsushiro Castle) where he earned the sobriquet of \\"Demon\\" for his ruthless suppression of a local uprising. After Nobunaga's assassination, the minor lords of Shinano rose in open revolt and Nagayoshi was forced to flee back to Mino Province, where he murdered the sons of the Shinano lords whom he had held as hostages. Two years later, Nagayoshi and his father-in-law Ikeda Tsuneoki decided to support Toyotomi Hideyoshi over Oda Nobukatsu and seized Inuyama Castle across the Kiso River in Owari Province. To protect his rear against attack by Tokugawa Ieyasu, Nagayoshi reformed Kaneyama Castle with additional dry moats and clay ramparts. Both Nagayoshi and Ikeda Tsuneoki fell during the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute of 1584. Before the battle, Nagayoshi left a will stating that in case of his death, Kaneyama Castle was to be assigned to one of his generals, and that under no circumstances was his younger brother, Mori Tadamasa to inherit. Hideyoshi ignored the will and allowed Tadamasa to succeed. Subsequently, Tadamasa was reassigned to Kaizu Castle, and then to Bitchu Province, where he built Tsuyama Castle. The castle was abandoned around the start of the Tokugawa shogunate, and many of its buildings and stone walls were dismantled and reused to repair Inuyama Castle. One of the gates originally from Kaneyama Castle has been preserved as a gate to the temple of Zuisen-ji in Inuyama. At the site of Kaneyama Castle are only a few broken stone ruins and foundations. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.

Early life and education  Shim was born in Kuching in the then- British protectorate state of Raj of Sarawak. He completed his A Level studies in Westminster College, London, United Kingdom in 1962 before receiving his barrister-at-law from the Inner Temple in 1969. In 1980, Shim graduated from the Faculty of International and Comparative Law at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium with a Master of Laws (Honours) (LL.M. (Hons.)).  Career  = 1970 & 1980s = Shim's career in the legal service began on 10 August 1970 when he became a cadet legal officer. By 1977, he was made a registrar at the High Court of Borneo. In between, Shim had also served as a crown counsel and magistrate. His career then progressed further when he was appointed as a sessions courts judge in 1989. = 1990 & 2000s = On 1 March 1992, Shim was appointed as a judicial commissioner at the High Court in Sibu. He served in that capacity for just five months before being promoted as judge of the same High Court in August 1992. As a High Court judge, Shim took postings in Kuching and later Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia, beginning 1996. Having served as a High Court judge for almost eight years, Shim was chosen to take over duties as acting Chief Judge of the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak in July 2000. He officially ascended to the fourth highest judicial office in Malaysia, after the Chief Justice of Malaysia, President of the Court of Appeal of Malaysia and Chief Judge of Malaya, in September 2000. Shim retired from the legal service on 19 July 2006. = 2010s = In 2011, Shim was selected to chair the newly-created National Wage Consultative Council placed under the Ministry of Human Resources of Malaysia. Following the loss of Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak and his Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition in the 14th Malayoian general election, Shim was selected to chair a special tribunal formed in 17 October 2018 to probe and seek the removal of six members of the Election Commission of Malaysia (SPR) after thirteen charges were framed against the latter.

It was part of an earlier scheme to convey coal from a new colliery at Tickhill to Grimsby for export. After authorisation, its promoters did not proceed with construction, and when the South Yorkshire Joint Railway was built, serving Tickhill and other developing pits, that line was a better outlet for the minerals and the promoters lost interest in the Tickhill line . Eventually the Great Northern Railway adopted the powers and built the line, but it never carried mineral trunk hauls and became simply an insignificant agricultural siding. It closed in 1964 or 1965. Conception The Bawtry to Haxey line Towards the end of the nineteenth century, a new colliery was being developed at Tickhill, in South Yorkshire about three miles west of Bawtry. Rail access to Grimsby was critical to the commercial success of the pit, and the owners promoted the Tickhill Light Railway. This was to run from the colliery at Tickhill to a junction with the Great Northern Railway at Bawtry, on the East Coast Main Line, and from there it was to run on to a junction with the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway at Haxey. It was expected to be able to continue from there to Goole over the Axholme Joint Railway, at the time being promoted by the North Eastern Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway jointly. The section from Bawtry to Haxey followed closely the route originally authorised to the Great Northern Railway in 1846, but never built by them. John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume III: Twentieth Century to Grouping, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1981, , pages 68 and 69Stewart E Squires, The Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Castlemead Publications, Ware, 1988, ISBN , pages 22 and 23 The promoters of the proposed line got a Light Railway Order dated 7 Aug 1901 for a line from Haxey to Bawtry and Tickhill. However, at this stage they did nothing towards construction, and meanwhile the Axholme Joint Railway was opened to Haxey on 3 November 1904.B J Elliott, The South Yorkshire Joint Railway and the Coalfield, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2002, , page 124 Although they did not take any steps toward construction, the impending opening of the Axholme line may have prompted the Tickhill promoters to renew their authorisation: on 22 Sept 1904 they were granted an Extension of Time Order. The Great Northern Railway takes over On 30 May 1907 the Great Northern Railway board decided to apply for an order to take over the Tickhill Light Railway's powers themselves, paying ¬£2,300 to the original promoters; the transfer was granted in July 1908. The intended junction at Haxey was simplified; originally it had been proposed to cross directly to the Axholme Joint Railway, but this was not needed by the Great Northern Railway; the simplification would save ¬£10,000. Still not making this a priority, in June 1910 the board ordered construction between Bawtry and Haxey, as soon as land could be obtained, at an estimated cost of ¬£88,000. Haxey was on the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Line; as the connection was planned to bring coal to the line for transport south, the Great Eastern Railway agreed to pay for part of Haxey junction. The Great Eastern Railway interest must have been to get access for its trains to the Tickhill colliery area, although they would have needed to construct the Bawtry to Tickhill section themselves.Wrottesley, page 108 A trade periodical reported in November 1911 that > A start has been made in the last few days on the new line which the Great > Northern Railway are constructing between Bawtry and Haxey and which will be > a valuable link in view of prospective colliery developments. The line which > will be eight miles long is to cost ¬£30,000 and will occupy about twelve > months in construction. The contractors are Messrs H. Lovatt Ltd. Collieries > have been spoken of at South Carr and Misterton and for these, together with > the new pit to be sunk at Harworth [this became [Harworth Main Colliery], > the line will be very valuable. Some months ago, a survey was made for a > siding from the Harworth Colliery to connect with the Great Northern line > near Scrooby. As most of the coal will go eastward, the connection will very > likely be carried to Bawtry, in which event it would be an easy matter to > extend the line via Harworth to Tickhill and link up with the Five > Companies' line. The Order gives power to carry the line to Tickhill.The > Iron & Coal Trades Review, 17 February, 1911 Harworth was located midway between Rossington and Firbeck. The exploration lease was held by a German combine headed by Hugo Stinnes. A line connecting the site to the East Coast Main LIne at Scrooby was authorised in August 1912 and a temporary line laid for the sinkers, using a German locomotive. With the outbreak of war, all work at Harworth was suspended in August 1914.Elliott, pages 73 and 74 Opening The Bawtry to Haxey line was opened for goods traffic only on 26 August 1912;Squires says 12 August 1912. it consisted of eight miles of single line. In the meantime the Tickhill colliery had been connected to the South Yorkshire Joint Railway, and construction of the Bawtry to Tickhill section was no longer planned. As predicted by the Iron and Coal Trades Review, the Harworth connection to the main line was made at Scrooby, south of Bawtry and facing south. As a result there was no coal traffic on the Haxey line. There were sidings at Misson goods depot, an agricultural location intermediately on the line, and a private siding for Yorkshire Amalgamated Products. There were three sand and gravel quarries, two near Bawtry and one about half a mile west of Misson. Passenger trains were never contemplated.Wrottesley, page 127Elliott, pages 73 and 74 It is very doubtful if through traffic was carried between Bawtry and Haxey. It is possible that the central portion of the line was lifted and shipped to France during World War I. The Haxey end was used for wagon storage, having been closed to ordinary traffic before 1923. About three-quarters of a mile of track eastwards from Misson was removed about that time. In 1950 a locomotive went on to the Haxey stub to move wagons and derailed due to the poor state of the track, and immediate permanent closure of the eastern extremity followed. The western end from Bawtry continued in use due to the sand traffic; in London North Eastern Railway days, two round trips daily were often required. According to Squires, there was no run-round facility on the branch, so returning trains were propelled to Bawtry. However, the Ordnance Survey map for 1921 shows a passing loop to the south of the line at Misson, while in 1964 there was a much longer passing loop to the north of the line as well. Instead of becoming a trunk haul mineral line, the section from Bawtry to Misson was little more than a farming siding and this finally closed on 1 April 1965, or 7 December 1964, according to other authorities.A.L.

Created by mural artist and sculptor Bruce Mahalski, in his Royal Terrace residence, it opened to the public in March 2018.  History  Model alt= Mahalski had worked as an artist and illustrator for many years, and taught art in Wellington, New Zealand from 2004 to 2017. Part of his art practice involved creating works from animal bones, reflecting his lifetime fascination with natural history. As a teenager, Mahalski worked as an unofficial intern at the Otago Museum, and opening his own museum had been a lifelong dream: \\"I wanted to work in museums when I was young, But I guess I‚Äôm not much of a team player, so it seemed easiest‚Ä¶just to try and set up my own.\\" Mahalski had been collecting shells, bones, crabs, and insects since the age of eight. His collection of natural history curiosities and cultural objects, incorporating collections of both his parents (his father was a physician and his mother a psychologist), incorporated specimens found in nature, and objects acquired on his travels and from Trade Me. In 2017 Mahalski moved back to his home town of Dunedin, and turned four rooms and the hall of his central city residence at 61 Royal Terrace into exhibition galleries, while continuing to live in the remainder of the house. The Museum of Natural Mystery opened to the public on 23 March 2018, initially only on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. From the outside the museum resembles an ordinary Dunedin villa, but is decorated with the rongorongo script of Easter Island.  Exhibits  Described as \\"David Lynch meets David Attenborough\\", the museum exhibits \\"biological curiosities, ethnological art and unusual cultural artefacts\\". Some of the exhibits are memorials to people, including Mahalski's father, physician E. R. Nye. They include the bones of many different species of animal (including humans), 200 skulls, pinned butterfly collections, vintage books (especially medical texts), and ephemera. On display is a hippo skull, and a giraffe skull sourced from a game park after the animal was culled (no animals were killed for the purposes of exhibition). Other exhibits include: * a card deck with the faces of wanted Iraq War criminals * the skull of a \\"unicow\\", a malformed cow with single horn growing out of its forehead * a plate belonging to the last man to be hanged in England for sheep stealing * wood from the English haunted house Borley Rectory * a clay sculpture allegedly damaged by a poltergeist at the Inverlochy Art School in Wellington * nkisi sculptures from the Congo The museum also contains a gallery where Mahalski exhibits his bone sculptures. For him, \\"the roles of artist and collector are inseparable; items from his collection make their way into his art and his art is displayed next to his collection. More than this, he sees the whole collection as a work of art in itself.\\"  Gallery  File:The Dunedin Museum of Natural Mystery in Dunedin - Gallery (2019).jpg File:Kiribati Warrior - a life-size bust made from animal bones,fish spines and crushed bone by New Zealand artist, Bruce Mahalski (2013).jpg File:The Dunedin Museum of Natural Mystery in Dunedin - Mammal Room (2019).jpg File:Hippo and human skull at the Dunedin Museum of Natural Mystery (2019) (cropped).jpg  References  Category:Museums in Dunedin Category:2018 establishments in New Zealand Category:Museums established in 2018 ","title":"Dunedin Museum of Natural Mystery"},{"id":"61475921","text":"Somtax (Som Tax also as Sumutashi; ) is a township of Akqi County in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China.

Taxonomy This mahseer possesses many typical Cyprinidae features, with a slim, torpedo-shaped body, plus large head and scales, and four barbels at the corners of the mouth. In the original description, Jerdon says: \\"Head to whole body as 1:4; height 3 1/2 times in its length... 23 scales along its body.\\" as among the identification characteristics. Tor malabaricus may be confused with juvenile Tor remadevii, but the distributions should be very different, with Tor remadevii only to be found within the basin of the eastwards-flowing Cauvery River. There have been several recent papers on the genetics of Tor malabaricus and other mahseer species of India , https://www.was.org/meetings/mobile/Paper.aspx?id=153761&src;=P. These papers may help in future identification, although comparisons between Tor malabaricus and Tor khudree should be viewed carefully as despite Pavan-Kumar et. al. reporting that \\"Individuals of Tor putitora, Tor khudree, Tor tor, Tor mahanadicus and Tor malabaricus were collected from respective type locations \\", it is known that Tor khudree is no longer to be found at the type locality . Distribution This mahseer is confined to the west-flowing rivers and streams of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu https://www.earth-syst-sci- data.net/10/1735/2018/essd-10-1735-2018.pdf and Kerala . Ecology It may be expected that Tor malabaricus has similarities with all other mahseer species, being omnivorous, with a diet that likely includes aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, fruit and vegetation, small amphibians and other fish. It would seem probable that adult fish access headwaters for spawning during high water conditions, although as it inhabits the faster, shorter rivers draining westwards along the Western Ghats, migrations would likely be shorter than other species. Conservation This species is currently assigned as Endangered by the IUCN. The major constraining factor in any conservation strategy is the relative lack of understanding of the distribution and ecology of the species and how it interacts with other local fish species within the same habitat. As with other mahseer species, the main threats are: loss of habitat due to urbanisation, encroachment on flood plains, dam building, sand extraction and pollution. Destructive fishing methods like dynamite, poisoning and electricity are in common use throughout South and Southeast Asia, and may be expected to be a major threat to the sustainability of populations. In many of the rivers that have, historically, held Tor malabaricus, an emerging threat is deliberate stocking of the mahseer species from Maharastra, Tor khudree . The spread of this fish poses problems for native stocks and it must be considered an invasive species. It seems likely that the fish deliberately poisoned in a temple pool in Shishla, Karnataka in 1996 would have been Tor malabaricus . Unfortunately, these fish were replaced with Tor khudree stocks from artificial breeding programmes, thus adding to the pressures on native stocks of fish. Temple pools, while useful repositories of local stocks are also extremely vulnerable to diverse habitat pollution incidents https://www.indiawaterportal.org/sites/indiawaterportal.org/files/Temple_Fish_Sanctuaries__Last_bastions_of_native_fish_and_pristine_river_stretches_- _Parineeta_Dandekar.pdf.

As an inductive, management-oriented concept, the CM approach is based on the perspective of a decision-maker and thereby covers and aligns all contract- related processes and parameters that must be considered in order to achieve the objectives of the organization or institution.  Theoretical foundations  The CM approach and its instrumentalization, the CM Model, were developed by Ralph Schuhmann and Bert Eichhorn. The approach and model merge the theoretical findings of new institutional economics, in particular asymmetric information, principle-agent and relational management theories, with the applied, management-oriented approaches of Proactive Law and Keskitalo‚Äôs concept of Contractual Risk Management which both emphasise the use of risk management for contract deployment. In contrast to contract management, the CM approach is not concerned with the management of the contract, but rather with the management of an organization or relationship through the use of the contract.  The CM Model  The CM Model represents a holistic system that comprises all elements relevant for the use of the contract as a steering instrument. It highlights the fact that the contractual management tasks ‚Äì contract plan, draft, implement, monitor, and evaluate ‚Äì are executed within an environment which is determined by management processes and decision parameters. Risk management and knowledge management comprise the core management processes that enable a goal-oriented deployment of the contract through their interactions with the processes of corporate management and management of the relationship. The particular company and business relationship as well as societal norms and value systems determine the specific decision parameters which will ensure compliance with company objectives.  Fields of application  The CM approach and the CM Model were originally developed for the governance of transactions and business cooperations in the private sector. Case studies show evidence that the approach and model are also applicable to public organizations if adapted to the specific working conditions of administrative bodies. Furthermore, the CM approach may be equally useful in the management of quasi-markets through contracts and thus are applicable on an institutional macro level. Even constellations encountered in political management can be addressed by the contractual management approach and model.

Founded in 2013, the institute maintains several facilities across the university's Seattle campus and supports renewable energy technology research, education, entrepreneurship, and outreach. The institute is under the direction of Daniel T. Schwartz, PhD.  History and operations  The Clean Energy Institute is based in the Molecular Engineering and Sciences building at the University of Washington's Seattle campus. It was founded in 2013 with a $6 million grant from the state of Washington for the purposes of supporting solar power and energy storage research and development. This includes research projects led by the university's own academic labs, private companies, and the government. The institute's primary research facility is the Washington Clean Energy Testbeds (WCET), which opened in 2017 and was funded by an additional $8 million state grant approved by governor Jay Inslee. Located next to University Village near the main campus, the facility allows both academic and private sector users to rent lab space, utilize testing equipment, and consult staff for assistance in their research projects. Equipment at the WCET include battery device testers, solar simulators and solar cell testers, a systems integration lab where users can test devices under real-time or simulated power grids to evaluate energy generation and storage strategies, and a roll-to-roll printer which GeekWire described as \\"one of the most advanced roll-to-roll systems in the world.\\" The institute also maintains the Research Training Testbed, which is located in the Nanoengineering and Sciences Building on the university's main campus.  Research  The Clean Energy Institute's main research areas include battery and solar photovoltaic technology as well as grid management. The institute has supported projects relating to perovskites, which have often focused on improving the material properties of thin-film perovskite cells as well as exploring the use of high-throughput manufacturing processes for producing such devices.  Future expansion  In 2018, the state of Washington allocated $20 million to construct a new building on the west side of the UW's Seattle campus called the Center for Advanced Materials and Clean Energy Technologies (CAMCET). The CAMCET building will ultimately house the Clean Energy Institute and the Washington Clean Energy Testbeds as well as the Northwest Institute for Materials Physics, Chemistry, and Technology, and it will include lab and office space for research and collaboration. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2020, and the building is expected to open by the year 2023.

Formerly known as the Church of Holy Sepulchre, it is located to the north of the city, very close to the convent of San Juan de la Cruz, on the slope that ascends to Zamarramala, a town of which it was, for centuries, a parish church. It consists of a nave with a dodecagonal floor plan that surrounds a small central two-story shrine (edicule), to which apses and the tower were added. It is one of the best-preserved churches of this style in Europe. It was declared a Spanish Property of Cultural Interest on 4 July 1919.  History  The construction of this temple has traditionally been attributed to the Knights Templars, but it is now believed that it was the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem that carried out its construction and that it depended, as an encomienda, of the Collegiate church of Santa Mar√≠a la Mayor in Zamora.L√≥pez-Yarto, Amelia, La Iglesia de la Vera Cruz de Segovia y la Orden del Santo Sepulcro. Calatayud: Centro de Estudios de la Orden del Santo Sepulcro, 2008. alt= The temple was dedicated on 13 September 1208, as attested by the tombstone in front of the side door in the temple that narrates In 1531 and as a result of the unification of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre with the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, it became dependent on the Sovereign Military and Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Rhodes and Malta. To the original building was added an apse which is now used as a sacristy. Then, the tower, initially separated from the church, was added. Later, three apses were built, giving the church its today's appearance. In 1692 it ceased to be a parish of Zamarramala and the Virgen de la Paz, whose image made of stone in Romanesque style, presides over one of the apses, became the patron of the church. It was declared a Spanish Property of Cultural Interest by Royal Order on 4 July 1919. On 31 May 1951, the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta took possession of it again and is in charge of its conservation and custody.  Arquitecture  369x369px The temple was built in Romanesque style, already in transition to Gothic, with a dodecagonal nave surrounding a two-storey edicule, to which three apses, a semi-circular sacristy and a square-shaped tower have been added. A lantern stands out slightly from the roof and a tower attached to the building. The tower and a sacristy added to the south east of the church. This type of construction, which has as its direct antecedent the Roman baptisteries of the early Christianity, was widely used by different Crusader Orders. It is estimated that the Dome of the Rock and the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem were taken as examples. The Templars, who had their headquarters in the Holy Land in the Dome of the Rock, built their churches in London, Paris (demolished) and Tomar using this type of layout, as did the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in Torres del R√≠o in Navarre (Spain). The exterior wall is made of ashlar, and it opens small semicircular arrow windows that give light to the temple. At the edges, buttresses reinforce the structure. The tower has a square floor plan with a gable roof. It has four bodies and the last one, where the bells are housed, has two windows on each side with a semicircular arch. The base is reinforced with buttresses. There are two doors leading to the church. The main one on the west fa√ßade, which coincides with the axis of the central apse, has a linteled opening with a plain tympanum and four archivolts decorated with serrated edges. On each side, three columns have sculpted capitals showing birds, warriors, human busts, demons, and bird sirens. On a roof with corbels, there is a window. The side door of the south fa√ßade is opposite the place where the dedication stone of the temple is located. It is made up of a semicircular arch and has no tympanum. Above it, on the outside, there is a relief depicting the Holy Women and the Angel of the Resurrection at the foot of the empty tomb of Jesus Christ. The archivolts are unornamented and the capitals are decorated with vegetal motifs, human figures and birds-sirens.  Interior  Interior of the Vera Cruz with the central aedicula and the flagsIn the walls of the nave remain vestiges of the old mural decoration as well as two niches, one with the icon of the patron saint of the Order of Malta, Our Lady of Philermo and another with the icon of the patron saint, St. John the Baptist. The flags of the Order of Malta, which refer to the languages into which it is divided, are located throughout the nave. In the central apse there is an image of Jesus crucified from the 13th century. In the left apse is located the chapel of the tabernacle where there is a copy of the image of St. John the Baptist, patron saint of the Order of Malta, whose original is in its headquarters in Madrid. In the right apse is the Romanesque image of the Virgin of Peace.The high altar of the church The aedicula is a small two-story shrine located in the center of the church. It is accessed by a double staircase under which opens the access to the lower floor, facing the main door. The second floor is crowned by a caliphal dome and in the center there is an altar with Mud√©jar decoration. The lower floor, with four pointed arches oriented with the cardinal points, has a ribbed vault. The uses for these rooms are unknown. It is estimated that in the upper room, the arms sailing was carried out before the knights' crossings and in the lower room penitential acts were carried out. Today, religious celebrations of the Knights of the Order of Malta are organised on the upper floor. Situated on the ground floor of the tower, a 16th-century niche carved in stone with the coats of arms of one of the Commanders of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher was built to venerate a relic of the True Cross. The relic of the cross is nowadays on display in the parish church of Zamarramala, where it was moved after several robbery attempts. Situated on one of the walls of the circular nave is the Gothic altarpiece that adorned the central apse. It dates from 1516, from the Castilian school with scenes from the life of Christ.  Celebrations  The Knights of the Order of Malta celebrate their religious celebrations in this church. The procession of Good Friday is noteworthy, especially the procession of the Lying Christ and the Lignum Crucis in which the Knights of the Order of Malta parade in black choir habits.

However, by 1838 Daguerre had developed his own method whereby the exposure was reduced to only seven minutes or so. Crop showing people photographed The photograph was taken from a window in Daguerre's studio beside the at 5 , behind the . This was at a time before the Place de la R√©publique had been built and the location is where now joins the Place de la R√©publique. The plate is about . The Boulevard du Temple would have been busy with people and horse traffic but because an exposure time of about ten minutes would have been required the only people recorded were two keeping still ‚Äì a bootblack and his customer at the corner of the street shown at lower left of the plate. Publication and exhibition Daguerre first publicly announced his invention to the French Acad√©mie des Sciences in January 1839 but in March 1839 a fire at his studio destroyed almost all of his daguerrotypes leaving only about 25 which can be definitely attributed to him. In October 1839, as a publicity effort, he presented King Ludwig I of Bavaria with a framed triptych of his work in which this photograph was the right hand image. This image was labelled as having been taken at huit heures du matin and a very similar plate was mounted in the left panel marked as midi. The images were both taken on the same day, either in 1838 or 1839, together with a third plate which has since been lost. The triptych was put on display at the Munich Arts Association where they immediately attracted attention with the Leipzig Pfennig-Magazin saying of the 8 am image that there appeared to be a man having his boots polished who must have been standing extremely still. Second image taken at midday The images were stored at the royal palace and later at the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum archives where they gradually deteriorated until in 1936 or 1937 the American historian of photography Beaumont Newhall rediscovered them and made reproductions for display in New York. In 1949 he published them in his book The History of Photography from 1839 to the present Day. During World War II the original daguerrotypes were kept in poor conditions until in 1970 they were placed on loan with the Munich Stadtmuseum. Restoration was attempted but with disastrous results. Since then daguerreotype facsimiles have been produced from Newhall's copies. Analysis 8 am image reversed to show actual orientation Various people have scrutinised the image to see if there are traces of any other activity. There may be faint images of other people and possibly a child looking out of a window, and a horse. As with all Daguerre's plates, the picture is mirror image. Bearing this in mind the camera location and angle have been analysed. There may have been photographs of people before 1838. Hippolyte Bayard claimed to have taken photographic self-portraits in 1837 but these have not survived. There are other daguerrotypes, both portraits and possibly by Daguerre, that might also date from 1837. The self-portrait by the American Robert Cornelius was taken in 1839.

Plot At the Springfield Retirement Castle after telling him a war story and pranking him with it, Grampa gives Bart a dud grenade. Bart takes it to a school assembly and pranks them the same way Grampa did, scaring everyone away while ambulances and firefighters are called. Ned Flanders throws himself on top of the bomb to sacrifice himself to save the school and Bart is forced to reveal the prank. Superintendent Chalmers wants to expel Bart from school, but Ned intervenes, volunteering to supervise Bart the right way with the three P's: persistence, prayer and persistent prayer. At the Flanders house, Bart tries Ned's patience so Ned takes him fishing. Bart manages to catch a fish and Ned teaches him how to roast it on a fire. Bart also joins the church choir and everyone congratulates Ned for turning Bart around. Homer becomes jealous. Feeling useless, Homer walks around the city until he finds a sad Nelson Muntz at the Springfield City Dump, crying due to his situation at home. Homer brings him to Krusty Burger and offers to become his mentor, making Bart jealous. Seeing the problems that he is causing, Lisa asks Homer to seek counseling. Homer goes to a therapist that disagrees with his methods. Homer goes then to see Nelson, but finds his mother, who asks him if he is going to leave them too, like all the other men have in the past, breaking Nelson's heart. When Homer explains the situation to Nelson, Nelson prepares a plan to get even with Bart at the Christian Pride Parade, trying to activate the mechanism that Bart and the Flanders built, the praying hands, when Bart passes through. Homer spots Nelson, and pushes Bart away in time, getting squashed by the hands himself. The two ride in the ambulance together. Homer apologizes to Nelson and guides him to Ned as a mentor.

When she learns she cannot stay with her, she checks her favorite mommy blog, \\"Yaaass, Mom!\\", for tips on how to pass the time. She first tries going to the gym to take a Soul Cycle class, where she is uncomfortable with the aggressive coach who wins the other ladies over with his angry coaching.

Meanwhile, Tatum presents \\"The Drederick\\" to the workers, a cannabis resort and spa, and wants Marge to host the opening. However, he claims he cannot offer her the job because Homer giving weed a bad image with his shop. The only way for her to keep her job at the company is to stop Homer. Marge tries to convince Homer to stop, but he refuses and the two end up in a fierce argument all night. As Marge is preparing to leave her job at Well + Good, Tatum offers her an alternative option: if Marge could provide evidence that Homer is serving food, the county health department will shut him down. Marge goes through with the plan, giving Homer a jar of cheese balls and encouraging him to serve some to Lenny and Krusty the Clown. When they eat some of the cheese balls, the department closes the activity, betraying Homer. At The Drederick's opening ceremony, Homer sneaks in claiming to be Kevin Smith's father, and, supposedly drunk, upsets the influencers by revealing Marge has never tried pot herself. To save face, she tries some and feels the effects of getting high. She finds out she was deceived and that the people at Well + Good were only promoting their cannabis products as healthy as a front to get high. She attempts to counter the high by eating food, only to find out they are all laced with pot and that the napkins are potent in pot. Increasingly disoriented, she makes her way into the bathroom and is comforted by Homer, who had faked being drunk to teach her a lesson. After Marge's bad experience with cannabis, she apologises to Homer for ratting him out; he also apologises for ruining the one place that made her feel special. As Marge is still feeling weird from her high, Homer tries to make it up to her lighting a joint, which turns out to be an electronic cigarette that explodes and causes a chain reaction that destroys the resort completely. In the end, Well + Good closes down and the city declares cannabis outlawed in an emergency law. However, Lisa points out that with the loss of the tax money, Maggie's preschool will soon be shut down. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B, stating that \\"Now that the legal pot business is here to stay...that the Simpsons (family and series) would incorporate it into the sweep of shenanigans, adventures, and whatnot feels, well, organic. And the script for ‚ÄòHighway To Well,‚Äô credited to the always-welcome Carolyn Omine, does an admirable job of making the marijuana element (underrated dispensary name) feel right at home as just another excuse for Homer and Marge's differences to bubble to the surface, rather than reeking with ‚Äòvery special episode‚Äô staleness or sensationalism. As things turn out, legalized pot is just another new development in American society that reveals the characters, in a more or less satisfying manner.\\".

Part One is the nineteenth episode of the 31st season and originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 26, 2020, Part Two is the twentieth of the 31st season and aired on May 3, 2020. The title \\"Warrin' Priests\\" refers to War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. This marks the series' third two-parter following Season 6 and 7's \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\" and Season 28's \\"The Great Phatsby\\". Both parts were written by Pete Holmes; part one was directed by Bob Anderson and part two by Matthew Nastuk. Holmes guest stars as preacher Bode Wright in both parts. Plot =Part One= The First Church of Springfield is mostly empty as the service starts, with even the choir being late. Reverend Lovejoy unsuccessfully tries to get the congregation involved. Meanwhile, a young man named Bode Wright turns up in Springfield to apply for the job of youth minister after he saw an advert placed by Helen Lovejoy. Bode gets the job after a short interview, with Helen offering to let him stay with them, to Reverend Lovejoy's annoyance. The next church service, Lovejoy loses his voice completely. Bode Wright then takes over as the pastor for the service and proves a hit with everyone, singing \\"Amazing Grace\\" and getting the congregation involved, though Ned Flanders dislikes his modern methods. As the services go on, more and more people turn up to the church. Homer even starts to love church. Lisa and Bode bond together over being vegetarians, science, Buddhism and jazz. The church council votes to replace Lovejoy with Bode. Lovejoy and Helen then decide to go to Michigan to dig up some dirt on Bode. Meanwhile, Homer and Marge go to Bode to get marriage counseling, with Bode helping them immediately. Later that day, Lisa goes to see Bode to meditate with him. Lisa tells Bode that he has brought the town into a full-blown religious revival, with many people turning back to religion. Meanwhile, in Traverse City, Michigan, Reverend Lovejoy manages to find a newspaper article that could be the downfall of Bode. =Part Two= Bode Wright, the new minister of the First Church of Springfield, brings record crowds to the church, with his fresh ideas and good looks. Bode tries to bring other religions in, while Ned is disappointed and misses the old ways. Lisa finds that the new minister's teachings help reconcile her with the church, though Marge warns her that Springfield has been traditionally hostile to new ideas. Ned challenges Bode to a scriptural debate and loses. Meanwhile, in Michigan, Reverend Lovejoy and Helen visit the Blessed Buy Megachurch, where Bode was fired. Lovejoy asks about Bode and the preacher presents them a USB drive with proof about Bode. During the ceremony at the church, Lovejoy returns announcing what he found in Michigan: the reason Bode was fired was that as a 19-year-old minister, he burned a Bible during a church service. The next Tuesday, Lisa presents the debate between the two priests, but the Springfielders don't forgive the new minister and Bode resigns. The Simpson family invites him over for dinner, and Lisa then asks him at church the reason he burned the Bible. He says that God is in the heart, not in a cathedral or a book, but Lisa tells him that the people in town don't get the subtext. Bode sadly leaves Springfield. Reception Dennis Perkins from The A.V. Club gave Part One of the episode a B+, stating \\"Holmes himself plays Bode, the guitar-strumming young pastor who's come to Springfield at the behest of not Reverend Lovejoy (of the interminably sleepy sermons and defensive moralizing), but wife Helen. (She put an ad for help on \\"Christ's List.\\").\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave Part Two a 4 out of 5, stating \\"'Warrin' Priests' is a parable. Springfield is America. The majority of people are as desperate for change as they are desperately afraid of it. The episode is a testament to longer-form Simpsons. The series gets more adventurous, allows more attention to details, develops supporting personalities and lets the tensions grow. It almost felt like this episode could've used another full segment.\\" References External links Category:The Simpsons (season 31) episodes Category:2020 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about religion ","title":"Warrin' Priests"},{"id":"61476422","text":"A grain train at Rozelle in 1977 Rozelle Yard was a goods railway yard in Rozelle, New South Wales, Australia. Since heavy rail traffic ceased, part of the site has been redeveloped into a light rail depot and maintenance facility. Much of the former yard is currently being redeveloped as part of the Bays Precinct project. It was one of two major yards on the former Rozelle-Darling Harbour Goods Line, the other being at Darling Harbour.  History  By 1908, goods traffic on the line to Darling Harbour and the neighbouring suburban lines had become excessive, with 592 wagons arriving each day and 512 being dispatched.Forsyth, J.H. (ed.) (1988‚Äì93), Stations & Tracks; Vol. 1: \\"Main Suburban & Branches -- Illawarra & Branches\\". State Rail Authority of New South Wales: Sydney, p. 97. It was decided to construct separate goods lines from Sefton to Darling Harbour via Enfield, Dulwich Hill and Rozelle, with extensions to Botany and the State Abattoirs at Homebush Bay. The initial scheme, approved by the Parliamentary Committee on Public Works, approved the initial line from Dulwich Hill to Darling Harbour. To avoid an opening rail bridge alongside the existing Glebe Island Bridge, a circuitous route was built around Rozelle Bay through the suburb of Pyrmont. The proposal, which included two tunnels under Pyrmont and Glebe, was approved on 23 November 1914, and the line opened on 23 January 1922. A branch line from the yard served White Bay Power Station.Bozier, Rolfe, \\"New South Wales Railways: Rozelle-Darling Harbour Goods Line\\". Retrieved 9 August 2019. In January 1996, the Lilyfield to Central section of the Metropolitan Goods line closed. Much of the alignment was reutilised by the Inner West Light Rail that opened to Wentworth Park in August 1997 and was extended to Lilyfield in August 2000.\\"Last Freight Finishes on Darling Harbour Line\\" Railway Digest March 1996 Page 15\\"Sydney's Tram Extension Opens\\" Railway Digest September 2000 page 4Sydney Metro Light Rail, Australia railway-technology.com The yard saw a considerable decline in traffic throughout the 2000s, becoming overgrown and being used only intermittently for storage of disused passenger and freight carriages. Goods traffic on the line ceased in 2009 and the yard fell out of use.  Redevelopment  A light rail stop serving Lilyfield, located adjacent to the rail yards, opened on 13 August 2000 as the terminus of the Wentworth Park-Lilyfield extension of the Inner West Light Rail. In February 2010, following the cessation of goods traffic the previous year, the Keneally Government announced a extension of the light rail from Lilyfield to Dulwich Hill. A stabling facility was built to the west of Lilyfield station. A second platform was added at Lilyfield for services towards Dulwich Hill. The Dulwich Hill extension opened in 2014. A maintenance depot was constructed next to the station on the site of the Rozelle Rail Yards. Part of the yard is to be utilised by the WestConnex M4-M5 Link. As a result of the current renewal works, the precinct will include ten hectares of green space featuring smokestacks, sports fields and recreational facilities and is due to be open to the public in late 2023.

Serving with the Royal Artillery, Bill was sent to France with the B.E.F. and captured by the enemy in 1940. He was sent East to work on farms near the Baltic Coast and in 1945 was being held in Stalag 20B, Gross Golmkau, 30 km south of Gdansk. It was here that fellow prisoner, Stan Wells found 16 year old Sarah Matuson hiding in a barn.Eden Camp, Hut 19, Medal Room, Medal Board, Scruton, Bill, accessed when visiting the site, 2019 Sarah, a Lithuanian Jew from Shavli, along with her mother, Gita, and sister, Hanna were 3 of 300 survivors of a horrific forced march of 1200 women from Stuthof Concentration Camp. Compelled to escape by her mother, Sarah succeeded in leaving the line in search of food but was spotted by locals and took refuge in the barn. Severely undernourished and exhausted, Sarah was discovered by Stan who informed her that the locals had given up their search. He reassured her and returned with food, and with the help of his fellow prisoners, Bill Scruton included, smuggled Sarah into Stalag 20B. For around 3 weeks, Bill and the others hid Sarah in the hayloft of a barn that housed the horses of the local police station and despite the risk of discovery, nursed her back to health. They left Sarah in the care of a sympathetic local women when they were ordered on a forced march themselves, though advancing Russian forces soon liberated all involved. Sarah was to discover later that her family had not survived the war and in memory of her sister she added ‚ÄòHannah‚Äô to her name. She moved to live with an uncle and started a new life, training as a nurse, marrying William Rigler, a New York Supreme Judge, and had two children. Though eager to trace the men who had saved her life, Sarah only remembered one full name of the ten British prisoners; Alan Edwards. After a long search and with the assistance of the British War Records Office, Sarah made contact with Alan and in 1973, and the group were reunited. The efforts of Stan Wells, George Hammond, Tommy Noble, Alan Edwards, Roger Letchford, Bill Scruton, Bill Keeble, Bert Hambling, Jack Buckley and Willy Fisher were recognised by Yad Vashem, the Jewish organisation which safeguards the memory and meaning of the Holocaust for future generations, and they were awarded a medal and the title of Righteous Among the Nations. In 2013, six of the group‚Äôs families were identified and given the posthumous award of British Hero of the Holocaust. Bill Scruton‚Äôs nieces, Mavis Shaw and Barbara Topham, were traced and awarded Bill‚Äôs medal which is now on permanent display in the Eden Camp Medal Room. Sarah published the book ‚ÄòTen British Soldiers Saved My Life‚Äô under her new name of Hannah Sarah Rigler in 2007.

He was the Senior Secretary to the President for Civil Affairs from 2017 to 2019 in the Moon Jae-in Cabinet. On 9 September 2019, President Moon Jae-in appointed Cho as Minister of Justice, replacing the incumbent Park Sang-ki. As of late 2019, Cho Kuk was involved in a series of controversies, including allegations of illicit business activities and falsification of academic achievements of his daughter. On 14 October, Cho Kuk announced his resignation of Minister of Justice over corruption allegations.  Early life and education  Cho was born in West District of Busan in 1965, as the eldest son of the ex-Director of Institute of Ungdong, Cho Byun-hyun (died in 2013), and his wife and the current Director of the institute, Park Jung-sook. He attended for Gudeok Elementary School in Busan, then moved to Seoul and studied at Daesin Middle School. After he returned to Busan, he finished his secondary education at Hyekwang High School. Cho earned a bachelor's and master's degree in law studies from Seoul National University, and doctoral degree (J.S.D) from University of California, Berkeley in the United States. He was also a visiting scholar at University of Oxford and University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. Cho used to be a lecturer for law studies at University of Ulsan from 1992 to 1994 and from 1999 to 2000, then at Dongguk University from 2000 to 2001, and later at Seoul National University‚Äîwhere he had earned his bachelor's degree‚Äîfrom 2001 to 2004. While at Seoul National University, his position was promoted from a lecturer to a senior lecturer (2004‚Äì2009), then to a full professor in 2009.  Political career  Cho showed his interests toward politics in the end of the 1980s, while studying at university. During this time, he was already a member of Socialist Labour League of South Korea, along with Rhyu Si-min and Eun Su-mi. Cho was detained due to this activities, under the breach of the National Security Act, and declared as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Later, he criticised the National Security Act as a \\"barbaric law\\" from his book titled For the Freedom of Conscience and Ideology. Since the 2000s, Cho has been involved in various activities related to human rights and democracy. He was a member of People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, Committee of Determination of Punishment in Supreme Court, National Human Rights Commission, and the other various organisations. Cho has never held any kind of elected positions, despite the former Democratic Party and its successor Democratic Unionist Party suggested him for running as a member of National Assembly in Bundang 2nd constituency. There were also expectations that Cho would run for the Superintendent of Education in Seoul during the local elections in 2014, but he declined. He did not even run for mayorship of Busan in 2018, despite public expectations. = Senior Secretary to the President for Civil Affairs, 2017‚Äì2019 = Cho Kuk in 2015 On 11 May 2017, the next day after Moon Jae-in officially assumed his presidency, Cho was appointed as Senior Secretary to the President for Civil Affairs. He was one of non- prosecutors appointed for the position. He promised for the clear investigation of 2016 South Korean political scandal. This was welcomed by People's Party, but also attacked from Liberty Korea Party. On 31 December 2018, he attended at House Steering Committee of National Assembly. This \\"surprise\\" attend was issued into South Korean society, as this was not really done by the former senior secretaries. A source reported that this inclined the approval ratings of the President Moon. He was replaced by Kim Joe-won on 26 July 2019. = Minister of Justice = On 9 August 2019, Cho was nominated for the position of Minister of Justice replacing Park Sang-ki, by President Moon. He quoted from General Lee Soon-shin and promised for the political reform. On 9 September, Cho was officially appointed as the Minister of Justice. But he resigned 35 days after taking office due to a prosecution probe into various allegations surrounding his family.  Political orientation  Cho is often regarded as liberal, even though he was labelled as a \\"leftist\\" by several right-wings. Regarding the abolition of the death penalty, he said, \\"I understood the national sentiment, but it should be replaced to life imprisonment.\\" He also mentioned that people should not argue with criminality of abortion. For issues related to Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), Cho announced that the government is not only for KCTU and impossible to satisfy their demands.  Controversies  In his political career, Cho Kuk was embroiled in a number of scandals, including plagiarism and tax delinquencies. More significant scandals came from his pending nomination as the Minister of Justice, mainly concerning Cho Kuk's illicit business activities and falsification of academic achievements of his daughter, Cho Min. Leaders of Seoul National University's General Student Council chant slogans during a rally at the school campus in Seoul on 5 September 2019, to voice their objection to the possible appointment of Cho Kuk, who is facing allegations of ethical lapses. There are numerous other allegations of corruption under public scrutiny. Cho Kuk, having been a prolific self-righteous critic of corruption, is now widely criticized as being a hypocrite, coining the term \\"Choronambur\\" (Ï°∞Î°úÎÇ®Î∂à), which means \\"it's romance if done by Cho, but adultery if done by others\\". = Plagiarism = Cho was frequently accused of plagiarism. In July 2013, Song Pyung-in of The Dong-a Ilbo and a conservative commentator Byun Hui-jae had mentioned that Cho plagiarized several theses during his studies at Seoul National University in 1989. He replied that he underwent some problems with citations, although \\"unsure because it was long time ago\\", but then he apologized for it. On 26 June 2015, Seoul National University answered for the issue: some issues were found, which are not too serious. A few months after the incident, both commentators claimed again that Cho's plagiarism continued at Berkeley in 1997. In response, Professor John Yoo said that no rechecking is required. Berkeley also mentioned that there was no proof for the accusations. = Tax Delinquencies = Cho faced another criticisms regarding with tax delinquencies related with Institute of Ungdong. It was reported that he and his family did not pay its legal costs for 3 years. He accepted that it was true, and successfully paid all. =Illicit Business Activities= In 2017, it was revealed that Cho Kuk and his family invested a total of approximatedly one million KRW, with a contract to invest an additional approximately seven million KRW, into a private equity fund, CO-LINK. CO-LINK invested in a Korean company that is contracted in a multi-billion dollar computer network project in South Korea. On 27 August 2019, a search warrant was carried out by the prosecutor's office on suspect sites. On 29 August, the former wife of Cho's younger brother Cho Kwon, Cho Eun-hyang, who is listed as the owner or CEO of many of Cho Kuk's family businesses and properties, was denied boarding on an international flight out of Gimhae International Airport. Despite two full days of news reports, she claimed she was not aware of the flight ban placed on her. Furthermore, three other business associates of Cho Kuk's family, including a Cho Kuk relative, had already left the country before the ban was officially placed on them. Kim Gyung-yul and his team of accountants and economic analysts of People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy came to a conclusion that this is a crime involving political power. On 31 October, Cho Kuk's younger brother, Cho Kwon, was arrested on charges of embezzlement and bribery. =Falsification of Academic Achievements of Cho Min= Cho Min, and her parents Cho Kuk and Chung Kyung-sim, have been accused of falsifying her academic achievements to get enrolled in prestigious universities and the medical school. Falsified academic achievements include her research in genetics and pathology, one of which has been retracted for violating ethical guidelines. A senior association of medical experts in South Korea condemned the paper as one of the most serious cases of academic misconduct in South Korean history and compared it to the Hwang Woo-suk scandal. =Indictment and Arrest= On 10 September 2019, shortly after Cho Kuk's nomination hearing, Cho Kuk's wife, Chung Kyung-sim, was officially indicted for forgery of a document by the prosecutor's office. Prior to the charges and during the hearing, when asked what should happen if his wife should face charges, Cho Kuk replied that his wife should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. Cho Kuk did not add that he would withdraw or resign from the nomination (Korea Times, 11 Sept. 2019, Chosunilbo, 10 Sept. 2019) On 24 October Chung Kyung-sim arrested for embezzlement using forged official documents and other charges.

He participated in the Non-cooperation Movement , Civil Disobedience movement . Early life Gopabandhu Choudhuri was born to Gokulananda Choudhuri at the village of Kherasa, Jagatsinghpur District, Odisha. His father belonged to a landlord family and was an eminent advocate. His younger brother was Nabakrushna Choudhury who was Chief minister of Orissa. He graduated from Presidency College with B.A. in Mathematics in the year 1912. He got his master's degree from the same college in 1914 . In 1917 he got his preliminary law degree from the Calcutta University . After his education he joined the British Government as a deputy magistrate. Gopabandhu married Rama Devi, niece of Madhusudan Das on 1914. Indian Freedom Movement In 1921 after four years of working for British Government, he resigned from his job as of Deputy Magistrate . He decided to spend the rest of his life in the service of the people. It was an unprecedented action which surprised the people of Odisha. In the words of celebrated novelist, Jnanpitha Award Winner and his biographer Gopinath Mohanty , His resignation, which was an extraordinary step and a brave decision, brought him immediately to the middle of the Indian freedom movement. While most of the population thought his resignation was a great sacrifice but he himself never considered it as such. He selected Jagatsinghpur as his place of work. He laid the foundation of famous \\"Alakashrama\\" near the banks of Alaka river January 1922. There was a school attached to the ashram. Along with imparting education, the school also taught sanitation work and ran programmes to fight the communicable diseases like malaria and cholera. In 1921, he represented Orissa in AICC.It was for the first time Orissa was represented in AICC. His responsibility in was to give popularize the Congress, and expand its organisational base. He was also responsible of the Congress office and managed the Congress establishment in Orissa. In his political thought, he was a dedicated Congressman with unwavering faith in Mahatma Gandhi. He never wanted power for himself. His belief was a strong Congress would be crucial to achieving independence from British.Hence His goal was to strengthen the Congress.He did not contest the elections for Provincial Legislative Assembly. he led a group of Congress workers who would shun power, who would not sit on any committee nor would be members of any Board. They would work to strengthen the Congress. For him, the freedom movement and the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi was the most important consideration. So, he was eager to merge Utkal Sammilani with Congress and fight for separate linguistic province under the aegis of Congress. However, there was a group of Utkal sammilani members who was opposed to the idea. Ultimately Choudhury could not reconcile with both the factions and resigned from Utkal sammilani in 1924. In 1934, Mahatma Gandhi undertook a padyatra in Orissa. One of the places he visited during his travel was a remote village Bari, in Jajpur subdivision of the erstwhile Cuttack district. Bari and surrounding areas were regularly afflicted with floods. He was posted here during his days in the Government service and he was well acquainted with the area. Gandhi suggested Gopabandhu to choose one of such place and to stay there to work with the people. Gopabandhu selected Bari . He set up a base at Bari with his family and a few followers on 13 August 1934. While he remained a congress member, he bid adieu to active politics. At Bari, he undertook many social reconstruction various programmes such as village cleaning, teaching Dalits, empowering Dalits to fight exploitation by landowners. He also undertook setting up small scale industries like leather tanning and manufacturing units, units to produce molasses, units to manufacture khadi, units to produce soap and paper etc. He also encouraged local people into vocations such as apiculture, dairy farm, basket and mattress production. He trained farmers to grow new vegetables such as tomato, cauliflower, etc. and plant various fruit bearing plants. The practice of growing vegetables that was started by him still continues in Bari and its nearby areas. Besides his work to strengthen the village economy, he also wanted to bring in inter-caste harmony. He persuaded the villagers to let untouchables enter into the Baldevjiu temple as early as 1936. He translated Mahatma Gandhi's biography \\"my experiments with truth\\" to odia, \\"satyara prayog\\" Post Independence  India got independence in 1947. He continued his work at Bari that he began before independence. He was however disillusioned by the Congress governments approach towards governance. He boycotted the 1952 elections and joined the Acharya Vinoba Bhave led Bhoodan movement.

Description The body of Allopseudaxine katsuwonis comprises an anterior part attenuated in the cephalic region which contains most organs, and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor bears a single row of 24 pedunculate clamps. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. A lobe lappet is present, and is armed with two pairs of hooks. There are also two buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior mouth, an oval pharynx, a simple oesophagus and a posterior intestine that bifurcates at or near level of genital pore in two lateral branches. The intestinal branches terminate in the distal portion of the haptor region. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium armed with a corona of 14 hook-like spines, one row of dorsolateral marginal vaginae on each side of the body, each row divided into a longitudinal row of transverse slit with sclerotized margins, a slender tubular ovary and about 60 large oval testes pre, para and post-ovarian.

Motti is a good Jewish boy dominated by his mother. He is in college studying economics for his family. Motti's mother constantly arranges dates for Motti, hoping he will marry soon. In class, he meets Laura. Unlike Motti's other dates, he is interested in Laura. But she is not Jewish and therefore a 'shiksa' in Yiddish. He knows his mother would never approve. Motti starts to hang out with Laura. She wears blue jeans, drinks gin and tonics and, according to Motti, has a great ass. At the same time, Motti is still being set up on dates by his mother. On one of his dates, Motti and the girl, Michal, agree to act as if they are dating to stop their mothers from bombarding them with date proposals. Motti's mom wrecks her car with excitement over the news. Meanwhile, Motti and Laura keep dating. Eventually, Motti can't stand the pressure of his mother. Motti confesses to his mother that he and Michal were never dating and the whole thing was a lie. His mother decides that he needs to meet with their Rabbi. The Rabbi thinks that Motti needs to go to Israel for perhaps maybe there he will find a wife. In Tel Aviv, he meets a girl named Yael. They spend the entire day together at the beach. Yael brings Motti back to her place and Motti loses his virginity. The next morning Motti's mom calls. Motti tells his parents that he lost his virginity, to his mother's dismay. When Motti returns to Zurich, he goes on another date with Laura. Laura has a party and invites Motti. After a night of drinks, dancing, and drugs, Motti spends the night with Laura.

Once Laura leaves, his mother, enraged at her son's desire for a shiksa, disowns Motti and kicks him out of the house. Motti decides he will go live with Laura. But she tells him that while she likes Motti, she is not ready for that much commitment. Motti visits his dying insurance client, Frau Silberzweig. Her tarot cards had predicted an end to something and she wondered if it had happened. He explains \\"basically everything.\\" In which Frau Silberzweig tells him that that is good news. She explains that if everything is over, Motti now has space to experience everything. Motti leaves and receives a call from Laura. The scene ends with an overshot of Motti with the viewer left to wonder what happened in that call.

It documents demolished buildings in Houston as well as ones that were planned but never built. Craig Hlavaty of the Houston Chronicle wrote that the book \\"is indispensable for Houstonians who like to think about what was and what might have been.\\" The author argued that the loss of historic buildings in Houston harmed the formation of a community in Houston, and his goal is to promote preservation of historic buildings in Houston. James Wright wrote in Texas Books in Review that the book discusses \\"the social practices and political mechanisms\\" resulting in demolition of historic buildings. Background Strom, of Swedish ancestry and the holder of a master's degree in history, was a resident of Playa del Rey, California at the time of publication but grew up in Houston and had ancestors who lived in Houston. He was employed by the Houston Metropolitan Research Center of the Houston Public Library as an architectural archivist for a nine year period. The Journal of Southern History stated that in that capacity Strom \\"developed extraordinary expertise in Houston's built environment, especially civic and commercial structures.\\" At the time of publication he worked for The Aerospace Corporation. The author had previously published an article on historic buildings in Houston that had been razed and another article on concepts of buildings never built, also in Houston, published in the same magazine. These articles were the basis of this book. Lisa Gray of the Houston Chronicle asked Strom if not being resident in Houston at the time of writing the book complicated his research. He replied: \\"No. Those buildings, they're part of my fabric. They're in my head.\\" Contents The buildings that were planned but not constructed were covered in the book's second part. Wright compare dthe work to that of Barry Lopez. Reception Peter B. Dedek of San Marcos University stated that \\"Overall, Houston Lost and Unbuilt is an interesting, well researched, and valuable resource for anyone interested in Houston‚Äôs history and its lost architectural heritage.\\" Dedek believed that the coverage of projects never built \\"detracts\\" from the book's original purpose regarding the promotion of historical preservation.
