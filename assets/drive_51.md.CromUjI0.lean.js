Most notable of all his accomplishments, Culver is credited for solving a fatal flaw in the Lockheed P-38, which killed several pilots.

A. \\"Dick\\" Pulver was misdirected to Irv Culver who answered the phone with \\"Skonk Works, inside man Culver\\" and the name stuck. Another variant of the story relates that the original Skunk Works was located in a circus tent adjacent to the Lockheed plastics fabrication facility which smelled bad and reminded the engineers of the L'il Abner comic strip. Reportedly, Culver showed up for work wearing a civil defense gas mask as a gag and when he answered the phone he said \\"Skonk Works\\" referring to the cartoon. \\"Kelly overheard him and chewed out Irv for ridicule: \\"Culver, you're fired,\\" Johnson roared. \\"Get your ass out of my tent.\\" Culver showed up for work the next day and Johnson never said a word. Kelly Johnson referred to Culver as \\"a brilliant designer\\" in his autobiography Culver was interested in a variety of aircraft configurations and developed guidelines for laying out the twist distribution on tailless aircraft. He also helped to design an experimental helicopter, distinguished by a forward-sweeping blade, that was extremely easy to fly. In 1966, Culver, Thomas Hanson and Lance Hook were awarded a patent (US3261407) for a rigid rotor system which set world speed records for Lockheed helicopters and laid the foundation for aerobatic rotorcraft. It earned Culver the Dr. Alexander Klemin Award from the American Helicopter Society. In recent years, Culver was noted by Dan Armstrong, President of Experimental Soaring Association, for his work with Jim Maupin designing gliders intended to be built by craftsmen from plans.

The original route planned for the Worcester and Hereford Railway did not include the first tunnel, but its inclusion became necessary in response to pressure for the line to serve the towns of Malvern and Ledbury. The first Colwall Tunnel was one of the railway's greatest engineering challenges, after several years of work, it was opened to traffic on 17 September 1861. Its limited cross-section and single track configuration were often felt to be inadequate, contributing to pressure for a second tunnel to be constructed. A partial collapse of the first tunnel during 1907, temporarily blocking the railway, was another contributing factor. During the 1920s, work on the construction of a second tunnel commenced. Once this newer, wider bore was completed and brought into service on 2 August 1926, the original Colwall Tunnel was permanently closed that same day. It was used during the Second World War for storing munitions, being furnished with a concrete floor and a narrow-gauge railway. Only the newer bore remains in use as of the present day. It has been proposed to reopen the older bore as a cycle route. Colwall Old Tunnel The origins of the Colwall Tunnels are directly connected to the development of a railway between Worcester and Hereford, which was first mooted during the early 1850s. The original intended route for the railway was actually a much straighter route running directly between the coalfields of South Wales and the industries surrounding Birmingham and the Black Country, roughly parallel to the present day A4103. As a result of considerable lobbying by the citizens in the towns of Malvern and Ledbury, who sought the new line to serve their locations as well, it was decided to change the railway's route to include them; this new route necessitated construction of two tunnels (along with two viaducts and a bridge), one of the former being the first Colwall Tunnel. During 1856, work on constructing the Worcester and Hereford Railway commenced. The need to traverse the Malvern Hills represented the endeavour's largest engineering challenge; in addition to Colwall Tunnel, Ledbury Tunnel was also constructed for the line. Both tunnels share considerable similarities, such as a relatively narrow cross section and only able to accommodate a single track; trains were particularly constrained by the tunnel's dimensions. The completed bore has a maximum depth below the surface of roughly 600 ft; airflow in the tunnel is augmented by a pair of ventilation shafts. The tunnel had to be bored through relatively hard rock only using the manual methods available at the time. Local engineer Stephen Ballard was appointed to complete the work. Being bored by navvies from either end of the tunnel, work progressed at an average rate of ten feet per week. However, once the igneous Malvern rock (some of the hardest rock to be found in Great Britain) was reached, the rate of progress slowed to as little as 15 cm (six inches) per day. Further complications came in the form of spring waters, multiple pumps had to be installed to remove the water from the construction site; this water source was subsequently helpful, being used to refill the line's steam locomotives, as well as being piped to Great Malvern railway station. On 17 September 1861, the first Colwall Tunnel was opened to traffic. During 1907, the tunnel suffered a partial collapse around one of the ventilation shafts, resulting in the line being temporarily blocked until engineers could implement repairs to the tunnel. The problematic original bore was closed on 2 August 1926, having been replaced by a newer, wider bore that was opened to traffic that same day. During 1939, the disused tunnel was appropriated for military use as a munitions storage facility on behalf of the Admiralty. It was refurbished with ling and a concrete floor, and a narrow-gauge railway was laid along its length, enabling stores to be transported to either end of the bore. By July 1941, this new railway was operational; its locomotives were stored engine sheds built just outside either end of the tunnel. Shortly following the end of the Second World War, the facility was deemed to be surplus to requirements, thus the narrow-gauge railway was dismantled and it fell back into disuse once more. It was around this time that both of the tunnel mouths were sealed with steel sheeting to make them inaccessible. In the present day, the original bore forms a part of the Malvern Hills Site of Special Scientific Interest, and has been reportedly inhabited by a colony of about 700 hibernating lesser horseshoe bats, but otherwise disused and inaccessible. The Ledbury Area Cycle Forum has promoted a project to reopen the disused tunnel as a recreational and utility facility for cyclists and walkers. It is periodically inspected by engineers for safety purposes. Colwall New Tunnel By the 1920s, it was clear that the original Colwall Tunnel possessed several negative attributes, including being very narrow, relatively low and steep (it had a gradient of 1 in 80), all of which made it increasingly difficult to accommodate the emerging specification of rolling stock. Furthermore, locomotive crews complained about the tunnel's inhospitable conditions; there were cases of individuals passing out on the footplate due to the fumes. Accordingly, management decided that the best solution would be to construct a new, wider tunnel directly adjacent to the existing bore. Construction work commenced in 1924, it was completed only two years later, significantly faster than work had proceeded on the first tunnel. The greater speed of work was credited to the advance in tunnelling techniques and the availability of new pneumatically-powered tools. The new tunnel had a contract price of ¬£196,080. The second Colwall Tunnel was opened to traffic on 2 August 1926, while the old bore was closed on that same day. Like the original Colwall Tunnel, the new bore carries a single track throughout. There have been petitions and studies conducted for the whole line, including the tunnel, to be double-tracked throughout; it has been observed that any reengineering or replacement programme would incur considerable expense. Irrespective, the newer tunnel remains active to the present day.

The award-winning film explores the assassination of a human rights activist in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the subsequent trial. Synopsis Floribert Chebeya was a human rights activist who had survived Mobutu Sese Seko's dictatorship and the subsequent civil war. On 2 June 2010, his body was found in a car near the capital, Kinshasa. The police quickly painted a scenario that made Chebeya the routine victim of a crime with sexual connotations. However, this version of the events broke down after an investigation in which the police were implicated. The government agreed to bring some of the highest police officials to justice in a military court, handing out stiff sentences to those found guilty and awarding compensation to the victims. The film exposes the rough edges of Chebeya's character. He was a tenacious, insensitive and annoying man, with an inflated view of his role as defender of human rights, sometimes willing to make strange alliances to achieve his goals. The film covers more than just the police case, but provides a survey of life in a country that is between dictatorship and democracy, between opacity and justice. A recurring theme is the failure of the police chief, General John Numbi, to appear and offer an explanation. Production Thierry Michel directed his first documentary on the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1992 with Za√Øre, le cycle du serpent. Since then he has released a series of other films covering different aspects of life and politics in the country. Taken together his films provide a unique overview of the social, economic and political life of the country. He flew to Kinshasa as soon as he heard of the death of Chebeya, whom he had known for many years, to film the trial. This was the largest public trial there for over a decade, and the authorities were under strong pressure from the United States and Europe to ensure that justice was done. Speaking of the film in an interview, the director said the trial did provide some degree of justice, if imperfect, but noted that the country may be sliding backwards in terms of protection of human rights. Reception Le Monde noted that because the analysis is subtle, the documentary is probably only accessible to those who already known something of the Congo. Another reviewer said Thierry Michel had perpetuated the memory of Chebeya and given him the stature he deserves, that of a modest hero, ruthlessly efficient, a man whose name is written in the pantheon of heroes of the Congo. The film won the Grand Prize at the International Film Festival of Human Rights in Paris in March 2012. The film received a Magritte Award nomination in the category of Best Documentary in 2013.

The primary purpose of the trading post was to supply slaves for the plantation colonies in the Americas. Dutch involvement on the Slave Coast started with the establishment of a trading post in Offra in 1660. Later, trade shifted to Ouidah, where the English and French also had a trading post. Political unrest caused the Dutch to abandon their trading post at Ouidah in 1725, now moving to Jaquim, at which place they built Fort Zeelandia. By 1760, the Dutch had abandoned their last trading post in the region. The Slave Coast was settled from the Dutch Gold Coast, on which the Dutch were based in Elmina. During its existence, the Slave Coast held a close relationship to that colony. History Prospect of the European factories at the Royal Palace of Savi. Included are the Portuguese, English, French and Dutch factories. The Dutch factory is at the bottom right. According to various sources, the Dutch West India Company began sending servants regularly to the Ajaland capital of Allada from 1640 onward. The Dutch had in the decades before begun to take an interest in the Atlantic slave trade due to their capture of northern Brazil from the Portuguese. Willem Bosman writes in his Nauwkeurige beschrijving van de Guinese Goud- Tand- en Slavekust (1703) that Allada was also called Grand Ardra, being the larger cousin of Little Ardra, also known as Offra. From 1660 onward, Dutch presence in Allada and especially Offra became more permanent. A report from this year asserts Dutch trading posts, apart from Allada and Offra, in Benin City, Grand-Popo, and Savi. The Offra trading post soon became the most important Dutch office on the Slave Coast. According to a 1670 report, annually 2,500 to 3,000 slaves were transported from Offra to the Americas and writing of the 1690s, Bosman commented of the trade at Fida, \\"markets of men are here kept in the same manner as those of beasts are with us.\\" Numbers of slaves declined in times of conflict. From 1688 onward, the struggle between the Aja king of Allada and the peoples on the coastal regions, impeded the supply of slaves. The Dutch West India Company chose the side of the Aja king, causing the Offra office to be destroyed by opposing forces in 1692. After this debacle, Dutch involvement on the Slave Coast came more or less to a halt. During his second voyage to Benin, David van Nyendael visited the king of Benin in Benin City. His detailed description of this journey was included as an appendix to Willem Bosman's Nauwkeurige beschrijving van de Guinese Goud- Tand- en Slavekust (1703). His description of the kingdom remains valuable as one of the earliest detailed descriptions of Benin. On the instigation of Governor-General of the Dutch Gold Coast Willem de la Palma, Jacob van den Broucke was sent in 1703 as \\"opperkommies\\" (head merchant) to the Dutch trading post at Ouidah, which according to sources was established around 1670., section 3.c.2. Ouidah was also the place where English and French traded slaves, making this place the likely candidate for the new main trading post on the Slave Coast. Political unrest was also the reason for the Ouidah office to close in 1725. The company this time moved their headquarters to Jaquim, situated more easterly. The head of the post, Hendrik Hertog, had a reputation for being a successful slave trader. In an attempt to extend his trading area, Hertog negotiated with local tribes and mingled in local political struggles. He sided with the wrong party, however, leading to a conflict with Director-General Jan Pranger and to his exile to the island of Appa in 1732. The Dutch trading post on this island was extended as the new centre of slave trade. In 1733, Hertog returned to Jaquim, this time extending the trading post into Fort Zeelandia. The revival of slave trade at Jaquim was only temporary, however, as his superiors at the Dutch West India Company noticed that Hertog's slaves were more expensive than at the Gold Coast. From 1735, Elmina became the preferred spot to trade slaves. Trading posts { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" ! Place in West Africa ! Est. ! Disest. ! Comments ---  Offra (Pla, Cleen Ardra, Klein Ardra, Offra)  1660  1691  As the original head trading post at the Dutch Slave Coast, Offra was established in 1660. According to a 1670 report, 2,500 to 3,000 slaves were transported annually from Offra. Due to the Dutch siding with the Aja in the local political struggles, the fort was destroyed in 1692. ---  Allada (Ardra, Ardres, Arder, Allada, Harder)  1660  ?  According to sources, the Dutch West India Company began sending servants to Allada, the capital of Ajaland, already in 1640. In some sources, Allada is referred to as \\"Grand Ardra\\", to contrast it with \\"Little Ardra\\", which is another name for Offra. ---  Benin City  1660  1740  In contemporary Nigeria. ---  Grand Popo  1660  ?  ---  Savi (Sabee, Xavier, Savy, Sav√©, Sabi, Xabier)  1660  ?  In the beginning of the 18th century, the Dutch had a small trading post in Savi (capital of the Kingdom of Whydah), next to the Royal Palace. Compared to the English and French trading posts, the Dutch post was rather minimalistic in nature. ---  Ouidah (Fida, Whydah, Juda, Hueda, Whidah)  1670  1725  Ouidah was the centre of slave trade for the French and English on the Slave Coast. In 1703, Governor-General of the Gold Coast Willem de la Palma sent Jacob van den Broucke as \\"head merchant\\" to Ouidah in 1703. Abandoned in 1725, in favour of the post at Jaquim, due to political unrest at the Slave Coast. ---  Agathon (Aggathon, Agotton)  1717  ?  The trading post at Agathon, in contemporary Nigeria, was situated on a hill on the banks of the Benin River (also: Rio Formoso). Agathon was an important post for the trade in clothes, especially the so-called \\"Benijnse panen\\". In 1718-1719, the post produced 31,092 pounds of ivory. ---  Jaquim (Jaquin, Jakri, Godomey, Jakin)  1726  1734  One of the most successful post at the slave coast. Became the head post after Ouidah was abandoned in 1725. In 1733 Fort Zeelandia was built here, but two years later, the directors of the Dutch West India Company decided to shift the slave trade to Elmina Castle, where slaves were cheaper. ---  An√©ho (Petit Popo, Little Popo, Klein Popo, Popou)  1731  1760  Little Popo, also known as An√©ho, was the most westerly post on the Slave Coast. Due to this, the post suffered from competition of the Danish Africa Company, based at the Danish Gold Coast. ---  Appa 1  1732  1736?  The island of Appa lies to the east of Offra. To this island, Hendrik Hertog, the merchant at Jaquim, fled in 1732 when he sided with the defeated party in a local conflict. On this island, a new trading post was founded, which was supposed to replace Jaquim. Appa and rebuilt Jaquim, now known as Fort Zeelandia, became a prominent centre of slave trade for some time, until 1735, when the Dutch West India Company decided to shift slave supply to Elmina on the Gold Coast. Hertog fled to Pattackerie in 1738, fearing that Appa would be attacked by local tribes as well. ---  Appa 2 (Epe, Ekpe)  1732  1755?  Appa 2 is the name used in some literature to refer to the trading post Hendrik Hertog fled to from the island of Appa, east of Offra. He named the new post Appa as well, but this post was situated near Pattackerie (contemporary Badagri). ---  Badagri (Pattackerie)  1737  1748  Referred to on the Atlas of Mutual Heritage as a separate trading post distinct from \\"Appa 2\\", also located at Badagri. It is unsure whether there were two separate trading posts in reality, or that the posts are one and the same. ---  Meidorp (Meiborg)  ?  ?  Meidorp was situated at the River Benin (also: Rio Formoso). It was a simple lodge, named by Dutch traders. It was abandoned after the last merchant named Beelsnijder turned the local population against him, due to his tactless approach towards them. } Notes References  External links  * Category:History of Benin Category:Former colonies in Africa Slave Coast, Dutch Category:African slave trade Category:Dutch colonisation in Africa Category:Dutch West India Company Category:17th century in Africa Category:18th century in Africa Category:States and territories established in 1660 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1760 Category:1660 establishments in Africa Category:1760 disestablishments in Africa Category:1660 establishments in the Dutch Empire Category:1760 disestablishments in the Dutch Empire Category:Historical regions ","title":"Dutch Slave Coast"},{"id":"35367135","text":"ISO/IEC 10116 Information technology ‚Äî Security techniques ‚Äî Modes of operation for an n-bit block cipherISO/IEC 10116:2006 Information technology ‚Äî Security techniques ‚Äî Modes of operation for an n-bit block cipher is an international standard that specifies modes of operation for block ciphers of any length.

Among other factors, poverty is a contributing factor together with, a low level of development, and huge social and economic disadvantages. For example , according to government statistics, the unemployment rate reached 28.1% in 2014; in 2008, it was 51.2%. Crimes reported in Namibia amounted to 96,200 in the financial year March 2008‚ÄìFebruary 2009, in 2009/10 to 98,671, and in 2010/11 to 90,675. More than two fifths of all stated crimes occur in the capital Windhoek, where the majority of reported crimes are burglaries, robberies, and assaults. According to a US State Department report in 2015, the most common type of crime in Windhoek, Namibia's capital, is petty street crime, with most incidents occurring after dark, and criminals using knives and occasionally firearms. Organised crime across all of Southern Africa probably only developed in the 1980s. While the thousands of kilometers of unsecured borders are often believed to be responsible for enabling cross-border crime, \\"research has shown that criminals prefer legal border points\\". Organised crime in Namibia is active mainly in the transporting of drugs and the hiring of drug mules, as well in laundering of money through investments in real estate and luxury assets. Types of crime =Crimes against the person= Serial killings Namibia has experienced at least one serial killings event when between 2005 and 2007 the B1 Butcher killed and dismembered five women and deposited body parts along Namibia's National Road B1. The identity of the B1 Butcher was never conclusively determined. Violence Namibia has a high rate of domestic violence, particularly against women and children. Rape and murder cases are frequent. The number of rape cases reported annually was estimated to be between 700 and 1,600 in 2010, and domestic violence is primarily done by men against women. A report on the period from 2012 to 2015 counted roughly 40,000 assault cases, 2 839 rape cases, 1 138 attempted murders and 734 murders while pointing out that a large number of cases remain unreported. A census in 2011 showed that the Namibian population was 2 113 077, and the UN Drugs and Organised Crime Office counted the number of murders in 2012 at 388 or 17.2 people per 100,000. This is relatively high compared to other African countries; for comparison, Guinea-Bissau had 140 murders or 8.4 per 100,000 people according to UN survey data. There are a number of non- profit organisations to counter gender-based violence but the problem is perceived to become worse. Former President Hifikepunye Pohamba suggested in 2014 that 6 March should become a national prayer day, a measure that has received criticism for undermining the secular organisation of the state. Infanticide There are a number of cases every year where newborn babies are dumped in river beds, in rubbish-bins and in dams. According to the report published by the parliamentary standing committee on human resources, social and community development, from 2003 to 2007, baby dumping rose from 6 to 23 cases per year, a 283 percent rise. Most of these cases of concealment of birth go unreported; Windhoek Water Works alone reported in 2008 that they discover 13 dead newborns in their waste water system per month. According to Sister Namibia, a feminist magazine published in the country since its independence, Namibian abortion laws are restrictive, and illegal backstreet abortions are also a growing concern in the country. =Property crimes= Money laundering Money laundering is legislated by the Financial Intelligence Act and controlled by the Financial Intelligence Centre. The Centre reported a significant increase in suspicious transactions in 2011, but already in 2003 the United Nations described the situation as \\"critical\\". Stock theft Stock theft is a prevalent crime in Namibia and carries hefty penalties. After a 2004 law amendment to the Stock Theft Act, stealing livestock over the value of 500N$ results in a 20-year (repeat offenders: 30 year) mandatory prison sentence. This clause has in 2011 been declared unconstitutional, but several people were sentenced until then.

It was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1919,Henry Boot & Sons (London) Prospectus, 1919. becoming the first ever quoted housebuilder. Between the wars, Henry Boot built more houses (public and private) than any other company.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. , History Henry Boot (1851-1931) was born a farmer‚Äôs son in the small village of Heeley just outside Sheffield.Ron Baines: The Boot Family (1998) Henry served a seven-year apprenticeship and worked a total of 20 years with local building firms before he began to work on his own account in 1886. The new business rapidly progressed from jobbing work to larger scale public contracts and housing projects. Henry‚Äôs eldest son Charles Boot (1874-1945) joined the business after leaving school (presumably not long after the business started) and it was he who transformed Henry Boot & Sons into one of the most successful construction and housing businesses between the wars. Henry had retired before the outbreak of World War I leaving Charles as managing director. As with so many construction business, war expanded the range of contracts: Henry Boot & Sons built a British Army camp at Catterick in Yorkshire; RAF Manston Aerodrome near Ramsgate; the Calshot Naval Air Station at Calshot in Hampshire; Tees Naval Base; a U.S. Army Rest Camp and hospital at Southampton and Chepstow Military Hospital. The company also constructed over one thousand military buildings and over 50 miles of roads and sewers. Charles Boot was keenly interested in housing and as soon as hostilities ended he began what was to be a major housebuilding programme ‚Äì both public and private. The Company was floated at the end of 1919 to raise ¬£300,000 of new capital to finance these plans. The Prospectus showed the Company operating out of London and Birmingham as well as Sheffield, and it recorded that \\"Provisional arrangements have been made to proceed at once with several large housing contracts involving the building of some thousands of houses\\". In the 1920s, housing was primarily undertaken for local authorities; at the end of the decade Company accounts stated that some 20,000 houses had been built for local authorities. In the 1930s the emphasis swung to private development and Henry Boot became a substantial developer of housing estates, both for sale and rent. In 1933 First National Trust was formed specifically to develop and administer estates to be let at low rents. At the beginning of 1935, the Company raised a further ¬£400,000 of preference capital to finance expansion. The Prospectus stated that the Company had built around 30,000 houses since 1920.Henry Boot & Sons Prospectus, 1935 There is some uncertainty as to how many houses were built during the inter-war period. The Company's \`Brief History\` mentions 80,000 but Charles Boot himself referred on separate occasions to lower figures. In 1943 ‚ÄúI have been engaged in building for over fifty years, and my concerns have‚Ä¶ built over 60,000 houses;Charles Boot Houses Built by Private Enterprise 1943 and in 1944 \\"as a builder of over fifty thousand houses\\"Charles Boot Post-war Houses June 1944 The 60,000 figure is thought to be the most appropriate. The homes became known as Boot houses; many of them were suffering from carbonatation by the 1980s. The Company‚Äôs massive housebuilding programme was not to the exclusion of the traditional general construction business. A Paris office was opened immediately after the end of World War I and Boot was engaged in the reconstruction of war-damaged towns. In 1920, offices were opened in Athens and Barcelona. One of the largest contracts of its time was a ¬£10m Greek irrigation contract, awarded in 1927; however, the 1935 Minute Book recorded that ledgers had not been received from Greece and the contract was not finished until 1952. The wide range of construction projects carried out by Boot at home and in Europe included harbours, railways, roads, schools and hospitals but the scheme for which Boot is best known is Pinewood Studios were work started in 1935. World War II saw the cessation of housing construction and resources were concentrated on wartime requirements. 1939 had already seen the start of work for all three services and Boot's war effort included aerodromes, ordnance factories and hospital camps. Boot was also one of the major contractors engaged in the construction of Mulberry harbour units. Charles Boot died in 1945 and the Company never again became the force it had been between the Wars. In particular, housing output remained well below its pre-war levels as management lay in the control of family members more interested in construction: throughout the 1960s Boot averaged no more than 200 houses a year. However, one feature that was unique to Boot was that in 1965 it formed its own building society ‚Äì The Banner Building Society (Boot had moved its head office to Banner Cross Hall in Sheffield in 1932). Many of the houses that had been built by Boot in the 1930s had been financed with mortgages created by Boot itself and Boot transferred these mortgages into Banner; public deposits were gradually taken into Banner enabling Boot to remove progressively its own capital. This structure was not popular with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and Banner was eventually sold to Midshires Building Society in 1982. The 1970s saw Henry Boot strengthen its railway engineering business and significantly increase it overseas work. The Company supplied all the trackwork for the Mass Transit Railway in Hong Kong; there were further contracts for the Kowloon-Canton Railway and in Singapore. However, in 1985, the group lost ¬£7m. primarily in overseas construction and in the following year Jamie Boot (the grandson of Charles‚Äô younger brother Edward) was appointed managing director. The emphasis of the group was changed: the traditional railway engineering business was sold in 1988 and private housing development gradually increased ‚Äì sales had risen to 700 a year by 2001. Two years later, the company cited competing cash demands from the property and plant divisions and the housing division was put up for sale: it was sold to Wilson Bowden for ¬£48m. Today property investment and development, land development and construction are described as the group‚Äôs lead activities. Operations The Group is organised into the following divisions: * Henry Boot Developments operates in the UK property development market. * Hallam Land Management is the strategic land and planning promotion arm of the business. * Henry Boot Construction serving both public and private clients in all construction sectors. * Banner Plant Limited is a plant hire company. * Stonebridge Homes Limited is a jointly owned housing business operating in the north of England. * Road Link (A69) Limited operates a 30 year contract with the Highways Agency to maintain the A69 trunk road.

The name originated from the Punic-Roman town of Melite (ŒúŒµŒªŒØœÑŒ∑, Melite in Ancient Greek), the ancient capital of Malta which eventually developed into the city of Mdina. The symbolic depiction of a country as a woman called by the Latin name of that country was common in the 19th century (such as Britannia, Germania, Hibernia and Helvetia). Description and origins Ceiling fresco at Auberge de Provence by Nicolau Nasoni, depicting a personification of \\"Religion\\" which bears similarities with later depictions of Melita The earliest known personification of Malta dates back to 1481. This depicts a woman holding a sceptre in one hand and the emblem of Malta in the other, and it was produced for the choir of the Mdina cathedral. The personification of Melita is often depicted as a female wearing military attire, prominently displaying the Maltese cross. This is said to represent Malta's strategic importance in a military and maritime context, while also reflecting the islands' Catholic traditions. This iconography is inspired by that of the Roman goddess Minerva and the allegory of fortitude in a Christian context. It also bears similarities to depictions of Britannia. This depiction is said to have originally represented the Order of St John, which ruled Malta between the 16th and 18th centuries. An example of an allegorical painting which bears similarities to later depictions of Melita is an 18th-century fresco at Auberge de Provence by Nicolau Nasoni. The painting depicts a female figure wearing armour with a Maltese cross and holding a sword and shield, and it is said to represent the \\"Religion\\", a common nickname for the Order. After the Order's expulsion from Malta in 1798, the personification came to represent Malta itself due to the strong links between the islands' identity and the Order. In the first half of the 20th century, a woman wearing an gƒßonnella was sometimes used as an alternative personification of Malta distinct from Melita. Depiction on stamps and currency The 1899 Melita stamp =Stamps= Melita has been portrayed a number of times on Maltese postage or revenue stamps. The allegorical figure first appeared on a 2s/6d olive-grey stamp in 1899, where she was depicted holding a sword and a shield, the latter emblazoned with the Maltese cross. In the background were the flags of Malta and of the Order of St John. The designer of this stamp is not known, and it remained in use until the early 1920s, being reissued with a different watermark in 1919. Special printings of the 1899 design, sometimes in new colours or watermarks, were also issued with overprints for revenue purposes between 1902 and 1908. Between 1922 and 1926, a series of dual-purpose postage and revenue stamps known as the Melita issue was issued to commemorate Malta's self-government. The stamps had two designs: one by Edward Caruana Dingli and the other by Gianni Vella. Caruana Dingli's design, which was used for the pence and pound values, depicts Melita as a robed and helmeted figure holding a rudder, representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny, while Vella's design shows Melita embracing Britannia, representing the link between Britain and Malta as sisters or mother and daughter. =Currency= A depiction of Melita based on Caruana Dingli's design appeared on the fifth series of Maltese lira banknotes which were in use from 1989 until Malta adopted the euro in 2008. The watermark on these and previous banknotes also shows the head of the allegorical figure Melita. The allegorical figure also appears on the Melita bullion coins minted since 2018.

His wife Jane Marcet was a prolific author, whose series of books entitled 'Conversations' treated topics such as chemistry, botany, religion and economics. Biography Marcet was born at Geneva, and received his school education there. In 1794 he went to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with an MD on 24 June 1797. He wrote a thesis on diabetes, printed at Edinburgh in the same year. He then took a house in London, worked as assistant physician at Cary Street Dispensary, and was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1799. He then became a physician at Finsbury Dispensary, and at Guy's Hospital on 18 April 1804. He lectured there on chemistry between 1805 and 1819. Marcet took charge of the temporary military hospital at Portsmouth in 1809 for some months, when it contained invalids from Walcheren. He had married Jane Haldimand (see Jane Marcet), lived in Russell Square, and, as he grew wealthier, grew less and less inclined for medical practice. He retired from the staff of Guy's Hospital, 10 March 1819, and went to live in Geneva, where he was appointed honorary professor of chemistry. He visited England in 1821, and died in Great Coram Street, London, 19 October 1822. His grandson was William Marcet, FRS. Works In 1805, Marcet contributed an essay, A Chemical Account of the Brighton Chalybeate, to a new edition of the Treatise on Mineral Waters of his colleague, Dr William Saunders. This was also published in the same year as a pamphlet. He describes a variety of experiments of the rudimentary chemistry of that period made with the water of a chalybeate spring called the Wick, and shows that, unlike the Tonbridge spa, it might be drunk warm without any precipitation of iron. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1815, and published some chemical papers in the Philosophical Transactions. He published in 1817 An Essay on the Chemical History and Medical Treatment of Calculous Disorders. He complains that he was unable to give full statistics, as no major London hospital then kept any regular record of cases.

There existed two versions of her story, which are as follows. According to Plutarch (who follows the Naxian authors) and Polyaenus, Polycrite was taken captive by Diognetus as he ravaged Naxos; he fell in love with Polycrite and made her his legal wife. As the Milesian army was celebrating a religious festival, Polycrite asked Diognetus if she could send some bakery to her brothers in the besieged city. He permitted and even encouraged her to do so; she then enclosed a tablet with a note in a loaf of bread, instructing her brothers to take advantage of the fact that the Milesians were going to get drunk during the celebrations, and to attack at night. The brothers in turn delivered the message to the Naxian generals, who followed the advice of Polycrite and thus won a victory over the Milesians. Polycrite asked for mercy on Diognetus, saving him and his possessions. As the citizens welcomed her at the gate of the city, she was so overwhelmed with joy that she could not bear it and fell down dead. She was buried on the spot, and her tomb became known as the \\"Tomb of Envy\\", as though Fate became envious of her and would not let her enjoy the honors.Plutarch, On the Virtues of Women, 17Polyaenus, Stratagems of War, 8. 36 In another version, which was recorded by Parthenius of Nicaea and, according to Plutarch's remark, was also followed by Aristotle, Polycrite had been accidentally left at a temple of Artemis outside the city when the city itself was blockaded by the Milesians. There she was spotted by Diognetus who became enamoured of her. Out of piety he dared not take her by force in the temple and thus sent messages asking her to become his lover. At first she would reject those but then responded that she would consent on condition that he swear by the name of Artemis to fulfill any wish of hers in return. When he did so, she told him to betray his Milesian allies and support the Naxians instead. He was hesitant at first but then, impressed by the girl's patriotism, agreed. In the meantime, the Milesian army was celebrating the Thargelia, which was going to be a distraction. Diognetus and Polycrite decided to make use of this and sent a loaf of bread to Polycrite's brothers in the city; in the loaf was put a tablet with instructions for them. When Polycles, a brother of Polycrite, received the message, he was unsure whether they could trust Diognetus, but eventually a decision was made in favor of action. The following night, the Naxians broke through the blockading wall with assistance of Diognetus who held up a signal light and left a gate open for them. In the battle that ensued, the Naxians were victorious but Diognetus was killed. Polycrite was much honored for saving her home city, and the people brought her so many gifts that she was suffocated under their weight and died. Her and Diognetus' bodies were placed on one and the same funeral pyre, and a hundred sheep were sacrificed at her funeral ceremony.Parthenius, Love Romances, 9 (with reference to Andriscus' Naxiaca and Theophrastus' Political History) References Category:Women in ancient Greek warfare ","title":"Polycrite"},{"id":"35367766","text":"Ch√¢teau de Talmont is a medieval castle in the Talmont-Saint-Hilaire commune in the Vend√©e department in the Pays de la Loire region of western France.

He was a zealous Protestant and opponent of the court and appears to have lost his reason. Malet was the son of Sir Thomas Malet of Poyntington. He was a student of Middle Temple in 1650 and was called to the bar in 1655. He became a member of the Rota Club in 1659. In 1660, he was elected Member of Parliament for Milborne Port in the Convention Parliament. He was a J.P. for Somerset from July 1660 to 1670 and a commissioner for maimed soldiers from December 1660 to 1661. In 1661 he was re-elected MP for Milbourne Port in the Cavalier Parliament. He was commissioner for assessment for Somerset from 1661 to 1669 and for Berkshire from 1664 to 1667. In 1675 he became a bencher of Middle Temple. He was commissioner for assessment for Westminster from 1677 to 1679. History of Parliament Online - Michael Malet Malet was an extreme Protestant opposed to the High Church as well as Roman Catholics. He was also an outspoken enemy of the Court and apparently became increasingly insane. It was said of him when Samuel Pepys introduced the naval programme \\"Michael Malet, who, to make good the M‚Äôs in his name, is many times mightily mad, without a metaphor or a trope, said he knew no need we had of ships in time of peace, unless it were to carry away the Italian women again, meaning the duchess of York.\\" Later it was reported that he \\"came to the Queen‚Äôs drawing room to show he can be as mad elsewhere as in the Parliament House, and there bawled out aloud to his royal highness, quite across the circle when the room was full, ‚ÄòMonsieur le Duc, il faut laisser l‚Äôidolatrie, il faut faire Dieu votre ami; il vous servira mieux que le roi de France, ce que je maintiendrai‚Äô; which he was so pleased with that he said it over twice; and afterwards, being persuaded out of the Queen's presence, uttered twenty other follies in the privy chamber\\". His final disgrace came at a by-election in Berkshire in July 1678 when \\"poor, maggot-headed Mr Malet\\" uttered some words ... which were said to \\"reflect very greatly upon his Majesty‚Äôs honour\\" and he was sent to the Tower. He was never brought to trial and was last recorded alive in 1683. Malet married Mary Aldworth, widow of John Aldworth of Letcombe Regis, Berkshire and daughter of Thomas White of Fyfield Berkshire by 1664. They had at least three sons. He was the brother of John Malet.

The 15-minute short film was directed by Philippe Baylaucq as part of his two-year residency at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in Montreal. Ora was choreographed by Jos√© Navas, who had previously worked with Baylaucq on the NFB experimental dance film, Lodela. The film is inspired by Darwin's theory of evolution and the myths of Narcissus and Prometheus. Production Baylaucq had experimented with standard-definition thermal imaging cameras, but wasn't satisfied with the results. Commercially available thermography produces brightly coloured images, while Baylaucq wanted high-definition cameras that could shoot in black and white, so images could be colourized afterwards. The director learned of an engineer based in California, Arn Adams, who had developed an HD thermographic system for the company Focalplane, owned by Lockheed Martin. This technology is used by the United States military for night vision and military operations, as well as for scientific and medical applications, but was never used to film dance until Ora. While Baylaucq had \\"certain misgivings\\" about using military technology for his film, he secured permission from Lockheed Martin and the U.S. military as well as Canadian dance, production and directors unions to shoot the film in the United States, as this technology was not allowed to leave the country. Production took place in an unheated warehouse in Vermont, close to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, with floor-to-ceiling sets made of heat-reflecting aluminum panels, which were constructed and shipped by truck from Montreal. Cameras had to be cooled by liquid nitrogen so they wouldn‚Äôt generate a heat signature themselves. They were also computer-dependent and could only record 2.5 minutes of footage before data needed to be downloaded, which also meant that dancers, wearing little in the cold building, had to stop every two minutes. The six dancers also had to perform without lighting or music. Ora is also the first NFB film recorded in 7.1 surround sound. The film was shot in 3D as well as 2D, for wider distribution in areas of the world where 3D cinemas are not as popular. The NFB executive producer of Ora is Ren√© Ch√©nier. Release The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival in the Short Cuts Canada section before being screened at the Festival du nouveau cinema with Wim Wenders‚Äô 3-D dance film Pina. In December 2011, it was shown with Pina in Quebec cinemas. In March 2012, Ora received the international short documentary audience award at the Thessaloniki Documentary Festival.

He has come to be regarded as the original tomb raider, or grave robber, opening up graves and tombs and removing remains and artefacts against the wishes of those laying claim to them. Count Byron De Prorok was educated at the University of Geneva. He worked on the excavations at Carthage from 1920 to 1925 and held the Archaeological Institute of America's prestigious Norton Lectureship in 1922‚Äì1923.Rose, Mark, Tales of the Count: Adventures in Showmanship\\" in Archaeology, Volume 54, Number 5, (September/October 2001), Online. During the later 1920s and early 1930s, Prorok undertook a series of expeditions in Africa of dubious scientific value, pursuing ancient legends and eventually came to believe he had found evidence that proved Atlantis lay in North Africa, the true location of the fabled Biblical land of Ophir and what he supposed were the ruins of an ancient temple where Alexander the Great \\"became a god\\". In addition to these tremendous 'discoveries' he also claimed to be a member of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, the Royal Archaeological Institute and The Royal Geographical Society. His numerous critics say that this \\"count\\" Byron de Prorok was neither a real count nor an archaeologist, was expelled from The Royal Geographical Society (allegedly in 1932), who had \\"a vivid imagination\\" and \\"was given to gross exaggeration\\". He was, however, an active member of the Adventurers' Club of New York. Regardless of his archaeological faults, De Prorok was a pioneer in using motion pictures, which he did first in 1920. However, none of his films survive. His published works include Digging for Lost African Gods (1926), Mysterious Sahara: The Land of Gold, of Sand and of Ruin (1929), Dead Men Do Tell Tales (1933) and In Quest of Lost Worlds (1935).  Exploration of the Hoggar Mountains and discovery of the tomb of Tin Hinan, 1925  De Prorok is most remarkable for his excavation in 1925 of the Tin Hinan Tomb, the monumental grave belonging to the 4th-century BC Tuareg matriarch Tin Hinan, whose remains he uncovered and controversially extracted. From a Tuareg point of view, Prorok was a graverobber who desecrated the tomb of a revered ancestor. The expedition into the Sahara included Maurice Reygasse, Alonzo W. Pond of Beloit College, W. Bradley Tyrrell, big game hunter, of Chicago, Mr. Denny of The New York Times, a motion picture operator, an interpreter, two native guides and a native chef. Alonzo Pond is said to have found Prorok \\"difficult\\". The expedition was launched from Algiers in October 1925 and using motor vehicles for transport headed south towards the Hoggar Mountains. > We hoped to find something in the Sahara which would throw a useful light > not only upon the commerce of the ancient cities of the coast but also, > perhaps, upon the very origin of man and the beginnings of Libyo-Phoenician > civilisation where we were told, on authority that is not so assured as it > perhaps might be, that there are buried cities and strange races. It is a > land of myth and mystery.. Text from . Prorok was particularly excited about discovering lost people deep in the Sahara in quest that echoes past searches for Prester John. He hoped to encounter inhabitants of the Hoggar Mountains who were, he had come to believe, \\"a mysterious people, tall, straight and slender, who regard themselves as the greatest of all races with similarity to the Egyptians as represented on the ancient tombs of the Pharaohs.\\" In October 1925 the expedition arrived in Touggourt and entered the Sahara at El Kantara and \\"from here we began the long plunge of a thousand miles of desert to the Hoggar, in whose valleys are white people of magnificent physique and classic features, whose origin is a mystery, and on which they themselves have steadfastly refused to give any information.\\" Prorok writes much about the Tuareg people whom he describes as \\"a strange people\\" whose \\"impetuosity in attack has made them dreaded throughout the Sahara\\". At Ouargla the expedition halted to view ancient ruins and got lost in the desert. Prorok was particularly grateful to the assistance the expedition received from French soldiers based at the oasis, commenting in his particular style, \\"Ouargla itself must stand as the monument to the French administration who are doing a work in the Sahara as stupendous as anything ever attempted by the Romans in Africa.\\" Taking leads from the soldiers the expedition visited Gara Krima which was \\"an old stronghold of the pirates of the Sahara from whence they scanned the desert, sweeping down whenever a caravan was signalled, and raiding the country far and wide.\\" The expedition then left Ouargla but soon broke down in the sand (and having to be rescued by French soldiers again) before eventually arriving at the desert Oasis of In Salah. From here they travelled \\"beyond civilisation\\" to Tamanrasset where they received the dramatic news that they had narrowly missed \\"five hundred rebel raiders moving on the Hoggar from southern Morocco; the strongest armed force loose in the desert since the war.\\" In Tamanrasset they were received by \\"all the Tuareg chiefs of the vicinity headed by Amenokal Akhamouk, the king of all the Hoggar...and the French forces, headed by Commandant Count Beaumont\\" and it was here the expedition divided with Pond, Reygasse and \\"King\\" Amenokal heading north to further study Tuareg culture. Prorok accompanied by a body of twenty Tuaregs went in search of \\"a vast pyramidical mound located in the southern stretch of the range, among peaks seven thousand feet high\\" which he believed was the lost tomb of the \\"Mother of all the Tuaregs\\", Tin Hinan. On 18 October 1925, Byron Khun de Prorok and his team located the fabled tomb in the oasis village of Abalessa. Of this discovery de Prorok says, \\"The finding of the Tomb took several days, for the Tuaregs were suspicious of our intent. The negroes, however, on being asked where was the great tomb answered by a pointing of the hand in the direction south. This was the way we found the location of the vast mound.\\" > On the north side, the principal tomb had suffered the least damage and it > was possible to recognize the skilled craftsmanship of the builders. This > wall, relatively intact, rose some twenty to twenty-five feet from the base, > but what was the type of the superstructure, or how much higher it carried, > it is not possible to say, for the roof had at some time caved in, and the > whole area was littered by a great mass of loose rocks, hewn boulders, and > sand. The outer walls of the tomb must have covered an area of sixty by > ninety feet, and later we discovered that the walls themselves were about > three feet thick at the highest remaining point. The walls of the smaller > tombs were from eighteen inches to two feet thick. During the excavation of the tomb that followed a thunderstorm is alleged to have occurred which caused \\"great terror among the natives\\". Work continued with new diggers and at last the condition of the grave of Tin Hinan was revealed and described by de Prorok, thus; > Whoever the personage was, whether Tin Hinan or one of her peers, she had > been given the utmost honour in her death. Her jewelry was indicative of her > rank, and in the antechamber of her tomb lay her clothing neatly piled, and > ready for her use beyond the shadows. Here were garments of leather, painted > red and yellow, as well as clothing of cotton and other fabrics, in various > colours, ornamented by intricate fringes. No weapons were found, but food > for her journey was by her, dates dried to the thinnest film of skin on the > stone, and a store of what looked to have been grapes, together with jars of > grain. Despite protests from both Tuareg and \\"negro\\" tribes the expedition removed all the bones and treasures and took them back to the Ethnographical Museum in Algiers, where they remain on display.  Journey from Egypt to Abyssinia and the search for King Solomon's Mines, c.1925‚Äì33  Prorok's next 'adventures' were published in Dead Men Do Tell Tales (1933) and were sensationally detailed in Modern Mechanix Magazine in 1936 describing the author's \\"fifteen year search\\" for the fabled mines of King Solomon in Ethiopia during the period preceding the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. This book has been described as falling short of political correctness in either the archaeological or ethical senses of the word and is a trip back into the mind of a professional freelance-archaeologist in the early 20th century. A fine example of some of the typical havoc and destruction Prorok caused is recorded in Dead Men Do Tell Tales, wherein he relates how he fell into a catacomb while working on an ancient Egyptian tomb, \\"My foot slipped, and I fell and crashed through ... and I was surrounded by broken pieces of sarcophagi that had been smashed by the falling stones. They were beautifully painted, and covered with hieroglyphics of scientific value ... I tried piling up the coffins in an effort to climb out. Every time I climbed on one it collapsed, and the poisonous dust (from the crushed Mummy inside) would rise again.\\" Further typically dramatic exploits are revealed by Prorok who describes how \\"after endless formalities and diplomatic action\\" the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie gave his team \\"the first permission ever given to white men\\" to explore the \\"forbidden land\\" of the Blue Nile. While in Abyssinia (now called Ethiopia), Prorok describes extraordinary temperatures and his attempts to avoid a confrontation with a powerful and reputedly hostile sultan in the Benishangul-Gumuz Region who may have been a remnant of the defunct Sennar (sultanate), > The Old Man of the Mountain, dread Solomon Ghogoli, Sultan of the Shangul. > He was over 100 years old, maintained many wives and was, it was rumoured, > the owner of secret gold mines which no white man had ever seen. Never was > he known to permit a European or American to visit his vast, savage > realm...for three terrible days we trekked across the enormous canyons and > great mountains of this legendary land. Even in the shade our thermometers > registered from 140 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, so much greater than the heat > of the human body that we were actually able to cool our hands by clamping > them under our armpits. The merciless heat once reached 167 degrees, three- > fourths as hot as boiling water. Our porters were terror-stricken. They were > fearful of being caught and killed by the savage sultan. No wonder many of > them deserted. According to the tale Prorok managed to find some mines and then excavated some ancient tombs before hearing of the local sultan ‚Äì whom they feared ‚Äì gathering his men. The team hastily packed their specimens and fled down the Dabus River to \\"Albi Moti\\", hoping for a promised Ethiopian military escort awaiting there with their official passports. This help was eventually forthcoming and Prorok dramatically relates how the previously hostile Sultan thus humbled attempts to make amends for his ignorant errors, with the author concluding characteristically: > He showed us many things no white man had ever seen before: his most > valuable golden idols, dating back many centuries, which his slaves had dug > up in the surrounding region; also a number of huge, rough diamonds. We in > turn were quite willing to offer presents. And maybe we didn‚Äôt bless Haile > Selassie! His name was indeed powerful in that wild stronghold of barbarism. It was here that Prorok became convinced that this area between Sudan and Ethiopia was the legendary land of Ophir of Biblical fame, whence came the gold, frankincense and other treasures for Solomon‚Äôs celebrated temple in Jerusalem. He also believed that he had discovered the oldest and richest of gold mines and the \\"prime cause\\" of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.

There is evidence of reduction of biomass in Saskatchewan's boreal forests (as with those of other Canadian prairie provinces) that is linked by researchers to drought-related water stress stemming from global warming, most likely caused by greenhouse gas emissions. While studies, as early as 1988 (Williams, et al., 1988) have shown that climate change will affect agriculture,Williams, G.D.V., R.A. Fautley, K.H. Jones, R.B. Stewart, and E.E.

New plan attacks climate change in Saskatchewan . Retrieved on: 2008-04-07. Species diversity Although the adaptive capacity of local species cannot be assumed to be nil, the impacts of anthropogenic climate change, or global warming, are likely to be too rapid for evolution to allow local adaptation. Species of special concern are the piping plover and lake sturgeon, because they are currently IUCN redlisted species their life cycle is dependent on current hydrological regimes. The effects of climate change are also expected to affect the majority of Saskatchewans habitat types, and therefore, changes to the entire ecology of the province are expected. Phenology Climate change is expected to alter the phenology, or timing of lifecycle events, of species worldwide. Environmental cues such as seasonal shifts in temperature and photoperiod influence processes such as germination, spring growth, breeding or flowering season, seed set, metamorphosis, migration, and senescence. Increasing winter and spring temperatures over the last century, particularly in northern latitudes, have resulted in rapid phenological shifts in many species. The magnitude and direction of these shifts are unpredictable and vary with latitude, topography, and the species in question. As phenological responses have a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, observations of species-specific phenological trends can be used as a sensitive and dynamic indicator of climate change effects on biota. Although little published information is available specifically on phenological responses to climate change in Saskatchewan, these are likely to follow general worldwide and regional trends. One such trend is advanced flowering in early-season plants and delayed flowering in late-season plants, leading to increased risk of reproductive failure due to frost damage from cold snaps. For instance, trembling aspen in Alberta has been shown to have advanced in flowering date by 26 days over the past century. Changes in flowering phenology also have the potential to greatly impact plant-pollinator dynamics. Asynchronies between flower availability and pollinator activity may lead to lower pollination rates and declines in ecologically and economically important insect species. This in turn could impact insectivorous consumers and thus have cascading effects on entire food chains. Other insect species may benefit from warmer temperatures. Increased voltinism and winter survival in many insects has the potential for dramatic population increases in pest species such as foliage- eating Lepidoptera and bark-boring Coleoptera. Alterations in phenology may have important implications for Saskatchewan agriculture, horticulture, forestry, and traditional First Nations plant uses, as well as large-scale cascading effects on communities and ecosystems. More studies are needed, both species-specific and on interactions between species, to better understand potential future responses of Saskatchewan biota to climate change. Programs such as NatureWatch, established in Canada in 1995, encourage citizen-based ecological monitoring as a method of phenological record-keeping. Such long- term monitoring will help us to better anticipate and adapt to these temporal changes and their resulting consequences. Ecozones Saskatchewan is divided into four different terrestrial ecozones including the taiga shield, boreal shield, boreal plains and prairies. These regions are determined by features such as natural‚Äîlandforms, soils, water features, vegetation and climate, however with climate change these features are beginning to change. =Taiga shield= The taiga shield is predicted to change in species composition if global warming continues in the future. The permafrost on the taiga has shifted northward by approximately 150 kilometres in the last 50 years due to warmer, wetter summer conditions, and increased snowfall in the winter. Because of this shift, lichens, which commonly dominate the bogs in this area, have been replaced by vegetation generally found in dry mesic lichen woodlands. It is predicted that if warming of this ecozone continues, the abundance of lichens, which is still currently high, will decrease considerably. Not only is species composition within the taiga shield expected to change in the future, but its boundaries are anticipated to shift northward onto the tundra as well. It is likely that with this northward shift, the way in which forests form will be altered in that they will become shorter and more aggregated. Deformities of individual trees is also likely to be seen due to wind stress from colonizing the open tundra. =Boreal shield and boreal plains= According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the boreal forest is more sensitive to climate change than either temperate or tropical forests and will be most affected by predicted future warming. Projected changes in both temperature and moisture patterns suggest the boreal ecozones will be subjected to changes in both boundaries and natural disturbance regimes. Not only is it predicted that the boreal ecozones boundaries will shift northward with global warming, its range is expected to shrink as well. These changes will likely result in both a loss of biodiversity, and a loss of an economically valuable resource for forestry. Fire is an extremely important natural disturbance in boreal ecozones that is required for the regeneration of stands. Historical records show an increase in fire frequency and intensity in recent years because of drier conditions, and this trend is predicted to continue into the future with global warming. This change in the fire regime can have impacts on species composition and the overall makeup of the boreal forest. =Prairies= The general circulation models (GCMs) for Saskatchewan's prairie ecozone predict an extremely arid future, which is similar to conditions seen after the Holocene. From these GCMs it has been inferred that the prairies will be subjected to intense desertification and erosion because periods of drought may last ten or more consecutive years. As well, because of this expected warm, dry climate, plants that exhibit C4 carbon fixation will become more competitive than plants that display C3 carbon fixation, and will likely become dominant in the future. Another implication of global warming for the prairie ecozone is on the Prairie Pothole Region. This is the area of hundreds of depressions in the landscape formed by past glaciation. The region comprises both permanent and semi-permanent wetlands, which may experience changes in water depth, areal extent and length of wet and dry cycles. These changes will not only have implications for vegetation surrounding the wetlands, but for waterfowl and other organisms inhabiting them as well. Impacts =Wetlands and water resources= Although Saskatchewan may be globally reduced recognized for its vast expanses of fertile agricultural lands,Agriculture in Saskatchewan the Southern portion of the province is situated in the heart of the prairie pothole region (PPR), an area renowned for productive wetlands.Prairie Pothole Ducks Within the PPR, Saskatchewan is estimated to have over 1.5 million wetlands covering over 1.7 million hectares.Wetlands in Saskatchewan Saskatchewan wetlands are very dynamic ecosystems, as they include a wide variety of shorebirds, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, invertebrates, and aquatic and terrestrial plants.Mitsch, W. J., and J. G. Gosselink. (2000). Wetlands. Third edition. John Wiley and Sons, New York, New York, USA. Also, Saskatchewan provides essential habitat for millions of migrating and nesting waterfowl each year. In fact, the number and diversity of breeding waterfowl are directly dependent on the availability of wetlands found throughout the prairie pothole region.Weller, M.W., Spatcher, C.E. (1965). Role of Habitat in the Distribution and Abundance of Marsh Birds. Ames: Iowa State University, Agricultural and Home Economics Experimental Station. Special Report no. 43. Apart from being a home to wildlife, wetlands provide Saskatchewan residents with valuable ecosystem services, such as water quality improvement, flood control, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. Recent data produced by Regional Climate Models have predicted that the temperature in the prairie pothole region in Saskatchewan will rise between 1.8‚Äì4 ÀöC by the year 2100. Accompanying the rise in temperature, experts anticipate the prairie pothole region will experience an intensified Hydrologic cycle leading to an increase in the frequency of drought periods and torrential rains. Unfortunately, Saskatchewan wetlands have been identified as particularly vulnerable to these changes in climate, as many wetlands are shallow, and have high evaporation rates. Inter-annual variation between wet and dry periods in which abundant rainfall is followed by a drought period have been a commonality in Saskatchewan wetlands since their formation nearly 14,000 years ago. However, unprecedented changes in climate expected in the prairies have many experts concerned that Saskatchewan wetland ecosystems will not be able tolerate the heat, and intensified wet/dry cycles., For example, Sorenson et al. (1998) predicted that with a doubling of carbon dioxide, the prairie pothole duck population would be cut in half by the year 2060 due to a loss of wetland habitat. It remains unknown how wetland organisms will respond to oncoming climate change; yet, perhaps the biggest uncertainty is predicting the way Saskatchewan citizens decide to share their water with vulnerable wetland ecosystems. As the climate changes in the province of Saskatchewan, improved attention to water management may be critical to protecting Saskatchewan's fragile wetlands. Currently, Saskatchewan Environment, SaskWater, and the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority are responsible for water quality management in the province. Climate Change will reduce water resource availability and quality, accordingly these organizations are investigating the circumstances that they will eventually encounter.\`Watershed and Aquifer Planning\` Increased climate variability indicates that stream flow of all rivers will be smaller in magnitude, with flow rates becoming more unpredictable, especially in rivers with many dams, such as the South Saskatchewan River. This means that reservoir management, especially of Lake Diefenbaker, will become more difficult because baseline data will not be available for the specific climate parameters. Cumulatively, the changes to Saskatchewan's wetlands and water resources will have significant impacts of native flora and fauna. =Native species distribution= The effects on the distribution of native species in Saskatchewan from climate change are beginning to reveal themselves, and will continue to grow worse if mitigation and adaptation measures are not taken. In Saskatchewan, the driest area is found in the southwest, with the landscape becoming progressively more semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid moving north and east. This is reflected in the natural vegetation gradients of the province (ecoregions). Climate change effects are predicted to shift these vegetation zones, and therefore the species that inhabit them northward. For grasslands this means short-grass prairie will move up from regions in the United States, and the mixed-grass prairie will bear down increasingly on the north. The boreal forest would move somewhat north, but continue to shrink in size because of ill-suited conditions, such as a drier climate. This means permanent losses of forest cover in Saskatchewan. These changes will have impacts for people in the province that will affect our economy and recreational activities. Hunters and fishermen will see a movement and decline in species. For example, waterfowl populations will continue to decline as wetlands contract and dry up; and boreal forest species like deer, moose, and elk will decline because of a losses in forest cover. People who fish will see the usual shift northward of species, but also extirpations in southern and central regions of the province. This will be especially prominent in small, shallow habitats (ponds, small lakes, marshes). Increased turbidity, salinity, and eutrophication in water habitats will also contribute to declines in fish populations. The forestry and agriculture sectors of our economy will also see changes. The loss of the forest cover in the boreal forest will have a direct and negative effect on the forestry economy. When addressing climate change effects on the native species in Saskatchewan it is important to encourage management strategies for adaptation on top of mitigation policies. Many people do not want to hear the word adaptation; however at the rate the world is going climate change is inevitable and is happening right now, so we need to come up with approaches to adapt as well. =Invasive species= With climate change affecting the structure and functions of the ecosystems in Saskatchewan, the populations of invasive species are increasing, escalating the possibility of outcompeting native communities. Evidence of the increasing invasive populations is present in the agricultural sector of western Canada, where 37% of the dominant 30 species of insect herbivores are invasive to the region. As the climate continues to warm, the occurrence of extreme weather events such as floods, will allow gateways for aquatics specimens to branch out from their own confined environments. Risks of Asian carp entering Saskatchewan waters and depleting resources for other species is a growing concern. These climate-driven events could lead to completely transformed ecosystems where invasive species dominate function, resulting in a reduced diversity of native species. Invasive species are one of the primary threats to biodiversity in an ecosystem. Invasive species have the ability to out- compete native species due to a lack of predators, which permits high individual and population growth rates and high reproductive capacities. The behaviour of species in response to climatic conditions allows prediction of the rate of dispersal of invasive species. As the levels of global trade, transport, tourism and climate change continue to increase the threats to biodiversity is amplified.Convention on Biological Diversity (2002) Alien Species that threaten ecosystems, habitats, or species. COP6 Decision V1/23 (http://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/?id=7197) accessed 04/04/12 In the most conservative climate change scenarios, bio-climatic models predict the potential distributions, relative abundances and economic damage of several invasive species such as C.obstrictus, O. melanopus, and P. xylostella to increase in Saskatchewan. The introduction of invasive species occurs in a four-step process: # Introduction stage: climate change facilitates transport through intensity and/ or frequency of extreme events and opens areas for settlement. # Colonization stage: climate change increases the success of survival and enables better growth of invasive species in the introduced range # Establishment: climate change enables successful reproduction and establishment of invasive species # Spread: climate change enhances the competitive ability of established invasive species and extends suitable areas, which might offer new opportunities for introductions. Climatic models show northward shifts in the ecozones of Saskatchewan, creating more agricultural land. The increased area with favourable climates to host insects will allow for a significant spread of more invasive species. An invasive species that is already damaging crops in Saskatchewan is the cabbage seedpod weevil. This insect is native to Europe and arrived in North America in 1930. The weevil reached Saskatchewan in 2000 only five years after being recorded in Lethbridge, Alberta. The current dispersal rates at current temperatures are 55-km/ year. At this rate, predictions show the weevil spreading right across Canada with detrimental effects on crops.  Conservation of rare habitats  Within Saskatchewan there are areas where unique geography or topography allows for rare or distinctive organisms to thrive. These rare habitats and their species will be facing a great deal of stress as human- driven climate change continues to raise temperatures both world-wide and in Saskatchewan. Within the province, these increases in temperature will cause effects such as changes in wind patterns,Weather and Climate Change in the Canadian Prairies Weather and Climate Change in the Canadian Prairies. an increase in rare weather events, a decrease in water availabilityImpacts of Climate Change on Saskatchewan's Water Resources J.W.

These changes to the natural landscape can have large detrimental effects on the conservation efforts made to protect these rare areas. Examples of areas within Saskatchewan which are currently conserving rare habitats include Provincial Parks such as the Athabasca Sand Dunes Provincial Park, Cypress Hills Provincial Park, and National Parks such as Grassland National Park. Each of these parks protects areas of land which are unique compared to the dominant landscape of commercial agriculture in Saskatchewan. For example, the Grasslands National Park preserves rare grass communities such as mixed grass prairie and short-grass prairie, as well as the many unique and endemic species, such as the black-tailed prairie dog, that depend on these grasses for ecological community preservation. The reason for the establishment of the park was that over 80% of all previous mixed grass prairie and short-grass prairie has been lost in Saskatchewan due to current agricultural practices, and preservation of these species is vital to ecosystem health and biodiversity. Preservation of these natural habitats is becoming a challenge with the changing climate. Park boundaries, set out for conservation purposes, may be rendered moot as ecozones shift northwards, J. Vandall, N. Henderson and J. Thorpe, 2006. Suitability and Adaptability of Current Protected Area Policies under Different Climate Change Scenarios:The Case of the Prairie Ecozone, Saskatchewan.

Protected area managers need to examine policies in light of these coming changes, and look at possible mitigation techniques such as buffer zones, flexible boundaries and connective corridors to help mitigate the possible loss of rare and endemic species and landscapes in Saskatchewan. Agriculture Agriculture is one of the oldest economic activities since it is the backbone of the food supply and without it the world's population would experience food insecurity. Changes in agricultural supply result from the combination of changes in yields and changes in crop acreage. Changes in crop yields are the result of climate changes and any human mitigating responses such as increasing fertilizer or water use or adoption of new crop varieties, while changes in acreage are affected by producers' expectations concerning changes in relative crop prices and per acre returns. Agriculture is an economic activity that is highly dependent upon weather and climate in order to produce the food and fibre necessary to sustain human life. Despite technological advances, such as improved varieties, genetically modified organisms, and irrigation systems, weather is still a key factor in agricultural productivity, as well as soil properties and natural communities. Crop and livestock yields are directly affected by changes in climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation and the frequency and severity of extreme events like droughts, floods, and wind storms. Also, carbon dioxide (CO2) is fundamental for plant production; rising concentrations have the potential to enhance the productivity of agro ecosystems by plants producing fewer stomata, small openings in the leaves through which CO2 and water vapour are exchanged with the atmosphere, leading to reduced water usage. A temperature rise extends the growing season and the farmable area; it causes earlier maturity of grains and the opportunity to grow new crops. While the temperature rise is beneficial to the crops, the extra heat also affects weeds. Weeds, pests, and insects tend to get better living conditions under higher temperatures. To further increase risks to good crops, is the potential for poor herbicide performance with increased temperatures, reducing the potential crop yieldsArthur. L.M. (1988).

Saskatoon: Saskatchewan Research Council, Publication No. E-2900-17-E-92. Climate change models generally predict an increased frequency of extreme weather events, and longer, warmer, drier summer, with greater potential for precipitation in the spring and winter.Tyrchniewicz, A. And Yusishen, B. (2000). Agriculture and Climate Change: workshop Report, 23 March 2000. International Institute for Sustainable Development, Winnipeg, 15 p More spring precipitation could mean enough moisture for germination but it could also mean more frequent floods, and drier summers could mean an increased risk or drought, while warmer summer could allow greater crop diversification including increased production of heat loving crops such as corn, sorghum, and soybeans.Wilcox, D. (2006). Manitoba not yielding to climate change? In: Manitoba Agronomists Conference 2006 Proceedings, 12‚Äì13 December 2006. Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences, University of Manitoba The raising of livestock is also an important agricultural activity, particularly in terms of cattle. Hog production is becoming increasingly important. As well, operations are diversifying with the introduction of buffalo and elk because they are more accustomed to Saskatchewan's climate. The main effects of climate change on livestock from increased temperature and decreased precipitation is distress. Warmer conditions in the summer can lead to stress on livestock since dry pastures, poor hay and feed production and shortages of water all lead to worse conditions. On the other hand, increased temperatures during the winter can reduce cold stress for livestock living outdoors and reduced energy requirement to heat facilities for those living indoors. Increased temperature could have a positive effect on the growth of pastures and provide better feed for livestock, assuming the pastures receive adequate moisture. Warmer conditions in the summer can also suppress appetite, leading to lower weight gains.Adams, R.M., McCarl, B.A., Segerson, K., Rosenzweig, C., Bryant, K.J., Dixon, B.L., Conner, R., Evenson, R.E., Ojima, D. (1998). The economic effects of climate change on U.S. agriculture, Chap 2. In: Medelsohn R, Hewmann J (eds) The economics of climate change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (in press) Government plans In June 2007, Saskatchewan introduced a plan to address climate change and further develop its energy sector. Introduced by Premier Lorne Calvert, Industry and Resources Minister Maynard Sonntag and Environment Minister John Nilson, the Saskatchewan Energy and Climate Change Plan aims to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions and sets targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 32 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050. The plan has five components, or \\"emissions reductions wedges\\" to these targets. These include: * Conservation and efficiency measures by industry, business and homeowners; * Carbon dioxide capture and storage measures in Saskatchewan's oil and gas industry and in the province's electricity sector; * Increased use of renewable energy, including wind, solar power and hydrogen, and further development of Saskatchewan's ethanol and biodiesel resources; * Reduction of methane and other emissions in the oil and gas industry, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions in the agriculture industry; and * Creation of more natural carbon sinks in Saskatchewan's forests and soils. The Saskatchewan Environmental Society is among those who consider the plan inadequate. The Society points to the scientific consensus which calls for industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions to 25-40% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. They comment that the government's target is 20% below 2006 levels: \\"As our emissions have grown so rapidly over the past 20 years, this would still leave our provincial emissions well above 1990 levels. Saskatchewan's emission rise is much greater than that of most countries.\\"Saskatchewan Environmental Society. Climate Change. Retrieved on: 2012-04-07.  Effects on reptiles and amphibians  Saskatchewan has a variety of reptile and amphibians, including two species of turtles, one species of lizard, nine species of snakes, one species of salamander and six species of frogs. , additional text. Each of these species represents an important stepping stone in a unique food web, either by acting as a predator or as prey. Reptiles and amphibians act as biological controls for vectors of human diseases, such as mosquitos and ticks. They also serve as critical food sources for native and migrating bird populations throughout the province. To lose this source of biodiversity will affect the health of the respective Saskatchewan ecosystems. However, the majority of the populations of these species are already at risk due to other anthropogenic factors, such as pollution and habitat destruction. Climate change may exacerbate the already tenuous positions these species hold in their respective ecosystems. Concrete examples of risks posed to reptile and amphibian populations in Saskatchewan have been poorly studied, yet many examples exist around the world of the consequences on these fragile organisms from around the world. Desertification of wetland habitats as a result of changing precipitation patterns will decrease the amount of suitable breeding habitat, decreasing populations of amphibians and water dependent reptiles. Such a desertification effect is currently being demonstrated in certain regions of China. Changes in air temperatures (particularly night temperatures) may affect the metamorphosis rates and reproductive patterns of certain reptile or amphibian species as well. As exemplified in side-blotched lizards (genus Uta) in the United States a nighttime temperature increases raises the rate at which these species may reproduce.[] additional text. This may seem like a positive effect for many shrinking populations, however as habitat sizes continue to decrease, requirements for survival such as food availability may dwindle to the point where larger populations would not survive. Therefore, an effect such as increased reproduction in certain species, may have an overall negative effect on the survival of that species in the wild. A significant threat to amphibian populations in the wild has been the appearance and spread of a Chytrid Fungus (specifically, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), and an increase in global climate temperatures may facilitate a movement of the fungus northward, thus affecting Canada's species of amphibians.[] Better monitoring of populations of reptiles and amphibians throughout Saskatchewan would enable better understanding of the roles various species play in food webs.

The story concerning her, known from the works of Plutarch and Polyaenus, is as follows. Lampsace was the daughter of Mandron, king of the Bebryces in Pityussa (the older name for Lampsacus). Her father was assisted by Phobus of Phocaea in a military conflict against the neighboring people, and, in reward, assigned to Phobus a part of his kingdom, to where the latter led a colony from Phocaea. The colonists subsequently led several successful military campaigns and obtained plenty of trophies, which made the barbarian population of Pityussa fear and envy them. Thereupon the Bebrycians devised a plot to drive the Greeks out of their land in the absence of Mandron. Lampsace became aware of the plot and reported it to the Greeks, who then forestalled the barbarians by developing a stratagem of their own: they invited the Bebrycians to a sacrificial banquet and when those got drunk, one half of the Greeks massacred them while the other half was taking control over the city walls. The Greeks then invited Mandron to reign over them but he chose to leave, taking wives and children of those slain away with him. Lampsace was greatly honored for having informed the Greeks of the imminent threat, but she fell sick and died. The citizens gave magnificent burial to her and went on to worship her as a heroine, renaming Pityussa to Lampsacus in her honor; later on a vote was held to promote her to the status of a goddess. As such she was venerated as late as the times of Plutarch.Plutarch, On the Virtues of Women, 18Polyaenus, Stratagems of War, 8. 37Stephanus of Byzantium s. v.

Life  Born in Athens in 1931, he followed family tradition by entering the medical profession. He studied at the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and received his degree in 1955. In 1967, he became a member of the National Research Council and a co-investigator of the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization. He climbed the ladder of the academic hierarchy in two different scientific fields: Clinical Therapeutics and History of Medicine. He was elected successively as Assistant Professor (1969‚Äì72) and as Associate Professor (1973‚Äì78) in the Department of Clinical Therapeutics of the Medical School of Athens. During the period 1976-1980 and at the personal invitation of Constantine Karamanlis he served as Secretary General for the Greek Ministry of Social Services. Prof. Marketos embraced Karamanlis‚Äô European vision for Greece and assisted his government in pursuing a determined policy toward Greek membership of the then EEC. Among his political achievements, Prof. Marketos pioneered the founding of two Medical Schools in Greece (in the city of Ioannina and in the city of Alexandroupolis). He was instrumental in the passing by the Greek Parliament of pertinent legislation concerning the rights of patients with renal diseases. Prof. Marketos served also as President of the National Welfare Organization and of the National Committee on Human Tissue Transplantation for Therapeutic Purposes. During the years 1986-1989 he also served as a Member of the Greek Parliament. Throughout his life, he was also interested in introducing medicine to the general public, as evidenced by more than 600 articles in the Greek press, mostly in Kathimerini, where he maintained a permanent column in the Sunday edition for 16 years under the pseudonym ‚ÄúGalen‚Äù. He was Editor-in-Chief of Materia Medica Greca (1973-1992), and President of the Greek Association of Medical Press.  Marketos as a scholar  Spyros Marketos served as professor and chairman (1980‚Äì1998) of the Department of History and Philosophy of Medicine at the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and in 1998 he retired as an emeritus professor. His scientific research covered a diverse set of topics ranging from quantitative nosography and social medicine to history of medicine and medical ethics. He has published eighteen books. He was the author or co-author of more than 300 scientific papers on topics such as history of medicine, public health, medical ethics and nephrology. Between 1993 and 2000 he served as president of the International Hippocratic Foundation of Kos. During his term the foundation inaugurated, under the auspices of President Karamanlis, the Hippocratic Museum of medicine and hosted a number of international activities including the First Medical Olympics (a quadrennial medical symposium of notable international practitioners and academics) that took place on the island of Cos in 1996.

Career  Known throughout his childhood as \\"Toots\\", Smith originally started as a drummer but was convinced by Ethel Waters that he was far better as a trumpet player. It has been said that when he reached New York in 1920 he already had a fully formed style, which achieved \\"the vocalized sound, the blues spirit and the swing which makes for convincing jazz performance\\". In 1921, Smith joined the Black Swan Jazz Masters in Chicago, directed at the time by Fletcher Henderson who described Smith as \\"the most soulful trumpet I ever had\\". He also worked with the Jazz Hounds, the Broadway Syncopators, and finally with McKinney's Cotton Pickers throughout the 1920s. He became famous from his work accompanying Bessie Smith, recording over 30 records. She stated that Smith was her preferred cornetist when recording due to his reserved additions to her voice. Some of the other artists he worked with include Billy Paige, Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, and Allie Ross. Thomas Brothers described Smith as Louis Armstrong's New York City rival, citing Armstrong's description of Smith as \\"a big prima donna.\\" When recalling his time with the Henderson orchestra, Armstrong insisted that he was forced to cover the high notes Smith could not hit.  Family  Smith came from a family of musicians. His father, Luke Smith, Sr., was a bandleader, and six of his brothers also played the trumpet or trombone: Luke, Jr. (1895‚Äì1936), Stanley (born 1890), Doonie, Charles (born 1908), Carpathia (1912‚Äì2000), and Russell (1890‚Äì1966). Three of the brothers played professionally, Russell as first trumpet for Fletcher Henderson's orchestra. Smith married Madeline Adele Belt on January 12, 1928, in Manhattan.

Rugby Boys are a collective term for gangs of street children found in the Philippines. They are one of the most well-known poverty- afflicted people found in the slums of the Philippines. They are known for using and being addicted to a contact cement known as \\"Rugby\\" brand manufactured by Bostik and other aromatic solvents to alleviate their hunger, and resulting in crime to fund their addiction. Data from the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development show that the number of street children increased by 6,365 yearly, and half of the country‚Äôs street children, from 8 to 20 years old, have at one time sniffed Rugby and other inhalants. The relative ease of procuring these substances due to their low cost contributes to widespread abuse. There is no comprehensive epidemiologic data on the magnitude on inhalant abuse among children and adolescents in the Philippines. In response to widespread abuse of toluene-based substances, stricter rules have been imposed on the manufacture and sale of Rugby and similar glues by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, such as the mandatory addition of mustard oil as a sniffing deterrent. In addition, purchasers will now be required to present valid identification for them to have access to contact cement that doesn't contain any bitterants or other such deterrents. History Wealthy adolescents were the first to use inhalants and become addicted to them, often using them to alleviate depression. In terms of addiction, inhalants are ordinary household products such as cleaners, cooking sprays, fabric protectors, paint thinner and adhesives and solvents. Because of the low cost of Rugby and other inhalants, poor people (especially inexperienced and destitute youths) use them to relieve hunger pangs and common poverty health problems. ‚ÄúRugby Boys‚Äù (also called ‚ÄúSolvent Boys‚Äù) and even girls do the sniffing in the streets. The chemical is placed in a plastic bag, and inhaled from the bag to achieve euphoria. The impoverished population is the most common victim of addiction to dangerous and illegal substances. Once they are \\"high\\" they forget their hunger. Others become addicted because of family problems, poor self-esteem and peer pressure. Solvents, particularly Rugby, is the inhalant of choice in the Philippines for most teenagers since it is easily obtained. Less scrupulous store owners sell the adhesive in small portions to children and teenagers. Health problems Inhalants cause nausea, blurred vision, memory lapse and loss of motor coordination. These effects may be a minor discomfort to the user after inhalation, but permanent damage from inhalants is irreversible. Damage to organs such as the liver, kidneys, brain and heart could be fatal. A documentary by Karen Davila showed the effects of inhalant abuse on a person's body. One male teenager who served as the subject of the documentary has been addicted to Rugby for five years. He started sniffing Rugby due to peer influence. His parents knew about his addiction, but as his mother explained, they were unable to dissuade him from inhaling the toxic substance. His father resorted to beatings to teach him a lesson, to no avail. All his friends are addicts and the money they earn is saved to buy Rugby. The boy even turned his addiction into business, buying a bottle of Rugby then selling it in small portions to friends, and the profit enabled him to buy more Rugby. In the months they have observed this boy, they captured him at his lowest point. With the years of abuse that his body suffered, he could not stand or walk properly, and his body was scrawny. When he was taken for a medical exam, doctors found that he had tuberculosis and that his liver and kidneys were not functioning well. Through CT Scan, it was found that his brain was smaller than average for his age bracket. Doctors said that if he continues his habit, he would either fall into a vegetative state, in a coma, or die. The chemical toluene provides the aromatic smell of contact cement and other glue and is the culprit behind the addiction. Toluene abusers are exposed to levels above 1000 ppm (parts per million). Levels of exposure greater than 600 ppm cause confusion and delirium. Inhalant abuse causes permanent damage to the brain and may result in ‚Äúsudden sniffing death‚Äù. It can also cause loss of memory, confusion or disorientation, distorted perception of time and distance, hallucinations, nausea and emesis. Inhalant abuse leads to muscle cramps and weakness, numbness of limbs, abdominal pains, damage to the central nervous system, kidneys and liver. It also produces psychological dependence. Once the habit is formed, the dose must be increased gradually to produce the same effect. Crimes attributed Many Rugby boys have resorted to crime to fund their addiction. These crimes include robbery, aggressive threats and hold-ups, drug trafficking, and racketeering and small organized crimes. In a recent television documentary by Karen Davila, a Filipino broadcaster, a boy they ordered to buy Rugby from a store easily purchased a bottle of Rugby, and was told by the store owner that the Rugby should be wrapped in paper to conceal it. This is because there is a law prohibiting the selling of solvents to minors without parental consent. Many crime syndicates and common businessmen recruit and teach children how to get away with buying it. Many of their crimes occur at crowded public places, when the police are distracted.

Ruiz i Quesada The Saint Augustine Altarpiece is a Catalan Gothic painting in egg tempera by Jaume Huguet and Pau Verg√≥s made between 1462 and 1475. The long duration of the work was caused by financial reasons, and it is assumed that work was begun by Huguet and finished by other members of his workshop, in particular Pau Verg√≥s. The altarpiece was commissioned by the guild of tanners to be placed on the altar of the Augustinian friary of Sant Agust√≠ Vell (\\"Old St Augustine\\") in Barcelona, Spain. The panel measures 250 x 193 x 9.5 cm and has been in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC) in Barcelona since 1927. Artwork at MNAC Website Comparisons with similar works that survive complete suggest that there were originally several more panels than the eight that now survive, seven in the MNAC and one in the Museu Mar√®s, also in Barcelona. They would have been framed in an elaborate gilt wooden setting as a retable behind the main altar. The grandeur of the work makes it the most important painting of the fifteenth century in Catalonia.  Description  In 1463 the Guild of Tanners commissioned an altarpiece from Jaume Huguet for the high altar in the church of Sant Agust√≠ Vell in Barcelona. The unusual size of the piece, one of the largest in Catalan Gothic painting, and the crisis the country was going through at the time, delayed completion of the altarpiece until 1486 and involved several members of the Huguet workshop, and in particular a member of the Verg√≥s family. Eight panels from this altarpiece are preserved, seven at the MNAC and another at the Museu Mar√®s. The quality of the composition and the pictorial technique of the 'Consecration of Saint Augustine' suggest it can be considered the personal work of the great master. Typically for Catalan painting at this date, which was conservative by Italian standards, the panel still has a \\"gold ground\\" background, decorated in textile-like patterns of pastiglia stucco relief, which is also used for the croziers and jewels on the mitres and vestments of the figures. Saint Augustine, the dedicatee of the church, is shown being consecrated by several other bishops as Bishop of Hippo in Roman North Africa, which happened in 395, although the painting shows entirely contemporary styles of dress. The unvested figure reading a book in a chemise covering on the left is a donor portrait of one of the friars, probably the head of the community. Another friar's head, looking like a portrait, peeps out at the rear right.  History  The work on the altarpiece began on July 20, 1452 when the carpenter Macia Bonaf√© was given the contract to construct the retable. It was stipulated that the altarpiece was to rest on a stone base with doors on either side leading to the sacristy. Bonaf√© was also to create a figure of the Madonna, which was to rest in a niche, as well as the heraldic lions of the guild. On the same day Bonaf√© received his contract, the guildsmen engaged Luis Dalmau to begin working on painting as soon as the construction of the retable was finished. Dalmau ended up doing no actual work on the piece, for reasons unknown, and on December 4, 1463, the contract was given to Jaume Huguet. For payment, Huguet received one hundred and ten lliures on February 1 and July 1 of 1464, and was thereafter to draw fifty six lliures every Christmas until the full amount had been paid.Rowland (1932) The whole arrangement was very businesslike with very clear instructions on how Huguet was to proceed. He was first to paint the four panels of the predella with scenes from the Passion as conceived in a sketch that he had presented to the guild, and this portion was to be completed by Christmas, 1466. Huguet was also tasked with painting the figures of saints on the sacristy doors, coloring the statues, and painting the heraldic lions. Before he was allowed to begin any painting, he had to present drawings for the approval of the guild and two painters, one chosen by the guild and the other chosen by Huguet. With the expectation that much of the work would be done by assistants, as it was a very large undertaking, it was specified that Huguet himself would be responsible for painting the heads and hands. It is not until November 29, 1486 that the altarpiece is spoken of as being completed, twenty three years after Huguet was originally commissioned. The documents also show that Huguet was not paid as originally promised and did not receive his full sum until 1488, when he was still owed 200 lliures. The reasons for the delay are unknown, but there a couple conjectures as to what happened. One is that the Constable Dom Pedro arrived six weeks after the contract was drawn up and engaged Huguet to paint him a retable, which would have taken precedence over that of the guild. It could also be that the guild lost interest or had a lack of finances that temporarily halted the project.

Pronunciation: \\"u - ng - w - …ô - nt- (…ô) - m\\"  Description  Masdevallia unguentum is from an unknown origin but most likely originates from Colombia. The species is a miniature, presumably epiphytic, herb with erect, elliptic leaves. The flowers are born singly on thin stems as long as the leaf and emit a spicy fragrance. The species keys out to Masdevallia saltatrix but can easily be distinguished by the odor, striped rather than spotted calyx, and the tail that rests against the back of the tube.  Cultivation  The species can be cultivated like other intermediate to cool (day: 56‚Äì64 F; night: 48‚Äì56 F) growing masdevallias. They require high humidity (65‚Äì95%) with strong air movement to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. Light should be medium to bright shade (600‚Äì1400 footcandles). The plants should be reported before the medium breaks down in either a bark based mix or in sphagnum moss. They should be fertilized with a half-strength mixture of a balanced fertilizer once a month and a high nitrogen fertilizer can be used for single applications in the spring and fall.Rhodehamel 1988 The plants can be propagated by division or sexually.

It was written to celebrate Donald Duck's sixtieth anniversary. The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #1994-23; the first American publication was in Donald Duck #286, in September 1994. Plot It is Donald Duck's birthday, but he becomes depressed when he discovers that his three nephews have forgotten about his birthday. Donald then applies for a job as a museum janitor, but his application form is turned upside down so that he is mistaken for sixty years old, an age at which the job isn't available. While walking out of the museum, Donald is hit in the by a magic urn. Suddenly, a birthday genie appears and offers him a wish. Donald doesn't believe the genie and inadvertently wishes that he were never born, a wish that the genie grants him. It only gradually dawns on Donald that he has been abruptly transported to an alternate reality: the world as it would be if he had never existed. When Donald gets out of the museum, he finds the street damaged and his car gone. He sees Grandma Duck's car, although it's occupied not by Grandma Duck but by Gyro Gearloose. Donald asks him what he is doing in Grandma Duck's car, and Gyro answers that he bought her car and her farm years ago. Donald is shocked when Gyro says that he was once a brilliant inventor, but he once created some think boxes that made animals as smart as people, but when he reversed their polarity he was caught in the ray and was given a normal human brain and was never able to invent again. (The reference is to an old Carl Barks comic that ended quite differently, because in the original timeline, Donald was present rather than absent.) Donald is confused but walks to Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin to use the telephone, where he finds his Grandma who tells him that she sold the farm to Gyro because she could not run it alone (Gus Goose never worked for her) and that Daisy Duck bought this building from Scrooge years ago to use it as her printing plant: She is now a wealthy novelist, having started writing romance novels to fill her lonely life. A haggard Daisy appears, looking like a diva wearing tons of makeup. She throws Donald outside (pummeling him with empty bottles, subtly suggesting that in this reality, she has become an alcoholic). Donald realizes that this is real and now he was never born. He meets Gus Goose, who tells him that he went to work for Scrooge McDuck as his top assistant (he was the only relative Scrooge had who works for him and he is not as smart as Donald). On his first day at work, Magica De Spell turned up outside the money bin, selling hamburgers for a dime. Gus ignorantly handed her the Number One Dime, causing Scrooge to have a fit when he learnt what his new assistant had done. He came too late to stop Magica from turning the dime into a magical amulet, which she then used to become the richest person in the world. The loss of the dime destroyed Scrooge's self-confidence, allowing Flintheart Glomgold to cheat him out of his money. Scrooge lost everything, and Glomgold relocated the former McDuck empire to his own home base. Losing the McDuck taxes is slowly turning Duckburg into a ghost town. Donald flees in horror and drives to his cousin Gladstone Gander's house, thinking that if he saw that Gladstone was as miserable as everyone else it would cheer him up, but he does not find Gladstone. He instead finds grossly overweight versions of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, sitting on the couch eating junk food: they lived with Gladstone since they were ducklings and didn't join the Junior Woodchucks. Gladstone then appears (he was the only one who has not suffered from Donald's absence) and accuses Donald of stealing his car. When Donald tries to run away, he collides with a Beagle Boy in a police outfit (they turned \\"straight\\" after Scrooge went bust, but are implied to be a highly corrupt police force). Donald jumps into Gladstone's car and drives off towards the museum, hoping to find the urn and set things right. He crashes through the museum's walls and finds the urn, but thinks that he used his only wish. The genie reveals that Donald gets one wish for each time he touches the urn on his birthday. Donald is hit by the urn on his head and is knocked out cold. When Donald wakes up, he thinks it was just a dream. However, as he drives away, the genie's voice is heard, implying that all of this was real. Soon, Donald realizes that he is very important. As Donald arrives home, everyone throws him a surprise party and he is given his job back. Inspiration The plot is inspired by the 1946 movie classic It's a Wonderful Life, a title that is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue.

Captain Precious and pilot Bronders managed to return the ship to her original course, but another wave struck Berlin and she swung northward again, causing her to become impaled on the tip of the granite breakwater at the entrance to the New Waterway. Waves swept over the vessel, and both Precious and Bronders soon were swept overboard. The Dutch steam lifeboat President van Heel attempted to offer aid, but the rough seas prevented her from approaching the stricken vessel. Berlin broke in two amidships at 0600.

His feast day is March 30, and he is also venerated along with the rest of the 103 Korean martyrs on September 20. Biography Residence of Bishop Antoine Daveluy between 1845 and 1866 in the village Sin- ri (rural part of Dangjin). Antoine Daveluy was born 16 March 1818 in Amiens, France. His father was a factory owner, town councilman, and government official. The members of his family were devout Catholics and two of his brothers became priests. He entered the St. Sulpice Seminary in Issy-les- Moulineaux himself in October 1834 and was ordained a priest on 18 December 1841. His first assignment was as an assistant priest in Roye. Despite poor health, he joined the Paris Foreign Missions Society on 4 October 1843. He departed for East Asia on 6 February 1844, intending to serve as a missionary in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. He arrived in Macau, where he was persuaded by the newly appointed apostolic vicar of Korea, Jean-Joseph-Jean-Baptiste Ferr√©ol, to accompany him there instead. The two were joined by Andrew Kim Tae-g≈èn, a Korean seminarian who had been studying for the priesthood in Macau. They first traveled to Shanghai, where Bishop Ferr√©ol ordained Father Kim on 17 August 1845. The three priests then made a stormy crossing by sea to Korea, arriving in Chungcheong Province in October. Father Daveluy began work as a missionary in Korea, becoming fluent in the language. He wrote a Korean- French dictionary and other books about the Catholic Church and its history in Korean. On 13 November 1855, Pope Pius IX appointed him titular bishop of Akka and coadjutor to Bishop Sim√©on-Fran√ßois Berneux,Ritzler and Sefrin (1978), p. 71. who had been appointed apostolic vicar in 1854Ritzler and Sefrin (1968), p. 132. after the death of Bishop Ferr√©ol in 1853.Ritzler and Sefrin (1968), p. 108. He was consecrated by Bishop Berneux on 25 March 1857. After Bishop Berneux was executed during a campaign by the Korean government against Christians, Bishop Daveluy became apostolic vicar on 8 March 1866. He was promptly arrested on 11 March. Imprisoned and tortured, he staunchly defended his Catholic faith. Sentenced to death, he asked to be executed on Good Friday 30 March. He was beheaded at a Korean naval base in Galmaemot (Í∞àÎß§Î™ª) near present-day Boryeong along with two French priests, Pierre Auma√Ætre and Martin-Luc Huin, and two lay catechists, Lucas Hwang S≈èk-tu (Bishop Daveluy's personal assistant) and Joseph Chang Chu-gi. All five were canonized on 6 May 1984 along with Father Kim, Bishop Berneux and 96 other Korean martyrs.

A separate school building was taken into use in 1938, but it was destroyed in the bombing of Longyearbyen in 1943. When the school resumed operations in 1946, it initially used a two-room house at Haugen. With the 1951 opening of Huset, a community center, the school was located in the second story. From 1954, the school was reorganized. It has two classes, the vicar was no longer responsible for teaching, and operations were taken over by SNSK, who received a 25,000 Norwegian krone per year subsidy from the government. From 1957, a principal was hired and the school split into three classes. In 1964, a private middle school was established. From 1971, a new school building was taken into use, in time for the introduction of obligatory nine-year education. The new facilities included a gym and a swimming pool. From 1972, teachers were no longer permanently employed, but instead given three-year fixed terms. Ownership and funding of the school was taken over by the Ministry of Education and Research from 1 August 1976. From 1978, upper secondary education was introduced, for which a extension was built. A further was added in 1984. In 1995, an additional was added and the following year, Svalbardhallen, a multi-purpose indoor sports complex, was opened. The same year, the school received an Internet connection. Regular school for six-year-olds started in 1997. In 1999, the school took over the community's music school. A new middle school building was taken into use in 2005, followed by another section for younger students the following year. From 1 January 2007, ownership was taken over by Longyearbyen Community Council. Demographics The student body is highly transient, as working adults in Svalbard usually have two to three year contracts and leave after they finish these contracts. Due to the low population the school emphasizes friendship and dealing with conflicts properly. In 2007 there were 230 pupils; they consisted of Norwegians and those from 12 other countries, including about 10 Thai students. None of the students had originated in Svalbard. Once pupils reach ages 16 or 17 most families move to mainland Norway. Curriculum The curriculum is largely the same as that of mainland Norway. In 2007 students 16 and older took courses on survival in the wilderness.

After becoming overburdened with debt it was rescued by Hanson plc in 1991. A new Beazer Group, comprising solely the UK housebuilding business, was demerged from Hanson in 1994, and bought by Persimmon plc in 2001. History =Early Days= The six generations mentioned above can easily be traced with the help of the Census. George Beazer born c.1783 (refer 1841 and 1851 England census) was living in the little village of Marshfield just outside Chipping Sodbury, and the Beazers stayed there for several generations. George's son Henry (1822) was the first to be designated a mason as was Joseph (1844) and then Jesse (1874). Jesse's work consisted largely of repairs to the farms and properties around the village, though he did manage to finance his own house at the age of only 26, an unusual achievement for a mason in those times.Cyril Beazer, Random Reflections of a West Country Master Craftsman (1981) Jesse had eight children but only one son ‚Äì Cyril H Beazer (1908-1983). Cyril started working for his father at the age of 13, but work was scarce and Cyril later moved to Bath to work for local firms, becoming a mason himself and then a general foreman. In partnership with a local businessman who owned a small plot of land, Cyril built two houses and thus began the building business that was to bear the name C.H.Beazer. During the 1930s Cyril employed no more than a few men and, in World War II was mainly involved in war damage repair work in Bath; until 1944 when he and his men were directed to undertake similar work in London. The early post-war period continued to be dominated by war damage reconstruction in Bath, but the business gradually extended to new build and to the counties around Bath. Reflecting the increased size of the business, C H Beazer (Construction) was incorporated in 1956; Cyril's eldest son, Ralph, joined as a director and the younger brother Brian became a director in 1960. In the event it was Brian Beazer who took over as managing director in 1968 and it was he who turned this small Bath company into an international construction group. =The Acquisition Years= The local firm of Mortimer & Sons, of similar size to C.H. Beazer, was bought, its general construction business complementing what had become Beazer's predominant private housebuilding. In 1971, Beazer made a leap from what had been a predominantly south-west firm by developing a commercial property site in Brussels. Within two years it had property developments in Belgium France and Germany as well as seven schemes in the U.K. Supported by those development profits, in July 1973 C.H. Beazer (Holdings) was floated on the London Stock Exchange, barely months before the onset of the first major post-war recession. Profits fell, there were property write-downs and the dividend was cut in 1976. The years that followed were ones of consolidation before the acquisitions began again at the end of the decade ‚Äì only this time they were on a much larger scale.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. In 1979, Beazer bought the Somerset firm of R.M.Smith, doubling housing output to around 500 a year. Further acquisitions included house builders Monsell Youell and Second City Properties, the property developer M.P. Kent, brick manufacturer Westbrick and prefabricated classroom manufacturer Prattens. By 1984, Beazer had become a volume housebuilder with output of over 2,000 a year. This was doubled the following year with the purchase of William Leech, taking Beazer to number four in the industry. Also in 1985 Beazer made its first foray into the US with the purchase of Cohn Communities, a small housebuilder. A failed attempt to buy the UK's largest scaffolding company was followed by the hotly contested purchase of French Kier, a large domestic and international contractor. This was complemented by the acquisition of contracting businesses in Hong Kong and Australia. But all this was to be overshadowed by Beazer's next steps in the USA. In 1986, Beazer bought the Dallas-based Gifford Hill, the fourth largest cement producer in the US, for ¬£190m. This was quickly followed by the purchase of Koppers for $1.8 billion cash. Koppers was the second largest aggregates business in the USA but it also had a long-standing chemical and wood treatment business with what proved to be significant environmental liabilities. The Beazer group was now financially highly geared and had to face both the worldwide property recession and increasing environmental liabilities ‚Äì the 1989 accounts contained a provision of over $500m, and rising. The Beazer solution was to float off Beazer Europe leaving the US operations, Beazer Homes USA, as a separate business. While the pathfinder prospectus was still being circulated, Beazer received a rescue bid from Hanson plc. Hanson's interest was in the building materials part of Beazer and it quickly sold the Kier construction business. In contrast, Beazer's housing was held through the recession and a new Beazer Group, now consisting solely of UK housebuilding, still the fourth largest in the UK, was floated in 1994.Prospectus March 1994 This Beazer mark 2 made its own modest acquisitions including paying ¬£35.7 million for the upmarket southern housebuilder Charles Church Developments on 13 May 1996 and by the end of the 1990s it was producing around 8,000 houses a year. =Disappearance= At the end of 2000, Beazer Group and Bryant Homes proposed a ‚Äúmerger of equals‚Äù but this was overtaken by a bid for Bryant from Taylor Woodrow. This left Beazer exposed and in 2001 it was acquired by Persimmon plc for ¬£610m.Acquisition Document February 2001 References Category:Housebuilding companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Beazer"},{"id":"35368603","text":"Fight the Bear is a ska/rock band.

He was a Spanish nobleman and a member of the House of Castro.  Family origins  He was the son of Fernando Garc√≠a de Hita, founder of the powerful Castro family, by his wife Estefan√≠a Ermengol, daughter of Ermengol V, Count of Urgell.  Biography  King Alfonso VIII of Castile and Queen Eleonor Plantagenet delivering the city and the village of Ucl√©s to the master of the Order of Santiago Pedro Fernandez de Castro v. Tumbo menor de Castilla, f. 1. (ancient codex from 13th century) Pedro fought in the army of Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile in the conquest of Aurelia and Alharilla in the present day area of Santa Cruz de la Zarza. Later in 1146, he participated in further military campaigns, assisting in the occupation of Baeza and the landings in Almer√≠a. These actions were an important part of the overall military campaign because they devastated the Moorish navy and largely removed them from the war at large. Later, while crusading in the Holy Land, he decided to create a new military order dedicated to protecting the sepulcher of James the Apostle and to protecting the Way of St. James. On 4 August 1165, Pedro, together with his wife, his sister Urraca, and his children, donated a house to abbot Miguel in Santa Cruz de Valc√°rcel for the purpose of founding a monastery dedicated to the principles of the order. The donation was confirmed by his wive's brothers, Nu√±o and √Ålvaro P√©rez de Lara, in addition to G√≥mez Gonz√°lez de Manzanedo, the husband of Pedro's sister-in-law, Milia P√©rez de Lara, as well as his brothers and other members of the Castro family. Later in that year, at the age of 50, Pedro Fern√°ndez officially founded the Order of Santiago in the city of C√°ceres. The spirit of the order was born in the times of the Almohad invasion and is influenced by the Knights Templar, to which Pedro had become acquainted with in the Holy Land. His wife and daughter would later become nuns at the Monastery of Santa Cruz de Valc√°rcel. Francisco de Rades y Andrada, in his chronicles of military orders, records Pedro's death in 1184, being buried in the main chapel of the Convent of San Marcos, Le√≥n.  Marriage and descendants  Pedro Fern√°ndez married Mar√≠a P√©rez de Lara, daughter of count Pedro Gonz√°lez de Lara, with whom he had the following children: * Fernando P√©rez de Castro: known as \\"Potestad\\".

She lives and works between Italy and the United States. Biography She obtained her degree in Philosophy at the University of Pisa (Italy) defending a dissertation with the philosopher Nicola Badaloni. Then she received a PhD in Literature and Film from the University of Chicago. She has taught at Loyola University of Chicago, at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and the University of Rome La Sapienza (Italy). She was Visiting Professor at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles and the Florence campus of the New York University (NYU) Tisch School of Cinema. She was also Distinguished Visiting Professor at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) in Boca Raton. She was Acting Associate Dean at the Loyola University‚Äôs campus in Rome. In 1999 she founded along the philosopher Mario Perniola the magazine Agalma: Magazine of Aesthetic and Cultural Studies of whose editorial committee she is still a member. Since 1986 she has been part of the Italian Bar Association of Journalists and for several years the press attach√© to the Governor of Tuscany Region. Later, she had a TV program about cinema on RaiSat channel titled Metix from the title of one of her books. She has been a guest at numerous Film Festivals in Italy and of several TV and radio cultural programs. She has collaborated with the director Fiorella Infascelli in the movie Italiani presented at the Venice Film Festival in 1998. She has written for the newspaper Il Manifesto. In 2013 she co-founded with Nicola Fano, Gloria Piccioni and Gabriella Mecucci the online culture newspaper Succedeoggi, of which she is a columnist. She holds conferences and seminars at many Italian and foreign institutions. In the last few years, she has combined her theoretical and journalistic work with literary and screenwriting activities. Thought =History of philosophy and politics= The initial period of Camaiti Hostert‚Äôs research focused on the history of political philosophy following the methodological analysis of Nicola Badaloni, under whose tutelage she studied at the University of Pisa. In her first work, Giuseppe Toniolo. Alle origini del partito cattolico (1984; Giuseppe Toniolo. The origins of the Catholic Party) ‚Äì that resulted from her dissertation in Philosophy ‚Äì she traced the intellectual biography of the thinker Giuseppe Toniolo, by retrieving his prominent figure in the Catholic Movement, and casting light on his role in the subsequent foundation of the first Catholic Party in its relationship with the Marxist concept of the main political subject. The same historical-philosophical perspective defines also the second work by Camaiti Hostert titled Politica e diritto di resistenza. Kant ed Erhard: democrazia e libert√† del soggetto (1987, The Politics and the Right of Resistance. Kant and Erhard: Democracy and Human Freedom). In this work Camaiti Hostert has traced the relationship between the German Jacobinism, of which Johann Benjamin Erhard is one of the most representative authors, and Kant‚Äôs theory of Public Right, Political Will and Civil Liberty. Through the concepts of ¬´resistance¬ª and ¬´insurrection¬ª, she interprets Erhard‚Äôs theses as an attempt to build a theory of the antagonistic subject. =Cultural studies and identity theory= Because of her intellectual, academic and existential relation with the United States and with the socio-cultural dynamics of this country, Camaiti Hostert first developed themes related to comparative literature (see for instance her afterword to the American edition of the Dacia Maraini‚Äôs novel, The Silent Duchess, Feminist Press 1998Amatangelo, S. 2002. ¬´Coming to Her Senses: The Journey of the Mother in La Lunga Vita Di Marianna Ucria¬ª. Italica : Bulletin of the American Association of Teachers of Italian. 79) and then has moved towards the Cultural studies with the analysis of the post-colonial theories, especially by focusing on the subaltern subject and on identity construction. Through this research, Camaiti Hostert engages a sometimes critical confrontation with many important cultural theorists like Edward Said, Stuart Hall and Homi K. Bhabha and with political thinkers, like Antonio Gramsci. Her major work in this field of investigation is Passing. Dissolvere le identit√†, superare le differenze (Passing. A Strategy to Dissolve Identities and Remap Differences). Dealing with the complex theme of Alterity as it relates to the Italian women‚Äôs movement, especially to the works of Carla LonziE. Chiti Lucchesi, ¬´Luoghi del non ritorno: sogni, parole e immagini¬ª, in Borghi, Liana, and Uta Treder (eds). Il globale e l'intimo: luoghi del non ritorno. Perugia: Morlacchi, 2007: 59 and the theories of sexual difference, the analysis of Passing tackles the feminist studies, particularly the point of convergence between post-colonial and gender studies (Gayatri C. Spivak, bell hooks, Teresa de Lauretis, Rosi Braidotti) and from that point it expands its reflection to the process of formation of any ethnic and sexual identity.Hardt, Michael, and Antonio Negri. Empire. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 2000: 448Lingel, Jessa. 2009. ¬´Adjusting the Borders: Bisexual Passing and Queer Theory¬ª. Journal of Bisexuality. 9, no. 3-4:381-405 =Visual studies and film theory= Visual Studies - that were born as a field of interdisciplinary research on the wake of the Anglo- American Cultural Studies ‚Äì have become since the late ‚Äò90s the focus of Camaiti Hostert‚Äôs research. In Metix. Cinema globale e cultura visuale (Meltemi 2004, Metix. Global Cinema and Visual Culture) - work that collects Camaiti Hostert‚Äôs findings during those years - she has analyzed the structure of the vision, the dynamics of the gaze and the processes of images production in contemporary cinema (mainly American cinema, but not only Hollywood). Visual Studies in general and Camaiti Hostert‚Äôs work in particular, interpret images not as isolated objects, but as clusters of several practices which change use and meaning of the images themselves: if cinema represents the medium from which Camaiti Hostert‚Äôs analysis has begun, her analysis expands to all visual languages, including TV, advertisings, Internet.Michaud, Marie- Christine. 2012. ¬´Culture populaire et s√©ries t√©l√©vis√©es¬ª. Amerika. no. 6. http://amerika.revues.org/2969 The pivotal passage of the text is the transition from the idea that an image is able to mean something, to the understanding that this ability is tied with the formation of the subject identity. According to Camaiti Hostert‚Äôs theory Visual Studies show the similarities between the analysis of the visual culture and the analysis of the construction of cultural, gender and ethnic identities and differences, with particular attention to the unmasking of visual stereotypes that have represented the various forms of marginality.De Ruggieri, Francesca. Matrix and the city: il corpo ibrido nel cinema e nella cultura visuale. Pisa: ETS, 2006. This work is linked to Camaiti Hostert‚Äôs parallel research into the field of Film Studies.

The settlement was naturally protected by the foothills of Mount Daisen, yet had close access to Miho Bay on the Japan Sea, which is clearly visible from the site. Discovery Construction of a golf course was planned on the site in the early 1990s, but after an examination of the area by the Boards of Education of Daisen and Yodoe, now Yonago City, between 1995 and 1998, a national-level conservation movement sought to protect the area from development. The site was designated a \\"\\" by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, a special body of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The Mukibanda site is protected under the Japanese Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. Excavation Roughly 1/20th of the Mukibanda remains have been excavated.Â¶ªÊú®Êô©Áî∞ÈÅ∫Ë∑°„Å®„ÅØ? The of excavation revealed 395 pit-style dwellings, 502 dwellings with raised cornerstones, and 24 Yayoi-style barrow cliff tombs. This area was inhabited between the late Yayoi to early Kofun period, roughly 100 BC to 300 AD. The east part of the site was occupied by dwellings, and the western part of the site, on higher ground, was used for gravesites. The settlement was active in blacksmithing, bead making, and the production of earthenware pottery. The highest point on the site in the Matsuogashira district of Daisen appears to be the home of the chief of the village and home to the sacred area of the site. The entire site is thought to be the chief village, and possibly capitol, of some type of political entity.

Background The material in question includes 251,287 United States diplomatic cables, over 400,000 classified army reports from the Iraq War (the Iraq War logs), and approximately 90,000 army reports from the war in Afghanistan (the Afghan War logs).

An Article 32 hearing, presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Almanza, was convened on December 16, 2011, at Fort Meade, Maryland, to determine whether to proceed to a court martial. The army was represented by Captains Ashden Fein, Joe Morrow, and Angel Overgaard. Manning was represented by military attorneys Major Matthew Kemkes and Captain Paul Bouchard, and by civilian attorney David Coombs. The hearing resulted in Almanza recommending that Manning be referred to a general court-martial, and on February 3, 2012, the convening authority, Major General Michael Linnington, commander of the Military District of Washington,Linnington was later promoted to Lt. Gen. and became the DoD Deputy Director for Readiness . His replacement at MDW is Maj. Gen. Jeffrey S.

Prosecution evidence The lead prosecutor, Captain Fein, argued that Manning had given enemies \\"unfettered access\\" to the material and had displayed an \\"absolute indifference\\" to classified information. He showed the court a video of Adam Gadahn, an al-Qaeda spokesman, referencing the leaked material.Denver Nicks, Private: Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks, and the Biggest Exposure of Official Secrets in American History, Chicago Review Press, 2012, p. 3. The prosecution presented 300,000 pages of documents in evidence, including chat logs and classified material. Nicks writes that Manning appeared to have taken few security precautions. After Manning's arrest, detectives searched a basement room in Potomac, Maryland, and found an SD card they say contained the Afghan and Iraq War logs, along with a message to WikiLeaks. Investigators said Manning had also left computer trails of Google and Intelink searches, and of using Wget to download documents.Nicks 2012, p. 223. Lieutenant Colonel Almanza heard from two army investigators, Special Agent David Shaver, head of the digital forensics and research branch of the army's Computer Crime Investigative Unit (CCIU), and Mark Johnson, a digital forensics contractor from ManTech International, who works for the CCIU. They testified that they had found 100,000 State Department cables on a computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010; 400,000 U.S. military reports from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan on the SD card; and 10,000 cables on a personal MacBook Pro and storage devices that they said had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted. They also said they had recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric Schmiedl, a Boston mathematician, in which Manning had admitted to being the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack (\\"Collateral Murder\\") video. Johnson said he found a text file called wl-press.txt on an external hard drive in Manning's room in Iraq. The file was created on November 30, 2009, and gave the contact detail in Iceland for WikiLeaks. He said he also recovered 14‚Äì15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on Manning's MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange, using the Adium instant messaging client. The MacBook's log-in password was found to be the encryption key. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club's domain (ccc.de), had names associated with them, Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank. Johnson also said he found SSH logs on the MacBook that showed an SFTP connection, from an IP address that resolved to Manning's aunt's home, to a Swedish IP address with links to WikiLeaks. There was also a text file named \\"Readme\\" attached to the logs, apparently written by Manning: Johnson said there had been two attempts to delete material from the MacBook. The operating system was re-installed in January 2010, and on or around January 31 an attempt was made to erase the hard drive by doing a \\"zero-fill,\\" which involves overwriting material with zeroes. This process was started, cancelled, then started again with a single pass. The material was recovered after the overwrite attempts from unallocated space.The army investigators' testimony Zetter, December 19, 2011 Defense arguments Manning in September 2009 The defense named 48 people it wanted to appear on Manning's behalf. The list was believed to include President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton had said that the diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks \\"did not represent significant consequences to foreign policy.\\" Obama was named because of an April 2011 statement that Manning \\"broke the law\\": Obama's statement was later echoed by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, who said \\"We're a nation of laws. He did violate the law.\\" Manning's lawyers argued that the government had overstated the harm the release of the documents had caused, and had overcharged Manning in order to obtain evidence against Assange. They suggested that other people had had access to Manning's workplace computer, and under cross-examination Shaver acknowledged that some of the 10,000 cables on Manning's personal computer did not match cables published by WikiLeaks. Coombs asked for the dismissal of any charge related to the use of unauthorized software, arguing that Manning's unit had been \\"lawless ... when it comes to information assurance.\\" The defense also raised the issue of whether Manning's gender identity disorder had affected Manning's judgment. Manning had e-mailed master sergeant, Paul Adkins, in April 2010 to say she was suffering from gender confusion and, despite then living as a man, attaching a photograph of herself dressed as a woman. After Manning's arrest, the army found information about hormone replacement therapy in her room, and Manning's commander, Captain Steven Lim, learned that she had been calling herself Breanna. Defense lawyers argued that the superiors had failed to provide adequate counseling, and had not taken disciplinary action or revoke Manning's security clearance. They also suggested that the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy‚Äîwhich was repealed in September 2011‚Äîhad made it difficult for Manning to serve in the army as a gay man.For the prosecution argument about Manning's \\"absolute indifference,\\" and for the defense argument about Manning's unit being \\"lawless,\\" see Serena Marshall, \\"Court Martial for Bradley Manning in Wikileaks Case?\\", ABC News, December 22, 2011. * For the government overcharging Manning, see Kim Zetter, \\"Army Piles on Evidence in Final Arguments in WikiLeaks Hearing\\", Wired, December 22, 2011. * For the gender issues, see Kirit Radia and Luis Martinez, \\"Bradley Manning Defense Reveals Alter Ego Named 'Breanna Manning, ABC News, December 17, 2011. * For Manning facing court martial, see Denver Nicks, \\"Bradley Manning Likely Faces Court Martial\\", The Daily Beast, January 13, 2012. =Defense request to depose six witnesses= After the hearing, in January 2012, Coombs filed a request to depose six witnesses, whose names were redacted in the application, and who are believed to have been involved in classifying the leaked videos. Coombs argues that the videos were not classified at the time they were obtained by WikiLeaks.David Coombs, \\"Request for oral depositions\\", United States v.

She ordered the CIA, FBI, DIA, State Department, and Department of Justice to release documents showing their assessment of whether the leaked material had damaged the national interest of the United States. Lind said she would decide after reading the documents whether to make them available to Manning's lawyers. She also ordered forensic imaging of five computers removed from Manning's work station that had not yet been wiped clean.\\"Bradley Manning Judge to Rule on Request to Drop Charges\\", ABC News, April 24, 2012. * \\"Bradley Manning Defense Challenges Charge of 'Aiding the Enemy, ABC News, April 25, 2012. * \\"No Luck for Bradley Manning: More Motions Denied in WikiLeaks Case\\", ABC News, April 26, 2012. At the start of the hearing, Manning replaced the assigned two military defense lawyers, Major Matthew Kemkes and Captain Paul Bouchard, with Captain Joshua Tooman. The next Article 39 hearing was set for June 6‚Äì8 and trial was set for September 2012. =Petition to the Army Court of Criminal Appeals= The Center for Constitutional Rights filed a petition in May 2012 asking the Army Court of Criminal Appeals to order press and public access to motion papers, orders, and transcripts. Petitioners included Julian Assange, Amy Goodman of Democracy Now!, Chase Madar, author of The Passion of Bradley Manning (2011), and Glenn Greenwald of Salon.David Dishneau, \\"GI Seeks Dismissal of 10 Counts in WikiLeaks Case\\", Associated Press, May 24, 2012. * \\"Constitutional Rights Attorneys, Media Challenge Secrecy Of Manning Court Martial\\", Eurasia Review, May 24, 2012. =Motion to dismiss= On September 19, 2012, Manning's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss all charges with prejudice, arguing that Manning had been unable to obtain a speedy trial.Motion to Dismiss of September 19, 2012 as cited in Nathan Fuller (September 29, 2012) \\"The government has made an 'absolute mockery' of Bradley Manning's right to a speedy trial\\" BradleyManning.org The motion claimed that the 845 days spent in pretrial confinement was longer than the periods that the law says is unreasonable.Adam Klasfeld, \\"Landmark Delays in Manning Court-Martial, Lawyer Says\\" Courthouse News Service, October 1, 2012. (United States military law normally requires a trial within 120 days.Adam Klasfeld, \\"Judges Doubt Need for Secrecy in Bradley Manning Court-Martial\\" Courthouse News Service, October 10, 2012.) Judge Lind ruled against the defense motion and allowed for the delay because the prosecution needed more time to prepare its case. =Initial plea= Audio recording of an excerpt of Manning's statement given on February 28, 2013 On February 28, 2013, Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 specified charges. Military judge Colonel Denise Lind accepted the guilty pleas, for which Manning could face up to 20 years in prison. Manning did not plead guilty to the most significant charge of aiding the enemy.\\"Bradley Manning pleads guilty to some Wikileaks charges\\", BBC News, February 28, 2013. Manning acknowledged having provided archives of military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks. She pleaded guilty to 10 criminal counts in connection with the material leaked, which included videos of airstrikes in Iraq and Afghanistan in which civilians were killed, logs of military incident reports, assessment files of detainees held at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, and a quarter-million cables from American diplomats stationed around the world. Manning read a statement recounting how she joined the military, became an intelligence analyst in Iraq, decided that certain files should become known to the American public to prompt a wider debate about foreign policy, downloaded them from a secure computer network and then ultimately uploaded them to WikiLeaks. When the judge asked Manning to explain how she could admit that her actions were wrong, Manning replied, \\"Your Honor, regardless of my opinion or my assessment of documents such as these, it's beyond my pay grade‚Äîit's not my authority to make these decisions about releasing confidential files.\\" An audio recording of Manning's statement was released by journalist Glenn Greenwald on March 12, 2013.Glenn Greenwald, \\"Finally: hear Bradley Manning in his own voice\\", The Guardian, March 12, 2013. Manning put the files on a camera digital storage card and took it home on a leave in early 2010. Manning then decided to give the files to a newspaper, first calling The Washington Post. Next, The New York Times was contacted and an unanswered voice mail message was left. In January 2010, Manning called the public editor's line at Bloomberg News, but got no response. Manning then copied the files and uploaded them to WikiLeaks, through its website, using a directory the group designated as a \\"cloud drop box\\" server. Manning was frustrated that WikiLeaks did not publish files about 15 people who printed \\"anti-Iraqi\\" pamphlets. After uploading the files, Manning was engaged in more online conversations with someone from WikiLeaks, who Manning thought was a senior figure, like Julian Assange. In retrospect, Manning described the relationship as \\"artificial.\\" Trial The trial began on June 3, 2013, at Fort Meade, Maryland, before Colonel Denise Lind, chief judge, U.S. Army Trial Judiciary, 1st Judicial Circuit.Judge Advocate General Corps website , last updated September 24, 2012, retrieved July 23, 2013. Opening for the prosecution, Captain Joe Morrow accused Manning of having \\"harvested\\" hundreds of thousands of documents from secure networks, then making them available within hours to the US's enemies by dumping them on the Internet: \\"This is a case about what happens when arrogance meets access to classified information,\\" he said.Paul McGeough, \\"WikiLeaks trial begins on a low-note\\", Sydney Morning Herald, June 4, 2013. For the defense, Coombs described Manning as \\"young, na√Øve and good intentioned.\\" Coombs recounted an incident in which a convoy was hit by an IED, which U.S. troops were relieved did not result in any American fatalities. Manning was reportedly disturbed by her comrades' lack of sympathy upon later learning that an Iraqi civilian had been killed in the incident. Coombs said that by releasing material she felt the public should see, Manning had hoped to make a difference. Manning additionally believed that much of the information she released was \\"already basically in the public domain,\\" and that it was of historical importance. On July 2, at the trial's 14th day of sessions, prosecutors rested their case, having presented testimony from 80 witnesses and evidence showing that Manning's training repeatedly instructed her to not give classified information to unauthorized people. The government also presented evidence that Osama bin Laden asked for and received from an associate the Afghanistan battlefield reports WikiLeaks published,David Dishneau & Pauline Jelinek, \\"Prosecution rests in Manning's WikiLeaks trial\\", Associated Press, July 2, 2013. and that al-Qaeda leaders reveled in WikiLeaks' publication of reams of classified U.S. documents, urging members to study them before devising ways to attack the United States. On July 10, the defense rested its case after presenting evidence from 10 witnesses. Manning did not take the stand. Attempting to undercut the most serious charge against Manning‚Äîaiding the enemy‚Äîdefense lawyers called Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler, who testified that until WikiLeaks started publishing the material Manning leaked, even The Pentagon apparently viewed the anti-secrecy website as a legitimate journalistic enterprise. Thereafter, said Benkler, the public, the military and traditional news media perceived WikiLeaks as a group that supported terrorism.Associated Press, \\"Bradley Manning's defense rests its case in WikiLeaks scandal\\", Los Angeles Times, July 10, 2013. On July 18, Judge Lind rejected a defense motion to dismiss the charge of aiding the enemy, citing Manning's extensive training as an intelligence analyst and the sheer volume of records that were leaked as reasons to allow the charge to proceed. In its rebuttal case, the prosecution entered three tweets from WikiLeaks that Manning may have viewed to show that the organization was not a legitimate journalistic enterprise. In surrebuttal, the defense entered articles into evidence depicting WikiLeaks as an important journalism outlet, a platform \\"just as important as\\" the Freedom of Information Act (United States).Julie Tate, \\"Judge in Bradley Manning trial rejects motion to dismiss key charge\\", The Washington Post, July 18, 2013. On July 25, chief prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein delivered the government's closing argument, portraying Manning as an \\"anarchist\\" who sought to \\"make a splash\\" by providing vast archives of secret documents to WikiLeaks. Arguing that Manning must be found guilty of aiding the enemy, Fein said, \\"He was not a whistleblower. He was a traitor, a traitor who understood the value of compromised information in the hands of the enemy and took deliberate steps to ensure that they, along with the world, received it.\\" Fein contended that Manning's \\"wholesale and indiscriminate compromise of hundreds of thousands of classified documents\\" for release by the WikiLeaks staff, whom he called \\"essentially information anarchists,\\" was not an ordinary journalistic disclosure but a bid for \\"notoriety, although in a clandestine form.\\" Fein addressed the court for nearly six hours. The next day, defense attorney Coombs countered with his own closing argument, portraying Manning as \\"a young, na√Øve, but good-intentioned soldier who had human life and his humanist beliefs center to his decisions, whose sole focus was, 'Maybe I just can make a difference, maybe make a change. Coombs said his client released only files she believed would cause no harm yet spark debate and prompt change, and that if Manning had not been selective, she would have leaked much more. Playing excerpts from the Baghdad helicopter attack (\\"Collateral Murder\\") video that Manning admitted supplying to WikiLeaks, Coombs told Judge Lind: \\"When the court looks at this, the defense requests that you not disengage, that you not look at this from the eyes of 'this happened on a battlefield.' Did they all deserve to die? That is what Private Manning is thinking as he is watching this video he is seeing, and he's questioning.\\" With closing arguments concluded, Col. Lind began her deliberations. Manning chose to have her court-martial heard by the judge only instead of a jury.David Dishneau, \\"Bradley Manning Trial Begins 3 Years After Arrest\\", Associated Press, June 3, 2013. Findings On July 30, 2013, Judge Lind issued her findings regarding the charges. Manning was acquitted of aiding the enemy by knowingly giving out intelligence through indirect means, and was convicted of 19 of the 21 or 22 specified charges, including theft and six counts of espionage. The hearing on sentencing began on July 31, 2013. The maximum sentence that Manning could have faced was 136 years' imprisonment. This was subsequently reduced to 90 years after the military court granted the defense's motion to merge some of the 20 counts that Manning was being charged with on the grounds that they overlapped. Sentencing The judge ruled in January 2013 that Manning's sentence would be reduced by 112 days because of treatment during confinement at Quantico.Tate, Julie and Nakashima, Ellen. \\"Judge refuses to dismiss charges against WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning\\", The Washington Post, January 8, 2013.

Michael Worsley, testified that Manning had been left isolated in the army, trying to deal with gender-identity issues in a \\"hyper-masculine environment.\\" On August 14 during the sentencing hearing, Manning apologized for past actions, telling the court: \\"I am sorry that my actions hurt people. I'm sorry that they hurt the United States. I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions. When I made these decisions I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people. ... At the time of my decisions I was dealing with a lot of issues.\\"Kube, Courtney; DeLuca, Matthew; McClam, Erin. \\"'I'm sorry that I hurt the United States': Bradley Manning apologizes in court\\", NBC News, August 14, 2013. * Courson, Paul.

Manning was given credit of 1,293 days (3 years and 6 months) served in pre-trial confinement, and may be eligible for parole after serving one-third of the sentence. Manning was also reduced to the lowest enlisted pay grade (E-1), forfeited all pay and allowances, and given a dishonorable discharge. Petition for commutation of sentence On September 3, 2013, Manning's attorney announced that he had filed on his client's behalf a Petition for Commutation of Sentence, submitted with a letter to the Secretary of the Army and, through the Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney, to President Obama, seeking a presidential pardon.Simpson, Ian. \\"Manning seeks presidential pardon in WikiLeaks case\\", Reuters, September 4, 2013. On January 17, 2017, President Obama commuted Manning's sentence to a total of 7 years confinement, starting with the initial date of arrest. As a result of the commutation Manning was released on May 17, 2017. Appeal On May 31, 2018, the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals upheld Manning's 2013 court-martial conviction of violating the Espionage Act. The court rejected Manning's contention that the statute is too vague to provide fair notice of the criminal nature of disclosing classified documents. \\"The facts of this case,\\" the three-judge panel ruled, \\"leave no question as to what constituted national defense information. Appellant's training and experience indicate, without any doubt, she was on notice and understood the nature of the information she was disclosing and how its disclosure could negatively affect national defense.\\" The court also rejected Manning's assertion that her actions in disclosing classified information related to national security are protected by the First Amendment. Manning, the court found, \\"had no First Amendment right to make the disclosures‚Äîdoing so not only violated the nondisclosure agreements she signed, but also jeopardized national security.\\" See also ;Material alleged to have been leaked * Afghan War logs * Iraq War logs * Guantanamo Bay files leak * United States diplomatic cables leak * \\"Collateral Murder\\" video * Granai airstrike video ;Miscellaneous * Information published by WikiLeaks * Military Whistleblower Protection Act * United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces Notes Further reading ;Articles * Carbone, Christopher. \\"Have gay rights groups abandoned Bradley Manning?\\" The Guardian.

Biswabasu found this stone and felt its divinity. So he started worshiping it and name it Lord Nila Madhava. This brahma was later fetched by King Indradyumna by Brahmin Bidyapati for the creation of Lord Jagannath's idol. It has been kept inside a small chamber inside the Lords idol. It is believed that it is still present inside the Lord's idol and is transferred to the new idol after every 12 years. The Puranic text Purusottama Mahatmyahttp://amritasinha.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/1782/ of the Skanda Puarana contains the Indradyumna legend and the origin of Jagannatha‚Äôs wooden idol at Puri. According to the legends, in the Satya yuga, Indradyumna was a Lunar Dynasty king of Somavamsa lineage. A traveling pilgrim came before Indradyumna and described the great God Nila Madhava (Blue Vishnu) being worshipped at Nilachal (Blue Mountain) in Odra (Odisha). The pilgrim disappeared after telling the story. At the king‚Äôs request, his priest and his younger brother Bidyapati went in search of the legendary divinity. Bidyapati reached the forest in Sabaradwipa on the banks of the river Mahanadi. The Sabara king, Biswabasu, received Bidyapati and promised to show him Nila Madhava the next morning. Bidyapati did not touch food or water before seeing the Lord. Seeing the eagerness of Bidyapati, the Sabara king had him bathed in Rohini-kunda and seated him under the kalpaw tree. There Bidyapati saw Nila Madhava being worshipped by the Devas. Then Bidyapati returned to Avanti, the capital of King Indradyumna. After listening to Bidyapati‚Äôs account, Indradyumna set out for Nila Madhava, along with the priest, Bidyapati, and his followers. But as it turned out, Nila Madhava had disappeared on the very day that Bidyapati had returned to Malaba. Upon reaching the spot, they found the god missing and the entire area covered with the golden sand of the coast. The shocked king Indradyumna was apprised of the message of Brahma by Narada: that the King must worship the deity with one thousand Aswamedha yajnas. The divination of Nila Madhava went on: \`‚ÄúIn this world I will not give you Dar≈õana in the form of Nila Madhava, but I will manifest in four forms: Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra, and Sudarshan Chakra. Wait near Chakra tirtha, and a daaru would come afloat. I will manifest in the form of a very large, fragrant, reddish log, and the signs of sankhaw, cakraw, gada, and padma will be seen everywhere on that form. Go there. Take Me out and make four deities from that log. Then you will be able to worship Me.‚Äù\` Upon receiving the devotion of the King, the Purusottama himself took the form of Visvakarma and secretly made the idols of daru (wood). Thereafter, Brahma himself established the holy idols on Baishakhaw Sukla, on Pushya star. The traditional version lacks historical support, as the identity of Nila Madhava remains unclear. For this reason, this traditional account of the emergence and origin of Jagannath worship remains a myth only. However, a Nilamadhav Temple is in the Kantilo town of Nayagarh, Odisha, Nilamadhav Temple dedicated to a deity named Nila Madhava, of uncertain genealogy.

Plot The new Guillemins station in Li√®ge was a huge project undertaken by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, who had already directed construction of stations in Zurich, Lisbon and Lyon. The site presented many challenges. The film follows the project from start to end over a nine-year period. It documents the issues, frictions and tension of the project as well as the pride and enthusiasm of the people involved. The result was a modern cathedral of European high-speed rail. The project was controversial, being criticized as being too grandiose, too expensive to maintain and not well-adapted to the Belgian climate. In the process many old buildings were destroyed and the whole neighborhood was disrupted. Reception The film was shown at the Cork Film Festival in November 2010. It has been called a unique experience which Thierry Michel reveals each of the key moments that made a utopia into reality. However, a reviewer complained about the lack of background on what led up to the project and lack of analysis of the impact of the station, saying Thierry Michel's film is nothing but a tissue of anecdotes. Another says that, fascinated by the technical challenges, Thierry Michel sees the men involved with a less clear eye. He portrays Santiago Calatrava as a man of dazzling ideas, but does not show how he is involved in the realities of the work. The prime contractor, Vincent Bourlard, is shown as having endless energy, perhaps more than is realistic.

Early life Heathwood was born and grew up in Belfast, County Down, Northern Ireland and is a British citizen. Leaving school at sixteen he originally trained as a television repairman. He has claimed to have been heavily involved in Belfast the punk scene in the late 1970s and has said that this period had a profound effect on his view of the world. After marrying for the first time in 1979, he took up photography as a hobby. Early work Almost immediately after he started photography Heathwood was exposed to the artistic and communicative aspects of the medium. His early influences were photographers such as Bill Brandt, Eve Arnold, Arnold Newman and Ralph Gibson. Working in black and white and producing his prints from a home darkroom he worked on a documentary project about the retired shipbuilding community of his city. This led to his first exhibition at the Age Concern Offices in Belfast. He also started photographing women in their own environments. Eventually this led him to take up a course of study at Napier Polytechnic of Edinburgh on their BA Degree in Photographic Studies in 1988, graduating in June 1991. While there his work split mainly into two categories; a documentary piece on transsexualism, the subject of his dissertation, and studio work on fetish and sexual roleplay. The mid-80s had seen the publication of 'Dark Summer' by Bob Carlos Clarke which had a profound effect on Heathwood's development as a photographer. His degree show at Edinburgh's Filmhouse was the first time his fetish-related imagery was shown to the public and this was followed by a solo show at the capital's City Caf√©. Before leaving Scotland with his future second wife Heathwood exhibited his transsexual documentary at the Antiquary, Edinburgh 1992. ONCE Based in Dublin, Ireland, since 1992 Heathwood continued working on fetish-related imagery and in 1994 began teaching photography. He also worked freelance as a commercial and editorial photographer. In 2001 Heathwood launched 'ONCE' which was Ireland's first exhibition of erotic art and expanded this into 'ONCE(again)' in 2003. This piece was featured in Amateur Photographer, Jade and Secret magazines and was shown in the Association of Erotic Artists' annual show in London and the Coffee,Cake&Kink; gallery in that city's Covent Garden. HOME CoffeeCake&Kink; commissioned Heathwood to create a show specifically for their exhibition space in Covent Garden. This became 'HOME' in 2006, an inquiry into how models in the given space occupy and control the composition to erotic effect. This piece stemmed from the experiences Heathwood had gained shooting for Suicide Girls, he was the first photographer in Ireland to feature work on this famous site. Again extracts from this work found their way onto the pages of Amateur Photographer, Jade and Secret magazines. SPOTLITE Taking the narrative and spatial themes from the previous exhibitions, along with Hollywood-style glamour portraits he'd completed, Heathwood produced 'SPOTLITE' . A studio-based piece where the glare of a super trouper is used to define a single time and place in which he captures his photographs. In this work Heathwood's models wear fetish, glamour and burlesque outfits to reflect the different inspirations he has gained from his prior experiences. He has said in interview that he felt 'SPOTLITE' was him finally speaking with his own photographic voice, in a way that was specific to him and not an extension of his influences. After introducing the work at CoffeeCake&Kink; in 2008 it was given a six-page feature and front cover in the UK's largest selling amateur photography photographic magazine, Amateur Photographer. Elements from 'SPOTLITE' are held in permanent exhibitions in the UK and USA and were published in Jade and Griff International magazines. Current work Working as a full-time lecturer in photography has allowed Heathwood to drop his commercial practice and concentrate on exhibiting and self-publishing. Previously Lustre Press, Ireland, has published the titles ‚ÄòONCE‚Äô (2010), ‚ÄòHOME‚Äô (2010), ‚ÄòWhatcha Wearin?‚Äô (2011) and ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs Your Daddy‚Äô (2011).

Biography Grinbergs was born on January 25, 1911 in St. Petersburg, the son of a Lutheran bishop from Latvia. Latvia became independent from Russia in 1917, and on the death of his father in 1923, Grinbergs' family returned to Riga, taking Grinbergs with them. In 1927, he won a high school mathematics competition, the prize for which was to study in Lille, France. He then studied mathematics at the University of Latvia beginning in 1930. On graduating in 1934, he won a prize that again funded study in France; he did graduate studies in 1935 and 1936 at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, during which he published his first paper, in geometry. He returned to the University of Latvia as a privatdozent in 1937, and joined the faculty as a dozent in 1940. His lectures at that time covered subjects including geometry, probability theory, and group theory. While there, he defended a thesis in geometry at the University of Latvia in 1943, entitled On Oscillations, Superoscillations and Characteristic Points. In the meantime, the Soviet Union had annexed Latvia in 1940, and the army of Nazi Germany had occupied it and incorporated it into the Reichskommissariat Ostland. Grinbergs was drafted into the Latvian Legion, part of the German military, in 1944. After the war, because of his service as a German soldier, he was held prisoner in a camp in Kutaisi, Georgia, until 1946; he lost his university position, and his doctorate (awarded during the German occupation) was annulled. Grinbergs returned to Latvia, where he became a factory worker in the Radiotehnika radio factory, while continuing to be interrogated regularly by the KGB. He developed mathematical models of electrical circuits, which he wrote up as a second thesis, Problems of analysis and synthesis of simple linear circuits, his defense of which earned him a candidate degree.Dambitis and Taimina write that he defended this thesis in 1960, but the date given by ≈†ostak and MacTutor is 1956. In 1954, Grinbergs was allowed to return to the University of Latvia faculty. In 1956, he joined the Institute of Physics of the Latvian Academy of Sciences, and in 1960, he began working at the Computer Center of the University of Latvia, where he remained for the rest of his career, eventually becoming Chief Scientist there. Research A non-Hamiltonian planar graph found by Grinbergs Grinbergs' initial research interests were in geometry, and later shifted to graph theory. With professors Arins and Daube at the University of Latvia, Grinbergs was one of the first to work in applied mathematics and computer science in Latvia. Grinbergs and his collaborators wrote many papers on the design of electrical circuits and electronic filters, stemming from his radio work. He earned the State Prize of the Latvian SSR in 1980 for his research on nonlinear electronic circuit theory. Another early line of research by Grinbergs at the Computer Center concerned the automated design of ship hulls, and the computations with spline curves and surfaces needed in this design. The goal of this research was to calculate patterns for cutting and then bending flat steel plates so that they could be welded together to form ship hulls without the need for additional machining after the bending step; the methods developed by Grinbergs were later used throughout the Soviet Union. In graph theory, Grinbergs is best known for Grinberg's theorem, a necessary condition for a planar graph to have a Hamiltonian cycle that has been frequently used to find non-Hamiltonian planar graphs with other special properties.. His researches in graph theory also concerned graph coloring, graph isomorphism, cycles in directed graphs, and a counterexample to a conjecture of Andr√°s √Åd√°m on the number of cycles in tournaments. Other topics in Grinbergs' research include Steiner triple systems, magnetohydrodynamics, operations research, and the mathematical modeling of hydrocarbon exploration.

Two psychiatric reports with conflicting conclusions were submitted prior to the trial, leading to questions about the soundness and future role of forensic psychiatry in Norway. Background On 25 July 2011, Breivik was charged with violating paragraph 147a of the Norwegian criminal code, \\"destabilising or destroying basic functions of society\\" and \\"creating serious fear in the population\\", both acts of terrorism under Norwegian law. Forensic psychiatrists Torgeir Husby and Synne S√∏rheim, who conducted the psychiatric analysis of Breivik and released their report in December 2011, found that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, supporting a would-be insanity defence or criminal insanity ruling by the court. However, subject to massive criticism from legal and psychiatric experts, the court decided to appoint two new psychiatrists, Terje T√∏rrissen and Agnar Aspaas, who were to conduct another analysis. Breivik was initially uncooperative with the new psychiatrists because of the previous report having been leaked to the media, but he later changed his mind and decided to cooperate.Breivik sier ja til ny psykiater-vurdering 15 February 2012, Dagbladet] Retrieved 16 April 2012 On 10 April 2012, psychiatrists found that Breivik was legally sane.

The thrower was Hayder Mustafa Qasim, an Iraqi who was the brother of Karar Mustafa Qasim, one of the victims who had been killed at Ut√∏ya. Shoe throwing is a mark of extreme contempt in Arab culture, signifying that the target is worth no more than the dirt that one steps in. Footage of the incident was not permitted to be released. =Day 23 (23 May)= Survivors of the attacks on the island continued to give testimony, including a number of teenaged girls. Fifteen-year-old Ylva Helene Schwenke was aged 14 when the attacks occurred and took four bullets. She is physically scarred and showed this to the courtroom at large. She commented on this saying her scars were \\"the price for democracy\\" because she feels democracy has prevailed. Apparently this commentary caused Breivik to grin. Breivik also smiled when he was described by another prosecution witness, an 18-year-old girl who remained anonymous, as being \\"an idiot\\". 17-year-old Andrine Johansen testified as to how she believes one of her friends took a bullet that would have killed her, and thus sacrificed his own life to save hers. She had witnessed Breivik killing 14 people, several of whom were her personal friends. Johansen described the defendant actually holding his gun to a victim's head and pulling the trigger. Johansen told how she had already been shot in the chest, and had fallen into the lake. Once the others had been killed, Breivik returned his attention to her, allegedly smiling. A victim named Henrik Rasmussen is said to have jumped into the line of fire, thus sacrificing his life for Johansen, whilst \\"Breivik had laughed with joy as he continued with the bloodbath...[during which narrative]...the accused shook his head at the description\\". =Day 24 (24 May)= More prosecution witnesses testified. Mathias Eckhoff aged 21 had been shot in the thighs and his scrotum. Eckhoff and others had met at the caf√©/pumphouse on the island to discuss the bombings in Oslo, and that is when Breivik arrived. When the group encountered Breivik outside, Eckhoff says he had demanded to see Breivik's ID as he was dressed as a police officer and was informing them the bomber had yet been apprehended. Breivik is said to have opened fire, and then Eckhoff was shot, and escaped by jumping into the water. Eckhoff said he could not use his legs which had been shot, only his arms. Mohamad Hadi Hamed also aged 21 was the second witness of the day. He had asked if Breivik could be removed from the courtroom whilst he was testifying. He was wheelchair-bound. He had been in the group that were opened fire upon by Breivik at the pumphouse along with Eckhoff. Hamed had been shot in the abdomen, shoulder and thigh, and had an arm and a leg amputated as a result of his injuries. =Day 25 (25 May)= When Adrian Pracon testified about his meeting with Breivik at Ut√∏ya, he looked steadfastly at the defendant, even when answering questions from the prosecutor. Breivik was visibly uncomfortable and only looked back at the witness in brief glimpses. \\"Breivik made an error when he decided to spare me, seen from his perspective. Now I really understand how fragile our society is,\\" Pracon testified. \\"I see how much it is worth and the importance of politics. I will continue with politics, and the Labour Party remains closer to my heart.\\" Pracon is the only witness who has looked at the defendant in this way. He was first shot in the shoulder, then the attacker decided not to shoot him. Breivik has testified earlier about why he decided not to kill Pracon. =Day 36 (5 June)= Defence lawyers for Breivik, trying to portray him as not insane, invited right-wing extremists to testify at the trial. Among the witnesses were Tore Tvedt, founder of the group Vigrid, and Arne Tumyr of the organisation Stop Islamisation of Norway (SIAN). They argued that there are people who share Breivik's political views, yet are not insane. Many of the extremists called echoed Breivik's political views; one said that \\"Islam is an evil political ideology disguised as a religion.\\" However, they distanced themselves from Breivik's alleged violent actions. Court-appointed psychiatrists =Day 37‚Äì38 (14‚Äì15 June)= Court-appointed psychiatrists Husby and S√∏rheim acknowledge no competence on terrorism and explain that they have evaluated Breivik without putting him into a political context. Without this context, the language he uses becomes incomprehensible (neologisms), his lack of remorse towards the victims becomes lack of empathy, his long period of isolation and preparation becomes inadequate functioning, and his explanations of why he carried out the operation become delusions and fantasies about violence. In this manner, his political ideology and the way he sees himself in the context of this ideology becomes evidence of paranoid schizophrenia. The defence says that they would understand the psychotic evaluation if Breivik had been talking about invaders from Mars, but find it difficult to understand how thoughts about a possible future Muslim invasion of Europe should be seen as a strong indication of schizophrenia. When asked what makes Breivik different from a \\"normal\\" terrorist, Husby and S√∏rheim say that they have no knowledge of how terrorists think, and find such comparative analysis not relevant to the mandate for their evaluation. =Day 39‚Äì40 (18‚Äì19 June)= Court-appointed psychiatrists Aspaas and T√∏rrissen acknowledge the political context of Breivik's thoughts and actions, and thus see no sign of psychosis. As they see the defendant, he is not clinically insane but a political terrorist with a psychological profile that makes it possible to understand how he was capable of carrying out the terror operation. Closing speeches The central theme of the defence closing speech was that Breivik, who never denied the facts of the case, is sane and should therefore not be committed to psychiatric care. The prosecutor, Svein Holden, had argued that since the first psychiatric report was written in a non-falsifiable manner, it is impossible to disprove that Breivik is insane, and it then follows that he should be committed to psychiatric care because there would be more harm in sentencing a psychotic person to ordinary prison than a non-psychotic person to a psychiatric facility.Defence lawyer argue Norway killer Breivik is sane 22 June 2012 BBC News Retrieved 22 June 2012 =Day 43 (22 June)= On the last day of the trial Breivik delivered a 45-minute defence speech summarising the trial from his perspective. The court had decided to refuse video or audio transmission of this speech and rejected appeals from the Norwegian media to reverse this. Bootleg recording On 26 July, it became known that a bootleg recording of this speech had been posted on the video-sharing site YouTube. According to Agence France-Presse, the video had been posted by a German man who stated that he had received the video from an elected member of the Norwegian Progress Party. According to Norwegian news media, it was a Norwegian man who originally posted the recording on YouTube on 27 June. The man, who told media he didn't know he was breaking the law, subsequently removed the video from his YouTube account. Coordinating counsel for the aggrieved Mette Yvonne Larsen petitioned Oslo District Court to have the video removed from YouTube, which according to them is not fit for publication since it contains incitement to commit criminal acts. Verdict and sentencing On 24 August 2012, beginning approximately 10am CEST, the court formally began to read the verdict against Anders Behring Breivik. Breivik was adjudged sane and sentenced to containment‚Äîa special form of a prison sentence that can be extended indefinitely‚Äîwith a time frame of 21 years and a minimum time of 10 years, the maximum penalty in Norway. Explaining why the court found Breivik to be sane, the court stated that \\"many people share Breivik's conspiracy theory, including the Eurabia theory. The court finds that very few people, however, share Breivik's idea that the alleged \\"Islamization\\" should be fought with terror.\\"Smilende Breivik forn√∏yd med dommen , nettavisen.no, 24.08.12 When asked by the judge whether he accepted the verdict and sentence, Breivik announced that he did not recognise the legitimacy of the court, and would therefore neither accept nor appeal. His attempt at addressing other \\"militant nationalists\\" in Norway and Europe was interrupted by the judge. Lacking a formal acceptance of the sentence, the judge formally interpreted this as taking a two-week contemplation period, but Breivik's attorney said there would be no appeal from the defence. At a press conference after the verdict, the prosecuting attorneys announced that they would not appeal either. Commentary on the proceedings Some news outlets in the United States have expressed wonder at apparent concessions being given to the defendant. Both the fact that he is allowed five full days to give his testimony, elaborating on his ideology, as well as court-room interactions where both the prosecutors and counsel for the aggrieved shook the defendant's hand at the beginning of the proceedings baffled some commentators but to others showed that the Norwegian court system is capable of respecting all people. Research has shown that in Norway the proceedings of the trial had a positive impact on the coping mechanisms in society. Moreover, the trial proceedings were seen as a positive counter-weight to Breivik's acts by most Norwegians.

The Cauvery River passes through its midst. An area of was established as Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary on 14 January 1987 under Section 18 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 with the objective of providing protection, conservation and development of Wildlife and its environment. The sanctuary was expanded to its current area of in 2013. On its east, it adjoins Dharmapuri forest division of Tamil Nadu state. Geography The sanctuary, established on 14 January 1987 under Section 18 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1973, is spread over an area of It lies in an elevation range of (‚ÄúPonnachi Betta‚Äù is the highest mountain in the centre of the sanctuary) with its northern and southern boundary delimited by the Cauvery River on the Eastern Ghats, which drains from west to east. Its eastern and northeastern borders are bounded by the Tamil Nadu state. The river forms the interstate boundary between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states over a river reach of with dense forests on both banks. The sanctuary is named after the Cauvery River which flows through it over a total length of . Important places along the river stretch flowing through the sanctuary covering its forested central and eastern parts are the Hogenakal Falls (meaning: \\"smoking rock\\" in Kannada language), Mekedatu (meaning: \\"goats leap\\"), and Sangam (confluence with the Arkavathi River. An important religious centre within the sanctuary is Muthathi Anjaneya temple. Also located within the sanctuary are an ecotourism fishing resort and the Cauvery Fishing Camp at Bhimeshwari. The sanctuary is managed by the Deputy Conservator of Forests with four wildlife ranges at Kanakapura, Hanur, Cowdally and MM Hills wildlife ranges. The reserve forests, which are part of the sanctuary, are the Basavanabetta S.F (), the Chilandavadi S.F (), the Muggur S.F (), the Chikkayalur S.F (), and the Mahadeswara Reserve Forest (). The boundary of the sanctuary is well demarcated with the surrounding border areas consisting of agricultural lands and forests; the bordering forest areas are: the Kollegal forest division to its west and south, Mandya and Ramanagaram forest divisions to its north, and Dharmapuri Forest division of Tamil Nadu state to its east. Human habitation inside the sanctuary and within radius of the sanctuary consists of eight enclosed villages and 30 villages respectively with a total population of 39,000 whose main occupation is agriculture. Along the boundary of the sanctuary, a trench is excavated to prevent elephant migration to neighbouring villages and to check damage to agricultural lands. Climate Map showing Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary The sanctuary has a semi-arid climate, where the average temperatures are a minimum of and maximum of , and during summer it touches a maximum of . The sanctuary receives rainfall both during the Northeast monsoon and Southwest monsoon. The rainfall varies between and . Biology and ecology The sanctuary mainly consists of dry deciduous forest, southern tropical dry thorn and riverine forests. Hardwickia binata and Albizia amara are the dominant forest types. There is hardly any vegetation in the northwestern part while good forests exist in the rest of the sanctuary. =Flora= The dominant species of trees found in this sanctuary are Terminalia arjuna and jambul (Syzygium cumini). Other tree species in the sanctuary are Albizia amara, Feronia sp., Tamarindus indica, Mangifera indica, Hardwickia binata, Acacia amata, and several other species of acacia, Feronia and Ficus. =Fauna= Grizzled giant squirrel in the Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary It is home to mammals like tiger (Panthera tigris), elephant (Elephas maximus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), leopard (Panthera pardus), dhole, spotted deer (Axis axis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), sambar (Cervus unicolor), four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), black-naped hare (Lepus nigricollis), chevrotain, common langur, bonnet macaque, honey badger (ratel)S.Gubbi,V.Reddy,H.Nagashettihalli,R.Bhat and M.D.Madhusudhan (2014) \\"Photographic Records of the Ratel Mellivora capensis from the Southern Indian State of Karnataka\\" published in: Small Carnivore Conservation, Vol.50, July 2014 malabar giant squirrel (Ratufa indica maxima), grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura) which is under the highly endangered category in the state of Karnataka (but under IUCN Red List as near threatened), smooth-coated otter (Lutra lutra)Shenoy, Kausalya and Varma, Surendra and Devi Prasad, KV (2006) Factors determining habitat choice of the smooth-coated otter, Lutra perspicillata in a South Indian river system. In: Current Science, 91 (5). pp. 637‚Äì643 The smooth-coated otter sites in the sanctuary‚Äôs river reach were specifically studied. It was noted that the otters inhabited riverine areas which were loosely packed sand and rock without compacted sand, rocks, gravel, and plant cover. The river Cauvery is also habitat for various species of reptiles like the mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), Indian mud turtles (Chelonia sp.). Reptile species in the sanctuary are Indian rock python (Python molurus), Indian cobra (Naja naja), Russell‚Äôs viper (Daboia russelii) and banded krait (Bungarus fasciatus). This is also one of the few places to find the IUCN Red List Critically Endangered hump-backed mahseer (Tor remadevii ) fish. It was also, previously, part of the distribution of the Critically Endangered Nilgiri Mystus (Hemibagrus punctatus), known locally as haddu. =Avifauna= The sanctuary is listed as an IBA assessed bird area by the BirdLife International in 2004 which extends over the same semiarid area as the sanctuary. The two most endangered species in the sanctuary are Gyps species of vultures ‚Äì the white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) and Indian vulture (Gyps indicus). The four vulnerable species reported are Nilgiri wood- pigeon (Columba elphinstonii), greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), white- naped tit (Parus nuchalis) and yellow-throated bulbul (Pycnonotus xantholaemus). Other bird species reported are 25 species of Malayan Tropical Dry Zone which includes the near threatened red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus). The species of least concern reported here is the resident white- bellied blue-flycatcher (Cyornis pallipes). In a recent bird survey carried out in the sanctuary, reported in January 2014, the total number of bird species identified in the park are 280, which include 19 new species. Some of the notable species reported are: Indian courser, Malabar parakeet, large- billed leaf warbler, green leaf-warbler, western crowned leaf warbler, fairy- bluebird, the Indian blue robin, the yellow-throated bulbul, the crested goshawk, rosefinch, Blyth's swift, Orphean warbler, European bee-eater, and Eurasian crag martin. Threats The threats faced in the sanctuary have been recorded to be mostly of recent origin and of low intensity. These low level threats are related to farming and fishing activities, use of forest resources in the form of logging, tree harvesting, extraction of minor forest produce, least degree of recreational disturbance from human activities and low level of natural changes in the form of water harvesting structures. Upstream water impoundments have resulted in very low flows even in monsoon seasons, and dam releases introduce cold, low mineral content water at unpredictable times, all of which impact on riverine species. However, the threats from exploitation of biological resources in the form of hunting and capture of animals is assessed as high. Introductions of alien fish species have put huge pressures on the native fish, especially the most endangered species. Conservation measures Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary landscape Conservation measures in force in the sanctuary are in the form of patrolling on foot and in jeeps, and functioning of 11 moving anti-poaching camps; two permanent camps have been proposed. Drinking water to wild animals are provided through building of water conservation structures. Fire lines are cut and burnt well in advance before the beginning of the forest fire season; fire lines are created and dry material burnt. Fire watchers are stationed at strategic locations. A 10-year conservation plan for the period 2006‚Äì16 has been instituted. Zoning of forest into Core, Buffer, and Tourism zones has been planned. The tourism zone has four specific areas ‚Äì Bheemeshwari and Muthathi, Sangam and Mekedatu in the Kanakapura Wildlife Range, Gopinatham and Hogenakal falls of M.M.Hills Wildlife Range. Administrative set up has been proposed to be reorganized with additional staff. Improvement of patrolling paths has been envisaged. To increase awareness among the general public publicity pamphlets are planned, apart from fixing signages and plaques with information on the importance of preservation of wildlife of the sanctuary.

Swingle Frick, III, alias Romez Tormey. In 1970, while a student at Berkeley, Steen went underground as a member of the militant Weathermen organization. Before he was arrested in 1971, Steen says he had obtained a hundred-fifty different identities‚Äîalmost all of them courtesy of various Government agencies. What kind of documents are we talking about? MATTHEW STEEN: Birth certificates, notarized birth certificates, driver's licenses from various states, occasionally Social Security cards, and other superficial types of identification, like library cards, et cetera. WALLACE: And you had no real difficulty in doing this? STEEN: No. WALLACE: By the time the FBI got to him in 1971, Steen acknowledges he had used various fake ID's to rip off the Bank of America. He'd buy a set of Travellers' Checks; then, a couple of weeks later, claim they'd been lost or stolen‚Äîand get replacements. He had doubled his money. How much did you make this way? STEEN: Somewhere between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars. WALLACE: Among the official documents Matt Steen obtained under assumed names was a U.S. passport. Well, for decades, the head of the passport office in Washington has been keenly aware of the fake ID problem‚ÄîFrances Knight. Ms. FRANCES KNIGHT: This has been going on for years. Identify fraud is nothing that‚Äîthat is new in this Administration or in this decade. And yet, nobody‚Äîincluding the‚Äîthe brains of the Department of Justice‚Äîhave been able to come up with anything to stop it. It's been increasing. . . .  Federal Prison  Steen was sentenced to two consecutive five-year terms, served three years and released from United States Penitentiary, Lompoc in 1974 in Santa Barbara. Shortly after, he campaigned for public office and was twice elected to the Isla Vista Municipal Advisory Council.

Representatives of Epipompilus can be found in Australasia and North and South America. This distribution may indicate that Epipompilus evolved in Gondwana and is similar to other Gondwanan taxa such as the southern beech Nothofagus and Auracaria. Epipompilus is found in North and South America, ranging from Argentina to extreme southern United States, with around a dozen known species. One species, E. insularis is endemic to New Zealand. In Australia, the genus reaches its greatest diversity, with a greater number of species and a more varied spectrum of morphological features than among the American species. The Epipompilus species in New Guinea are notably brilliantly coloured and apparently highly evolved species. The genus is restricted to these areas but several Tertiary fossils from the northern hemisphere should probably be placed in Epipompilus. Ecology and behaviour These wasps are scarce in collections, probably due to their small size and the fact that they rarely visit flowers. A single male E. turneri which was collected on Leptospermum in New South Wales is one of the few flower records. In Australia observation and collection have often been associated with the trunks of living Eucalyptus trees. The morphology of many of the species suggests that they are adapted for crawling under bark and for entering crevices to search for spiders. Prey recorded includes spiders from the family Sparassidae. These wasps probably do not build nests but hunt spiders underneath bark and lay eggs on them as they find them. Taken into consideration with the many primitive structural features of members of this genus, it is suggestive that the hunting technique of Epipompilus represents an ancestral type of behaviour for spider wasps.

The company currently operates five casinos. It is known for the involvement of Gulfstream Aerospace founder Allen Paulson, who was CEO from 1994 to 2000, and former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, who was a major investor in the company from 1995 to 2013. Dan Lee has served as CEO since late 2014.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141201005226/en/Full-House- Resorts-Announces-Appointment-Daniel-R.#.VOHkIPmsW6M History =Founding (1987‚Äì1995)= The company was incorporated in 1987 as Hour Corp., and changed its name to D.H.Z. Capital Corp. later that year. In 1992, the company changed its name to Full House Resorts and bought the Deadwood Gulch Resort, a hotel and casino in Deadwood, South Dakota. The resort was expanded in 1994 with an RV park and a family fun center, Gulches of Fun. By 1996, the company determined that Deadwood's remote location and low betting limits were too limiting, so the resort was put up for sale. It was sold it to a group of South Dakota businessmen in 1998 for $6 million. Full House made its initial public offering on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market in 1993, raising $8 million. Allen Paulson, founder of Gulfstream Aerospace, bought a 17.5 percent stake in the company in March 1994, and was named chairman and CEO in August. The Coquille Indian Tribe chose Full House in 1994 from fifteen potential investors to develop a casino in North Bend, Oregon. Built in a former plywood mill, The Mill opened in May 1995. The company financed the construction in exchange for 26 percent of the profits through 2002. =Entry of Lee Iacocca (1995‚Äì1997)= In an effort to extend its base beyond the gaming industry, Full House was negotiating to purchase 21 acres of land in Branson, Missouri from a company owned by former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, and Omega Properties, owned by John Fugazy and Full House director William McComas. During the talks, Full House learned that Iacocca and Omega were discussing four separate casino development projects with the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of Potawatomi, the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, the Delaware State Fairgrounds, and four organized Indian tribes in Michigan. To gain access to these projects, Full House bought Iacocca's company and Omega in 1995. Iacocca received a 12.2 percent stake in the company. With the four tribes in Michigan (Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Hannahville Indian Community, and Keweenaw Bay Indian Community), Full House proposed to build a $175 million casino in a vacated department store in Detroit. However, Governor John Engler decided in 1995 not to allow off-reservation Indian casinos, and Full House wrote the project off. Full House worked with the Torres-Martinez tribe of southern California to lobby the federal government for more land, to replace the half of the tribe's reservation that was permanently flooded by the Salton Sea. By 2001, little progress had been made with the land, or with signing a compact with the state to allow a casino, so the tribe's members voted to terminate the contract with Full House. The company invoked arbitration and ultimately received a $1 million settlement from the tribe. In December 1995, the firm entered into a partnership with lottery equipment manufacturer Gtech, under which all of Full House's existing and future projects, except for Deadwood Gulch, would be pursued as joint ventures. The alliance lasted until April 2001, when Full House bought out Gtech's interests for $1.8 million. In May 1996, the Delaware project came to fruition with the opening of Midway Slots & Simulcast, a casino with 500 video lottery terminals and a racebook, at Harrington Raceway at the state fairgrounds in Harrington. Full House developed the casino at a cost of $11 million, and received a 15-year contract to operate it for a percentage of revenues. The firm's involvement ended when the agreement expired in 2011. The proposed Nottawaseppi Huron casino in Battle Creek, Michigan was delayed by years of litigation by anti-gaming activists. The $375-million FireKeepers Casino finally opened in 2009, as a joint venture with real estate developer Robert Mathewson. Full House and Mathewson were to manage the casino for seven years, receiving 26% of net income, but the Nottawaseppi Huron bought out the agreement in 2012 for $97.5 million and took over management of the casino. =Gregg Giuffria & Hard Rock Biloxi (1997‚Äì2000)= In 1997, former rock musician Gregg Giuffria and casino architect Paul Steelman conceived the idea of building a Hard Rock hotel and dockside casino in Biloxi, Mississippi. Giuffria, a friend of Iacocca, approached McComas and Iacocca with the idea. After they negotiated an agreement with the Rank Group, owner of the Hard Rock trademark, Iacocca joined the Full House board of directors, and Giuffria was named president of the company in 1998. The project was organized as a joint venture between Full House and Paulson, with Paulson providing a boat, the former Treasure Bay casino barge. A seven-acre site next to the Beau Rivage casino was secured for the $250- to 300-million development. Giuffria resigned from Full House in 2000, but the company pressed forward with the Hard Rock. By 2002, though, financing had not been found, the options to purchase the land had lapsed, and Full House dropped the project. The Hard Rock Biloxi was ultimately opened in 2007 by a company co-owned by Giuffria. At Giuffria's urging, the company moved its headquarters from Del Mar, California to Las Vegas in 1998. =Post- Allen Paulson (2000‚Äì2014)= After Paulson's death in 2000, Full House put itself up for sale. In July 2003, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians in California agreed to acquire the company for $20.1 million, but a tribal ballot to approve the purchase failed later that year, and the deal was canceled. Instead, Paulson's son, Michael, took over as chairman, and the company began a strategy of expansion. In 2005, Full House reached development agreements with two tribes in New Mexico. The Manuelito Chapter of the Navajo Nation selected the company from eleven applicants to develop and manage a casino, four miles west of Gallup. With the Namb√© Pueblo of New Mexico, the company agreed to develop a casino and hotel on tribal land fifteen miles north of Santa Fe, in exchange for thirty percent of net revenues for the first seven years. The Navajo project was dropped in 2007, when the tribe decided to proceed without a gaming developer. Market conditions, including the opening of a large casino by the nearby Pueblo of Pojoaque, led the Namb√© to drop their arrangement in 2008, instead pursuing plans for a smaller gaming operation to be managed by the tribe itself. Also in 2005, the company entered an agreement with the Northern Cheyenne Nation to develop a $10- to 15-million casino in Lame Deer, Montana. By 2010, financing difficulties forced Full House to write off the $728,000 it had spent, though it said it would continue to pursue the project. In February 2007, the company bought Stockman's Casino, an casino in Fallon, Nevada, along with its 98-room Holiday Inn Express hotel, from James Peters for $25.5 million. It sold the hotel a year later for $7.2 million, deciding that it was not important for driving customers to the casino. In 2011, Full House entered into a three-year management agreement with the Pueblo of Pojoaque to oversee its Buffalo Thunder and Cities of Gold casinos, for $100,000 a month plus success fees based on financial targets. The company earned $5.4 million under the contract before it expired in September 2014, and the tribe resumed self-management of the casinos. Also in 2011, the company purchased two casinos from HGMI Gaming, a Hyatt affiliate owned by the Pritzker family. It bought the assets of the Grand Lodge Casino at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Incline Village, Nevada for $700,000, and leased the space for $125,000 a month for an initial five-year term, keeping all profits. It also bought the Grand Victoria riverboat casino and hotel in Rising Sun, Indiana for $43 million, and renamed it as the Rising Star Casino Resort. In October 2012, Full House acquired the Silver Slipper Casino in Lakeshore, Mississippi for $70 million, with plans to potentially add a hotel. An analyst stated the company would likely continue acquiring properties with earnings in the $10‚àí to 15-million range. The company partnered in 2013 with the Keeneland Association in a plan to buy Thunder Ridge Raceway, a harness racing track in Prestonburg, Kentucky. The partners proposed to move the racing license to a new Quarter Horse track to be built in Corbin. The purchase was contingent on the formal legalization of slot machine-like Instant Racing devices, at least 300 of which would operate at the new track. In March 2014, Full House agreed to acquire the Fitz Casino in Tunica Resorts, Mississippi from Majestic Star Casino for $62 million. Two months later, however, Full House said it would back out of the deal, citing financing difficulties. =Dan Lee era (2014‚Äìpresent)= In October 2014, a group of activist shareholders, led by former CEO of Pinnacle Entertainment Dan Lee, launched a proxy fight, accusing Full House's management of going on a \\"reckless buying binge\\". Lee soon drew the support of the Paulson family. The company responded by putting itself up for sale. The fight ended in a settlement in December 2014, with Lee appointed as CEO of Full House. During the proxy contest, Full House was sidelined from the Thunder Ridge project, after the Kentucky Racing Commission expressed concerns about Full House and Keeneland decided to pursue the purchase alone. In 2015, Full House proposed building a $650-million mixed-use project anchored by a casino, on a site near the Indianapolis International Airport. In May 2016, Full House purchased Bronco Billy's casino in Cripple Creek, Colorado for approximately $30 million. The company revealed a proposal in August 2018 to build La Posada del Llano, a racetrack, casino, and hotel near Clovis, New Mexico.

It includes activities such as interacting with new media, reading books and magazines, watching television and film, and listening to radio. An active media consumer must have the capacity for skepticism, judgement, free thinking, questioning, and understanding. History For as long as there have been words and pictures, the people of the world have been consuming media. Improved technology such as the printing press has fed increased consumption. Around 1600 the camera obscura was perfected. Light was inverted through a small hole or lens from outside, and projected onto a surface or screen, creating a moving image. This new medium had a very small effect on society compared to the old ones. The development of photography in the middle 19th century made those images permanent, greatly reducing the cost of pictures. By the end of the century millions of consumers were seeing new, professionally made photographs every day. In the 1860s mechanisms such as the zoetrope, mutoscope and praxinoscope that produced two-dimensional drawings in motion were created. They were displayed in public halls for people to observe. These new media foreshadowed the mass media consumption of later years. Around the 1880s, the development of the motion picture camera allowed individual component images to be captured and stored on a single reel. Motion pictures were projected onto a screen to be viewed by an audience. This moving camera affected the progression of the world immensely, beginning the American film industry as well as early international movements such as German Expressionism, Surrealism and the Soviet Montage. For the first time people could tell stories on film, and distribute their works to consumers worldwide. In the 1920s electronic television was working in laboratories, and in the 1930s hundreds of receivers were in use worldwide. By 1941 the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) was broadcasting two 15-minute newscasts a day to a tiny audience on its New York television station. However, the television industry did not begin to boom until the general post‚ÄìWorld War II economic expansion. Eventually television began to incorporate color, and multiple broadcasting networks were created. Computers were developed in the middle 20th century, and commercialized in the 1960s. Apple and other companies sold computers for hobbyists in the 1970s, and in 1981 IBM released computers intended for consumers. On August 6, 1991, the internet and World Wide Web, long in use by computer specialists, became available to the public. This was the start of the commercialized Internet that people use today. In 1999, Friends Reunited, the first social media site, was released to the public. Since then, Myspace, Facebook, Twitter and other social networks have been created. Facebook and Twitter are the top social media sites in terms of usage. Facebook has a total of 1,230,000,000 consumers while Twitter has 645,750,000. Both companies are worth billions of dollars, and continue to grow. Overall media consumption has immensely increased over time, from the era of the introduction of motion pictures, to the age of social networks and the internet. People involved Media is the sum of information and entertainment media taken in by an individual or group. The first source of media was solely word of mouth. When written language was established, scrolls were passed, but mass communication was never an option. It wasn't until the printing press that media could be consumed on a high level. Johannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith and businessman from the mining town of Mainz in southern Germany printing press. His technology allowed books, newspapers, and flyers to be printed and distributed on a mass level. The first newspaper written on paper was done by Benjamin Harris in the British- American Colonies. The invention of a newspaper was one of the most influential pieces in media consumption history, because it pertained to everyone. Eventually communication reached an electronic state, and the telegraph was invented. Harrison Dyar, who sent electrical sparks through chemically treated paper tape to burn dots and dashes, invented the first telegraph in the USA. The telegraph was the first piece of equipment that allowed users to send electronic messages. A more developed version came from Samuel Morse, whose telegraph printed code on tape and was operated using a keypad and an earpiece. The pattern of communication soon became known as Morse code. Inventors Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell both independently designed the telephone. The telephone was simple enough for everyone to use and didn't require learning a code. Soon after the telephone came the radio. Combining technology from both the telegraph and telephone, Guglielmo Marconi sent and received his first radio signal in 1895. Finally in 1947, after a long period of development, television exploded as a medium. Not one person is responsible for the creation of the television, but Marvin Middlemark invented \\"rabbit ears\\" in 1930, which allowed for televisions to be a commercial product. The television has by far been the most influential consumed media, and allowed news to spread on a visual level. In 1976, Apple created the first consumer computer. The computer was the start of mass written communication using email. Apple continues to be a leading company in computer use. In 1998, the first ever social media site SixDegrees.com was created by Andrew Weinreich. It enabled users to upload a profile and make friends with other users. Shortly later in 1999, Friends Reunited was created by Steve and Julie Pankhurst and friend Jason Porter Sites like MySpace created by Tom Anderson gained prominence in the early 2000s. By 2006, Facebook created by Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter created by Jack Dorsey both became available to users throughout the world. These sites remain some of the most popular social networks on the Internet. Increase Among other factors, a person's access to media technology affects the amount and quality of his or her intake. In the United States, for instance, \\"U.C. San Diego scientists in 2009 estimated the 'average' American consumes 34 gigabytes of media a day.\\" The amount of media consumption among individuals is increasing as new technologies are created. According to phys.org, a new study done by a researcher at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California, says that by 2015, the sum of media asked for and delivered to consumers on mobile devices and their homes would take more than 15 hours a day to see or hear, an amount equivalent to watching nine DVDs' worth of data per person per day. With social media networks rapidly growing such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, our world of media consumption is reaching a younger and younger age group, making our consumption that much larger as a country. With mobile devices such as smartphones, news, entertainment, shopping and buying are all now at the tip of our fingers, anytime, anywhere. Positive effects There are a number of positive effects of media consumption. Television can have positive effects on children as they are growing up. Shows like Sesame Street teach valuable lessons to children in developmental stages, such as math, the alphabet, kindness, racial equality, and cooperation. Dora the Explorer introduces foreign language to children of all backgrounds in a fun, cooperative environment. Mass media has a huge grasp on today's adolescents. Many young people use different types of social media daily. Mass media can be used to socialize adolescents from around the world and can help to give them a fundamental understanding of social norms. Media relating to advertising can also have a positive effect. Some alcohol manufacturers are known to spend at least ten percent of their budget on warnings about the dangers of drinking and driving. Also, studies show that milk consumption (though controversial) shot up in children fifteen years of age and younger due to print and broadcast advertisements. Many video games can also have positive effects. Games like Wii Tennis and Wii Fit improve hand-eye coordination as well as general mental and physical health. Video games, including shooting games, may positively impact a child's learning, as well as physical and mental health and social skills. Even games rated for mature audiences have been found to be beneficial to the development of children according to a study that was published by the American Psychological Association (APA). The study showed that there is a need to look at the positive effects as well as the negative ones. When a child plays video games, they naturally develop problem-solving skills. Strategic video games, such as role-playing games, release statistics that the more intense game play improved in problem solving skills and there is a significant rise in school grades as well, according to a study that was taken over a several year span but was published in 2013. The study also showcased that the creativity of children was also enhanced by playing all genres of video games, including mature rated games. Research revealed that video games benefit children significantly more than other sources of technology. The internet itself is an overwhelmingly useful resource for people of all ages, effectively serving as a personal library for any who access it. The sheer volume of educational websites, information and services offered are so immense that research has become a far easier task than it was in any previous period in human history. Social media has provided invaluable benefits for people over the course of its lifetime, and has served as an incredibly effective method of interacting and communicating with others in nearly every part of the world. Media consumption has proven to serve as an indispensable asset in the educational field, serving both instructors and students alike. Instructors and students consume media for school curricula in Ontario. Media literacy is prominent amongst the youth who have essentially been born into an era where media is a global driving force. When a student learns to approach media sources with a critical lens, it can be observed that all forms of media have no sense of neutrality. Students who consume media are capable of questioning the validity of the media they are exposed to, in turn developing their own sense of critical thinking. To broaden their comprehension skills, students often find it useful to question an author's purpose, the reasoning for the placement of specific images or motifs, the representation of content and its meaning to individuals, and the effects of the media on individual and societal thinking. Media related to learning is typically considered a source as well as a tool. Since its start, many have successfully used Rosetta Stone (software) to assist in the process of learning a new language. Rosetta Stone is a source compatible with several platforms i.e. (iPad, Tablet, Phone Apps Websites). Negative effects Media consumption can have a wide range of negative behavioral and emotional effects. There are many instances of violence in movies, television, video games and websites which can affect one's level of aggression. These violent depictions can desensitize viewers to acts of violence and can also provoke mimicking of the acts. Since violence is so rampant in media, viewers believe they live in a more violent world than they actually do. The reach of media is expanding globally and with this television has become a vice around the world. Television addiction has been labeled as the plug in drug since 1977. Over the years televisions are now located in almost every home, according to most recent estimates taken by Nielsen in the U.S. alone there are 116.4 million T.V. homes Television can have a negative impact on adolescents and cause them to behave in a manner that is not part of normal social norm. In an article about media violence on society it states that extensive TV viewing among adolescents and young adults is associated with subsequent aggressive acts. Programs that portray violent acts can change an adolescent's view on violence and this may lead them to develop aggressive behavior. These shows usually portray a person who commits a crime or resorts to violence. They also show that these people go unpunished for their crime, creating the notion that crime is something a person can get away with. Studies show that 65% of people between the age of 8 to 18 have a television in their room. The average high- schooler watches, on average,14 hours of television a week. Excessive television viewing and computer game playing has also been associated with many psychiatric symptoms, especially emotional and behavioral symptoms, somatic complaints, attention problems such as hyperactivity, and family interaction problems. When adolescents watch television for long periods of time they spend less time being active and engaged in physical activity. Many adolescents who spend large amounts of time watching television see actors as role models and try to emulate them by trying to be like them this can also have a negative impact on people's body images, mostly women. After seeing beautiful and thinner than average women in the media, viewers may feel worse about themselves and sometimes develop eating disorders. Some believe that the reason obesity rates have greatly increased in the last 20 years is due to increased media consumption. This is due to the fact that children are spending much more time playing video games and watching television than exercising. Social media is said to also cause anxiety and depression. Research suggests that young people who spend more than 2 hours per day on social media are more likely to report poor mental health, including psychological distress. Numerous studies have also shown that media consumption has a significant association with poor sleep quality. Television and computer game exposure affect children's sleep and deteriorate verbal cognitive performance. Another problem that has developed due to increased media consumption is that people are becoming less independent. With text messaging and social media, people want instant gratification from their friends and often feel hurt if they do not receive an immediate response. Instead of having self-validation, people often need validation from others. Another issue with independence is that since children frequently get cellphones when they are very young, they are always connected and never truly alone. Today, many children do not have the rite of passage of being on their own because they can always call their parents if they need help or are frightened. Minorities are often put in a negative light in the media as well, with blacks being portrayed as criminals, Hispanics portrayed as illegal aliens, and people from the Middle East portrayed as terrorists. Research has shown that consuming much media with headlines that depict minorities in negative ways can affect how people think. Effects on Self-Esteem  Media has played a huge role in society for years in selling people on the expectations of how an ideal male and female body should look. These images of the \\"ideal body\\" can have a very negative effect on self-esteem in both men and women. These images can play significant roll in eating disorders in men and women as well. The idea of body comparison goes back to Festinger's (1954) Social Comparison Theory. Festinger argues that individuals make body comparisons in areas for which they relate. If someone who is over weight and is an environment that focuses on health, thinness, or body images (e.g. the gym or the beach) they may be more likely to see thinness as an ideal that can increase dissatisfaction with their own body. The more a person engages in body comparison, the more likely they may struggle with low self-esteem and a negative body image. Women are sold to believe that to be beautiful, they must be a size zero and have long legs. Men are sold the notion that they must big biceps and zero body fat. Reading magazines with images of toned muscular men has been reported to lower body and self-esteem in men and they start worrying more about their own health and physical fitness.  Social Media  The amount of time spent on social media can inform people about their self- esteem.Andreassen, C.S. Current Addiction Reports (2015) 2: 175. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9 Research has shown that individuals with lower self-esteem may have an easier time expressing themselves on social media rather than in the real world. Many people use metrics such as how many people are following them and likes to measure acceptance or rejection from peers. One study from the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, argues that individuals who feel accepted and part of the \\"in crowd\\" have a higher sense of self-esteem than those who do not feel as though they are a part of these crowds. Semiotics of American youth media consumption American youth have personal television sets, laptops, iPods and cell phones all at their disposal. They spend more time with media than any single activity other than sleeping. As of 2008, the average American ages 8 to 18 reported more than 6 hours of daily media use. The growing phenomenon of \\"media multitasking\\"‚Äîusing several forms of media at the same time‚Äîmultiplies that figure to 8.5 hours of media exposure daily. Media exposure begins early, typically increases until children begin school, then climbs to a peak of almost 8 hours daily among 11 and 12-year-old children. Media exposure is positively related to risk-taking behaviors and is negatively related to personal adjustment and school performance. Of teenagers ages 12 to 17, 78% have a cell phone, and 47% of those own smartphones. 23% of teens own a tablet computer and 93% have a computer or access to one at home. Of teenagers ages 14 to 17, 74% access the Internet on mobile devices occasionally. One in four teens are mostly cell phone users, consuming a majority of their media with applications on their phone. Media consumption, particularly social media consumption, plays a major role in the socialization and social behaviors of adolescents. Socializing through media differs from socializing through school, community, family, and other social functions. Since adolescents typically have greater control over their media choices than over other social situations face-to-face, many develop self-socialization patterns. This behavior manifests itself actively in personal social development and outcomes due to the vast array of choices made available through social media. Adolescents have the ability to choose media that best suits their personalities and preferences, which in turn create youth that have a skewed view of the world and limited social interaction skills. Socialization can consequently grow increasingly difficult for youth. Media, parents and peers may each convey conflicting messages to adolescents. With vastly differing views of how to approach various situations, confusion can be apparent and youth may avoid or internalize their social weaknesses. Social semiotics represent a significant role in how adolescents learn and employ social interaction. Impressionable adolescents regularly imitate the sign systems seen in the media. These semiotic systems affect their behavior through connotations, narratives, and myths. Adolescents are shaped by the sign systems in the media they consume. For example, many young girls in the 1990s dressed and acted like the Spice Girls, a pop band that gathered prolific and critical acclaim at the time. Similarly, boy bands created a trend of many teenage boys frosting their hair in the early 2000s. With more exposure to the media and images of models, young women are more likely to conform to the ideals of specific body images. Anorexia, bulimia and models smoking convey to girls that a feminine person is thin, beautiful, and must do certain things to her body to be attractive. A code of femininity (see media and gender) implies today that a \\"true\\" woman is thin, girlish, frail, passive, and focused on serving others. On the other hand, the code of masculinity for a young males raised within the past several decades may include the ideals of profusely individualistic and self-sufficient natures, oft personified in film characters such as cowboys and outlaw bikers. The images, myths, and narratives of these ideas imply that a \\"true\\" man is a relentless problem solver, physically strong, emotionally inexpressive, and at times, a daredevil with little regard for societal expectations and the law of the land. The never ceasing flood of signs, images, narratives, and myths surrounding consumers of media have the capability to influence behavior through the use of codes. Codes are maps of meaning, systems of signs that are used to interpret behavior. Codes connect semiotic systems of meaning with social structure and values. The idea of being judged on femininity or clothing relates to experiences later in life, including job interviews and the emphasis placed on reaching financial success. Media consumption has become an integral part of modern culture, and has shaped younger generations through socialization and the interpretations provided for the signs and world around them.  Effect on Public Attitudes Regarding Crime and Justice thumbLaw & Order: SVU Television viewers of crime-based shows are more fearful of crime. Media consumption affects the public's perception of the justice system through the relationship of fear regarding crime, the perceived effectiveness of law enforcement, and the general attitudes about punishment for crime. The justice system has been consistenly portrayed in mass media in negative tandem through the portrayal of criminals, deviants, and law enforcement officials, in turn affecting their overall perception by the public. A 2003 study by Dowler showed the effects of media consumption influences public attitudes regarding crime and justice. In this study, a relationship between media and crime was found to be dependent on characteristics of the message and receiving audience, where substantial amounts of local crimes reported raised fear, while lower crime amounts lead to a feeling of safety. George Gerbner's empirical studies of the impact of media consumption discovered that television viewers of crime-based shows are more fearful of crime than those who are not consuming that type of media. A study conducted by Chermak, McGarrell, & Gruenewald focused on media coverage of police misconduct, producing results where greater consumption of media portraying dishonesty amongst law enforcement led to increasing confirmation bias in the direction of the officer's guilt.

It was one of the first books to chronicle women's images in film. Along with Marjorie Rosen's Popcorn Venus, it typifies the first feminist expeditions into film history and criticism, adopting the \\"image of woman\\" approach. Haskell compared the portrayal of women on-screen to real life women off-screen to determine if the representation of women in Hollywood cinema was accurate. Later developments in feminist film theory have partially rejected Haskell's and Rosen's approach as rudimentary. \\"The Woman's Film\\" One particularly influential chapter in From Reverence to Rape discusses the genre of the \\"woman's film\\". As Haskell points out, woman's film could be a compensation for \\"all the dominated universes from which she has been excluded: the gangster film, the Western, the war film, the policier, the rodeo film, the adventure film.\\" A woman's film is also more self-pitying in comparison to the male adventure film which Raymond Durgnat calls the \\"male weepies.\\" The man's film abstracts the times before settling down, when men were battling nature or the enemy. Marriage becomes the killjoy. \\"All the excitement of life occurs outside of marriage.

The primary aspects of audio forensics are establishing the authenticity of audio evidence, performing enhancement of audio recordings to improve speech intelligibility and the audibility of low- level sounds, and interpreting and documenting sonic evidence, such as identifying talkers, transcribing dialog, and reconstructing crime or accident scenes and timelines. Modern audio forensics makes extensive use of digital signal processing, with the former use of analog filters now being obsolete.

The film stars Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, James Ransone, Fred Thompson, and Vincent D'Onofrio. The plot revolves around true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt (Hawke) whose discovery of home movies depicting grisly murders found in the attic of his new house puts his family in danger. Sinister was inspired by a nightmare co-writer C. Robert Cargill had after watching The Ring (2002). Principal photography began in Autumn of 2011 with a production budget of $3 million. To add the authenticity of old home movies and snuff films, the Super 8 segments were shot on actual Super 8 cameras and film stock. The film was a co-production between the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The film premiered at the SXSW festival. It was released in the United States on October 12, 2012, and in the UK on October 5, 2012. Sinister received positive reviews, praising the acting, direction, music, cinematography, and atmosphere, but received some criticism for its use of jump scares and horror cliches. The film was a box office success, grossing $87.7 million against its budget of $3 million. The film's financial success spawned a sequel, Sinister 2, released in the United States on August 21, 2015. A 2020 study conducted by Broadbandchoices named Sinister the scariest horror film ever made, based on highest average heartrates of audience members. Plot True crime writer Ellison Oswalt moves into a home with his wife Tracy, their son, Trevor, and their daughter, Ashley. Ellison moved into a home where a family was murdered and intends to use their case as the basis for his new book. He hopes his research reveals the fate of the Stevenson family's fifth member, Stephanie, who disappeared following the murders. Ellison finds a box in the attic that contains a projector and several reels of Super 8 mm footage, each labeled as home movies. The films are footage depicting the murder of different families in various ways, including hanging, drowning, throat-cutting, and arson. Each murder is performed by an unseen person holding the camera. Ellison notes the appearance of a mysterious, semi- circular symbol in the films and a strange, masked figure. One night, Ellison investigates noises in the attic and discovers a childlike drawing that depicts the murders, with a strange figure called \\"Mr. Boogie\\" standing next to the victims. Ellison consults a local deputy and discovers that the murders in the Super 8 footage took place at different times and in different cities across the country. Ellison also learns that a child from each family went missing following every murder. The deputy refers Ellison to Professor Jonas, who specializes in the occult, to decipher the symbol in the films. Jonas says such symbols refer to an ancient and obscure Pagan deity named Bughuul, who would kill entire families and take one of their children to consume their soul slowly. Jonas suspects the murders are part of a cult initiation rite rather than the work of a single person stretching across decades. Ellison hears the film projector running and finds the missing children seated in the attic watching one of the films. Bughuul appears on camera before physically appearing before Ellison. Ellison takes the camera, projector, and films outside and then burns them. He tells Tracy that they are moving back to their old house. At his old home, Ellison receives a video call from Jonas who sends him scans of historical images associated with Bughuul, including the symbol in the murder movies. Early Christians believed that images of Bughuul served as a gateway for the demon to come from the spiritual realm to the mortal world, and Bughuul can possess children who come into contact with these images. Ellison discovers the unharmed projector and films in his attic, along with a new film labeled \\"Extended Cut Endings.‚Äù The deputy calls Ellison and informs him that every murdered family had previously lived in the house where the last murder took place. Each new murder occurred shortly after the family moved from the crime scene into a new residence. By moving, Ellison has placed himself and his family in line to be the next victims. The new footage depicts the missing children coming onscreen following each murder, revealing themselves to be the killers under Bughuul's influence. Ellison becomes lightheaded and notices a green liquid at the bottom of his coffee mug, along with a note that says, \\"Good night, Daddy,\\" before losing consciousness. He awakes to find himself, Tracy, and Trevor bound and gagged on the floor. Ashley, under Bughuul's possession, approaches them while filming with the 8 mm camera. She murders her family with an ax, using their blood to paint pictures on the house walls, along with Bughuul's symbol on a door. Ashley views the film of her murders while drawing the murder in the lid of the home movies box. The missing children stare at her through the film but flee when Bughuul appears. He lifts Ashley into his arms and teleports into the film so he can eventually consume her soul. The box of films is seen sitting in the Oswalt family's attic, now accompanied by Ashley's reel. Cast Production =Development= Writer C. Robert Cargill says that his inspiration for Sinister came from a nightmare he experienced after seeing The Ring, in which he discovered a film in his attic depicting the hanging of an entire family. This scenario became the setup for the plot of Sinister.Interview: Sinister Writer Cargill Screen Geek In creating a villain for the film, Cargill conceptualized a new take on the Bogeyman, calling the entity \\"Mr. Boogie\\". Cargill's idea was that the creature would be both terrifying and seductive to children, luring them to their dooms as a sinister Willy Wonka-like figure. Cargill and co-writer Scott Derrickson ultimately decided to downplay the creature's alluring nature, only intimating how it manipulates the children into murder. In further developing Mr. Boogie, the pair had lengthy discussions about its nature, deciding not to make it a demon but rather a pagan deity, in order to place it outside the conceptual scope of any one particular religion. Consequently, the villain was given the proper name \\"Bughuul\\", with only the child characters in the film referring to it as Mr. Boogie.How Internet Art Inspired the Monster in Ethan Hawke's Sinister io9.com =Design= In crafting a look for Bughuul, Cargill initially kept to the idea of a sinister Willy Wonka before realizing that audiences might find it \\"silly\\" and kill the potential for the film becoming a series. Looking for inspiration, Derrickson typed the word \\"horror\\" into flickr and searched through 500,000 images. He narrowed the images down to 15, including a photograph of a ghoul which was tagged simply \\"Natalie\\". Cargill was particularly struck by \\"Natalie\\" and decided: \\"What if it's just this guy?\\". He and Derrickson contacted the photographer and purchased the rights to use the image for $500. Derrickson explained that the image appealed to him because it reminded him of the makeup and costumes worn by performers in black metal, while remaining unique enough so as not to be directly linked to the genre; Derrickson had previously researched black metal while looking for inspiration for Bughuul's symbol, which is ritualistically painted at the scene of each of the film's murder sequences. Some of the background music for these murder sequences was taken from ambient tracks by bands associated with the Norwegian black metal scene, including Ulver and Aghast.Sinister: The \\"Other\\" Soundtrack.

CraveOnline called the film \\"solid\\" but remarked that the film \\"doesn't quite go to the next level that gets me like an Insidious\\",SXSW Review: Sinister CraveOnline and IGN praised the film's story while criticizing some of Sinister's \\"scream-out-loud moments\\" as lazy.Sinister Review IGN Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek wrote, \\"For the most part, Sinister is about its protagonist's growing obsession. Director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still) appears to be deeply influenced not just by the horror genre (most obviously The Shining) [but also] by such films as Michael Mann's Manhunter, Joel Schumacher's 8 mm, and Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation. Like the main characters of those films, Ellison becomes consumed by a mystery, and spends long periods of time engrossed in the pursuit of the truth ‚Äì like us, he's repulsed by what he sees, but can't quite bring himself to look away.\\" Reviewer Garry McConnachie of Scotland's Daily Record rated the film 4 of 5 stars, saying, \\"This is how Hollywood horror should be done... Sinister covers all its bases with aplomb.\\" Lambie, rating the movie 3 of 5 stars, says that despite its \\"faults, there's something undeniably powerful about Sinister. Hawke's performance holds the screen through its more hackneyed moments, and it's the scenes where it's just him, a projector, and a few feet of hideous 8 mm footage where the movie truly convinces. And while its scares are frequently cheap, it's also difficult to deny that Sinister sometimes manages to inspire moments of palpable dread.\\" The reviewer for Time Out London granted only 2 out of 5 stars, saying, \\"This so-so, occasionally effective horror film combines found-footage creepiness and haunted-house scares ‚Äì but is stronger on mood than story.\\" Some reviewers have criticized the film's preoccupation with outdated technology. Peter Howell of the Toronto Star (who gave the film 2 out of 4 stars) argues that the movie tries for \\"old school shocks\\" but \\"can't afford a pre-Internet setting.\\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote that \\"celluloid is such a warm, friendly old format that it seems unlikely to contain the spirit of, say, a child-eating demon.\\" Academic study of the film, however, tends to view Sinister's representation of both old and new media formats as a study in transmediation. =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on February 11, 2013, in the UK and February 19, 2013, in the US with two commentaries (one with director Scott Derrickson and another with writer C. Robert Cargill). The release also included two new features (True Crime Criminals and Living in a House of Death) as well as a featurette on the Sinister Fear Experiment performed by Thrill Laboratory in celebration of the film's theatrical release. Sequel A sequel was announced to be in the works in March 2013, with Derrickson in talks to co- write the script with Cargill, but not to direct. On April 17, 2014, it was announced that Ciaran Foy would direct the film, and Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, Charles Layton, Xavier Marchand and Patrice Th√©roux would executive produce the sequel with eOne Entertainment. The film was released on August 21, 2015.

His medal was sold for ¬£4,830 ($7,313) in July 2000. Military service Tyke was hatched in Cairo, Egypt, from British and South African parents, and was seconded into military service. Bomber crews would carry homing pigeons in order to get word of their location back to home base should they be shot down. In June 1943 the American bomber he was stationed on was shot down, and Tyke was released in order to get help. He flew over a hundred miles in poor visibility, passing on the crew's call for help to friendly forces. The bomber crew credited the pigeon with saving their lives. Tyke was awarded the Dickin Medal for his actions, an animal-only medal issued by the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. Tyke's citation reads, \\"For delivering a message under exceptionally difficult conditions and so contributing to the rescue of an Air Crew, while serving with the RAF in the Mediterranean in June, 1943.\\" He was one of the first pigeons to be awarded the Dickin Medal, along with White Vision and Winkie, who each received the award on 2 December 1943. Legacy In July 2000, Tyke's Dickin Medal was auctioned by Spink Auction House in London. It was sold for the sum of ¬£4,830 ($7,313) after receiving an initial top estimate of ¬£3,500 ($5,299). Fellow Dickin medallist Peter's medal was auctioned at the same event.

A. Friis started an action to establish a high school in the Moot. The former Department of Education was not inclined to an Afrikaans high school building. In 1928 the then MEC for Education, Mr. Michael Brink, made a promise for a new Afrikaans high school. Up until 1943, the matter was still on ice. A new Afrikaans high school was not on the agenda of the Department of Education. Mr. Michael Brink again decided to undertake the matter further. On June 14, 1944, a site was recommended and approved on February 13, 1946. This area was the now famous, southern slope of the Magaliesberg east of Voortrekker Road. In November 1946 the first sod was dug by Mr. Michael Brink. Mr. J Dey was the architect, Mr.. J D Verhoewe the contractor and Mr. C. Morgan, chairman of the action committee. Eventually, after many years, the first Afrikaans High School was established in the Moot, under the name Michael Brink Ho√´r. A year later, on June 10, 1950, the Administrator of the Transvaal announced that: the school will from now on be known as Die Ho√´rskool Wonderboom. It was the first step in the direction of the rich traditions, beautiful grounds and outstanding features of Ho√´rskool Wonderboom, as it is known today. \\"Grow and Serve\\" is the motto of the school upheld throughout the past 58 years. This motto and badge were introduced at the end of 1950. The school song was the next milestone. Mr. J. A. van der Walt, a teacher was the author of the lyrics and the famous Stephan Eyssen wrote the music. The school song was officially inaugurated at the matric farewell in 1953. The school's number of pupils had increased rapidly, and already in 1955 new building additions were necessary. In 1964 construction started on the new wing and the larger hall. and completed on 16 January 1967. This also included some alterations to existing buildings including the media center. In 1974 the new pavilion was built, which, with its roof was a big improvement. In addition, the sports fields underwent a metamorphosis. In January 1949 Mr. Van Vuuren, a retired former headmaster took the reins of the new school in his capable hands. In 1950 dr. J. C. Otto was appointed the first permanent headmaster. He was later the Mayor of Pretoria. He was succeeded in 1962 by Mr. S. H. Friis, son of Mr. J. A. Friis under whose leadership the action began for a new Afrikaans high school. After 14 years, in 1976, Mr. C. Schutte was appointed his successor, and only 10 years later in 1986, D.J. Ferreira took up the reins. Dr. S.T. van Wyk was appointed on 1 November 1994, and his career as headmaster of Ho√´rskool Wonderboom lasted for a fruitful 17 years. Dr S.T. van Wyk retired in 2016, with Mr. Marius Lezar taking his place and starting his first year as headmaster in 2017.

Early life Green was born in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. His father was a colonial administrator in the British Empire and his mother is Polish. His father was agnostic and his mother a devout Roman Catholic. Green was raised in the Roman Catholic faith from a young age. Green attended a Monastic Roman Catholic boarding school, St Martin's Ampleforth at Gilling Castle, and then Ampleforth College. When he was 11, his father took a job in Cairo, and so Abdur Raheem would travel to stay there during his school holidays. He studied history at the University of London, but did not complete his degree because of a growing disillusionment with what he regarded as the Eurocentric teaching of the British educational system. Conversion to Islam At a young age, Green began to question his Roman Catholic upbringing. However, at the age of 19, he stated that he would \\"vigorously defend\\" the faith, even though he did not actually believe in it. He also practiced Buddhism for nearly three years, though never formally embraced it. In 1987, Green first became interested in Islam, picking up his first copy of the Qur'an. He embraced Islam in 1988. Personal life Green has ten children. Whilst claiming two wives, Green was asked in the interview whether British law prohibits bigamy. Green responded: \\"It does. Yet several Britishers are bigamists. But those who practise bigamy can protect the second marriage under the provisions of 'common law wives'. Under this children out of such marriages are legitimate and wives inherit property.\\" Controversies In 2005, Green was barred from boarding a flight with a stopover in Brisbane because he appeared on the Australian government's \\"movement alert list\\". This was for extreme views, \\"including that Muslims and westerners cannot live peaceably together and that dying while fighting jihad is one of the surest ways to paradise and Allah's good pleasure.\\" Some Australian Muslims argued that the Government had gone too far by stopping a man whose views they claim are now moderate. In October 2011, Green was banned from giving a scheduled lecture at Concordia University in Canada after concerns were raised over statements that he allegedly made about how men may treat their wives. In July 2012, Green was banned from the Emirates stadium of Arsenal F.C. In May 2014, the Telegraph reported that the iERA which Green chairs is being investigated by the Charity Commission \\"amid allegations that its leaders promote anti-Semitism and have called for homosexuals and female adulterers to be stoned to death.\\" The Telegraph reported that Green \\"has been caught on camera preaching at Hyde Park Corner, calling for a Jewish man to be removed from his sight. 'Why don‚Äôt you take the Yahoudi [Jew] over there, far away so his stench doesn‚Äôt disturb us?' he can be heard to say.\\" In 2015, he was asked to withdraw from speaking at event Against Racism, Against Hatred held at St James' Park, Newcastle.

Education  Rabbi Adler learned in Telz Yeshiva of Chicago, and then studied in Israel by Harav Tzvi Kushelevsky shlita, Rosh Yeshiva of Heichal Hatorah in Jerusalem's Givat Shaul, now Har Nof neighborhood. In 1998, Rabbi Adler founded a yeshiva ‚Äì Yeshivas Lev Yesharim ‚Äì in Sanhedria, Jerusalem for American post high-school Yeshiva boys.  Career  In 1999 Rabbi Adler accepted a position in Baltimore, Maryland as a fundraiser for a local institute. In 2000 he moved to Detroit where he worked as the Executive Director for Yeshivas Darchei Torah. In 2015 Rabbi Adler moved to Chicago, following a fifteen-year stint of Torah dissemination in Detroit. He is continuing his Torah projects in the Windy City.  Public Torah Teaching  Following this stint, Rabbi Adler began to formally be marbitz Torah (disseminate Torah to the masses) with his weekly Parsha sheets that are distributed in many shuls and kollels in the greater Detroit Orthodox Jewish community. His famous \\"Shabbos Taam Hachaim\\" (◊©◊ë◊™ ◊ò◊¢◊ù ◊î◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù) (Shabbos ‚Äì the taste of life) has a wide global readership, as it gets emailed every Friday to many hundreds of readers. In addition to the Shabbos page, Rabbi Adler uses his talent to pen the weekly Doresh Tov (◊ì◊ï◊®◊© ◊ò◊ï◊ë) blog (The name \\"Doresh Tov\\" originally refers to Mordechai Hatzaddik, who is a direct descendant of Binyomin Ben Yaakov, Rabbi Adler's namesake), which contains thoughts on the weekly parsha and/or inyoni d'yuma (current events in the Jewish calendar).http://doreishtov.wordpress.com/http://www.doreishtov.blogspot.com/ These blogs were all augmented by Hakosev, Adler's umbrella writing organization.http://www.judaicasavings.com/prodtype.asp?CAT_ID=668 Rabbi Adler is also a frequent contributor to \\"Parsha Perspectives\\", a weekly column on Partners In Torah's website.

In November 1955 the Independence Front tried to oust al-Azhari through a vote in the House of Representatives. The Anti-Imperialist Front refused to support this action, and Hassan at-Taheer Zarouq abstained from voting. The Anti- Imperialist Front explained its position that it struggled for principles, rather against any particular individuals. Instead, the Anti-Imperialist Front called for a national unity government. This move alienated the Anti- Imperialist Front from both the government and the other opposition forces. When the al-Azhari cabinet was followed by the government of Abdallah Khalil, the Anti-Imperialist Front retained its oppositional stance. Again, the Anti- Imperialist Front sought to build a broad, national front. However, such a front did not materialize as the People's Democratic Party (whom the communists had identified as a potential key partner) aligned with the Umma Party instead. Suez Crisis During the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Anti- Imperialist Front sent volunteers to help the Egyptian side (including its general secretary).

Life =Early Life and Marriage= Isabella was the elder of two children, she had one younger brother Humphrey. Their father died when the pair were still minors, and their mother remarried three more times. From their mother's third marriage to Raynald of Ch√¢tillon, the pair gained two half-siblings: Raymond, who died young and Alice, who married Azzo VI of Este.

Both of Isabelle's daughters were married roughly around the same time in 1189. In May, 1193, their spouses were both murdered.

It contains a single species, Tangasaurus mennelli. Discovery Tangasaurus is known only from three syntypes which represent two individuals. The small individual, which is well preserved in two specimens (part and counterpart) and is known from a partial skull and a nearly complete postcranial skeleton, was designated as the lectotype of the genus. The part slab (showing the partial skull and postcranial) is hosted at the Bulawayo Museum, Zimbabwe, while the counterpart slab SAM 6231 (showing the other side of the postcranial) is hosted at the South African Museum, Cape town. The third syntype, SAM 6232, represents a nearly complete postcranial skeleton from a larger individual, but it is poorly preserved. All specimens were collected by F. P. Mennell in 1922 at the Mizimbazi River near Tanga City, northeastern Tanzania. They were collected from the Ruhuhu Valley, in the middle part of the Tanga beds, dating to the late Changhsingian stage of the Lopingian series, about 252.5‚Äì251 million years ago. Although Mennell reported a presence of eight nearly complete individuals from that site, subsequent work couldn't find any evidence for the missing 6 individuals. Mennell's report, alongside some reptilian fragments that were discovered in 1913 and reported by Janensch (1927), are the only reptilian fossils currently known from the Tanga beds. Numerous well preserved specimens from various Late Permian localities of Madagascar were initially identified as Tangasaurus by Piveteau (1926). During that time the Mozambique Channel had just started to open. However, a reexamination of these specimens by Carroll (1981) and Currie (1982) has shown that they represent a different genus, Thadeosaurus, known only from Madagascar. Another specimen from Madagascar, MNHN 1908-32-57, was also tentatively referred to Tangasaurus. However, Currie (1980) found it to represent a new and distinct genus which he named Acerosodontosaurus. Description Tangasaurus was described and named by Sidney H. Haughton in 1924 who found it to be a probable diapsid reptile that, because of the long, powerful, flattened tail, had become adapted for an aquatic existence. Contrary to Haughton, Piveteau (1926) considered Tangasaurus to be a primarily terrestrial animal. Following Nopcsa (1924), he considered it to be related to the Araeoscelis, Kadaliosaurus, Broomia and the \\"eosuchians\\" (a defunct clade that used to unite all diapsids more advanced than Araeoscelis) Saurosternon and Pleurosaurus. Described by Piveteau (1926), Hovasaurus boulei from Madagascar was considered to be related to Mesosaurus. Although not as specialized as Mesosaurus for living in the water, Piveteau noted its short neck, short manus, well developed haemal spines and slight pachyostosis of the ribs. Haughton (1930) restudied Piveteau's specimens from Madagascar, concluding that Tangasaurus (then included the Malagasy specimens) and Hovasaurus were allied and that both were diapsids. Tangasaurus was considered to be morphologically intermediate between Youngina and Hovasaurus which was recognized as an aquatic reptile due to its short forelimb and coracoid, small ossification and elongated body. Piveteau (1926) included Broomia, Saurosternon and Tangasaurus in the Tangasaurinae. After Haughton's paper (1930), Tangasaurus and Hovasaurus were usually included as the only representatives of the family Tangasauridae. The known specimens of Tangasaurus were redescribed by Philip J. Currie (1982). He diagnosed the genus on the basis of two autapomorphies: It possesses high and rectangular neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae and the height of neural spine of mid- caudal vertebra about 35% greater than length of associated centrum, and about 75% length of associated haemal arch and spine. The largest \\"tangasaurid\\" (sensu Currie, 1982) is Hovasaurus with an estimated maximum snout-vent length of about . The largest specimen of Tangasaurus is 20% smaller than that, but its incomplete ossification suggests that larger specimens probably existed. Currie (1982) united to subfamilies within the Tangasauridae: Kenyasaurinae (that he named to include Kenyasaurus and Thadeosaurus) and Tangasaurinae (to include Tangasauridae sensu Haughton, 1930). He allied Tangasauridae and Youngina together within superfamily Younginoidea which he named. Currie (1980) named Acerosodontosaurus, and allied it with Younginoidea in the clade Younginiformes. More recent works that use phylogenetic analyses usually suggest that neither Younginoidea nor Younginiformes are monophyletic. Constanze Bickelmann, Johannes M√ºller and Robert R. Reisz (2009) redescribed Acerosodontosaurus and suggested an aquatic lifestyle for it. Their analysis is figured below, and it found support for two distinct families within \\"Younginiformes\\": the aquatic Tangasauridae, and the terrestrial Younginidae (in partial polytomy with Tangasauridae). More resolved results were obtained by Robert R. Reisz, Sean P. Modesto and Diane M. Scott (2011) in their description of Orovenator. However, those results required the exclusion of the fragmentary taxa Galesphyrus, Kenyasaurus, Palaeagama and Saurosternon from their analysis. The cladogram below shows Tangasaurus phylogenetic position among other neodiapsids following Reisz et al., 2011. Etymology Tangasaurus was first described and named by Sidney H. Haughton in 1924 and the type species is Tangasaurus mennelli. The generic name is derived from the name of the Tanga Region in which the only known specimens were found, and Greek sauros, meaning \\"lizard\\". The specific name honors F. P. Mennell, the geologist who reported and collected the specimens of Tangasaurus.

Jews Surrender Gem Trade to Indians, Erich Wiedemann, DEM SPIEGEL, May 15, 2006 These were sent to India for cutting and polishing, where labour costs were much lower. Gradually they started dealing in larger diamonds. In 1992, The Jain Cultural Centre of Antwerpen VZW was formed with 12 committee members and 52 founder members. Land for a Jain temple and a meditation centre (Upashray) was purchased. In 2001, construction of Antwerp Jain temple and meditation hall began.

Its offices and library are in the Great North Museum: Hancock, whose building, land and collections it owns. It leases them to Newcastle University, on whose behalf they are administered by Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums. It possesses a substantial natural history library and archive and maintains the Gosforth Nature Reserve, one of the oldest designated nature reserves in North East England. It also carries out research and provides talks, field trips and educational courses, as well as publishing scientific papers. Gosforth Nature Reserve NHSN has managed Gosforth Nature Reserve since 1929. This 1 km x 1 km wildlife refuge north of Newcastle upon Tyne includes a shallow lake with extensive reed bed, mixed woodland and small areas of wildflower meadow. The reserve is scientifically important for its uncommon flora and fauna, which includes bittern, kingfisher, otter, red squirrel, coralroot orchid and purple hairstreak butterfly. The reserve has hides and boardwalks that enable visitors to view waterfowl, waders and reed bed birds at one of the most popular birdwatching sites in the Newcastle area. Woodland trails and a feeding station provide an opportunity to see a wide range of woodland birds, mammals and flowers. Access to the reserve is restricted to NHSN members or those who purchase a day-pass from the information hut upon arrival. Publications The Northumbrian Naturalist (known as the Transactions until 2009) has been published by NHSN since 1831. This journal contains scientific papers, research and observations about the natural world of Northumbria and is the only journal of its kind in the North East. Northumberland Coastal Wildlife is published in partnership with various conservation organisations who manage designates sites along the Northumberland coast. This annual report records the numbers of pairs of breeding birds on the islands, a bird ringing report and an account of all the rarities observed during the time the wardens are in residence. The latter also includes details about cetacean sightings, information on the Farne Islands grey seal colony, and an account of butterfly and moth records. Activities NHSN continues to provide a range of field trips, events and education courses designed to inspire wonder in the natural world, as well as informative public talks throughout the winter period. More recently, the organisation launched its 1829 Talks ‚Äì delivered by early-career scientists studying at local universities. NHSN remains active in conservation and research in North East England, advising on various committees concerned with the protection of the region's wildlife. Through bird ringing, biological recording and the giving of small grants in sponsorship of local environmental studies, it continues to be actively involved in monitoring the fortunes of local wildlife. The organisation continues to support the development of young naturalists through its Student Naturalist Award Scheme and support via its Lantern Fund.  History  The key events in the history of the NHSN are as follows. *NHSN was formed on 19 August 1829 as an offshoot of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne, which had been founded in 1793. It was initially named the Natural History Society of Northumberland, Durham and Newcastle upon Tyne, and acquired its present name later. It began with a membership of 134. *In 1832, in order to house the NHSN collections, subscriptions were raised to build a new museum, the Newcastle Museum. This was on land behind the Literary & Philosophical Society's building (now part of Newcastle station). It was opened to the public in 1834. *In 1878, plans were announced for the building of a bigger museum, the Great North Museum: Hancock (as it is now called). John Hancock (see below), a local naturalist and taxidermist, was the driving force behind the project. The Prince and Princess of Wales officially opened the Museum on 20 August 1884, amid great celebrations hosted by Sir William and Lady Armstrong of Cragside. It was named the Hancock Museum in 1891 in memory of John and Albany Hancock, and acquired its present name in 2009 after a refurbishment. *In 1924, the Gosforth Nature Reserve came into being, initially as a bird sanctuary, when W. E. Beck, a member of the Society, leased the shooting rights over Gosforth Park from its owners, the High Gosforth Park Company. In 1929, Mr Beck, suffering ill health, handed over these rights to NHSN, which has managed it for wildlife ever since. *In 1949, NHSN became the official bird-ringing organization for the Farne Islands, and this work continues today. In 1951, the Society began to systematically study grey seals on the Farne Islands, commencing the longest period of continuous research in any British grey seal colony. *In 1960, NHSN, struggling to maintain the Hancock Museum, reached an agreement with Kings College (now Newcastle University) in which the latter acquired a 99-year lease of the museum and collections. A management committee was created and made responsible for running the museum and preserving the collection. The organisation is still represented on this today. *In 1961-62, NHSN helped in the birth of the Northumberland and Durham Naturalists' Trust, now the Northumberland Wildlife Trust and Durham Wildlife Trust. A symbiotic relationship exists with these to this day. *In 2006, the Hancock Museum was taken out of service and extensively refurbished, re-emerging as part of the Great North Museum in 2009.  Notable members  In chronological order (by date of demise): *William Loftus (c.1821‚Äì1858) was an English archaeologist and traveller. *Joshua Alder (1792‚Äì1867) was an amateur zoologist and malacologist specialising in tunicates and gastropods. *Albany Hancock (1806‚Äì1873) was brother of the ornithologist John Hancock and specialised in the anatomy of sea creatures especially sea slugs or nudibranchs, depicting them in minute detail. His watercolour drawings are held in the Society's archives. *William Chapman Hewitson (1806‚Äì1878) was a wealthy collector, particularly of beetles, lepidopterans, bird's nests and eggs. He built up an extensive collection of butterflies of the world and was an accomplished illustrator. *Grace Hickling (1908‚Äì1986) had a long association with the Farne Islands as a researcher and conservationist. She became the public face of the islands and played a key role in ensuring that they were recognised nationally for their importance as a habitat for seals and seabirds. *John Hancock (1808‚Äì1890) was an ornithologist, producing his Catalogue of the Birds of Northumberland and Durham in 1874. His greatest talent, however, was taxidermy and his collection of mounted British birds can still be seen today in the Bird Gallery of the Great North Museum: Hancock. *Mary Jane Hancock (1810‚Äì1896) was an amateur botanist and enthusiastic watercolour painter, and the youngest sister of John and Albany Hancock. The Natural History Society of Northumbria holds over 60 of her paintings and more than 300 botany specimens from her personal collections. *Marie Victoire Lebour (1876‚Äì1971) studied the life cycles of many aquatic organisms, rearing them from eggs to larvae and on through metamorphosis to adulthood, using the newly invented plunger jars which kept water flowing and full of oxygen. Her knowledge has contributed to our understanding of marine organisms from herring fish to single-cell diatoms. *David Gardner-Medwin (1936‚Äì2014) was a paediatric neurologist who worked with children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1966 he became involved with the Natural History Society of Northumbria, for which he was once chairman of its library committee and later chairman of its council.Dixon, Hugh (Spring 2015) \\"A man for all seasons; David Gardner- Medwin, Cherryburn and the Bewick Society\\".

It was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site and also added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 26, 1985. Description Built in 1887‚Äì1888, the 2¬Ω-story house was built in the architectural mix of Queen Anne and Late Victorian style. The house features an irregular floor plan with a variety of window shapes. It was constructed with a combination of stone, brick, and wood for the various features. The interior design of the structure has remained unchanged since its original construction, including a second floor cistern. Between 1888‚Äì1892, a two-story addition was built on the back. In 1917, the dormer on the third floor was removed after a fire. In 1941, the porches were altered, and one was removed. History The house was built for prominent local businessman Joseph Armstrong, who moved to the United States from Ireland in 1871. In 1872, he moved to Lapeer in part due to the expanding railroad in the area. He opened a dry goods store that he operated for the next 37 years before retiring. He purchased the site of his home in 1886 and contracted a local carpenter, Robert T. Bacon, to construct the house and other smaller structures on the property within the next two years. Following Joseph Armstrong's death, the property passed to his son, Jay Armstrong. Jay died in 1956. His wife, Evelyn, lived alone in the house until her death in 1981 when the house was sold.

The casus belli for the attack was the Wu leader Sun Quan's refusal to send his son Sun Deng as a hostage to the Wei court, under which Wu was a nominal vassal at the time. The invasions were separated into two parts. The first attack occurred in the years 222‚Äì224 before Cao Pi ordered total retreat. The second and last part was fought in 225. Background After the Shu Han emperor Liu Bei was defeated by Sun Quan's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting, Sun benefited from his submission to Cao Pi, who would help him in the conflict against Liu Bei. However, on both sides, this was never a popular concept, especially in the ranks of Sun Quan, who had defeated Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs 14 years ago. To make matters worse, Sun Quan and his officers were uneasy about Sun's titles and ranks (such as King of Wu) because they were seen as a vassal state to Wei. It was even considered within Sun Quan's forces that the alliance with Wei was futile, because the defeat they caused Liu Bei at Xiaoting was so critical that it meant that their alliance with Wei was no longer necessary for survival. Sun Quan also appeared as if he was planning to maintain this alliance not much longer than was necessary. In time, Cao Pi's plan to keep Sun Quan and Shu's relations sour backfired as Sun Quan and Liu Bei rekindled their alliance. In an attempt to improve his own relations with the Sun clan, he demanded Sun Deng (Sun Quan's eldest son) to be sent to the Wei capital Luoyang as a hostage. However, Sun Quan declined this request, and later apologized to Cao Pi, stating his son was still very young and vulnerable in his health to be away from his home and family. Cao Pi did not bring up or press the matter. However soon Cao Pi demanded Sun Deng as hostage again. This was also declined. Diplomatic ties between the two continued to sour until finally, Cao Pi attacked Sun Quan. Sun Quan repeatedly sent envoys to negotiate peace between the two, but resulted in failure. Soon after, Sun Quan proceeded to declare independence in November 222. First, second, and third invasions: (222‚Äì223) =Dongkou= In the autumn of 222, Wei general Cao Xiu led a naval fleet down the Zijiang tributary river to the Yangtze onto the Wu stronghold at Dongkou, under the command of Wu general L√º Fan. The initial efforts of Wei were a success in battle against the Wu commander, but the Wu reinforcements led by Sun Shao and Xu Sheng managed to stalemate the naval attack. The battle concluded in late spring of 223. =Jiangling= Further west of the Yangtze, Wei generals Cao Zhen, Zhang He, and Xiahou Shang attacked two Wu positions in Jing Province from Xiangyang. Zhang He led the attack to overrun the outpost at Nan Commandery, successfully defeating Sun Sheng in the process. Cao Zhen and Xiahou Shang opened the siege of Jiangling, capital of Jing Province. Though the Wu forces there under control of Zhu Ran were not strong, the siege was put on hold when Wu reinforcements led by Pan Zhang and Zhuge Jin arrived. Eventually the Wei camp was plagued by a disease, thus forcing another retreat and another stalemate. =Ruxu= The third invasion was not directed at the region of Nanjing or the Jing Province, but closer to the Wu king Sun Quan. The late Wu general Gan Ning helped take the Wei outpost in Yang Province at Ruxu, at the mouth of the Ruxu River into the Yangtze therefore Cao Ren attacked Ruxu. However, the assault also ended in retreat when Cao Ren learned that the other two armies attacking Dongkou and Jiangling had withdrawn from their positions. Rebellion of Jin Zong In the summer of 223, Wu general Jin Zong (ÊôãÂÆó) defected to Wei and moved to the new Wei outpost north of the Yangtze at Qichun. Wu general He Qi led the attack on Jin Zong, however, his forces decided to withdraw due to extremely hot weather conditions. He Qi managed to capture Jin Zong in the process. Fourth invasion: Incident at Guangling The last invasion occurred in 225, though no fighting officially occurred. Cao Pi led more than 100,000 men and naval vessels towards Guangling, on the opposite side of the Yangtze River from Jianye (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu). However, Wu had blockaded the river and the winter was harsh, causing the river to freeze; thus Cao Pi had a slim chance of success if he engaged in combat with Sun Quan. Looking at the unassailable barrier before his troops, he sighed, and ordered the withdrawal of his forces.

An all- rounder, Page scored 4,005 runs and took 212 wickets in first-class cricket. As an occasional wicket-keeper, he also made 14 stumpings. He played for Cheltenham College in 1881 and 1882 with some success, and when he went to Wadham College, Oxford, he made the university cricket team in his first year. Playing in the University Match against Cambridge each year between 1883 and 1886, he scored consistently, reached fifty on two occasions, and was captain in his final two years. Page also played for Gloucestershire between 1883 and 1895, scoring one century, and was regularly selected in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players matches between 1884 and 1894. Although selected for a representative tour to Australia in 1887-88, he was unable to go. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, his best innings was a score of 93 runs against Nottinghamshire, a team possessing a strong bowling attack, in 1883. Page also played rugby for Oxford and Gloucestershire, and hockey for East Gloucestershire, captaining the latter club for 22 years. Between 1888 and 1923, Page held a teaching post at Cheltenham College. According to his Wisden obituary, Page was a \\"capital batsman, possessing strong defence and good hitting power. He was also a medium-paced bowler with a curl from leg and a break from the off, could keep a good length and was to be relied on. In the field he was hard-working and excellent, being safe in any position.\\" Jack Hobbs claimed in 1935 that Page could bowl the googly while at the University in the 1880s, some time before Bernard Bosanquet is credited with the delivery's invention.

Wilson argues, building on the paper \\"The evolution of eusociality\\" (2010) by Wilson, Martin Nowak and Corina Tarnita in Nature, for more importance of group selection and against the idea of kin selection.  Reception  The Nature article was controversial, with many experts arguing against its conclusions, including an \\"outraged response\\" later in the same journal by 137 authors. Richard Dawkins wrote a harshly critical review for Prospect, in which he stated that Wilson had earlier supported Bill Hamilton's theory of kin selection but had, over the years, moved away from it, to the point where it was debatable that he had really understood the theory.

History  Newlands Lane (Lower School)  Previously Ellington School for Girls, the school amalgamated with The Hereson School (a boys' school in Broadstairs) in September 2009, and was renamed The Ellington and Hereson School. The school was initially based over the two former school sites, but all pupils were transferred to the former Ellington School site on Newlands Lane in 2011 (the Ellington School had been rebuilt in 2007). In March 2015 it was announced that The Ellington and Hereson School was proposed to merge with The Marlowe Academy from September 2015. Reasons for the merger included that the site for The Ellington and Hereson School was restricting its growth as a successful school.  Stirling Way (Upper School)  The Upper School site, formerly The Marlowe Academy The Marlowe Academy was founded in 2005 as an academy, with thirty million pounds spent on the new school buildings. It was intended to replace the existing Ramsgate School (previously known as Conyngham School), which had been marked as \\"failing\\" after inspections by the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted). In January 2011, the school leadership said they were disappointed in its standings in the performance tables, showing it third from last, but said that \\"this academy was set up to solve the problems in a particular area and we are doing that\\", with the 67% proportion of pupils achieving five A*-C grades at GCSE being better than previous years. A particular problem faced by the school is described as the \\"low academic standards of pupils coming into the Academy from local primary schools\\". The school was considered amongst \\"the worst schools in England\\" following an Ofsted inspection later in 2011, which found that \\"many Year 10 and 11 pupils had a reading age that was at least two years below their actual age\\", and placed the school in special measures. However, a subsequent inspection in March 2012 found that the school had made satisfactory progress in all areas inspected. \\"The number of children gaining five good GCSEs had improved\\", but was still below expected standards, at only twenty per cent. Some credit for the improvements was given to temporary principal Carl Wakefield, who was described as having \\"changed the Marlowe Academy in just nine months\\". As well as continued improvements in exam results, with an expectation of 84% of students achieving grades between A* and C at GCSE in 2012, as against 64% in 2011 and only 4% in 2005, in May 2012 it was claimed that a greater proportion of students were planning to stay on at the Marlowe Academy for their A-levels, instead of moving to other colleges in the area. The Academy however continued to receive poor Ofsted reports, including in November 2014 when a statement said that \\"senior leaders, trustees and sponsor are not taking effective action to tackle the areas requiring improvement.\\" In March 2015 it was announced that Marlowe Academy would merge with the Ellington and Hereson School. Reasons for the merger included that despite improvements, The Marlowe Academy continued to have lower exam results compared the Ellington and Hereson School, and The Marlowe Academy was continuing to see a fall in pupil numbers.  The Royal Harbour Academy  The merger of The Ellington and Hereson School and The Marlowe Academy was enacted in September 2015, with the new school being renamed The Royal Harbour Academy. However the new school is currently a foundation school, having the same governance arrangements as the former Ellington and Hereson School.

Arthur), a cabaret dancer and Zella's partner. He dismisses Lee as a simpering dandy. Lee arrogantly tries to get even with the sergeant, and as a result, he is arrested and sent to an Army training camp instead of jail. With World War I raging, now drafted as a private, Lee again finds himself pitted against tough Drill Sergeant Diggs. Private Lee does everything he can to annoy Sergeant Diggs, thinking it will get him thrown out of the Army. At camp, Private Lee's life is made miserable by the constant badgering of Diggs, but he reciprocates in kind. Both men have their sights set on the pretty Betty Wayne (Marceline Day), the judge's daughter. The rivalry between the tough sergeant and bumbling recruit goes through many mishaps and missteps until it finally gets resolved. The Army camp has reconnaissance balloons and, by accident, Diggs and Betty find themselves adrift in a runaway balloon. Lee sees a full complement of parachutes, and sets off in an aircraft to rescue Diggs and Betty. Lee manages to pull off an aircraft-to-balloon jump, making sure that the two stranded accidental aerialists make it safely to the ground.

In both the Canadas he served as President of the Executive Council and Speaker of the Legislative Council. During the Hunter administration, he was the most powerful man in Upper Canada. In Lower Canada, from 1802 until his death he was second only in rank to the Lieutenant Governor. Early life in England In 1762, he was born in England at Marylebone, London. He was the first son of Alexander and Anne (Elligood) Elmsley. He was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1786, MA in 1789, and entered the Inner Temple in 1790. At London in July, 1796, he married Mary Hallowell, daughter of Captain Benjamin Hallowell (1723-1799) R.N., of Roxbury, Boston, by his wife Mary, daughter of Thomas Boylston. Together they had at least one son, John Jr, who later followed him into the Executive Council of Upper Canada. Mrs Elmsley's Loyalist father was His Majesty's Commissioner of Customs for the Port of Boston at the time of the Boston Tea Party, which led the excited revolutionaries to persecute and expel the family from Boston, on pain of death. Mrs Elmsley was a niece of Governor Moses Gill and her brothers included Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell-Carew, one of Nelson's Band of Brothers, and Ward Hallowell (better known as Ward Nicholas Boylston), the great benefactor of Harvard University. Her mother was a first cousin of Susanna Boylston, the mother of the 2nd President of the United States, John Adams, and grandmother of the 6th President, John Quincy Adams. Upper Canada In November 1796, Elmsley arrived at Niagara-on-the- Lake, soon after followed by his wife and father-in-law. Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe had left the province in July, choosing Peter Russell to act as administrator in his absence. Before he left Simcoe had ordered that the provincial capital was moved from Niagara to York (Toronto), and Russell was busy organising the unwelcome upheaval. For legal reasons, Elmsley objected strongly to the move which brought him into conflict with Russell throughout 1797. Elmsley House, Toronto. Built 1798. In July, 1797, Parliament was held at York, but a compromise had been met with a bill passed to permit the courts to remain at Niagara-on-the-Lake for a further two years. Elmsley finally moved to York in the spring of 1798, building a large house that later became the Lieutenant-Governor's residence. The administrator (Russell) and the chief justice (Elmsley) continued to disagree about almost everything. Concerning land grants and tariffs with Lower Canada, Elmsley was greatly influenced by his friend Richard Cartwright, generally supporting the Loyalist and merchant points of view. In legal matters, he tried to adapt English law to Canadian circumstances but was consistently opposed by Allcock, who believed that there should be absolutely no tampering with English law, procedures, and precedents. Elmsley was one of the few university graduates in the province, and was much given to elegant phrases and Latin quotations, a habit that may not have endeared him to all his colleagues. Lower Canada and death When the Duke of Portland had appointed Elmsley to the Chief Justiceship of Upper Canada, he had also promised him promotion to the Chief Justiceship of Lower Canada as soon as the post became vacant. In 1800, fearing he would lose money with another move, Elmsley withdrew his claim. Despite his reluctance, he was appointed to the Lower Canadian post in 1802, following the resignation of William Osgoode. The salary was increased from ¬£1,000 to ¬£1,500 a year, and he was to be called to the Executive and Legislative Councils of Lower Canada with a 'seat next in Rank to the Lieutenant Governor.' He traveled to Montreal in February 1805 with plans to go to the United States after he had become seriously ill in November of the previous year. He died in Montreal on April 29, 1805. Legacy When the Fort York Government House was destroyed in the War of 1812 by an explosion from the British ammunition magazine, Chief Justice Elmsley's house was purchased on King Street and converted into the new Government House. Despite this it was still called Elmsley House for a long period. Personal Elmsley's son Captain John Elmsley (1801-1863) was a member of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada and Executive Council of Upper Canada.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/elmsley_john_1801_63_9E.html Elmsley converted as a Roman Catholic and is buried at St. Michael's Cathedral (Toronto).

(up is east) The fortifications of Kingston upon Hull consisted of three major constructions: the brick built Hull town walls, first established in the early 14th century (Edward I), with four main gates, several posterngates, and up to thirty towers at its maximum extent; Hull Castle, on the east bank of the River Hull, protecting Hull's river harbour, constructed in the mid 16th century (Henry VIII) and consisting of two blockhouses and a castle connected by a curtain wall; and the later 17th century Citadel, an irregular triangular, bastioned, primitive star fort replacing the castle on the east river bank. The town walls were demolished and replaced with the town docks over approximately 50 years from the 1770s, the Citadel was demolished and the site turned over to shipbuilding and dock activities in the 1860s. City Walls John Speed's map of 1611. Hessle (Hassle), Myton (Mitton), North (Northe), Beverley and Posterne gates are shown, as well as the castle The early Hull is thought to have been surrounded by a ditch, in the 14th century, construction of walled defences began. During the reign of Edward I, in 1322 the town gained the right of murage for five years; in 1327 permission to crenelate was granted ‚Äì including the construction of a fortified wall and houses. Additional grants of murage were given in 1341, and in 1348. The circuit of walls is thought to have been completed by sometime around 1356, built primarily of brick. The plan of the fortified town has been said (Parker, 1853; Viollet-le-Duc, 1856) to be similar to that of the contemporary Bastides of France, in particular Libourne, also founded under Edward I. When built the walls stretched from the west bank of the Hull to the bank of the Humber Estuary. By 1640 there were with barbicans constructed across a moat at either end; Northgates near the River Hull, and Hesslegates near the Humber. There were intermediate gates at Beverley Gate and Myton Gate. There was also a wall against the Humber, from Hessle Gate to the confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary at South End; on this part of the wall a gate (Water Gate, or Mamhole Gate) gave access to the Humber, by a small piece of land known as the Mamhole, used as the town dump amongst other purposes. Except at the mamhole the south walls were built up to the banks of the Humber. There were no walls on the bank of the River Hull, and soft ground at Northgates near the river bank prevented the walls being contiguous up to the river bank, in 1585 the fortifications at this gap were improved; a mud wall was constructed, and in 1630 an earthen wall with brick facing and a palisade was built. In addition to the five main gates several posterns in the wall existed, only wide enough for a person, each surmounted by a manned tower. Known examples are Low Gate in the north wall, and at the end of the streets Posterngate, and Blackfriargate (Blanket Row) on the western walls. In the 16th century John Leland stated that there were over twenty towers in the circuit of the walls; the exact number is unknown, early maps show up to 30 towers in total. After Henry VIII's visit in 1541 all entrances except the main gates, as well as North and Hessle gates were ordered to be walled up. During the English Civil War the fortifications were added to, with \\"hornworks\\" ('half moon' artillery batteries) built outside the main gates, additional defences connected the batteries, possibly as high as the original walls (14 ft), and a wide ditch outside the walls (later known as \\"Bush Dike\\") was added. The earthen ramparts behind the town walls were also built up at this time; in November 1646 a 50-yard section of wall to the north of Myton gate collapsed during the sieges, due to causes that may have included rain, excess weight of the earth bank and weight of the guns on the wall. During the late 17th and 18th centuries, the walls continued to be maintained; Beckman's report (1680) recommended the repair or reconstruction of 235 yards of the walls. In 1735 a tower over Beverley Gate was removed due to its poor condition, and Hessle Gate unblocked in 1761; the walls were reported to be in very poor condition in 1752. In 1774 the walls from North Gate to Harry Ogle's Tower, on the Humber bank were granted to the Hull Dock Company for the construction of a new town dock. =The river chain= Entrance to the town via the River Hull was protected by a chain hung across the river's mouth. A tower on the east bank may have been installed in 1380; in the 1460s during the period of turmoil during Henry VI's reign, a chain and windlass was installed (or renewed) across the mouth of the River Hull to be able to prevent any hostile ship entering the River Hull. After Henry VIII's visit the east side chain tower was improved. In the 1590s during a period of expected invasion from the Netherlands improvements were ordered to the chain; the attachment of logs to cause it to float when deployed. =Demolition ‚Äì Hull town docks, 1774‚Äì1829= In 1774 the Hull Dock Act established the Hull Dock Company, entitled to raise ¬£100,000 of capital through share issues and loans. It inherited the city walls, ditches and related defences west of the river. The town docks were subsequently built along the route of the walls, which were demolished. The first dock (1778, renamed Queen's Dock in 1854) was built in the area occupied by Beverley and North gates, and the intermediate walls, which were demolished, a second dock (Humber Dock, 1809) was built on the land between Hessle and Myton gates, and a third dock between the two was opened 1829 as Junction Dock (later Prince's Dock). The southern stretch of walls were removed in the early 1800s; by 1813 the land at Hull on the banks of the Humber had been extended southwards beyond the original wall and bank by dumping of material excavated during the construction of the town docks. The Castle Plan of the Castle, derived from Wenceslas Hollar's map of Hull During the Pilgrimage of Grace (1536) control of Hull was briefly taken by the rebels. After the rebellion, in late 1541 King Henry VIII visited Hull, and instructed that the fortifications be improved; in addition to scouring of the moat, and repairs and improvements to the walls and gates, he instructed that the de la Pole house, which had become the King's property was to be made into the town's citadel, and modifications made to the drainage system outside the town, so that the fields could be flooded at times of threat. In February 1542 Henry's plan for Hull had expanded in scope ‚Äì to the construction of a fortress in addition to the walls ‚Äì Henry appointed Michael Stanhope as his commander in Hull, providing ¬£18,000 for the castle's construction. Hull Castle was completed by the end of 1543, using locally made brick, as well as stone, some provided through the recently dissolved monastery at Meaux Abbey, as well as from St Mary's church in Hull. The structure was built on the east bank of the Hull, with three forts, connected by a wall, stretching from the opposite bank of the Hull to Northgates, south to the River Humber. The central fort \\"Hull Castle\\" was supported by two blockhouses on either end of the wall. At the same time as a bridge \\"North Bridge\\" was constructed across the Hull, just outside the walls; it was the first river bridge in Hull. The castle was a three-storey structure, with walls deep, surrounded by a thick outer wall, the blockhouses were slight smaller area, two-storey structures, trefoil in shape, with rectangular building on the fourth corner in the direction of the joining walls. In 1552 control of the Castle and blockhouses was transferred to the town of Hull. On 16 September 1643 the north blockhouse was partially destroyed during the second Siege of Hull, and the north bridge damaged when the magazine was accidentally ignited by a careless gunner. Both were later repaired at a cost of ¬£2,000. In 1657 the castle was requiring repairs estimated to cost ¬£5,000, and in 1670 storms caused damage to the south blockhouse that undermined its stability. In the 1680s the fortifications of Hull as well as Tilbury, Sheerness, and Portsmouth were ordered. The work on the Hull castle, under the control of Swedish engineer Martin Beckman would transform the fortifications on the east bank of the Hull into modern triangular fort, with governors house, magazine, and three barracks buildings that became known as the Hull Citadel. The southern blockhouse and castle were incorporated into the Citadel, with the connecting wall removed. The northern blockhouse was outside the boundaries of the new fort, and was retained, later let for commercial purposes, before being demolished in 1802. The Citadel The town with Citadel in 1786. Also shown is the first town dock on the line of the north walls, and the western walls and Bush Dike. (survey by A. Bower) The Citadel was a result of extensive remodelling and civil engineering work on the former Hull Castle and South Blockhouse (1680s); a triangular artillery fort was created at the western bank of the Hull at its confluence with the Humber. Beckmann estimated the cost of the improvements at over ¬£74,000 and eventually over ¬£100,000 was expended on the works, was acquired by the Crown for the expanded work. The new fortification extended onto the old village of Drypool, and part of that village had houses built to the north of the village church, outside the Citadel. The Citadel was an irregular triangular fort, with curtain walls of 100 (east), 266 (south) and 258 (west) yards with bastions at each apex, each with wall lengths of around 100 yards. The Castle and south blockhouse were retained and incorporated into the north and western bastions respectively. The structure was surrounded by a broad moat on the eastern and western sides. Military use of the Citadel ended by 1848, and it was transferred to the 'Commissioners of Woods and Forests' in 1858, and rented out to commerce. The Citadel was sold in 1863, and in 1864 the site was cleared for industrial and dock use. The Sieges of Hull In addition to actions during the Pilgrimage of Grace, and English Civil War, the town is said to have been briefly besieged around 1392 by enraged villagers from Cottingham and Anlaby, who objected to the construction of waterways from sources near their villages to supply Hull with fresh water. Around 1,000 persons threatened the town, as well as causing a nuisance in the countryside, and damaged the channels, but were ultimately unsuccessful and withdrew; the ringleaders are said to have been hanged at York, others pardoned.Sources:  =Pilgrimage of Grace= During the northern English religious rebellion known as the Pilgrimage of Grace during which both York and Pontefract Castle were taken, a third force, commanded by the Stapletons besieged Hull; the town refused to join the rebellion when visited by envoys on 12 and 13 October 1536. The opposing force led by Ralph Ellerker, and John and William Constable capitulated after a five-day siege, and the rebel force (estimated at up to 6,000, probably 2,000‚Äì3,000) took control of the town on 19/20 October 1536, installing John Hallam as governor; subsequently the monks and friars were reinstated in their respective monasteries and friaries.Sources: A truce was agreed between the rebels and the King (October/November 1536), during which time the King's position became much stronger. It is said this information reached Hull, and Hallam was expelled from the town by the emboldened Mayor (William Rogers), Alderman Eland, and a Mr. Knowles and other local people. However soon after (9 November) it was retaken, and garrisoned by forces under Robert Constable, with cannon installed in the harbour to prevent besieging from the sea. On 2 December the rebellion ended, with the King's pardon being proclaimed; the rebel forces dispersed, thinking that they had obtained the concessions they desired. On 10 January 1537 the rebellion reignited, with Francis Bygot,Also written Bygod, Bigot, Bigod. See also Bigod's Rebellion stating that the King's pardon was not good, and began to conspire with others including John Hallam. Hallam and others entered the town on market day in disguise, in an attempt to capture it from within, but had misjudged the mood of the town, and found support lacking; Hallam escaped, but then returned within the town gates in an attempt to rescue his colleagues, and was captured. Francis Bygot is recorded as having made an attempt to besiege the town in 1537; the rebels destroyed some windmills outside Beveleygates, but were unsuccessful in taking the town, and withdrew; whilst retreating they were attacked from the town by a party led by the Mayor, John Harrison, Ralph Ellerker and John Constable, with several killed or taken prisoner. Bygot is said to have captured Beverley, but was later captured. Hallam was tried and hanged at Hull, and in May 1537 Robert Constable was found guilty of treason, and hanged in Hull; his body was hung in chains from Beverley Gate. =English Civil War= Plaque by the foundations of the Beverley Gate thumb In 1638 at the beginning of the period known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, during the buildup before the 1639 war with Scotland (First Bishops' War) agents acting on behalf of the King (Charles I) visited the town to inspect its defence; all but the three main gates were to be closed and in 1639 it was reported that the town could be defended by 1,000 men. Charles I was welcomed into Hull to inspect the fortifications and arsenal in 1639. In April 1642 the King returned to Hull to secure the arsenal at Hull, but was refused admittance at Beverley Gate by John Hotham. In July Charles I established his court in Beverley and the siege of Hull began. Dikes were cut around Hull preventing besieging forces becoming established outside the walls, and the Charterhouse was demolished to prevent it being used for the defence of any besieging forces, both Hessle and Myton Gates were closed and blocked, and additional artillery batteries set up outside Beverley, Myton and North gates. Skirmishes and artillery exchanges took place outside the walls, additionally there were unsuccessful plots to blow up the gates to admit Royalist forces. A successful skirmish by the Parliamentarians on the Royalist headquarters in Anlaby resulted in the raising of the siege. On 2 September 1643, a second siege of Hull began, with Thomas Fairfax ensconced as commander of the garrison, and the royalist Earl of Newcastle besieging. At this time the ruins of the Charterhouse outside the north walls on the west bank were turned into an artillery fort. After unsuccessful attacks on the royalist position at Anlaby the land around Hull was flooded again, preventing besieging attack. The north Blockhouse of the Castle was accidentally blown up by its own gunpowder store on 16 September. Fighting continued outside the walls in September, with royalists temporarily taking control of the defences at Hessle Gate and Charterhouse, before being forced to withdraw. On 11 October 1643 1,500 men fought a seven-hour battle outside the walls, captured the royalist positions and relieved the siege.

Biography  Ottaviano Fregoso, was the son of Agostino Fregoso and Gentile di Montefeltro, daughter of the renowned condottiero, patron of humanists, and book collector, Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. Ottaviano was born in Genoa, but, like his brother, the future cardinal, Federigo, spent much of his youth at the court of Urbino, presided over by their uncle, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro. There the brothers received a classical humanistic education and were the companions and close friends of such humanists as Pietro Bembo and Baldassare Castiglione and the painter Raphael. Ottaviano and Federigo Fregoso are participants in the fictional discussion presided over by Elisabetta Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino, in Baldassare Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, which was supposed to have taken place at the court of Urbino in 1507. In the dialog, both brothers, who themselves (like the other interlocutors in the discussion), are supposed to embody the Italian Renaissance ideal of courtly behavior in an ideal court, are depicted as defending a republican form of government. Beginning in 1497, Ottaviano participated in an alliance with King Charles VII of France, in order to expel the Sforza family from Genoa. In the early 1500s, he also defended his uncle's duchy of Urbino against Cesare Borgia, known as Valentino, the son of Pope Alexander VI. In the course of this war, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, was forced to destroy several fortresses rather than cede them to the enemy. In 1506 Guidobaldo conferred on Ottaviano the lordship of Sant'Agata Feltria, which was confirmed in 1513 by Pope Leo X.The Fregoso family's rule over Sant'Agata Feltria lasted until 1660, when the city returned to the Papal States, leaving its imprint on the city in the form of the seventeenth-century Palazzo Fregoso, called \\"La Ragione\\" (\\"The Palace of Reason\\"), now the city hall, and the town fortress. These monuments and others were constructed when the Fregosos rebuilt Sant'Agata after a landslide in 1561 had destroyed much of the town. They commence the construction of c their Palace of Reason and other noble palaces and churches at the start of the 1600s, adorning them with the works of famous painters like Pietro da Cortona , Guido Reni and Guercino. Also in 1506, Ottaviano was sent to Bologna to recover for the Papal States the cities that had fallen into the hands of Giovanni Bentivoglio. Subsequently, Ottaviano returned to Genoa, where he and his cousin, Giano II Campofregoso, attempted to expel their former allies, the French. At that time the Fregoso (Guelph) and the Adorno (Ghibelline) families were engaged in a violent struggle for the supremacy of the city. These clashes culminated in 1510 with the victory of Adornos: the Fregoso faction was forced again into exile and again took refuge in Urbino. Three years later, the Fregosos turned the tables and defeated the Adornos, returning to Genoa, where in June 1513 Ottaviano became Doge. During his government he initiated important public works such as the modernization of the port of Genoa and the construction of the tower of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo. For its times, Ottaviano's government displayed notable magnanimity towards its opponents, both those within his family, as with his cousin (and former ally against the French), Giano II Campofregoso, who plotted to take Ottaviano's place as Doge, and toward members of such traditionally hostile families as the Adorno and the Fieschi. After 1515, Ottaviano Fregoso was forced to acknowledge King Francis I of France, as his overlord; Francis, however, allowed Ottaviano to remain on as ruler of Genoa. In 1520 Pope Leo X conferred on him the title of Count. When Spanish troops under Emperor Charles V sacked and occupied Genoa in 1522, Ottaviano was captured and imprisoned, first at Naples, then at Aversa, and then in the fortress of Ischia, where he died in 1524, according to some authors, by poisoning. After his death, the fief of S. Agatha was ruled, first by his brother, Cardinal Federigo Fregoso and then by his son Aurelio. To this day, descendants of Ottaviano Fregoso are noted to reside in the United States, with the majority of them residing in the states of; CA, VA, NY, NV, and FL, with the majority of them residing in CA, VA and NY. Descendants noted; Immediate; Antonasio Fregoso, Robert Fregoso, Deborah Fregoso, Bobby Fregoso, Charlotte Fregoso, Sean Fregoso, Elizabeth Fregoso, Skylar Fregoso, Jordan Fregoso, and Garrett Fregoso. Assessments Contemporary historians and intellectuals remembered Ottaviano as a liberal and magnanimous prince, holding him up as a quintessential Renaissance gentleman and a pattern for rulers, as did Baldassare Castiglione who made him one of the interlocutors in The Book of the Courtier (1528). Francesco Guicciardini, in his History of Italy (1561) records him as \\"certainly a prince of most excellent virtue, notable for his justice and other noble qualities, and as beloved in Genoa as any ruler could be in that city of factions, where the memory of their ancient liberties was not entirely extinguished in the minds of the citizenry.\\"In contrast to these contemporary evaluations, three hundred years later, in 1835, the Genovese historian Girolamo Serra, writing in his Storia della antica Liguria e di Genova judged Ottaviano to have been temperamentally unsuited to his times, particularly during the Spanish invasion in 1522: > But the timid Ottaviano deferred to the deliberations of the Senate and the > citizenry. The multitude should be consulted in times of peace; but times of > crisis call for action rather than words, and what is needed, rather, is a > prompt and resolute will. In the event, there were so many differing > opinions that nothing was concluded. References *Girolamo Serra.

The theory takes its name from mosaic tile art, because while an entire picture can be seen from a mosaic's tiles at a distance, no clear picture emerges from viewing a single tile in isolation. The theory has detractors, who say that when governments argue any seemingly innocuous scrap of information is part of a larger intelligence mosaic, governments effectively get free rein to argue just about anything is part of intelligence and must be kept secret. Some legal scholars, for example, argue mosaic theory can undermine transparency and civil rights. The method is used by American intelligence analysts. As practiced in the CIA's black sites and the United States military's interrogation centers at Guantanamo, Bagram Theater Internment Facility, and Kandahar detention facility, captives who were not themselves suspected of an involvement with terrorism were nevertheless held, and interrogated, because someone they had an innocent association with was suspected of an involvement with terrorism. Interrogation of these individuals, in great detail, en masse, was believed to allow analysts to fill in the mosaic and the milieu of actual terrorists. The method was learned by financial analyst Harry Markopolos during his Army Reserve service, and was credited by him as a major tool used in exposing the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme.

The C&O; built eleven aqueducts along its length. Seneca Aqueduct is a unique structure, not only being the first built, but also the only red sandstone aqueduct on the C&O;‚àíand the only aqueduct that is also a lock (Lock 24, or Riley's Lock). It is located at the end of Riley's Lock Road in Seneca, Maryland.  History  Seneca Aqueduct was built from 1829 to 1832 with three red sandstone arches quarried in the nearby Seneca Quarry, just a few hundred feet to the west. The initial stretch of the C&O; Canal opened in 1830 up to Seneca Creek; the next segment opened from Seneca to Harpers Ferry in 1833. This included a sizable turning basin, just west of the aqueduct, where canal boats could anchor or turn around. Next to the aqueduct and lock is the lock keeper's house, also made from Seneca red sandstone. Because of the canal, the nearby quarry operations, and additional mills on Seneca Creek, the town of Seneca was an active working class community. In 1897, the steam packet boat Anna Wilson leaving the aqueduct, collided with a freight boat loaded with watermelons, and sank. There were no injuries to the passengers. Local residents had \\"a ball\\" fishing out the watermelons floating in the basin.Hahn, Thomas Towpath guide to the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal; Georgetown Tidelock to Cumberland American Canal and Transportation Center, 1993. , p. 67 The canal closed in 1924 after ninety-six years in operation. A major flood in September 1971 took out the westernmost of the three arches. The National Park Service has since shored up the aqueduct with steel beams. Seneca Aqueduct is part of the C&O; Canal National Historic Park and is administered by the National Park Service. The aqueduct is included in the Seneca Historic District in Montgomery County, Maryland.

Life Bertha was raised with her brothers and sisters in the royal household of Charlemagne, who had all of his children educated by tutors. An offer by Offa of Mercia to arrange a marriage between Bertha and his son, Ecgfrith, led to Charlemagne breaking off diplomatic relations with Mercia in 790, and banning English ships from his ports. Like her sisters, Bertha never formally married; it has been speculated that Charlemagne did not want his daughters married for strategic reasons, fearing political rivalry from their potential husbands.Becher, Matthias. Charlemagne, Yale University Press, 2005 Bertha was in a long relationship with Angilbert, a court official, which produced three children. During 794-5, Angilbert presented a poem as a court entertainment, praising the beauty and charms of Charlemagne's daughters; Bertha is praised in particular for having critical discernment and appreciation for poetry, which Angilbert points out is a cause for him to be concerned about how she might receive his poem. Bertha's children with Angilbert were sons Hartnid, about whom little is known, the historian Nithard, Abbott of St. Riquier and a daughter, Bertha who went on to marry Helgaud II, Count of Ponthieu. Angilbert ended his affair with Bertha and entered a monastery, becoming Abbott of St. Riquier, according to a biography written by their son, Nithard. Angilbert remained an important advisor to Charlemagne, however. The children of Bertha and Angilbert were likely educated in Charlemagne's court. Nithard was a distinguished soldier and politician, and acted as an advisor to Charles the Bald of France. Following the death of Charlemagne, his successor, Louis the Pious, exiled his sisters to the convents that had been left for their inheritance by their father.

Career In 2000, he took up a position as a lecturer in the Mater Dei Institute of Education, Dublin, Ireland, where he led research on pastoral care in second level schools. While there he authored the book entitled Ethos and Education in Ireland (2003) (New York: Peter Lang)Norman, J. Ethos and Education in Ireland. New York. Peter Lang. , 9780820457284 in which he argued that the Catholic Church had a majority share in the control and management of schools in Ireland and that the church and state would need to reconsider this position in the light of the emerging diversity in Irish society. These views were upheld in 2006 when Archbishop Martin of Dublin called on the state to consider alternative patrons for schools and in 2011 when Ruair√≠ Quinn, Minister for Education and Skills, established a special commission to examine how some schools could be transferred from the patronage of the Catholic Church to other bodies.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Tex Avery and written by Jack Miller. The short was released on January 28, 1939 and features Egghead, an early version of Elmer Fudd. History The premise of the film is rather simple; it features a vaudeville-style amateur talent night (see, for example, the contemporary and still-ongoing \\"Amateur Night\\" competitions at the Apollo Theater and the long-running radio-turned- television show Amateur Hour) with a format that resembles the much later television program The Gong Show in that it features a judge who strikes a gong to stop the performance of any entertainer whom he deems bad. The primary character of this short is Egghead, a prototype of Elmer Fudd who lacks the speech impediment of the character he evolved into. The cartoon entered the public domain in 1967 when its last rightsholder, United Artists Television (successor-in-interest to Associated Artists Productions), failed to renew the original copyright within the required 28-year period. \\"Looney Tunes in the Public Domain\\" Plot During an amateur talent night at the \\"Warmer Bros. Theatre,\\" (pun on Warner Bros.) performers put on a series of strange acts, hosted by a disinterested dogface. These include: * A pianist who purports to play hands-free (he puts a coin in a player piano) * An opera tenor who rises off the stage as he sings higher notes * A swami who attempts to perform the Indian basket trick with help from Egghead, only to have it go wrong when Egghead fails to emerge from the basket after it has been pierced with a sword; the Swami offers Egghead a refund * A flea who recites \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\" (and lands with an implausibly loud thud after being rejected) * A trained dog that performs tricks and gives a speech at its owner's command * An actor who keeps getting pelted with tomatoes as he tries to deliver the \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy from Hamlet * A mangled, but earnest, rendition of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, during which the actor playing Romeo stops to shoot a boisterously laughing hippopotamus in the audience, then finds that the actress playing Juliet laughs in the same way and shoots her offstage as well With the exception of the swami and the balcony scene, every act is rejected by a backstage judge, who rings a bell and pulls a lever to open a trapdoor under the performers and drop them out of sight. The acts are broken up by assorted comical interludes, which include: * The theater orchestra's lead-in, which consists of the conductor playing all the instruments himself as the musicians conduct him * Egghead repeatedly barging onto the stage and singing \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain,\\" only to be yanked away by a shepherd's crook * The aforementioned hippopotamus driving most of the other patrons out of the theater by various means, including sitting on the feet of the person behind him (bending the feet into a 90-degree angle), smacking a spectator hard enough to squash his entire upper body into his hat, and elbowing an entire row hard enough to push them out through the theater wall * The stage curtains behaving in unexpected ways, such as falling down (rod and all) or being opened like a door by the MC At the end of the night, as a voice vote is taken for the winner, Egghead wins.

It is known only from a partial right humerus, estimated at 106 million years old, and contains one species, K. cadburyi. The holotype, NMV P20894, was described in 2005 and is currently housed in the Museums Victoria Palaeontological Collection. Etymology The genus name derives from Greek \\"kryo\\", meaning low temperature, in reference to the seasonal coldness common to the paleo-environment of Dinosaur Cove, and from the Greek \\"oryktes\\", meaning one who digs, referring to the robust humerus from which a fossorial lifestyle has been inferred. The species is named in honour of Cadbury chocolates, referring to the dark colour of the holotype, as well as for the \\"recognition and support provided\\" by Cadbury chocolates during the field work that resulted in discovery of the specimen. Morphology K. cadburyi is distinguished by the authors from all extant monotremes, as well as from fossil tachyglossids, by the presence of a broad, marginated, shallow bicipital sulcus on the proximal humerus, which extends distally onto the waist of the bone. It is also distinguished by the presence of a trochlear-form ulnar articulation and a distal olecranon fossa. Pridmore et al find these features sufficient to distinguish it from Steropodon as well as other non-tachyglossid but similar monotremes such as Obdurodon, Kollikodon, Teinolophos and Monotrematum. The bone itself measures a total length of 46 mm, though the authors point out that it is likely missing around an eighth of its true length and suffers from some amount of abrasion, and estimate the original length at around 50 mm in life. Pridmore et al determined on the basis of the expanded distal and proximal ends of its humerus that the animal was likely adapted for a burrowing lifestyle. In an analysis of the burrows made by prehistoric animals in 2009, Martin concluded that Kryoryctes, though the largest mammal known from the Lower Cretaceous of Victoria, was probably too small for most of the burrows in this area. They do point out that on the basis of its assignment by the authors as a burrowing animal, K. cadburyi may be postulated as a tracemaker for other fossilised burrow-like structures. Evolution The authors note that the humerus appears to be similar in morphology to extant tachyglossids, but have not explicitly allied it with echidnas based on a number of important elements which differ between it and all known members of the family. They conclude that if K. cadburyi is in fact a monotreme, it is likely a stem-monotreme. This affinity was disputed in 2009 by Canens et al, which allied K. cadburyi more closely with echidnas. This analysis was rejected in turn by a further analysis by Phillips, Bennett and Lee in 2010, which found it again to be distinct from tachyglossids, though they do reiterate that there is some possibility that the humerus attributed to K. cadburyi could belong to the contemporaneous stem-monotreme Steropodon, which is similarly-sized.

Nonetheless, the two built a successful department store and clothing manufactury. He travelled to England to marry Lucy Ground on the 20 September 1866, and returned to Brisbane early the next year. In 1869 he built Eldernell House (named for a settlement in Cambridgeshire, near his wife's birthplace) which is now the home of the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane. thumbleft Eldernell in the suburb of Hamilton, photographed circa 1919 Hemmant was a director of the Australian Bank of Commerce and an alderman on the Brisbane City Council.

He became famous for producing animated cartoons during the Golden age of American animation and produced his most significant work while employed by the Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. He created the characters of Daffy Duck in Porky's Duck Hunt (1937), Elmer Fudd in Egghead Rides Again (1937), Bugs Bunny in A Wild Hare (1940), Cecil Turtle in Tortoise Beats Hare (1941), Droopy in Dumb-Hounded (1943), Screwy Squirrel in Screwball Squirrel (1944), George and Junior in Henpecked Hoboes (1946), Spike/Butch the bulldog (Tex Avery's version) in Bad Luck Blackie (1949), and Smedley Dog in I'm Cold (1954). He developed the characters of Porky Pig from the Warner Bros. studio and Chilly Willy from the Walter Lantz Studio into the personas for which they are best remembered. Avery first began his animation career at the Walter Lantz studio in the early 1930s, working on the majority of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons from 1931-35. He is listed as \\"animator\\" on the original title card credits on the Oswald cartoons. He later claimed to have directed two cartoons during this time. By 1942, Avery was in the employ of Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, working in their cartoon division under the supervision of Fred Quimby. At MGM, Avery's creativity reached its peak. A burnt-out Avery left MGM in 1953 to return to the Walter Lantz studio. Avery's return to the Lantz studio did not last long. He directed four cartoons in 1954-1955: the one- shots Crazy Mixed-Up Pup and Shh-h-h-h-h, and I'm Cold and The Legend of Rockabye Point, in which he defined the character of Chilly Willy the penguin.

Woolf - 2002 In 1685 he was deprived of the living of ministry for refusing to take the test and moved to England to become rector of Astwick, Bedfordshire, but following the Act of Settlement 1701 was ejected for not abjuring under the Act of Security, which required the taker of the oath to renounce their allegiance to the Stuarts and the Church. Life He was born at Dunbar, about 1650. He graduated M.A. from Edinburgh University in 1670, and after passing his trials before the presbytery of Haddington became domestic chaplain to John Campbell, Earl of Caithness, by whom, on 12 May 1679, he was presented to the living of Minto. Deprived of this benefice after 1 November 1681 for refusing to take the test, Kirkwood, as one of the \\"outed ministers\\", migrated to England, where, on 1 March 1685, through the friendship of Gilbert Burnet, he was instituted to the rectory of Astwick, Bedfordshire.' In 1690 Kingwood began a correspondence with Robert Boyle on the subject of the Gaelic scriptures for the Highlanders. Boyle presented him with two hundred copies of his Bible in Irish for immediate circulation, and subscribed towards the printing of three thousand more copies, which Kirkwood succeeded in distributing over the north of Scotland, in spite of opposition to his scheme in England, on the ground that it would help preserve Gaelic. Kirkwood on 7 January 1702 was ejected from the living of Astwick for not abjuring \\"according to the statute 13 and 14 William III.\\" He bequeathed his books and papers to the presbytery of Dunbar. Works In 1699 there appeared anonymously a tract, An Overture for Founding and Maintaining Bibliothecks in every Paroch throughout the Kingdom. This was printed at Edinburgh, the word \\"overture\\" being the technical term for a proposal to the old Scottish parliament. Under the scheme the parish minister's private books were to form the nucleus of each library, the parish schoolmaster was to act as librarian, and a uniform system of cataloguing was to be adopted throughout the country. The tract was reprinted by William Blades in 1889. The Overture is traced to Kirkwood by means of a second tract, A Copy of a Letter anent a Project for Erecting a Library in every Presbytery, or at least every County in the Highlands. From a Reverend Minister of the Scots Nation now in England (no place nor date), to which is appended the statement: > The author of this Letter is a person who has a great zeal for propagating > the knowledge of God in the Highlands of Scotland, and is the same who did > promote contributions for the printing of Bibles in the Irish language, and > sent so many of them down to Scotland. The general assembly approved the project, but without further action. Laurence Charters, however, states that a library was established for the clergy in the Highlands by Kirkwood in 1699. In recognition of his projects Kirkwood was, on 4 March 1703, elected a corresponding member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; and on 11 November 1703 there were read at one of the society's meetings Letters and Papers from Mr. Kirkwood relating to the Erection of Lending Libraries in the Highlands. The tract contained elaborate suggestions and rules for the conduct of a lending library. A dry place was to be chosen; the books to be kept under lock and key. Some may be lent out, but no one to have more than two at a time, and the borrowers must be approved preachers, schoolmasters, and students. Each book to have its price against it in the catalogue, and every borrower to deposit a quarter more than the value, as a security for its safe return. Kirkwood also wrote A New Family Book, or the True Interest of Families.‚Ä¶ Together with several Prayers for Families and Children and Graces before and after Meat. The second edition of this work had a preface by Anthony Horneck and a frontispiece engraved by M. Vandergucht, dated 1693, is preserved in the British Museum Library. Charters assigned the date 1692 to this work, but in a letter to Kirkwood, dated 18 October 1690, Boyle acknowledges the receipt of a copy. * \\"A Collection of Highland Rites and Customes\\" Copied by Edward Lhuyd from the Manuscript of the Rev James Kirkwood (1650-1709) and Annotated by him with the Aid of the Rev John Beaton. - republished and edited John Lorne Campbell (Cambridge, 1975), References ;Attribution Category:1650s births Category:1700s deaths Category:Ministers of the Church of Scotland ","title":"James Kirkwood (Church of Scotland)"},{"id":"35377350","title":"Phantom (TV series)"},{"id":"35377365","title":"Paresh Mokashi"},{"id":"35377399","text":"James Stuart or James Stewart (1701‚Äì1789) was minister of Killin and worked with poet Dugald Buchanan on the Scottish Gaelic New Testament published in 1767.

Also starring Park Min-young, Lee Beom-soo, Kim Jaejoong of JYJ and Lee So-yeon, it aired on MBC from May 26 to August 12, 2012 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:50 for 22 episodes. Based on the Japanese manga series Jin written by Motoka Murakami, the series is the third television adaptation of the manga following the Japanese television drama JIN, starring Takao Osawa which aired on TBS in 2009 and its sequel in 2011. \\"Revamped with Korean sentiment,\\" the setting was changed from the original's Edo period to the Joseon Dynasty, during the reign of King Cheoljong of Joseon, and real-life Japanese historical figure Sakamoto Ry≈çma was replaced with Joseon political figure Lee Ha-eung. Plot Jin Hyuk (Song Seung-heon) is a gifted neurosurgeon who was born into a family of doctors. His success rate in surgery hovers at 100%, with his ability to quickly analyze any situation and extremely steady hands. Due to his personal pursuit of perfection, he has a cold attitude and lacks compassion. He is planning to give his girlfriend Yoo Mi-na (Park Min-young) a ring as a gift from their mother when after an argument, Mi-na gets into a car accident and goes into a coma. After surgically removing a foetus-shaped tumor from a patient's brain, a mysterious power causes Jin Hyuk to travel 150 years back in time to the year 1860 during the Joseon Dynasty, when medical technology was still in its infant stages. He begins treating people of the era, but the lack of necessary implements and rudimentary medical knowledge of the period forces him to develop medical devices and medicine by himself, and seek new ways to aid the sick. He meets young noblewoman Young-rae (who looks like Mi-na), who is betrothed to her childhood friend Kim Kyung-tak (Kim Jaejoong) but is not in love with him. Through this challenging process and with the help of Young-rae and Lee Ha-eung (Lee Beom-soo), Jin Hyuk becomes a true doctor. But his actions start interfering with history and Jin Hyuk is faced with hard choices. Cast * Song Seung-heon - Jin Hyuk :A 21st century doctor who finds himself trapped in the Joseon era following a tragic accident that puts his girlfriend, Yoo Mi-na, into a coma.

Her existence beyond legend is questionable, and accounts of her life are mainly based on the writings of indigenous historian Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl. Biography Xochitl was a mistress of the Toltec Emperor Tecpancaltzin, bearing him a son. (Tecpancaltzin had only daughters by his first wife, Maxio). After Maxio died, Xochitl became recognized as queen. Her son became heir and was known as Topiltzin-Meconetzin. When she was elderly, civil war erupted in the Toltec Empire. Xochitl called upon other women to join her in battle, and created and led a battalion made entirely of women soldiers. She died on the battlefield. The son of Xochitl and Tecpancaltzin, Topiltzin, was the last of the Toltec kings, before he was overthrown in the civil war. It was during the final stand of the Toltecs at Tultitlan that Tecpancaltzin and Xochitl were slain in battle. Depiction in art A well- known painting of Xochitl and Tecpancaltzin, El descubrimiento del pulque, was completed in 1869 by Mexican artist Jos√© Obreg√≥n. Obreg√≥n was trained, and painted in, a classical style popular in the 19th century. El descubrimiento del pulque is based on historian Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl's description of Xochitl as a beautiful virgin brought to Tecpancaltzin by her father, Papatzin. Papatzin was a Toltec noble, and a cultivator of maguey plants, also called agave plants and related to aloe. Xochitl presented to Tecpancaltzin a drink that she and/or her father invented, pulque, made from the honey of maguey. The painting was part of a cultural rise in Mexican nationalism during the period, yet the influence of classical European art symbolism appears throughout the painting. More recently, Xochitl appears as one of the 999 women included in American artist Judy Chicago's installation work, The Dinner Party. Xochitl is named in the Heritage Floor.

The fruits have been used to produce syrups and soft drinks. The fruits are rich in Vitamin C. The bark contains an alkaloid, Berberine. It stimulates the uterus and the intestine. It may cause liver complaints, rheumatism and sciatica. Some species of the genus Berberis are used as ornamental plants. Barberry is often parasitized by the fungus Puccinia gram inis and becoming part of the life cycle of the fungus. For this reason, barberry was removed from many places.

The building in which the company currently operates was built in 1909 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The company was owned and operated by the Dement family until it was sold in 2016 to Melissa Love and Sara Love, two local sisters. They now operate Generations Fine Paper and Gifts at Dement Printing. Foundation Though the Dement Printing Company wasn't officially founded until 1875, the Dement family was in the business of printing well before then. The first Dement to learn the printing trade was James Prentiss Dement (1815‚Äì1867), who became an apprentice in 1831. James' son, John Joseph Dement (1844‚Äì1926), began the Dement Printing Company in the Lockhard Building at the corner of 25th Avenue and Front Street in 1875. Charles Pinckney Dement (1842‚Äì1913), John's brother, is listed in the 1882 Meridian Business Directory as a \\"book and job printer\\" in the company. Charles, along with his son James Washington Dement (1874‚Äì1964), also founded The Meridian Star, Meridian's only daily newspaper, in 1898. The business was later sold to John Joseph's son, John Vance Dement (1873‚Äì1949), who moved the business to the intersection of 23rd Avenue and 4th Street. John Vance partnered with his brother, Frank Eugene Dement (1878‚Äì1963), and one other helper. John Vance and Frank again moved the business to a building located at 2315 4th Street in 1900. The business continued to grow during the seven years it was located at this site, adding not only more employees but more printing equipment as well. Dement Printing Company building Entrance to Dement Printing Company, showing the company name and year of construction. In 1909 the company had grown enough that the Dements decided to construct their own building at 2002 6th Street. The building, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is notable for its inclusion of classical elements in an industrial structure. The two- story brick building lies on a triangular block, giving it an unusual shape. The main entrance is located at the intersection of 20th Avenue and 6th Street on a cutaway corner. Above the main entrance, the company name and construction date are inscribed into the face of the building. A water table is painted white, and the capitals of the pilasters below each window bay contain a unique \\"running-dog\\" pattern. An old side entrance, later enclosed, was highlighted by a stone cornice with corbels which also featured this running-dog pattern. The building has been altered several times since its construction. New space for offices, a composing room, a press room, an offset printing room, and a bindery room have been added over the 100+ years in which the company has operated. At its peak the company took up nearly the entire block and employed 70 people, making it one of the largest printing companies in the state. Later generations Frank Dement sold his share of the business to his brother, John Vance, and moved to Texas in 1913. After John Vance died in 1949, his children took over the business. All seven of his children worked in the business at some time during their lives. John Ernest Dement (b. April 29, 1944), grandson of John Vance through James H Dement (1915‚Äì1987),The Ancestry.com page for John Vance Dement lists seven children (3 sons and 4 daughters), consistent with the Mississippi Business reference. John H Dement, one of John Vance's sons has birth date February 10, 1915, on Ancestry.com, consistent with this page on Genealogy.com, listing the father of John Ernest Dement as \\"James Dement\\", born on February 10, 1915. From this, it can be inferred that \\"James Dement\\" on Genealogy.com and \\"James H Dement\\" on Ancestry.com are in fact the same person, beyond reasonable doubt. This means that John Ernest Dement is the grandson of John Vance Dement. took over the company in 1974. His wife, Judy, and children, Corey and Scott, also help with the business. Corey and Scott are thus the fifth generation to be involved in the family business, beginning with the founder, John Joseph Dement. In 2016, Dement Printing was sold to two local sisters, Melissa Love and Sara Love. They continue the tradition started by the Dement Family of quality, local printing at an affordable price. In addition, Generations at Dement Printing has expanded to include Bridal Registry, Gifts, and Fine Printing. Products Throughout its lifetime, Dement Printing Company has produced many different products. At the turn of the 20th century when the business was located on 4th Street, popular products included letterheads, envelopes, statements, circulars, and order blanks. During World War II, Dement Printing Company was asked to fill a $26,000 order of carbon paper for Brookley Field in Mobile, Alabama. The company was also asked to print blueprints for the Air Base at Key Field in Meridian. Other products and services that have been offered by the company include book bindings, ruling, lithographing, photostating, and rubber stamps. When desktop publishing and home printing grew in popularity, Dement (and many other printing businesses) saw a great reduction in sales. The company shrank from its peak of 70 employees to 22. To cope with the change, the company created a \\"Generations\\" department, which prints wedding favors (invitations, picture books, etc.) and baby pictures. The company has also profited from selling office supplies and rents out parts of the building to other businesses.

It is published in the UK by Corsair (Constable & Robinson). It won the 2012 Nebula Award for Best Novel, the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the British Fantasy Award, and was a nominee for the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. Background Among Others is the ninth novel published by Welsh-born author Jo Walton. It was written in 36 days in 2008, distributed between 29 February and 29 May. Walton describes the novel as semi-autobiographical, about the \\"coming-of-age experience of having books instead of people for friends and solace\\", which since the publication of the novel she has discovered to be more common among readers than she had expected. The author also shared the experience with her protagonist of being a Welsh student in an English boarding school and walking with a cane. As the main character is 15 in 1979, she would also have been born and grown up in the same area of Wales at roughly the same time. Walton also credits her own experiences growing up with a paranoid schizophrenic mother as giving her a \\"useful knowledge of evil\\" that informed the portrayal of her protagonist's mother in this novel. The author indicates the inspiration was the response she received to an article she posted in her online journal that year about the area of Wales in which she grew up and how she \\"thought [she] was living in a fantasy landscape, when actually [she] was living in a science fictional one\\". However, she notes that it is not actually autobiography, but rather \\"a mythologisation of part of my life. It's a fantasy novel, but it's drawing on autobiographical material.\\" Walton wrote the novel under the working title The Industrial Ruins of Elfland but altered it to the current title after a friend mentioned it to her as a good title for a novel due to its frequent use in biographical bibliographies ‚Äì an author had written specific works \\"among others\\". This struck her as an apt description of the novel she was working on at the time. The novel was released in North America first, under the Tor imprint, in January 2011 before being released in the UK in October 2012 by Corsair. Plot The novel is presented as the diary of Morgana, a 15-year- old Welsh science fiction and fantasy fan, in 1979 and 1980. She and her twin sister Morwenna, both frequently using the nicknames \\"Mor\\" or \\"Mori\\", grew up playing and occasionally working magic with beings they call faeries in the hills of Wales. Several months before the start of the novel, their mother, who is described as both insane and a witch, attempts to gain more power to take over the world. The sisters are able to stop her, but in the process their mother causes them to struck by a car, killing Morwenna and disabling one of Morgana's legs. Morgana begins mostly using Morwenna's name, though still typically going by Mori. As her mother is insane and her grandfather (with whom she previously lived) has a stroke and is in a care facility, she has run away from her home and been sent to western England to live with her father and his three half-sisters, none of whom she has ever seen. Bereft of her sister, her joy in running, and her beloved Welsh countryside, Mori must reconcile to her new life as a disabled, friendless outsider. She feels that she can do this as long as she has books to read, and her one connection to her father is the love of books they share. Her paternal family send her to a nearby girls' boarding school, which she finds unmagical and very uncongenial. She has few friends and considerable free time because she can do her schoolwork quickly and because her injury prevents her from participating in sports. She spends most of her time reading books provided by her father (also an SF fan), the school library, the local public library, and interlibrary loan. Throughout her diary she records her and other characters' reactions to these books with as much interest as any other events of her life. At one point she casts a spell to locate friends who can unite with her on a common purpose and then is invited to join a SF/fantasy readers' club at the library. She makes a few connections there and eventually a boyfriend who not only shares her interested in books but in magic, although he can barely see the fairies and cannot himself work spells. Magic remains a persistent feature in Mori's life. Shortly after her arrival at the school, Mori's mother begins sending her letters and family photographs in which Mori's image is burned out and launching magical attacks to control her daughter. Mori tries to work with the fairies near her school but finds she must return to her home in Wales to truly connect and do her own protective magic. She is offered the opportunity to join her dead sister in becoming a fairy herself, but to do so must also die. She chooses instead to embrace her new life and whatever the future might hold. She confronts her mother in a final magical conflict, and, victorious, returns to her new family and her boyfriend. Genre and themes Among Others combines the features of a fantasy novel and a coming of age story. It is an epistolary novel, presented as a series of diary entries of a teenage girl which detail the concerns of her life in chronological order, ranging from such mundane concerns as her grade in math and the experience of buying a first bra to performing ritual magic to allow the dead to pass into the other life. The book takes a careful balance between confirming and denying that Mori's perceptions of magic and fairies is real, although a slightly stronger confirmation comes when Mori's boyfriend is also able to see the fairies. Walton has affirmed that it was her intention that the magic within the novel be real, and the theme of unreliable narration was not an intentional one although it has been widely picked up by readers. In addition to unintended themes of reliable narration and whether the magic Mori perceives is wish- fulfillment, the novel explicitly explores the question of moral responsibility in doing magic. As the novel progresses, Mori comes to feel that the rippling impact of magic on others and its ability to deprive them of free will is unacceptable, and she pledges to use magic only for protection. The book also explores the ability of books to provide hope in times of grief and darkness. As the title suggests, the novel is also focused on making one's own way in a world in which one feels outside. \\"Otherness\\" is core to the story. In her English boarding school, Mori is differentiated from her peers on a number of axes: she is Welsh, she is disabled, she is the only student in her school depicted as reading for pleasure (often alone with the librarian), and she is aside from her sister and mother the only person depicted as having the ability to see and communicate with fairies, at least until she introduces her boyfriend Wim to the skill. Reception Among Others was critically very well received. The book won the 2012 Nebula Award for Best Novel, the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the British Fantasy Award, and was a nominee for the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. In 2012, The Guardian described the book as \\"one of only a handful of novels ever to get such a grand-slam shortlisting for all the major science fiction literary prizes\\". It also won the Best Adult Books 4 Teens award from the School Library Journal in 2011. Ursula K. Le Guin, in her review for The Guardian, called the book \\"a funny, thoughtful, acute and absorbing story all the way through\\". Similarly, Elizabeth Bear, in her review for tor.com, stated that \\"The voice is sublime; the characters nuanced ... In any case, I think this is Walton's best book to date.\\" Conversely, in her review for The Washington Post, Elizabeth Hand wrote that \\"More than anything else, Among Others is a love letter to the literature of the fantastic and to SF fandom. This is problematic as well as charming, because nothing much happens in the novel.\\" References External links An Evening with Jo Walton, video interview on seattlechannel.org. 23 February 2012. * Tor Books website * Constable & Robinson website Category:2011 Canadian novels Category:2011 fantasy novels Category:Fiction set in 1979 Category:Fictional diaries Category:Novels about novels Category:Novels by Jo Walton Category:Novels set in Wales Category:Novels set in England Category:Tor Books books Category:Hugo Award for Best Novel-winning works Category:Nebula Award for Best Novel-winning works ","title":"Among Others"},{"id":"35379433","text":"Smilin' Guns is a 1929 American silent Western film, directed by Henry MacRae and starring Hoot Gibson.

The area was established by treaties between the West and Japan in the mid-to-late 1850s, and remained an important center of Western life in Japan until the outbreak of World War II. This settlement saw many firsts for Japan, including the first international telegraph and also the first use of a steam locomotive, the \\"Iron Duke,\\" on a short track in the Oura district. Nagasaki holds a festival in mid-September that focuses on the foreign settlement.  Development  A series of encounters between the West and Japan in the 1850s ended Japan's isolationist trade policies. In particular, the treaty with Russia, signed on February 7, 1855 established Nagasaki as an open port and, further, granted extraterritoriality privileges to foreigners living in Japan. These encounters finally culminated in 1859 when the Ansei Treaties, and in particular the Harris Treaty with the United States, took effect. These treaties demanded immediate opening of ports, and also established generally unequal trade relationships between the Western powers and Japan. In 1860 development of the area around Oura Creek began; by August 15, 1862, Japanese officials ordered foreign residents of Nagasaki into this new settlement area.  Decline and dismantling  By 1894, the treaties that led to the formation of the foreign settlement had been abolished, and new ones became effective in 1899. On that date, the foreign settlement returned fully to Japanese control. Tariffs returned to Japanese after the treaty with the United States, signed on February 21, 1911. Despite these political changes, the momentum established in the previous decades continued, and this area of Nagasaki continued to be an important hub of trade and settlement for Westerners. In the run up to World War II, however, the foreign population of the settlement declined, so that few were left as hostilities broke out.

The new facility includes a number of modernizations to improve patient care, including: * 32 more beds (an increase from 156 to 188), * A \\"home-like\\" rather than institutional atmosphere, * Scenic placement on the North Saskatchewan River with maximized views of nature from inside, and * A cogeneration system to reduce its environmental footprint. The project was announced in 2011 and began construction in September 2015. It held its grand opening March 14, 2019. The Government of Saskatchewan committed $407 million to the project, which covers design, construction, and 30 years of maintenance. Of this, approximately $222 million is attributable to construction. The project is proceeding as a public-private partnership (P3). Financial analysis by Ernst & Young indicated a P3 would save $90 million (18%) over the life of the project, versus a typical government-led project. Design, construction, and maintenance are the responsibility of a group named Access Prairies Partnership, led by Graham.Graham The construction effort created more than 1,500 jobs in the province.  Original hospital  New SHNB under construction, July 2016 Built between 1911 and 1913, the facility in North Battleford was the first mental health hospital to be built in Saskatchewan, Canada. It had 156 beds. Prior to its establishment, patients were sent to hospitals in Manitoba. The first superintendent of the hospital was James Walter MacNeill. The number of patients peaked at over 4,000 in 1946; with the advent of community care throughout the province the number of patients in the facility had dropped to under 300 by 1980. The original hospital is located at 1 Jersey Street in the North Battleford Crown Colony, a census subdivision adjacent to the City of North Battleford. The fate of the old facility is, as yet, unknown. The Government of Saskatchewan is accepting proposals for its future over summer 2019 and will make a decision thereafter.

Homma, whose father was a Shinto priest and an officer in the Japanese Imperial Army during the war, was born in Akita Prefecture. According to Homma, at the age of 14, he was sent by his father to train in Iwama under aikido founder Ueshiba Morihei. Homma also says that he trained as an uchi deshi in Iwama and at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo in Tokyo, under the founder and under Saito Morihiro in the late 1960s. Along with Hideo Hirasawa, Homma is one of a number of aikidoka who claim to be the last uchi deshi to have been trained directly by Ueshiba Morihei.http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_15090772 - accessed June03/2010 His early career as a teacher was on a US air force base. In 1976 Homma moved to Denver, Colorado, and founded the Nippon Kan as an independent dojo in 1978. This dojo has grown into the largest aikido dojo in the Rocky Mountain region and is well known for its international uchi- deshi program. He has organized several large aikido seminars in Denver, many of them taught by Saito Morihiro.  Humanitarian work  In addition to the aikido dojo, which is a non-profit institution, Homma has founded the Aikido Humanitarian Active Network (AHAN), whose mission is \\"to extend the philosophy of Aikido into the world beyond the dojo\\". AHAN activities have included sending computers and aid to an orphanage in Mongolia, supporting a sick aikido student in Nicaragua, and assisting dojo in Turkey and Brazil with charitable fundraising efforts. Homma is also known for his work in his community, including serving meals to the homeless.

It is the parent member of the phosphorus ylides, popularly known as Wittig reagents. It is a highly polar, highly basic species. Preparation and use Methylenetriphenylphosphorane is prepared from methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide by its deprotonation using a strong base like butyllithium: :Ph3PCH3Br + BuLi ‚Üí Ph3PCH2 \\\\+ LiBr + BuH The compound is generally not isolated, instead it is used in situ. Methylenetriphenylphosphorane is used to replace oxygen centres in aldehydes and ketones with a methylene group: :R2CO + Ph3PCH2 ‚Üí R2C=CH2 \\\\+ Ph3PO The phosphorus-containing product is triphenylphosphine oxide. Structure Crystallographic characterization of the colourless ylide reveals that the phosphorus atom is approximately tetrahedral. The PCH2 centre is planar and the P=CH2 distance is 1.661 √Ö, which is much shorter than the P-Ph distances (1.823 √Ö). The compound is usually described as a combination of two resonance structures: :Ph3P+CH2‚àí ‚Üî Ph3P=CH2 Hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane is one of several unusual phosphorus ylides inspired by Wittig reagents. Related compounds Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) enhance the ease of deprotonation of phosphonium salts. This behavior is illustrated by triphenylcarbethoxymethylphosphonium derived from chloroacetic acid esters and triphenylphosphine. It deprotonation requires only sodium hydroxide. The resulting triphenylcarbethoxymethylenephosphorane is somewhat air-stable. It is however less reactive than ylides lacking EWGs. For example they usually fail to react with ketones, necessitating the use of the Horner‚ÄìWadsworth‚ÄìEmmons reaction as an alternative. Such stabilized ylides usually give rise to an E-alkene product when they react, rather than the more usual Z-alkene. left Although these ylides are \\"electron-rich\\", they are susceptible to deprotonation. Treatment of Me3PCH2 with butyl lithium affords Me2P(CH2)2Li. Having carbanion-like properties, lithiated ylides function as ligands. Thus Me2P(CH2)2Li is a bidentate ligand.

Retrieved April 7, 2012. General history =1850s to the 1900s= Archaeology in Saskatchewan originated in the 1850s as a scientific initiative to explore the past relationships among fur traders, explorers and aboriginal cultures. What was originally explored in the Qu'Appelle River region were phenomenon later understood to be manufactured by the Cree, including earthen mounds and stone rings that were correctly interpreted to be previous tipi sites. In 1896, Reverend John Maclean recorded a monumental site near Moose Mountain, although at the time of discovery he could not determine the purpose of the site. =1900s to the 1920s= There was a motivational shift from scientific knowledge to personal curiosity by the early 1900s.'Archaeology, The History of.' from The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan. 2012. Retrieved April 7, 2012 In 1905, Charles Noddings made a notable find near Beaver Hills involving a similar set up to Maclean's stone monument find at Moose Mountain along with a number of stone carvings. Noddings was one of the first residents in Saskatchewan to advocate for the protection of an archaeological site by pressuring the provincial government at the time. This \\"sustain[ed] public interest in Saskatchewan archaeology until the development of an archaeological program in the 1950s.\\" Within that same time frame, burial mounds were also being discovered in Saskatchewan. Field work and research conducted by Dr. Henry Montgomery from the University of Toronto concluded with the first scholarly publication of archaeological literature for Saskatchewan. Other than the cases of Noddings and Montgomery, curiosity, and little scientific backing, fueled archaeological interest until the end of the 1920s. =1930s to the 1950s= The drought experienced across the plains in 1930s exposed various remnants of human occupation including but not excluded to pottery and tools of people who have inhabited the Great Plains. Developments with artifacts of the same nature in New Mexico traced human occupation back 10,000 years, resulting in the simultaneous extension of Saskatchewan archaeological finds back to 10,000 years at minimum. Artifact recovery became a popular extracurricular activity as it was not limited by the economy. A renewed public interest in archaeology prompted the founding of the Saskatchewan Archaeological Society (SAS) in 1933. By 1935, the society was based out of Regina and Saskatoon. To the best of their ability, the SAS established a newsletter to be distributed to the public and identified artifacts on minimal professional expertise and funding since the conditions of World War II hindered any institutional support for years. Spanning from the 1920s to the 1940s, Arthur Morton merged history and archaeology in his studies of the fur trade, followed by John Archer in 1949 and Jack Herbert in 1951. Morton's actions arranged protection for the remainder of fur trade posts near Nipawin, whereas Archer and Herbert both explored historic sites and together launched a provincial historic sites service. Archaeology in Saskatchewan from the 1950s onward was defined by the endeavors of Boyd Wettlaufer, the proclaimed \\"Father of Saskatchewan Archaeology.\\" He was an influential voice in acquiring knowledge of the North Plains First Nations. Wettlaufer's key role in Saskatchewan archaeology was centered on the Long Creek sites located south of Regina near Estevan. He illustrated differences \\"between various hunting and gathering cultures [from] several thousand years ago.\\"Boyd Wettlaufer Wettlaufer was one of the first archaeologists in Canada to use radiocarbon dating, successfully fought for a lab to be established in Western Canada at the University of Saskatchewan, and the first archaeologist in Saskatchewan to conduct an archaeological survey. =1960s to the present= Alice Beck Kehoe orchestrated the first major historic site excavation in Saskatchewan at the Fran√ßois-Finlay posts discovered by Morton earlier on. Interactions from institutions such as the Royal Saskatchewan Museum (previously known as the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History) and the University of Saskatchewan impacted the archaeological scene in Saskatchewan. The Royal Saskatchewan Museum took on mass excavation initiatives that had relations to aboriginal sites in areas such as Swift Current and the South Saskatchewan River. After the establishment of their Anthropology and Archaeology department, the University of Saskatchewan began organizing larger-scale archaeological initiatives by 1967. In the 1970s, the Government of Saskatchewan introduced the Archaeological Resource Management (RAM) as a part of environmental impact assessment. The RAM was created to provide scientifically accurate information that has added substantial data to the overall information base, contributing to the verification of hypotheses and strengthening of theories focused on cultural movements and habitation choices.

He was best known as an eminent Russian researcher of ancient Chinese religion and philosophy, author of many books and translations of classical Chinese texts (especially Buddhist and Taoist) into Russian. He founded the chair of Eastern philosophy and cultures at St. Petersburg State University. Life and career Evgeny Torchinov was born on August 22, 1956, in the city of Ordzhonikidze (then USSR), and soon his family moved to Saratov. After graduation from high-school in 1973, Torchinov was admitted to the Faculty of Oriental Studies of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) State University, where he majored in Chinese philology. After graduation in 1978, he became a Ph.D. candidate at the State Museum of History of Religion and Atheism, where he worked as a research fellow from 1981 to 1984. From 1984 and until 1994, he worked as researcher at the St.Petersburg branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences. In 1994, he defended his second doctoral dissertation entitled \\"Taoism: An attempt of historical- religious description\\". In 1998, he became the Chair of Philosophy of Religion and Religious Studies at St. Petersburg State University, and in 1999 created and led as the chair of Oriental Philosophy and Cultures.

Torchinov and V. Vorobyov He also worked as a visiting professor at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Torchinov died on July 12, 2003, in Saint Petersburg. Academic activity Torchinov made contributions to Taoism studies and translation of classical Taoist treatises. In his doctoral thesis he provided a detailed review of Taoism, its history, schools and concepts, relying on Chinese sources and global sinology. Later, he had the Taoist review published as a monograph aimed for non-specialist audience. Many of Torchinov's publications give an insight into the practical aspects of Taoism such as Outer Alchemy, Inner Alchemy, meditation techniques, afterlife techniques, and esoteric sex practices. Torchinov's long studies of Buddhism resulted in publication of an academic manual, Introduction to Buddhology. His academic interest in this field was focused on Mahajana and Far East Buddhism. He translated several authoritative Buddhist works from Chinese and Old Chinese into Russian, including The Treatise on evocation of trust in Mahajana. Torchinov translated a number of Ch'an Buddhism treatises, classical and modern. Generalizing his religious studies, Torchinov released a book entitled Religions of the world: Experience of the Transcendence dealing with transcendental states of consciousness and psychic techniques. The book provides in-depth analyses of Shamanism, ancient religions, sects, and modern world religions. Torchinov wrote several works in comparative religious studies. Some of his works are also dedicated to Kabbalah.

His regular playing position is lock. Although he was born in South Africa, and was part of the Springbok U20 side that won the 2012 IRB Junior World Championship, he has qualified to play senior international rugby for France on residency grounds, and made his debut against Wales in the Six Nations on 1 February 2019. Club career =Youth= Despite being born in Pretoria, Willemse moved to Tsumeb in Namibia, where he played rugby for Tsumeb Gymnasium and earned a call-up to the Namibian Under-18 Craven Week squad in 2009. He was then offered a junior contract by the Golden Lions and moved to Krugersdorp in 2010 to complete this schooling at Monument High School. He once again played at the Craven Week tournament, this time in the colours of the Golden Lions. In 2011, Willemse represented the Golden Lions U19 side in the 2011 Under-19 Provincial Championship. He scored eight tries to finish joint-third on the try-scoring charts and the leading forward try- scorer. =Golden Lions / Lions= In 2012, Willemse made his first class debut, starting the Golden Lions' 23‚Äì16 loss to the Leopards in Potchefstroom in the 2012 Vodacom Cup competition. Willemse scored his first try the following week, scoring the Lions' second try in a comfortable 59‚Äì29 over near-neighbours Falcons in Johannesburg. He made two more starts for the Golden Lions in the Vodacom Cup ‚Äì scoring another try in their match against the Griffons ‚Äì before being included in the Lions' starting line-up for their 2012 Super Rugby match against the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein, which ended in a 5‚Äì26 loss to the Lions. He made one more appearance in the Vodacom Cup before earning a call-up to the South Africa U20 side. During the latter half of 2012, he was mainly used in the Golden Lions U21 side that played in the 2012 Under-21 Provincial Championship, scoring three tries in 11 appearances. However, he also made his Currie Cup debut, starting their 2012 Currie Cup Premier Division match against the Blue Bulls in Johannesburg. =Blue Bulls / Bulls / UP Tuks= For the start of the 2013 season, Willemse made the short move across the Jukskei River to join Pretoria-based side Blue Bulls. He made two appearances for university side UP Tuks in the 2013 Varsity Cup competition before the Blue Bulls' 2013 Vodacom Cup matches against Griquas and the Pumas. He got another taste of Super Rugby action, starting in the Bulls' Australian tour matches against the Reds in Brisbane and the Brumbies in Canberra, before making three appearances off the bench upon their return to South African soil. In July 2013, the Blue Bulls announced that he signed a contract extension until 31 October 2014. Still eligible to play at Under-21 level, he made four appearances for the Blue Bulls U21 side during the 2013 Under-21 Provincial Championship, but he firmly established himself in the first team, starting ten matches during the 2013 Currie Cup Premier Division. He scored three tries during the competition, two of those coming in their match against Griquas in Kimberley. He featured prominently for the Bulls during the 2014 Super Rugby season, playing in 15 matches during the season. This season saw him score his first try in Super Rugby, in a 26‚Äì21 win against the Cheetahs in Pretoria. He ended the 2014 Super Rugby season on a high note, scoring two tries in a 40‚Äì7 victory over the Melbourne Rebels in their final pool match of the season. Willemse started all 11 of the Blue Bulls' matches in the 2014 Currie Cup Premier Division as they reached the semi-final of the competition before being eliminated by Western Province in Cape Town. =Grenoble= In June 2014, it was announced that Willemse would join French Top 14 side Grenoble after the 2014 Currie Cup Premier Division competition. =Montpellier= Willemse in action in August 2015 Willemse joined French Top 14 side Montpellier in June 2015. International career =South Africa U20= Willemse was named in the South Africa Under-20 team that won the 2012 IRB Junior World Championship held in South Africa. Despite Willemse scoring a try for South Africa in their first match of the tournament, he could not prevent his side losing 23‚Äì19 to Ireland. He repeated his try-scoring feat in their next match against Italy in a 52‚Äì3 victory and he played the entire match as South Africa beat England 28‚Äì15 in their final pool match to ensure qualification to the semi-finals. He started in both the semi-final against Argentina, a comprehensive 35‚Äì3 victory, and the final against New Zealand, where he helped South Africa to a 22‚Äì16 victory to ensure they lifted the trophy for the first time. =France= In May 2018, Bernard Laporte declared that Willemse could be selected for the French national team due to his three years of residence on French territory as well as his request for a French passport. However, he returned on his position in October 2018 saying that he could not be called until he obtained his passport. On 30 November 2018, he announced that he had obtained French nationality.

It has been a known pest since at least the time of Johan Christian Fabricius, who described the species in 1775. Description The adult Oebalus pugnax measures to long. It has a narrow profile that forms the shield shape characteristic of other stink bugs. These true bugs are typically straw-colored with sharp points on the apex of the shield and a yellow triangle exhibited on center of the shield. Some adults have gray coloring near the yellow triangle, while others may be a darker brown rather than straw-colored. However, the rice stink bug is easily distinguished from other stink bugs because of its narrower profile and lighter color than, for example, the brown marmorated stink bug. Behavior and crop damage The rice stink bug is a significant pest of rice crops in the southern U.S., including Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas (the Rice Belt). This agricultural pest is known to attack cereal crops with small seeds, particularly wheat, sorghum, and rice. The insect also lives in wild grasses such as Johnson grass, barnyard grass, and sedge, making control of cash crops difficult. They are occasionally found on other crops in which grasses are prevalent between the rows, even though the insect may ignore the field crop. The insect is extremely mobile and is known to travel en masse in and out of fields quickly in search of more favorable foods. Non-food crop hosts of the rice stink bug include: Echinochloa crusgalli, Echinochloa colona, Digitaria sanguinalis, Panicum dicotomiflorum, Phalaris minor, Paspalum urvillei, and Sporobolus poiretti; the last two are the most common species that the bug prefers. The rice stink bug will damage a developing seed head by feeding on the seed's endosperm, leaving an empty shell or shriveled kernels. This type of damage can precipitate microorganism diseases and other crop losses, most notably discoloration, \\"pecky rice,\\" and lower quality produce. When Oebalus pugnax are found in non-target crops such as standing corn, they can be ignored since they \\"generally do not feed in corn.\\" However, seedling corn is susceptible to the rice stink bug. Although the rice stink bug is the source cause of \\"pecky rice\\" damage in rice crops, the kernel spotting and discoloration is the result of a fungal infection of the rice kernels by fungi such as species of the ubiquitous genus Fusarium. Related species In South America, the small rice stink bug, Oebalus poecilus (also Solubea poecila), is the most destructive pest of rice crops. It attacks rice, barley, oats, corn, and wheat, while it occasionally attacks soybean, cotton, and guava. The small rice stink bug looks similar to the rice stink bug.

He says while shooting a scene in a linen closet with a topless Candice Rialson, someone from the linen service came in and saw her. Then an un-expurgated copy of the script was found and the unit was kicked out of the hospital. They had to move to another location, a former clinic, which did not match the original hospital.

Brown's description was published in Supplementum primum prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. The specific epithet is said to be derived from the genus Pandanus - screw pine and the Greek carpa - fruit. The proper word for fruit in ancient Greek is however karpos (Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄœåœÇ).Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek- English Lexicon revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Two subspecies are currently recognised: *H. pandanicarpa subsp. crassifolia (Meisn.) R.M.Barker. Subspecies crassifolia can be identified by the fruit mainly having a smooth surface at a young age, becoming rougher as it ages but still comparatively smooth. The external pattern on the fruit of subsp. crassifolia resembles that of \\"drying mud in a clay pan\\". This subspecies grows from Corrigin to Albany and east to Ravensthorpe. *H. pandanicarpa R.Br. subsp. pandanicarpa Subspecies pandanicarpa has prominent raised corky pyramid-shaped projections on the fruit from a young age. Subspecies pandanicarpa has a more easterly distribution than subsp. crassifolia. It grows from the Fitzgerald River National Park east to Israelite Bay. Distribution and habitat Hakea pandanicarpa grows from the Stirling Ranges to Israelite Bay on sand plain with low shrubland, heath and occasionally mallee.
