Location  Located in the market town of Wellington, Shropshire, England, and owned by the National Trust as one of their more unusual properties. Suburban villas were almost 'country estates in miniature' that attempted to emulate upper class mansions on a middle class budget. Many have either been modernised, renovated or refurbished out of recognition over the last 60 years or so or have been demolished and replaced with later housing, converted into offices or residential care homes, or have been broken up into flats and smaller residences.  Rare Survivor  Sunnycroft remains intact, complete with the original interior fixtures and fittings, many of which are still in place and therefore has a unique character and intimacy that is often lacking from larger properties but very evocative of its time and place. It is located close to the town centre in Wellington, on the B5061 Holyhead Road, originally the Shrewsbury to London road, and formerly part of Watling Street the Roman road from London to Wroxeter. Sunnycroft was built in 1880, and extended in 1899. Uniquely the house remained in the same family from its completion in 1899, until it was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1997. The National Trust summarises Sunnycroft as: * A late 19th-century gentleman's villa – typical creation of Victorian era suburbia * Rare unaltered interior, with an elaborate conservatory * A mini country-estate, with pigsties, stables, kitchen garden and orchards * Colourful borders and summertime flower displays * Superb long avenue of Redwood trees and lime trees  Gallery  File:Sunnycroft Verandah.JPGVeranda at the front of Sunnycroft File:Conservatory.JPGThe Grade II listed conservatory at Sunnycroft File:Conservatory Interior.JPGConservatory Interior File:Main Entraqnce.JPGThe visitor entrance to Sunnycroft File:Main staircase.JPGMain staircase File:Room.JPGDrawing Room File:Hallway Floor.JPGMosaic tiled floor to entrance hallway File:Stairs Ceiling.JPGStained glass ceiling light over main staircase File:Master Bedroom.JPGMaster bedroom File:Kitchen Range.JPGCooking range in the kitchen File:Aga.JPGThe Aga was manufactured by a company owned by a previous owner of the villa, Offley Lander See also *Listed buildings in Wellington, Shropshire External links *Sunnycroft - National Trust Country houses in Shropshire Gardens in Shropshire National Trust properties in Shropshire Buildings and structures in Telford Country parks in Shropshire Historic house museums in Shropshire Wellington, Shropshire ","title":"Sunnycroft"},{"id":"13162591","text":"Villanueva de Gómez is a municipality located in the province of Ávila, Castile and León, Spain.

It is one of 18 high schools in Jefferson County. The school colors are forest green, gold, and white. The mascot is a bear. The principal is Lynn Torr. There are 1,634 students as of October 2018, along with 87 full-time teachers. It is a Class 5A Athletic Program and has over 34 clubs and activities. History Bear Creek Consolidation SchoolBear Creek High School was established in 1894 as the Montana School. The school was a single room that served elementary grades one through eight. It was not until 1920 that the neighboring community decided to consolidate, thus giving the region its first high school. Before the school was built, all students planning to continue their education either had to live in or commute to schools in Denver. The Bear Creek Consolidated school combined five elementary school school districts. The four other schools were Montana School, Lakeview, Midway and Mount Carbon. The first class in 1923 consisted of five graduates. From this point on, the school was known as the Bear Creek Consolidated School. By 1950, all of the schools in Jefferson County had been consolidated and became the Jefferson County School District R-1. The class of 1952 became the first to graduate in the newly named Bear Creek High School. Although a fire in 1959 destroyed the original structure, classes were still held in the gymnasium. The new building was built just east of where the current school stands. This building stood for nearly 57 years until a new building, completed in 2009, was built where the original Consolidated School once stood. Bear Creek 1962–2009 On April 22, 2008, during the construction of the new building, Bear Creek High School students experienced another major fire that damaged a gymnasium and several classrooms. After further investigation, it was determined that the fire was an act of arson by two unnamed Bear Creek students. The cause of the fire was an discarded cigarette which caught an exercise mat on fire. This was the second fire within a year at a Jefferson County school. On June 1 at Weber Elementary School a fire that was determined to also be arson, caused nearly $65 million in total damages.

The municipality has a seat in the office of Ludwigslust from where it is administered. Wöbbelin consists of three areas: Dreenkrögen, the \\"Funkamtsiedlung\\", a housing development and buildings supporting a former radio broadcasting station, and the main town, Wöbbelin. History Wöbbelin was first mentioned in 1333 as \\"Wopelyn\\". In 1813, Theodor Körner, \\"Dichter der Freiheitskriege\\", the \\"poet of the wars of liberation\\", who died in Gadebusch on 1813-08-26, was buried in Wöbbelin. The monument to Theodor Körner on his grave was designed by the architect, Gottlob Friedrich Thormeyer, and solemnly opened on 1814-09-23. The grove with the graves of Körner and some family relatives (his sister, Emma) became a patriotic memorial place shortly after Körner's death. In 1938, a year before the beginning of World War II, the \\"Theodor-Körner-Gedenkstätte\\", the Theodor Körner memorial place, became a \\"nationalsozialistischen Weihestätte\\", a Nazi 'holy' place. On 1945-02-12, a concentration camp, which was a sub-camp of the Neuengamme concentration camp, Hamburg, was set up in the proximity of the district town of Ludwigslust. As it was located on the road to Wöbbelin, it was named the Wöbbelin concentration camp. The camp was taken by American troops on 1945-05-02 and many victims were buried in the cemetery where the Theodor Körner memorial place is located. In the middle of the cemetery, the former \\"nationalsozialistischen Weihestätte\\" serves today as a remembrance and memorial place for Wöbbelin and as the headquarters of a museum. The remembrance and memorial place remembers both the \\"Dichter der Freiheitskriege\\", Theodor Körner, and the Wöbbelin concentration camp. In 1952, Wöbbelin became the location for a broadcasting installation used for transmitting medium wave band broadcasts. Two steel, half-timbered masts, 120 metres high, were used in the antenna system. These were developed from a transmitting mast, which had been located at Königs Wusterhausen and dismantled. During the 1950s, the \\"Funkamtsiedlung\\" grew around the broadcasting station. The two transmitting masts were replaced in 1990 by two masts of the same height. The Geneva wave plan of 1975, assigned the frequencies 576 kHz and 999 kHz to Wöbbelin. The latter was emitted over a three corner body antenna and last used by talk radio before being dismantled. The former frequency was used by Megaradio, a privately operated pop music broadcasting station until 2003-04-04. The use of this frequency caused strong disturbances to the reception of SWR, \\"South West Broadcasting\\", in Wöbbelin, as SWR operated on the same frequency from Mühlacker. The remaining transmitting masts were demolished November 2005. Geography and transport The municipality lies on the federal highway 106 between the cities of Ludwigslust (7 km) and Schwerin (23 km). To the north, Dreenkrögen lies near the junction of the federal motorway 24 for Ludwigslust and a lorry and truck terminal. In Dreenkroegen is a large, 5.95 hectare bathing lake, which resulted from gravel quarrying.

The word is a portmanteau of \\"baby\\" and \\"Aeroflot\\", compare Baby Bells. In 1992 Aeroflot was divided into more than 300 regional and other smaller airlines, with many being single-plane operations. International routes were operated separately as Aeroflot—Russian International Airlines (ARIA).\\"Directory: World Airlines\\", Flight International (2007-04-03), p. 47. Retrieved on 2007-05-27. Some airline companies created from the old Aeroflot are now flag carriers of independent post-Soviet countries, such as Uzbekistan Airlines. Fall of the Babyflots There were over 800 such airlines at one time with many of them subsequently closing down due to abysmal safety records in 1994. 118 carriers went out of business because fewer passengers could afford to fly than in 1995. By 2000, Russia had only about eight federal air carriers and 40 to 45 regional airlines – down sharply from the current 315 carriers, said Ivan Valov, first deputy chief of the Russian Federal Aviation Service. The government began to restrict licensing and certification and bring air-safety standards into compliance with international standards. The \\"Babyflot\\" airlines have been blamed for a sharp decline in Russia's air safety. Many of the crashes that occurred have been blamed on poor maintenance and lax controls at many small carriers, which have neglected flight safety in their run for profit.Ivan Valov, first deputy chief of the Russian Federal Aviation Service.1/15/1998 The eight hundred-odd \\"Babyflot\\" airlines had such poor safety records that in 1994 the International Air Transport Association took the unusual step of recommending train travel as the least life-threatening form of conveyance in the former Soviet Union.Casino Moscow: A Tale of Greed and Adventure on Capitalism's Wildest Frontier by Matthew Brzezinski, Ch 1 List of babyflots * 2nd Arkhangelsk United Aviation Division * 2nd Sverdlovsk Air Enterprise * ARP 410 Airlines * ATRAN * Abakan Avia * Abkhazian Airlines * Aeroflot * Air Kazakhstan * Air Kharkov * Air Ukraine * Air Volga * Arkhangelsk Airlines * Baikal Airlines * BAL Bashkirian Airlines * Belavia * Belgorod Air Enterprise * Bravia (Bryansk Air Enterprise) * Bugulma Air Enterprise * Bural * Chitaavia * Dagestan Airlines * Dalavia * Domodedovo Airlines * Donavia * Estonian Air * FlyLal * Georgian Airways * Izhavia * Kazakhstan Airlines * Kazan Air Enterprise * Kemerovo Aviation Enterprise * Komiaviatrans * KrasAir * Kuban Airlines * Latavio * Mavial Magadan Airlines * Nefteyugansk Air Enterprise * Nikolaevsk-Na-Amure Air Enterprise * Novosibirsk Air Enterprise * Omskavia * Orenburg Airlines * Perm Airlines * Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky Air Enterprise * Polar Airlines * Pskovavia * Pulkovo Airlines * SAT Airlines * Samara Airlines * Saransk Air Enterprise * Saravia * Siberia Airlines (now S7 Airlines) * Tomskavia * UTair Aviation * Uzbekistan Airways * Vladivostok Air * Voronezhavia References Further reading *Tavernise, Sabrina. \\"TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; Aeroflot Without Fear In Today's Russia.\\" The New York Times.

Born in Malta as Stanislao Formosa, he changed his name to Stanley George Adams by deed poll on 12 May 1950. Adams was a senior executive with the Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-LaRoche when in 1973 he discovered documents which indicated that the company was involved in price-fixing to artificially inflate the price of vitamins. He passed on the documents to the competition commission of the European Economic Community, aware that Switzerland, while not part of the EEC, had a free trade agreement with it. The EEC failed to keep his name confidential during its investigation, passing documents containing Adams' name to Hoffman La Roche. Adams was arrested and charged with industrial espionage and theft. Adams' wife was told that he faced a 20-year jail term for industrial espionage. She committed suicide. In the end, Adams served six months in a Swiss prison. When released, he fled to the United Kingdom and, with the assistance of a number of Labour Party MPs, notably John Prescott, later deputy party leader, he attempted to recover compensation from both the Swiss government and the European Union. In 1985 the European Union agreed to pay Adams £200,000, about 40% of his total costs. He documented the saga in Roche vs Adams. In 1985, he was elected rector of St Andrews University (a student-elected post). In 1994, Adams was convicted of soliciting Tony Cox, a former member of a secret British Army unit in Northern Ireland, to murder his third wife, so that he could claim £500,000 in life insurance. Commenting on his actions after being released from prison, Adams expressed regret that his efforts to have his wife killed had ruined his chances for a seat in the House of Lords. He served five years of a ten-year prison sentence. In 1985 Director/Producer John Goldschmidt made the TV-Movie A Song for Europe, also known as A Crime of Honour, inspired by Adams' story. The film was shown on Channel 4 in the UK, on ZDF in Germany, on SRG in Switzerland and on ORF in Austria. The British actor David Suchet and Goldschmidt won Royal Television Society Awards for the film.

Born Marie Schoder in Weimar, she married Gustav Gutheil in 1899, with whom she lived until his death in 1914. In 1920, she married the photographer Franz Xaver Setzer. She debuted in the secondary role of the First Lady at the Weimar Court Opera in The Magic Flute in her native city of Weimar in 1891. Gustav Mahler engaged her for the Vienna State Opera in 1900, where she remained until 1926. She appeared at the Royal Opera House as Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier in 1913. One of her famous roles was her portrayal of a \\"strange, Nietzschean\\" Carmen. She was seen in the 1914 Vienna premiere of Richard Strauss's ballet, Josephslegende as Potiphar's Wife. She created Esmeralda in the world premiere of Franz Schmidt's opera Notre Dame in the same year. Gutheil-Schoder created the fiercely difficult single role of Arnold Schoenberg's monodrama Erwartung in 1924 in Prague; earlier that year, she performed his Pierrot lunaire. Mahler termed her \\"a musical genius,\\" and she was highly regarded as a musician and singing-actress, although she seemed to be, as one Viennese critic wrote, \\"the singer without a voice.\\" In her later career, she became a stage director of opera. She was a well-known pedagogue as well, one of her students being the mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens. She died at the age of 61, in Ilmenau, Germany. Recordings In 1902, she recorded for Gramophone & Typewriter Company Records, in Vienna: Two excerpts from Carmen, an aria from The Merry Wives of Windsor, and duets from La dame blanche and Les contes d'Hoffmann were performed. In 2004, Symposium Records issued a Compact Disc entitled Vienna – The Mahler Years. Included are the two duets Gutheil-Schoder recorded (with Franz Naval), along with recordings by Selma Kurz, Leo Slezak, Erik Schmedes, Lilli Lehmann, etc. References * The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, by John Warrack and Ewan West, Oxford University Press, 1996.

The West Block also houses offices for parliamentarians, a branch of the Library of Parliament, committee rooms, and some preserved pre-Confederation spaces. Built in the Victorian High Gothic style, the West Block has been extended twice since its original completion in 1865. Though not as renowned as the Centre Block of parliament, the West Block appears on the obverse of the Canadian five-dollar bill. The West Block has not typically been open for public tours; however, with the opening of the interim House of Commons in January 2019, tours will commence shortly after. Characteristics The West Block Designed by Thomas Stent and Augustus Laver, the West Block is an asymmetrical structure built in the Victorian High Gothic style, with load bearing masonry walls, all clad in a rustic Nepean sandstone exterior and dressed stone trim around windows and other edges, as well as displaying a multitude of stone carvings, including gargoyles, grotesques, and friezes, keeping with the style of the rest of the parliamentary complex. The West Block adds to the Ottawa skyline three prominent towers: the Mackenzie Tower (added in 1878), the Laurier Tower (added in 1906), and the Southwest Tower. The interim House of Commons Chamber, built in West Block's old courtyard, during a dry run in January 2019. History The Department of Public Works sent out, on 7 May 1859, a call for architects to submit proposals for the new parliament buildings to be erected on Barrack Hill, which was answered by 298 submitted drawings. After the entries were narrowed down to three, then Governor General Sir Edmund Walker Head was approached to break the stalemate and the winner was announced on 29 August 1859. The departmental buildings, Centre Block, and a new residence for the Governor General were each awarded separately and the team of Thomas Stent and Augustus Laver, under the pseudonym of Stat nomen in umbra, won the prize for the first category. Construction on all three blocks commenced by the end of 1859. By the time the West Block was completed in 1865, the building was three years behind schedule. The first tenants were the offices of the postmaster general, the Ministry of Public Works, and the Crown lands departments. As the number of parliamentary and administrative staff increased with the expansion of the country's area, more space was added to the West Block: the Mackenzie Wing and Tower in 1878 and, in 1906, the Laurier Tower and link. In the early 2000s, the masonry of the West Block was found to be in a state of severe disrepair. Scaffolding and protective sheeting were erected in order to prevent falling blocks from striking pedestrians and cars below and a restoration project was immediately implemented. The two largest towers were also stabilised with temporary steel structures for fear of stones falling off them. An $863 million project to completely renovate the West Block began in 2011, and the renovated building opened on 28 January 2019. In preparation for a planned, decade-long renovation of the Centre Block to begin in 2019, the central courtyard of the West Block was transformed into a temporary chamber for the House of Commons. The new chamber is surrounded by exterior stone walls and covered by a glass dome roof which lets in natural sunlight. Multiple underground levels as well as planned tunnel connections to other Parliament Hill buildings were constructed out of dug-out bedrock under the West Block during the extensive renovations. When the renovation of Centre Block is complete and the House returns to its traditional chamber, the new House chamber will be used as committee rooms.

(Tsipön; Tibetan: rtsis-dpon). Trimon accompanied Regent Reting who jointly spearheaded the search to lake Lhamo Latso, leading to the discovery of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama in 1935. Trimon is regarded as an eminent personality and significant political figure in modern Tibetan history. Biography Trimon Norbu Wangyal was the second son of the eminent Tsi-pa Shakabpa Tenzin Norgye, a distinguished bureaucrat who oversaw the training of cadets that entered government service. A scion of the Shakabpa family, Norbu Wangyal was adopted into the Trimön family. He took the family name upon inheriting the estates of his wife's father at Chetang, near Lhasa although he lived for many years at Sechung House. =Career= In 1912, Trimön, despite no formal military training, was assigned to a post as Assistant Commanders-in-Chief of the Tibetan army during the Chinese conflict at Lhasa. In June of that year, he was conferred the title of Theji.In 1913-1914, he accompanied Lönchen Shatra to India as his personal assistant, to the Tibetan Plenipotentiaries at the Simla Convention and conversed with Lord Hardinge. When he returned to Tibet in 1914, he was appointed the title of Shap-pe. Throughout the 1920s, Trimön worked as the Commissioner in Eastern Tibet. His position ended in 1931 when Nga-pho Shap-pe was brought in to resume his role. Despite being a competent figure, with substantial literary knowledge, he was unpopular with the National Assembly, and was widely reported to be very conservative, stern and arrogant. He was one of the victims of Lungshar's plot which failed in the summer of 1934. After the 13th Dalai Lama's demise in 1933, in the summer of 1935 - Trimön was amongst eminent officials who set out with the Kashag to find the reincarnated 14th Dalai Lama. The search sent them across Tibet as well as visiting the customary Lhamo La-tso several times, a lake where it is said to offer clues to the whereabouts of the next Dalai Lama. =Resignation= Trimön's house, Sechung, in Lhasa, 1920-21 by Charles Alfred Bell During this time he grew increasingly affected by the government in Tibet, and following the search for the new Dalai Lama ordered his nephew, Tsepon Shakabpa while staying at Tiklo Monastery to draft his resignation. That from his position to the high council stating that \\"he had advanced in age, and wish to resign, devoting the remainder of his life to religious pursuits.\\" The Regent, the Fifth Reting Rinpoche attempted to get Trimön to change his mind, and believed he should be promoted to lönchen, as he had desired. He stated he would also resign from the cabinet if Trimön quit. Trimön returned to Lhasa in October 1935, and despite Reting's words he resigned officially shortly before the Tibetan New Year in January 1936. Reting did not resign as he had promised, and did not reply straight away. But after the Losar celebrations, Reting responded to Trimön, formally thanking him for his distinguished service to Tibet. He was granted the estate Kaship Nubling. At this time, concerns increasingly grew in regards to Trimön's mental state, and his behavior became increasingly eccentric. He was perceived to display occasional fits of insanity. He was seen at the market in Lhasa wearing a white Shamthab (a lower dress worn by ascetic lamas) and playing music and dancing. He was reported to have pounded heavily on the doors of the Jokhang temple hollering at the monks to open it. He responded strangely to Reting's offer of Kaship Nubling, and tried to garner support to be reinstated. There is much evidence to suggest that Trimön did not genuinely want to resign from the government, but had become distressed with his position and the situation. Trimön resigned on the grounds that he would still be consulted to offer advice on important affairs. He remained suspicious of the Chinese until his death in 1945, as Reting's regime grew increasingly weak after his departure.

Cinelândia is the popular name of a major public square in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Its official name is Praça Floriano Peixoto, in honour of the second president of Brazil, Floriano Peixoto. History In colonial times, the main structure in the Cinelândia area was the Ajuda Convent, built for women around 1750. Today's square started to gain its current shape in the early 20th century, when the Brazilian government considered that Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of the Republic, needed to be completely overhauled. View of Cinelândia square towards Guanabara bay and the Sugar Loaf Beginning in 1904, the centre of the city was remodeled following the latest trends in hygiene and urbanism under the direction of mayor Francisco Pereira Passos. The centrepiece of the reform was a large boulevard – the Avenida Central, now Avenida Rio Branco - which was built crossing the old city centre, passing by the Ajuda Convent. Most of the old colonial houses in central Rio were demolished. The area in front of the Ajuda Convent was turned into a public square. During the early decades of the 20th century a series of monumental public buildings were built facing the square. These were the Municipal Theatre (Theatro Municipal), the Brazilian National Library (Biblioteca Nacional), the Rio de Janeiro Municipality (Palácio Pedro Ernesto) and the Higher Court (Tribunal Superior). Located nearby were the National Senate (Palácio Monroe, demolished in the 1970s) and the National School of Fine Arts, today Museu Nacional de Belas Artes. The square concentrated a great part of the political and cultural life of Brazil. The buildings surrounding the square, mostly following the French Beaux-Arts architectural style, were a symbol of the modernisation of the city. In the centre of the square, a monument to Marshal Floriano Peixoto, second president of the Republic, was erected in 1910. The bronze monument, designed by sculptor Eduardo Sá and cast in France, depicts scenes of important events in Brazilian history. Another bronze statue, inaugurated in front of the Municipal Theatre, pays homage to Carlos Gomes, Brazil's foremost 19th century composer. In 1979 a Rio de Janeiro Metro station was opened in the square. Cinelândia Station was one of the first five stations in the then-new network. =Cinemas= The old Ajuda Convent survived the initial remodeling of the square, but was finally demolished in 1911. In its place, Spanish entrepreneur Francisco Serrador built a series of tall buildings that concentrated the best cinemas of the city. It was due to these theatres that the area became popularly known as Cinelândia (\\"Cinema land\\"). Most of the cinemas are now closed, but the region around Cinelândia is still a lively spot in Rio thanks to its bars, restaurants and cultural attractions.

History Entrance gate The original Gothic castle of Grafenstein was founded in the 13th century. In 1562, it was bought by Crown Chancellor Georg Mehl von Strelitz. Between 1566 and 1586, he had rebuilt the castle in Renaissance style and thus turned it into a representative chateau. Georg Mehl also had a steward's house built below the castle, which was around the year 1830 rebuilt in Classicist style. Shortly before that – around 1818 – Christian of Clam- Gallas had built the New Castle near the Old Castle. The new building was surrounded by a large garden with a number of valuable plants. The Old Castle has preserved its original Renaissance appearance despite a fire which damaged its upper floors in 1843. The House of Clam-Gallas owned Grabštejn since 1704 until it was confiscated in 1945. After the Second World War, the castle was open to the public, but in 1953, the whole castle complex was taken over by the Ministry of Defence. The Old Castle's condition significantly deteriorated after the army left in the late 1980s. Repairs and restorations began in 1989. Nowadays, Grabštejn is one of the best restored monuments of great importance in the Czech Republic. The castle was opened to the public again in 1993. The tower offers a marvellous view of the three-border-triangle, the castle's northern wing, and the vault. The most touristically attractive part of the castle interior is the St. Barbara chapel decorated with Renaissance fresco paintings from the 16th century. All parts of the ceiling and walls are ornamented in with interlaced figural, animal, and heraldic motifs.

The railway was founded in 1972, based in the Royal Agricultural Showground in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, where it operated until 2005. At Easter 2006 the railway reopened at its new home, Kingsbury Water Park as a short out and back run. One year later the initial circuit of approximately was opened to the public, and the line was officially declared open by Pete Waterman on 14 July 2007, with a cavalcade of 36 locomotives. By Easter 2010, the railway had completed another kilometre of trackwork in the form of a double track extension to Far Leys on the other side of the park, traversing through a twin bore, 70 yard tunnel en route. This extension was formally opened, again by Pete Waterman, on 15 May 2010. Between 22 and 29 September 2010 the railway hosted the AGM of the 7 in Gauge Society, with nearly 100 locomotives visiting and operating over the course of the week, including a marathon 40 trains on the circuit at once during 24 September. The line runs a mixture of (both club and privately owned) Standard Gauge Scale and Narrow Gauge Steam, Diesel, Petrol and Electric locomotives. A feature of the railway is its gnome village, a collection of garden gnomes donated by the public. The gnome village was vandalised in September 2016, when several of the ornaments were damaged. The incident prompted members of the public to donate replacements following an appeal by railway members. Local newspaper, the Tamworth Herald also backed the appeal. The attraction was destroyed for a second time by vandals in April 2017.

Aston received the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his enunciation of the whole-number rule. In chemistry, the whole number rule states that the masses of the isotopes are whole number multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom. The rule is a modified version of Prout's hypothesis proposed in 1815, to the effect that atomic weights are multiples of the weight of the hydrogen atom. It is also known as the Aston whole number rule after Francis W. Aston who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1922 \\"for his discovery, by means of his mass spectrograph, of isotopes, in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole- number rule.\\" Law of definite proportions John Dalton's list of atomic weights and symbols The law of definite proportions was formulated by Joseph Proust around 1800Proust, J.-L.

The atomic theory of John Dalton expanded this concept and explained matter as consisting of discrete atoms with one kind of atom for each element combined in fixed proportions to form compounds.Dalton, J. (1808). A New System of Chemical Philosophy, volume 1, Manchester. Excerpt. Accessed 2008-05-08. Prout's hypothesis In 1815, William Prout reported on his observation that the atomic weights of the elements were whole multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen.William Prout (1815). On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms. Annals of Philosophy, 6: 321-330\\\\. Online reprintWilliam Prout (1816). Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms. Annals of Philosophy, 7: 111-13\\\\. Online reprint He then hypothesized that the hydrogen atom was the fundamental object and that the other elements were a combination of different numbers of hydrogen atoms. Aston's discovery of isotopes In 1920, Francis W. Aston demonstrated through the use of a mass spectrometer that apparent deviations from Prout's hypothesis are predominantly due to the existence of isotopes. For example, Aston discovered that neon has two isotopes with masses very close to 20 and 22 as per the whole number rule, and proposed that the non-integer value 20.2 for the atomic weight of neon is due to the fact that natural neon is a mixture of about 90% neon-20 and 10% neon-22). A secondary cause of deviations is the binding energy or mass defect of the individual isotopes. Discovery of the neutron James Chadwick, discoverer of the neutron, with General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. During the 1920s, it was thought that the atomic nucleus was made of protons and electrons, which would account for the disparity between the atomic number of an atom and its atomic mass.Friedlander G., Kennedy J.W. and Miller J.M. (1964) Nuclear and Radiochemistry (2nd edition), Wiley, pp. 22–23 and 38–39 In 1932, James Chadwick discovered an uncharged particle of approximately the mass as the proton, which he called the neutron. The fact that the atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons was rapidly accepted and Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935 for his discovery. The modern form of the whole number rule is that the atomic mass of a given elemental isotope is approximately the mass number (number of protons plus neutrons) times an atomic mass unit (approximate mass of a proton, neutron, or hydrogen-1 atom). This rule predicts the atomic mass of nuclides and isotopes with an error of at most 1%, with most of the error explained by the mass deficit caused by nuclear binding energy.

He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge Capel Cure played just one game for Essex, in the 1929 season, of a drawn match against his alma mater Cambridge University. Batting at number four, Capel Cure was trapped leg-before wicket by Trevil Morgan in his first innings for a duck, and scored just six runs in the second innings before being caught and bowled by Gordon Chandler. Bowling, he took 2–58 in the Essex first innings; his wickets were of Tom Killick (lbw, but only after he'd scored a double century) and George Kemp-Welch (also lbw) in the Cambridge 1st innings. Cambridge did not complete their 2nd innings. Capel Cure's brother-in-law was Gerald Barry, who played one first-class match for the Combined Services in 1922. Capel Cure was a landowner in Shropshire and Essex. He received the Territorial Decoration. He was High Sheriff of Essex in 1951–52 and deputy lord-lieutenant of the county from 1958 to 1978.

Plot Every boy on the street is in love with Becky. But her father, Papa Whisselberg, insists that they be Jewish. While getting her hair cut, Becky encounters an Irish-looking boy who can't take his eyes off of her. He tries to follow her home but is temporarily sidelined by a policeman who winds up falling into a pit of water. He finally meets up with her, and she falls for him. Becky warns him against entering, saying her father would be brokenhearted if she married a non-Jewish boy. That night, the boy climbs the fire escape to meet Becky in her room. At the same time, a thief enters the house, the policeman in pursuit. Confusion ensues: the thief tries to disguise himself as a woman in a nightgown but his pants give him away. As he escorts the captured thief, the policeman again falls into the pit of water; the scene fades as he throws down his badge. On the occasion of Papa's birthday, Becky welcomes the boy for the party. Papa warns Becky that he doesn't want an Irishman for her. Trying to be helpful, the boy helps clean up by bringing food into the kitchen. Mama leaves for a minute while the boy opens the oven to see a cake which collapses because of the open oven door. Embarrassed, he shuts the door, only to have Mama return to warn him against opening the oven door because the cake might collapse. Concerned about the impression he'll make, he secretly removes the cake and takes it out the back door to think of what to do. Eyeing a bicycle pump, he uses it to return the cake to its air- filled state, and sneaks it back into the oven without Mama seeing. Everyone is seated for the presentation of Papa's cake. He begins to cut into it, but the nearby candles mysteriously blow out. After repeatedly trying to cut the cake only to have nearby objects flung from the force of air, Maxie reveals that the boy was responsible for making the cake full of air. Papa angrily throws him out of the house, but Becky follows, saying she's going to marry him. After a humorous pursuit down the streets of Los Angeles, Papa finally catches up as Becky and the boy enter his house. Inside the house Papa yells at the boy that his daughter is not going to marry an Irish boy. The boy then introduces his parents, clearly Orthodox Jews, leading to a happy ending. The film fades as Papa chases Maxie for playing a prank on him.

There was an ancient tradition that the Antonii gens were Heracleidae, being descendants of Anton, a son of Heracles. Anthony is an English name that is in use throughout North America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia, India, Pakistan, the British Isles, Guyana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Cameroon and Nigeria. \\"Anthony\\" is equivalent to Antonio in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Maltese; António or Antônio in Portuguese; Anton in Dutch, Galician, German, Icelandic, Romanian, Russian, and Scandinavian languages; Antoine in French; Antal in Hungarian; and Antun or Ante in Croatian. The usual abbreviated form is Tony (sometimes \\"Tone\\" or \\"Ant\\" or \\"Anth\\" or \\"Anton\\"). Its use as a Christian name was due to the veneration of St Anthony the Great, the founder of Christian monasticism, particularly in Egypt. Also significant was the later cult of St Antony of Padua. The spelling with \\"h\\" is not found until the 16th century when William Camden claimed that the name derived from the Greek (anthos, flower or possibly a small yellow bird such as a wagtail). The spelling pronunciation later became usual in the United States but not in the British Isles.Withycombe, E. G. (1950) The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; pp. 26-27 In the United States, it is the seventh most popular male name as of 2008, according to the Social Security Administration. When the background is Italian, Nino or Toni, shortened from Antonino, are used. Its popularity in the United Kingdom peaked during the 1940s, in 1944 it was the sixth most popular male name and was still as high as 14th in 1964. Spelling and pronunciation The name was historically spelled Antony, as used in Shakespeare's play Antony and Cleopatra. In the 17th century, the letter \\"h\\" was inserted into the spelling on the belief that the name derived from the Greek word ἄνθος (anthos), meaning \\"flower\\". In Britain, the historical pronunciation predominates for both spellings, while in the United States the spelling pronunciation is more common when the \\"Anthony\\" spelling is used. entry \\"Anthony\\" Translations and variants * Albanian: Andon (standard Albanian and Tosk Albanian dialect), Ndue (Gheg Albanian dialect), Anton * Arabic: أنتوني, انطوان، انطون، طانيوس، مطانيوس * Basque: Andoni, Antton * Belarusian: Антось (Antoś), Энтані (Entani) * Bengali: এন্থনি (Ēnthoni), আন্তোনিও (Āntōni'ō) * Bosnian: Ante, Antonije, Toni * Bulgarian: Anton, Antoan, Andon, Doncho * Catalan: Antoni, Toni * Chinese: 安东尼 (simplified), 安東尼 (traditional) (Mandarin: Āndōngní, Cantonese: Ōndūngnèih) * Croatian: Anton, Antonijo, Antonio, Antun, Ante, Anto, Tonči, Tonći, Toni * Czech: Antonín, Antek, Tonik, Tonda * Danish: Anton, Anthon * Dutch: Anton, Antoon, Antonie, Antonius, Teun, Teunis, Theun, Theunis, Ton, Toon * Esperanto: Antono, Anĉjo * Estonian: Anton, Tõnis, Tõnu, Tõnn * Filipino: Antonio, Antón, Onyo, Onying, Ton, Tonton, Tonio, Tonyo, Tunyíng * Finnish: Anton, Anttoni, Antton, Antto, Toni * French: Antoine, Antonin * Galician: Antón * German: Anton, Toni * Greek: Αντώνιος (Antó̱nios), Αντώνης (Antonis), Andonios, Andonis * Gujarati: એન્થની (Ēnthanī) * Hawaiian: Anakoni, Akoni * Hebrew: אנטוני המלך, טוני * Hindi: एंथनी (Ēnthanī) * Hungarian: Antal, Tóni * Irish: Antaine, Antoine, Antóin * Italian: Antonio, Antonino, Antonello, Nino, Tonino, Tonio, Totò * Japanese: アンソニー (Ansonī) * Kannada: ಆಂಟನಿ (Āṇṭani) * Korean: 앤토니 (Anthony) * Latin: Antonius, Antoninus * Latvian: Antonijs, Antons * Lithuanian: Antanas * Macedonian: Anton, Antonij, Andon, Doncho * Marathi: अंन्थोनी (Annthōnī) * Malayalam: ആൻ്റണി (Antoni), അന്തോണി (Anthōṇī) * Mongolian: Антони (Antoni) * Nepali: एन्थोनी (Ēnthōnī) * Norwegian: Anton * Persian: آنتونی * Polish: Antoni, Antek, Antonin, Tolek, Tonek * Portuguese: António, Antônio, Antão * Romanian: Anton * Russian: Антон (Anton) * Sami: Ante * Serbian: Антоније (Antonije), Анто (Anto) * Sheng: Anto, Toni * Slovak: Anton, Tóno, Tónko (diminutive) * Slovene: Anton, Tone * Spanish: Antonio, Antón, Toño (diminutive) * Swahili: Antoni, Antonio, Toni * Swedish: Anton, Ante * Sylheti: আন্তনি (Antoni) * Tamil: அந்தோணி (Antōṇi) * Telugu: ఆంథోనీ (Ānthōnī) * Thai: แอนโทนี่ (Xæ n tho nī̀) * Ukrainian: Ентоні (Entoni), Anton, Antin * Urdu: انتھونی See also * Tony (given name) * Andoni (given name) *Anthon (given name) *Anthoney *Anthoni, name * Anton (given name) * Antoni * Antonis * Antonio * Antonius * Antony * Antonia (name) * Antoine * Anfernee References External links *BehindTheName.com entry (also contains a list of versions of Anthony in other languages) Masculine given names English masculine given names ","title":"Anthony (given name)"},{"id":"13163510","text":"Ivan Chapman (12 October 1906 – 19 February 1976) was an English cricketer.

The school has many nationally and internationally acclaimed scholars in social security, health care, health disparities, communication, social and health policy, and individual and family development. Many of the faculty have training in both social work and public health, as well as policy engagement.  History  1925 Washington University introduces a social work program under the leadership of Professor Frank Bruno. This program was initially named the Washington University Training Course for Social Workers and was part of the Department of Sociology in the College of Liberal Arts. 1926 The social work training program transfers to the School of Commerce and Finance, which was then renamed the School of Business and Public Administration. 1928 The George Warren Brown Department of Social Work is established with monies from the estate of George Warren Brown, a prominent shoe manufacturer. 1937 The Washington University community and alumni of the George Warren Brown Department of Social Work dedicate Brown Hall. Brown Hall is the first building in the nation constructed to house a program of social work education. George C. Throop, then chancellor, opened the first evening’s dedication ceremonies with a tribute to George Warren Brown and his wife, Betty Bofinger Brown, whose bequest in memory of her husband had made the building possible. 1937-1945 Brown Hall is home to the Department of Social Work as well as the departments of history, political science, anthropology and sociology. As the program, grew the school expanded to occupy the entire building. 1945 The University establishes the George Warren Brown School of Social Work as a separate school with Benjamin E. Youngdahl as its dean. Years later, the estate of George Warren Brown donated $1 million to the University to create a permanent endowment for the school. 1998 The Brown School and Washington University celebrate the dedication of Alvin Goldfarb Hall, a four-story building that doubled the capacity of the school. 2009 The Master of Public Health program enrolls its first class, and collaborates with the new Institute for Public Health. Students are able to obtain a dual degree with the MSW. The Institute for Public Health is designed to be multi-disciplinary, and has collaboration from the School of Engineering's Technology for Environmental Public Health and International Development program, the Olin Business School's undergraduate major in healthcare management, and the College of Arts and Science's undergraduate minor in public health.

Book  Bundy: The Deliberate Stranger was written by Seattle Times reporter Richard W. Larsen and published in 1980. Larsen covered politics for the Times and had interviewed Bundy in 1972, several years before he became a murder suspect, when Bundy worked as a volunteer for the re- election campaign of Gov. Daniel J. Evans and had been seen trailing the campaign of Evans' Democratic opponent with a video camera. Larsen would go on to cover the \\"Ted\\" murders in 1974, when Bundy was first identified as a suspect in Seattle area homicides, and then cover the Ted Bundy story up until Bundy's execution in 1989. Bundy: The Deliberate Stranger was published in paperback in editions as late as 1990 but has since gone out of print.  Television film  The Deliberate Stranger was adapted into a two-part television movie originally broadcast on NBC on May 5, 1986. The film, based on Larsen's book, starred Mark Harmon as Bundy. Parts of the film were shot in Salt Lake City and at Utah State Prison as well as Farmington, Utah and Seattle, Washington. The film omits Bundy's childhood, early life, and first six known victims (five murders and the first victim who survived), picking up the story with the murder of Georgann Hawkins and following Bundy's further crimes in Washington, Utah, Colorado and Florida. Frederic Forrest starred as Seattle detective Robert D. Keppel, and George Grizzard played reporter Larsen. = Technical Difficulties = During the second part's broadcast, a few NBC affiliates (including WPXI channel 11 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and KPRC channel 2 Houston, Texas) were interrupted by a frozen scene and a static sound until placing their own technical difficulties tel-op graphics for less than 30 seconds before returning to its fixed program.

She singled out praise for Harmon's portrayal of Bundy, noting how Harmon reproduced Bundy's rigid posture and suspicious expression. According to Nelson, her client, still on death row when the program aired, showed no interest in seeing the film. Ann Rule, who had known Bundy before the murders when they worked together on a suicide crisis hotline (Jeannetta Arnette played a character based on Rule), felt that Harmon's portrayal missed the insecurities that lurked under Bundy's confident facade. Harmon was nominated for a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Bundy. According to The New York Times, the two shows ranked seventeenth and sixth in the Nielsen ratings. Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times described it as \\"taut, suspenseful, scary\\".

He was ridden by Pat Eddery in all but three of his races. The horse was bred in Ireland, by Saddlers' Hall and out of the American horse Early Rising, but was trained in Britain by John Dunlop. After winning two of his four starts as a two-year-old, at Newmarket and Pontefract, he finished third in the Sandown Classic Trial at Sandown Park in April 1997, before winning the Lingfield Derby Trial and being touched off by a short head by Benny the Dip in an extremely tight finish to the 1997 Epsom Derby. He would go on to have a more successful career than the horse who beat him, who would not win any of his three subsequent races. Silver Patriarch started favourite for the 1997 Irish Derby, but finished a disappointing fifth to Desert King, beaten thirteen lengths. He then came second to Stowaway in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York, beaten half a length, before winning the St Leger at Doncaster, for which he had started 5-4 favourite. As a four-year-old he finished a narrow second to Romanov in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket, but won the 1998 Coronation Cup from Swain at Epsom in June, succeeding over the course and distance where he had been so narrowly defeated the previous year. He remained a consistent performer, though he was well beaten in the 1998 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, won by Swain for the second consecutive year. At five, he won the Jockey Club Stakes and the Geoffrey Freer Stakes at Newbury, in which he had finished second in 1998, and came fourth (though only beaten two and a quarter lengths) in the Coronation Cup, won by Daylami. He also finished fourth (though now beaten eight lengths) in the King George, also won by Daylami. He last raced in Hong Kong in December 1999.

Description A perennial herb found as an erect or semiprostrate shrub, Pelargonium drummondii may be 100 to 400 mm in height. The flowers are light pink, but a darker colour at the center, splotchy and veined in appearance. The oblate cordate leaves are generally large and succulent. P. drummondii is distinguished from a similar widespread Australian species P. australe by the presence of a prominent branching perennial stem, which is generally absent in P. australe. However, young plants are likely to be indistinguishable by morphology alone. The species was first described by Turczaninow in Bulletin de la Société Impériale des Naturalistes de Moscou.Turczaninow, P.K.N.S. (1858) Bulletin de la Société Impériale des Naturalistes de Moscou 31 (1): 421 Type: \\"Nova Hollandia, Drum.

It is based on the novel of the same name written by Vincenzo Cerami. The movie mix commedia all'italiana with psychological drama tragedy. The film was an entrant in the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Giovanni Vivaldi (Alberto Sordi) is a petty bourgeois, modest white-collar worker nearing retirement in a public office in the capital. His life is divided between work and family. With his wife (Shelley Winters) he shares high hopes for his son, Mario (Vincenzo Crocitti), a newly qualified accountant, not a particularly bright boy who willingly assists in the efforts which his father employs to make it in the same office. The father, in an attempt to guide his son, emphasizes the point of practicing humility in the presence of his superiors at work, and he enrolled himself in a Masonic lodge to help him gain friendships and favoritisms that, at first, he would never hope to have. Just as the attempts of Giovanni Vivaldi seems to turn to success, his son Mario is killed, hit by a stray bullet during a shootout that erupts following a robbery in which the father and son are accidentally involved. Misfortune and sufferings consequently distort the lives, beliefs and morality of the Vivaldis. Giovanni's wife becomes ill, loses her voice and becomes seriously handicapped. Giovanni, now blinded by grief and hatred, throws himself headlong into an isolated and desperate quest. He identifies his son's murderer, abducts him, takes him to a secluded cabin and submits him to torture and violence, eventually bringing the killer of his child to a slow death. Then, for Giovanni arrives - at his set date - his retirement and, only a day later, the death of his wife who had by now been overcome by her disability. Giovanni is now prepared with serenity and resignation to live into old age, but a spontaneous verbal confrontation with a young idler revives in him the role of an executioner who will, presumably, kill again.

In the Major Leagues, he was a backup first baseman who played for three different teams between the and seasons. Listed at tall and , Phillips batted and threw right-handed, and was nicknamed \\"Stretch\\" for his flexibility when covering first base. Early years A native of Clarence, New York, Phillips graduated from Lancaster High School in 1939 and Clarkson University in 1943. He served in the US Navy during World War II. Baseball career Phillips entered the majors in 1947 with the New York Yankees, playing for them two and half years joining the Pittsburgh Pirates (1949–52) and Detroit Tigers (1955–57). His most productive season came in 1956 with the Tigers, when he posted career numbers in home runs (5), runs scored (25) and runs batted in (34), while hitting a .293 average in 69 games. The highlight of Phillips’ career was his ultimate grand slam (a walk-off grand slam that erases a three-run deficit) on July 8, 1950, which he hit against the St. Louis Cardinals, with the ball tipping off the end of Stan Musial's glove as it went over the outfield fence. Through the end of the 2016 season, Phillips is one of just 28 players in major league history to hit an ultimate grand slam. In a nine-season career, Phillips was a .283 hitter (252-for-892) in 343 games, including 111 runs, 101 RBIs, 42 doubles, 16 triples, nine home runs and five stolen bases. A member of the 1947 World Champions New York Yankees, Phillips also earned Pacific Coast League Most Valuable Player honors in 1954, after hitting .300 with 17 homers for Triple-A Hollywood Stars. In 11 minor league seasons, he hit a combined .278 with 104 RBI in 1212 games for five different teams between 1943 and 1959. Later years After a brief minor league managerial career, Phillips returned to Clarkson University where he devoted himself to coaching baseball, spanning 24 seasons as the Golden Knights’ skipper, amassing nearly 200 victories and molding over 300 student-athletes in the sport of baseball. He also coached several hundred more in basketball, cross country and golf, guiding the golf team into the early 21st century as an assistant coach.

The seven were Phillip Berrigan, Elizabeth McAlister, Rev. Neil McLaughlin, Rev. Joseph Wenderoth, Eqbal Ahmad, Anthony Scoblick, and Mary Cain Scoblick. The group was unsuccessfully prosecuted for alleged criminal plots during the Vietnam War era. Six of the seven were Roman Catholic nuns or priests. The seventh, Eqbal Ahmad, was a Pakistani journalist, American- trained political scientist, and self-described odd man out of the group.Jay Schulman, et al. (May 1973) \\"Recipe for a Jury\\" Psychology Today, pg. 42. Haverford College physics professor William C. Davidon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case. In 1970, the group attracted government attention when Berrigan, then imprisoned, and McAlister were caught trading letters that alluded to kidnapping National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and blowing up steam tunnels.\\"No Again on the Conspiracy Law\\". Time. (17 April 1972) Retrieved on 8 September 2007. Background The defendants stood accused of conspiring to raid federal offices, to bomb government property, and to kidnap Kissinger. Father Berrigan was serving time in the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, in central Pennsylvania. Boyd Douglas, who eventually would become an FBI informant and star prosecution witness – was a fellow inmate. Douglas was on a work-release at the library at nearby Bucknell University. Douglas used his connection with Berrigan to convince some students at Bucknell that he was an anti-war activist, telling some that he was serving time for anti-war activities. In fact, he was in prison for check forgery. In the course of the investigation the government resorted to unauthorized and illegal wiretapping. Douglas set up a mail drop and persuaded students to transcribe letters intended for Berrigan into his school notebooks to smuggle into the prison. They were later called, unwillingly, as government witnesses. Douglas was the chief prosecution witness. Librarian Zoia Horn was jailed for nearly three weeks for refusing to testify for the prosecution on the grounds that her forced testimony would threaten intellectual and academic freedom. She was the first United States librarian to be jailed for refusing to share information as a matter of conscience. The trial U.S. attorneys obtained an indictment charging the Harrisburg Seven with conspiracy to kidnap Kissinger and to bomb steam tunnels. They filed the case in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, seat of the Middle District. Activist attorney and former Attorney General Ramsey Clark led the defense team for their trial during the spring months of 1972. Unconventionally, he didn't call any witnesses in his clients' defense, including the defendants themselves. He reasoned that the jury was sympathetic to his Catholic clients and that that sympathy would be ruined by their testimony that they'd burned their draft cards.Josh Saunders (November/December 2003). \\"Ramsey Clark's Prosecution Complex\\". Legal Affairs. Retrieved on 8 September 2007. After nearly 60 hours of deliberations, the jury remained hung and the defendants were freed. Douglas testified that he transmitted transcribed letters between the defendants, which the prosecution used as evidence of a conspiracy among them. Several of Douglas' former girlfriends testified at the trial that he acted not just as an informer, but also as a catalyst and agent provocateur for the group's plans. There were minor convictions for a few of the defendants, based on smuggling mail into the prison; most of those were overturned on appeal.See United States v. Ahmad, 347 F.Supp. 912 (M.D.Pa.1972), modified sub nom., United States v. Berrigan, 482 F.2d 171 (3d Cir. 1973); United States v. Ahmad, 335 F.Supp. 1198 (M.D.Pa.1971); and United States v. Ahmad, 329 F.Supp. 292 (M.D.Pa.1971 ). The trial gained some notoriety for the use of scientific jury selection – use of demographic factors to identify unfavorable jurors – to keep the defendants from being convicted.Huss, Matthew T.

Garfield, M.D. The Field Hospital served as the mid-level component of a three-tier medical care system that also included six well-equipped First Aid Stations at the individual shipyards, and the main Permanente Hospital in Oakland, where the most critical cases were treated. Together, these facilities served the employees of the Kaiser shipyards who had signed up for the Permanente Health Plan (commonly referred to as the \\"Kaiser Plan\\"), one of the country's first voluntary pre-paid medical plans, and a direct precursor to the health maintenance organizations (HMOs) defined by the federal HMO Act of 1973. By August 1944, 92.2 percent of all Richmond shipyard employees had joined the plan, the first voluntary group plan in the country to feature group medical practice, prepayment and substantial medical facilities on such a large scale. After the war ended, the Health Plan was expanded to include workers' families. By 1990, Kaiser Permanente was still the country's largest nonprofit HMO. National Park Superintendent Martha Lee stated that the hospital \\"was the center of the nation’s first prepaid health care system and was a precursor of today’s HMO’s [sic].\\"National Park Superintendent Martha Lee, on Richmond's Home Front National Historic Park, The Program, The Flywheel, retrieved September 8, 2007 In part due to wartime materials rationing, the Field Hospital is a single-story wood frame structure designed in a simple modernist mode. Originally intended for use primarily as an emergency facility, the Field Hospital opened with only 10 beds. Later additions increased its capacity to 160 beds by 1944. The Field Hospital operated as a Kaiser Permanente hospital until closing in 1995. Kaiser conducted its first medical research at the facility in 1942 and later at another site before abandoning animal research all together in favor of correlational studies in 1958.

It was sold by Kaiser in the late 1990s, after the opening of the Richmond Medical Center and converted to a mosque that was shut down for dilapidated conditions in 2014 by the Richmond Fire Department, which caused accusations of racism by Richmond City Councilman Corky Boozé while the congregation began to meet in a tent according to Richmond Confidential. In the summer of 2007 preliminary bus tours were begun with a new guideless model, which instead filled half of the bus with residents who spoke of their experiences from the time to put what are otherwise everyday streets for residents into a greater historical perspective.

Many variations existed. The flag shown in the canton of the Brandywine Flag uses a 4-5-4 star pattern, and was probably patterned after a Hopkinson-style United States flag.

Raskin performs rigorous field research in order to understand these architectures and the stories embedded within them. In an effort to articulate the nuance of alternate narratives, Raskin often stages performances and displays discrete art objects ranging from drawings and paintings to sculpture within her installations. Often Raskin employs the assistance of her male, German, alter- ego, Herr Doktor Wolfgang Hauptman to exorcise repressed cultural narratives that lurk in her choice of subject matter. Early life and education Raskin was born on April 16, 1974 in Miami, Florida, the eldest of four children. She grew up in a newly forming, suburban housing development, a location she has referred to as the site of her earliest adventures, play, and invention in the landscape. In 1996 Raskin received a BA from Brandeis University. In 2003, she received her MFA from Columbia University in New York City. While at Columbia, Raskin studied with Jon Kessler, Kara Walker, Coco Fusco, Dana Hoey and anthropologist Michael Taussig. Work In 2013 Raskin traveled to Afghanistan as part of Creative Time Global Residency Program. In 2005, Raskin was awarded the Berlin Prize at the American Academy in Berlin. She was an artist in residence at IASPIS in Stockholm for most of 2007 and in 2008, Raskin was an artist in residence at the Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture at Bard College. Raskin made her New York gallery debut in May 2007 at Guild & Greyshkul after having exhibited in various galleries and institutions including Galleria Riccardo Crespi, Socrates Sculpture Park, PS1/MoMa, Kuenstlerhaus Bethanien, and Artists Space. Since then she has had solo gallery shows at Milliken in Stockholm, Reception in Berlin and Churner and Churner in New York. She participated in the 2008 Art Show at the Park Avenue Armory. Her work at the Armory show was a military- like installation, referring to the Titan Missile program and Curtis LeMay. Raskin's work was featured at the 11th International Istanbul Biennale, the 2nd Athens Biennale, and the 3rd Singapore Biennale. In 2015, Motorpark, Raskin's collaboration with Kim Charles Kay was presented at Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft. Motorpark is a collaborative platform founded with Kay in 2012, initially involving the retrofit of a 1996 Blue-Bird school bus.

The building was established as an experimental art space in 1983, and was the first visual arts residency in the United States dedicated solely to the creation and presentation of new art installations and conceptual art. The Capp Street Project name and concept has existed since 1983, although the physical space which the residency and exhibition program occupied has changed several times. In 1998, Capp Street Project united with California College of the Arts’ Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts. In 2014, Wattis celebrated 30 years of Capp Street Project Art.  History  In 1983, Capp Street Project was created by Ann Hatch who acquired a David Ireland designed house at 65 Capp Street in San Francisco. Although Hatch's original intention was to preserve the house as a work of art, a personal inquiry concerning patronage and the desire to nurture non- traditional art making processes, ultimately led in another direction. The artist-in-residency program was created and became central to Capp Street Project. The 65 Capp Street house was purchased in 2008 by Carlie Wilmans, in order to preserve both the house and Ireland’s work. Wilmans is on the board of the Capp Street Foundation. In 1998, Capp Street Project became part of the Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, which is in turn part of the California College of the Arts and the house at 65 Capp Street returned to the public sector. As a program of Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts it is currently run by Anthony Huberman, the Director since 2013. The house opened to the public in 2016. Since its inception, Capp Street Project has given more than 100 local, national, and international artists the opportunity to create new work through its residency and public exhibition programs. In 2016, the duplex next door to 65 Capp Street was purchased by Carlie Wilmans and she had made plans to also donate it to the Capp Street Project in order to create artist housing. In 2019, Wilmans attempted to evict six families, but due to public backlash the plans were stopped. As a result, the Capp Street Project foundation started to distanced itself from the founder that same year. In 2019, the head curator of Capp Street Project, Bob Linder was laid off in an effort to restructure the programming and lessen exhibitions by visiting artists.

B Bond was the first major building in Britain constructed using the reinforced concrete system pioneered by Edmond Coignet. It was built by Cowlins Construction. The open plan structure, which is nine storeys high and has an 18-window range, was created in two equal parts separated by central spine wall. In addition to the concrete structure, the warehouse was built using black bricks, patent red bricks and blue engineering bricks, with Pennant stone steps, terracotta details and a Welsh slate roof. In the 1990s it was still being used for the storage of wines and spirits. The building is now owned by Bristol City Council. The western half houses Bristol Archives (which holds the extensive archives of the city of Bristol) as well as other council offices. The brickwork of the exterior of the building was refurbished by John Perkins Construction using bricks which matched the originals. The eastern side is occupied by the CREATE Centre, which includes an energy-saving Ecohome designed by Bruges Tozer Architects. The CREATE Centre also houses several organisations working in sustainable development, including the city council's sustainability teams.

The village is situated to the south west of Chester, very close to the England–Wales border. The civil parish includes Balderton, Gorstella, Lower Kinnerton and Rough Hill. It is one of the three old Cheshire parishes which are situated on the Flintshire side of the River Dee. Dodleston has a village shop with post office, village hall, village green, a C of E primary school, the Grade II listed St Mary's Church and the Grade II listed 'Red lion' pub. It also contains some good examples of buildings by the 19th-century architect John Douglas. At the 2001 census, the population of Dodleston was 777, reducing to 715 at the 2011 census. History The name Dodleston likely derives from the Old English personal noun Dod(d)el and the word tūn, meaning \\"an enclosure, farmstead or settlement\\". Dodleston was a township in Broxton Hundred. The population was recorded over time as 185 in 1801, 258 in 1851, 307 in 1901, 267 in 1951 and significantly increasing to 777 by 2001. The village was also the birthplace of Sir Thomas Egerton (1540–1617), who rose to importance during the latter years of Elizabeth I and the early reign of James I. Because of his high status he could have been buried in either Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral in London, but chose St Mary's Church, Dodleston, as his final resting place. Dodleston is the setting for \\"The Dodleston Messages\\", a series of messages from the sixteenth century allegedly received by author Ken Webster. =Association with Mallory= In the early 1980s the old order of life in a small country village was considerably affected by the development of a new housing estate, which became known as Boydell Park. Within Boydell Park and branching off Penfold Way is Mallory Walk, which is a cul de sac with footpath access to other areas of Dodleston. Mallory Walk is named after Canon Herbert Leigh-Mallory, who was Rector of St Mary's Church between the years 1927 to 1940, having previously been incumbent at St John's Church in Birkenhead. His son George Mallory was the English mountaineer who took part in the first three British expeditions to conquer Mount Everest in the early 1920s. Governance Dodleston is within the City of Chester parliamentary constituency. An electoral ward in the name of Dodleston and Huntington existed at the time of the 2011 census, which covered both of the parishes plus their surrounding areas. The total population was recorded as 3,958. As of , Dodleston is within the Christleton and Huntington Ward of the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester.

She married Philip Berrigan and was excommunicated from the Catholic Church. McAlister served prison time for nonviolent acts of civil disobedience.  Early life  Liz McAlister was born Maureen McAlister to Irish immigrant parents in Montclair, New Jersey. She and her twin sister Katherine had a sheltered upbringing and attended Lacordaire Academy. Following graduation, the sisters attended Marymount College, Tarrytown. During her sophomore year at Marymount College, McAlister, still Maureen, entered the novitiate of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (RSHM). In June 1961, she became Sister Elizabeth McAlister. McAlister continued her studies at Hunter College, graduating with a master's degree in art. She then returned to teach art history at Marymount College in 1963.  Life of protest and witness  = Philip Berrigan = While an instructor at Marymount College, McAlister got involved with peace demonstrations and prayer vigils against the Vietnam War. Through this community, McAlister met Philip Berrigan, who came to speak and demonstrate in Tarrytown, New York. According to McAlister's daughter, Frida Berrigan, the two met \\"at a funeral in 1966\\", although there are accounts that Berrigan and McAlister moved in the same circles from 1964, on. In early 1969, Phil Berrigan and McAlister married by \\"mutual consent\\". At this time, Berrigan was awaiting sentencing for pouring blood on draft files in the US Customs House in Baltimore. = Harrisburg Seven = While Berrigan was in federal prison for his involvement in the Catonsville Nine, McAlister and Berrigan communicated via a fellow inmate, Boyd Douglas, who was allowed furlough for work release. Douglas was an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and turned over the contents of Berrigan and McAlister's letters to the authorities. These letters, which included nascent plans to kidnap Henry Kissinger, led to the prosecution of McAlister, Berrigan, and five others, known as the Harrisburg Seven. = Excommunication and marriage = Berrigan had spoken and written about the importance of celibacy to activists, but abandoned his previous position against romantic entanglements for McAlister. McAlister and Berrigan were married (witnessed commitment) in January 1972 while Berrigan was in prison. Following his parole, on May 28, 1973, they were legally married and they were excommunicated by the Catholic Church. McAlister had three children with Berrigan: Frida, Jerry, and Kate. McAlister and Berrigan continued their activism, serving jail time for their civil disobedience. During their twenty- nine year marriage, Berrigan and McAlister spent a total of eleven years separated by prison.  Jonah House and later life  McAlister and Berrigan founded Jonah House in 1973. Called a resistance community Jonah House was a commune, with the Berrigan-McAlister family living in the basement of the Baltimore row house. They raised their three children there, with the help of the other activists in the community. In 1996, Jonah House moved to a house overlooking St. Peter's Cemetery, and the community members cared for the grounds.

The three main ethnicities within the British Iraqi community are Iraqi Arabs, Iraqi Kurds and Iraqi Turkmen, according to a publication by the International Organization for Migration. There are also smaller Christian and Yazidi communities.. History The UK has had a significant Iraqi population since the late 1940s. Refugees including liberal and radical intellectuals dissatisfied with the monarchist regime moved to the UK at this time. Supporters of the monarchy subsequently fled to the UK after it was overthrown. According to an International Organization for Migration mapping exercise, many settled Iraqi migrants in the UK moved for educational purposes or to seek a better life in the 1950s and 1960s. Some members of religious minorities were also forced to leave Iraq in the 1950s. Other Iraqis migrated to the UK to seek political asylum during the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, with large number of Kurds and Shi'a Muslims in particular migrating in the 1970s and 1980s, or as a result of the instability that followed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Demographics =Population size= The 2001 UK Census recorded 32,236 Iraqi-born residents, and the Office for National Statistics estimates that, as of 2009, this figure had risen to around 65,000. According to estimates by the Iraqi embassy, the Iraqi population in the UK is around 350,000–450,000..

Their purpose is to prepare adolescents for their life as adults. Secular coming of age ceremonies originated in the 19th century, when non-religious people wanted a rite of passage comparable to the Christian Confirmation. Nowadays non-religious coming-of-age ceremonies are organized in several European countries. Germany Modern non-religious coming-of-age ceremonies originate in Germany, where Jugendweihe (\\"youth consecration\\", today occasionally known as Jugendfeier, 'youth ceremony') began in the 19th century. The activity was arranged by independent Freethinker organizations until 1954, when the Communist party of East Germany banned it in its old form and changed it to promote Communist ideology. In the GDR Jugendweihe became, with the support of the state, the most popular form of coming-of-age ceremonies for the adolescents, replacing the Christian confirmation. After the reunification of Germany, the Jugendweihe activity regained its independence from Communism, but the non-religious rite of passage had become a tradition, and thus approximately 60-70% of youngsters in the eastern states still participate in it. The age for participating in the Jugendweihe is 13–14 years. Before the ceremony the youngsters attend specially arranged events or a course, in which they work on topics like history and multiculturalism, culture and creativity, civil rights and duties, nature and technology, professions and getting a job, as well as lifestyles and human relations. Nowadays there are many different groups organising Jugendweihes, but the most important ones are Jugendweihe Deutschland e. V., der Humanistische Verband Deutschland ('the Humanist Association of Germany'), der Freidenkerverband ('the Freethinker Association') and die Arbeiterwohlfahrt ('the Worker Welfare'). Norway Human-Etisk Forbund ('The Norwegian Humanist Association') has arranged non-religious confirmation courses in Norway since 1951. During the last ten years, there has been rapid growth in the popularity of the course. In 2006 over 10,500 youngsters, approximately 17% of the age group, chose the humanistisk konfirmasjon or borgerlig konfirmasjon ('civil confirmation'). The course can be taken during the year of one's 15th birthday. Norwegians living abroad can take the course as correspondence course by e-mail. Humanistforbundet, not to be confused with HEF (Human-Etisk Forbund) has since 2006 arranged an alternative to HEF's confirmation. It is a non-religious civil confirmation based on academics. The program usually consists of several lectures by various prestigious, well-known and competent organisations like the Red Cross, UNICEF and Dyrevernalliansen (a Norwegian animal welfare interest-organisation). People like Thomas Hylland Eriksen have also held lectures. Finland =Prometheus Camp= In Finland non-religious lower high school students planned a camp for a secular rite of passage as an alternative to the Christian confirmation, and the first Prometheus-leiri ('Prometheus Camp') was held in 1989 by the Finnish Philosophy and Life Stance teachers' coalition. The following year Prometheus-leirin tuki ry ('Prometheus Camp Association') was founded for organising the week-long summer camps. The ideology of the association is based on a Humanist world view, but it is politically and religiously non-aligned. One of the main principles of the activity is tolerance towards other peoples' life stances.The Prometheus medallion The camp is primarily aimed at youngsters who do not belong to any religious denomination, but approximately 20% of yearly Prometheus Camp participants are members of some religious community, usually the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, and also participate in a Christian confirmation. The usual age of participants in a Prometheus Camp is 14–15 years, but there are also \\"senior camps\\" for older youngsters. In recent years the yearly number of participants has been around 1000, which is approximately 1.5% of the age group. The themes in the Prometheus Camp are differences, prejudice and discrimination; drugs, alcohol and addiction; society and making a difference in it; the future; world views, ideologies and religions; personal relationships and sexuality; and the environment. These topics are worked on in open discussions, debating, group work, small drama plays or playing games. Every camp is organised and led by a team of seven members: two adults and five youngsters. At the end of the camp, there is a Prometheus Ceremony, in which the participants perform a chronicle about their week for their friends and family. They also get a Prometheus diploma, a silver-coloured Prometheus medallion and a crown of leaves that is bound by the camp leaders. Weekend- long continuation camps are arranged in the autumn. Annually one Prometheus- camp has been arranged in English, two in Swedish and approximately 65 in Finnish. Iceland In Iceland borgaraleg ferming ('civil confirmations') are organised by Siðmennt, a Humanist association, as an alternative to the Christian confirmation for 13-year-olds. Before the civil confirmation, the youngsters take a preparation course about ethics, personal relationships, human rights, equality, critical thinking, relations between the sexes, prevention of substance abuse, skepticism, protecting the environment, getting along with parents, being a teenager in a consumer society, and what it means to be an adult and take responsibility for one's views and behavior. The course consists of 12 weekly group meetings, each lasting 1.5 hours. Youngsters living outside Reykjavík can take the course in an intensive two- week version. The teachers of the course are usually philosophers. At the end of the course, there is a formal graduation ceremony in which the participants receive diplomas, and some of them perform music, poetry and speeches. There are also prominent members of Icelandic society giving speeches. An increasing number of youngsters have taken the course every year, with 300 taking the course for the confirmation in 2014. Sweden The association Humanisterna ('The Humanists') started secular coming-of-age courses in Sweden in the 1990s in the form of study circles, but they were soon replaced by a week-long camp where the subjects are dealt with through discussions, games, group works and other activities. In recent years, there have been approximately 100 participants annually in the Humanistisk konfirmation ('Humanist confirmation') camps. The camp's themes concern one's life stance, for example human rights, equality, racism, gender roles, love, sexuality and lifestyles, but the topics under discussion depend on the participating youngsters' own choices. At the end of the camp, there is a festive ceremony in which the participants demonstrate to their families and relatives what they did during the week, e.g. through plays and songs. There are also speeches held by the organisers of the camp, the youngsters themselves, and invited speakers. Denmark The first civil confirmation in the Nordic countries was arranged in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1915 by Foreningen mod Kirkelig Konfirmation ('Association Against Church Confirmation'). In 1924 the organisation changed its name to Forgeningen Borgerlig Konfirmation ('The Association for Civil Confirmation').Borgelig Konfirmation (in Danish) Civil confirmation declined in the 1970s as central organized ceremonies, but instead they became increasingly more common as private celebrations and the civil confirmations are still common today in atheist families. They are also known as 'nonfirmations', but are now rarely linked to any associations.  Czechoslovakia  During the communist era, young people were given identity cards at the age of 15 in a collective ceremony. At the age of nineteen, boys were required to perform military service.  United States and Canada  Edifices of the Ethical movement in the United States perform secular coming- of-age ceremonies for 14-year-old members, in which, after spending a year performing community service activities and attending workshops regarding various topics concerning adulthood, the honoree and one's parent(s) speak before the congregation about their growth over the year. Similar ceremonies are performed by congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association and Canadian Unitarian Council.

It was created by the construction of the Koka Dam across the Awash River. The reservoir has an area of 180 square kilometers. Located in the Misraq Shewa Zone of the Oromia Region, close to the capital and largest city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, the Koka Reservoir is popular with tourists and city-dwellers. There is a variety of wildlife and birds around the lake. The reservoir supports a fishing industry; according to the Ethiopian Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 625 tonnes of fish are landed each year, which the department estimates is either 52% or 89% of its sustainable amount.\\"Information on Fisheries Management in the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\\" (report dated January, 2003) Table 1 has the lower estimate for the maximum sustainable amount; Table 4 the higher estimate. Both the reservoir and the dam are threatened by increasing sedimentation caused by environmental degradation as well as the invasive water hyacinth. The Koka dam consists of concrete with a length of 458 meters and a maximum height of 47 meters. The head utilized is 32–42 meters. The transmission lines have voltage 132 kV. The primary contractor was Imprese Italiane all'Estero. The subcontractor who provided the equipment was Gruppo Industriale Elettro Meccaniche per Impiante all'Estero, and subcontractor for mounting the equipment and the erection of the transmission lines was Società Anonima Elettrificazione.

Although he won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1995 he was best known for his performances in the autumn of the previous year, when his wins at Ascot and at Doncaster led to him being one of the highest-rated two-year-olds in modern European racing. Background Celtic Swing was owned for most of his career by Peter Savill, bred by Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk and trained by her daughter Lady Herries in Sussex. He was sired by Damister, an American- bred horse who finished third in the 1985 Epsom Derby, out of the British mare Celtic Ring. His granddam, Pencuik Jewel, was a half sister to 1974 Ascot Gold Cup winner Ragstone, and to Castle Moon - the dam of 1986 St Leger winner Moon Madness, 1989 Coronation Cup winner Sheriff's Star and 1990 Goodwood Cup winner Castle Moon. His name, although partially inspired by that of his dam, was specifically taken from a Van Morrison track. In all his seven races he was ridden by Kevin Darley. Racing career =1994: two-year-old season= Celtic Swing raced for the first time at Ayr on 16 July 1994, winning a two- year-old maiden race over seven furlongs by four lengths. This would be the only time he ran without starting as favourite. On 8 October 1994 he won over seven furlongs at Ascot by eight lengths, beating the subsequently hugely successful Singspiel. Although this created considerable excitement, the race that led to the hype was the Racing Post Trophy over a mile at Doncaster on 22 October 1994, which he won by twelve lengths. He was voted the Cartier Racing Award as the top European two-year-old colt. Going into 1995, expectations ran high for Celtic Swing with widespread claims that he would be one of the greatest horses of all time, and almost unprecedentedly short odds for the 2,000 Guineas and Derby. Claims were even made that, 25 years after Nijinsky had been the last horse to do it, he would also take the St Leger and win the colts' Triple Crown, which it was widely believed had become almost impossible due to specialist breeding. =1995: three-year-old season= Almost inevitably, he never lived up to these grand expectations, which included a number of rapturous editorials in The Times. Stepping back to seven furlongs, he made his seasonal debut on softened ground at Newbury in the Greenham Stakes on 22 April 1995. Although his win over Bahri was not spectacular, he was still unchallenged, and he would have won by much more than the eventual one and a quarter lengths had he not been eased down. All was set for the 2,000 Guineas on 6 May 1995, a race run amid almost unbearable expectations (on that day's Morning Line, John McCririck said to Jim McGrath, who was strongly involved with Timeform which had said that the race was a \\"certainty\\", that if the horse did not win by at least eight lengths McGrath was finished). But the first cracks in Celtic Swing's armour suddenly emerged: although he fought back near the end, he could not beat the French horse Pennekamp, who eventually won by a head. Owner Peter Savill decided not to run in The Derby, claiming that the ground at Epsom was too firm for the horse's liking, and go instead for the Prix du Jockey Club (the \\"French Derby\\") at Chantilly on 4 June 1995. Here he started evens favourite, and won, but only by an unconvincing half-length over Poliglote. His final race would be in the Irish Derby at The Curragh on 2 July 1995. Here he started as 5-4 favourite, but finished a bitterly disappointing eighth out of thirteen runners, never having looked like winning. Worse was to follow: he had been injured during the race, and the rest of his schedule for the season was abandoned. It had been intended to run him again as a four-year-old in the later part of the 1996 season, but the injury recurred and, almost unnoticed, the much-hyped \\"wonderhorse\\" was quietly retired on 20 July 1996, more than a year after his last race. Stud record Celtic Swing's stud record was largely unremarkable but he did sire two outstanding horses. The Australian bred Takeover Target (Dam – Shady Stream) won eight Group One races including top sprinting races in Australia, United Kingdom, Japan and Singapore and in prize money from twenty one wins in forty one race starts. The French-bred filly Six Perfections won six races including the Breeders' Cup Mile in 2003. Celtic Swing died at the Allevamento di Besnate in Italy in September 2010 after contracting colitis.

Allegedly the two cousins were born in the same bed (at different times) and brought up in the same household at 52 Andover Street, Sheffield. He was the son of Benjamin Holden Joseph Warriss, an insurance company inspector, and his wife, Mary Ann, née Driver, Jewel's mother's sister. He first performed on the stage in 1930. Jimmy Jewel and Ben Warriss came together as professionals in 1934 at the Palace Theatre, Newcastle.Gifford, Dennis: Obituary: Ben Warriss The Independent, 18 January 1993 Their double act achieved seven Royal Variety Performances, 12 Blackpool summer seasons, a successful radio series (Up the Pole) and a film of the series. Around 1966, the two went their separate ways, with Warriss performing on stage and Jewel moving into television. Warriss was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats serving as \\"King Rat\\" for a year, 1953 and then again, for two consecutive years, 1961–1962. In the 1970s Warriss was the resident compere at the Cala Gran club in Fleetwood, Lancashire. In 1988 he played the Emperor of China in the first of the newly reopened Hackney Empire pantomimes, Aladdin. He was still performing in pantomime in his eighties. The character Parker from the 1960s TV series of Thunderbirds is said to have been based upon Warriss's appearance. His first wife, whom he married on 22 September 1934, was Grace Mary Skinner (b. 1910–11), a dancer and teacher of dancing and daughter of Henry Arthur James Skinner, master mariner. This marriage had ended by about 1940 and two years later Warriss married the entertainer Meggie Easton. His third marriage, which took place about 1960, was to Virginia Vernon.

Kick Master resembles early games in the Castlevania series.Kick Master instruction booklet (Nintendo Entertainment System, US) Enemies are fought using martial arts kicks and magic spells. Defeated enemies drop three items that will either help or hurt the player character Thonolan. When Thonolan gains a level, his maximum MP is increased and new moves are learned.  Plot  The castle of Lowrel is attacked and burned by the monsters and magic of the powerful witch Belzed (curiously, Western sources such as Nintendo Power described Belzed as a male). In the attack, the King and the Queen are slain and their only child, Princess Silphee, is kidnapped. The king's guards were all killed, except for the knight Macren. He and his younger brother, Thonolan, an aspiring martial artist, take off on a long journey to free the princess. As the fight against Belzed's minions commences, Macren is mortally wounded by a skeleton. With his dying breath, he pleads his brother to use his \\"great kicking skills\\" to avenge him. There are a total of eight destinations that Thanolan must bravely journey through before confronting and defeating Belzed: #Witches' Forest - A small forest that exists just outside of the Castle Lowel. The skeletal forces that attacked the kingdom came from this area and are led by the witch Druilla serving under Belzed. #Caverns of No Return #Belzed's First Stronghold - A stronghold that was once used by Belzed but is now abandoned. Left in her stead as a guardian is the lightning- wielding gargoyle. #Bottomless Crevasse - Beyond the stronghold is a series of crevasses along a mountainside. A fire-breathing chimerae seeking to end Thonolan's quest awaits him here. #Aboard the Ship of Strife #Across the Swamps #Long Way From Home - What appears to be a dungeon of sorts within Belzed's castle. Not being satisfied with the all of the destruction that she has caused, Belzed even used magic to create evil doppelgangers of both Thanolan and his brother - which lurk about this dungeon. #Sector 8: Belzed's Haunted Tower If the player manages to complete the game, the evil Belzed is destroyed and Thonolan rescues the princess Silphee. He then torches down Belzed's Tower and disappears, never to be heard from again. The player is then given an opportunity to try to beat the game again on a higher difficulty level.

Uses  Live bottom trailers can haul a variety of products including gravel, potatoes, top soil, grain, carrots, sand, lime, peat moss, asphalt, compost, rip-rap, heavy rocks, etc. Those who work in industries such as the agriculture and construction benefit from the versatility of the trailer and chassis mount.  Safety  The live bottom trailer eliminates trailer roll over because the tub does not have to be raised in the air to unload the materials. The trailer has a lower centre of gravity which makes it easy for the trailer to unload in an uneven area, compared to dump trailers that have to be on level ground to unload. Over head wires are a danger for the conventional dump trailer during unloading, but with a live bottom, wires are not a problem. The trailer can work anywhere that it can drive into because the tub does not have to be raised for unloading.  Advantages  The tub empties clean, making it easier for different materials to be transported without having to get inside the tub to clean it out. The conveyor belt allows the material to be dumped at a controlled pace so that the material can be partially unloaded where it is needed. The rounded tub results in a lower centre of gravity which means a smoother ride and better handling than other trailers. Working under bridges and in confined areas is easier with a live bottom as opposed to a dump trailer because it can fit anywhere it can drive. Wet or dry materials can be hauled in a live bottom trailer. In a dump truck, wet materials stick in the top of the tub during unloading and causes trailer roll over. Insurance costs are lower for a live bottom trailer because it does not have to be raised in the air and there are few cases of trailer roll over.  Disadvantages  Some live bottom trailers are not well suited for heavy rock and demolition. However rip-rap, heavy rock, and asphalt can be hauled if built with the appropriate strength steels.

Commentary career Holt became a racecourse commentator in 1988, and made his TV debut for Channel 4 on 30 September 1994 at Newmarket. He rose through the commentating ranks quickly, and was race-calling alongside Graham Goode for the SIS feed for the Grand National in 1990. The pair went on to commentate on the race together until 1997. Holt was also racecourse commentator at Newmarket during the Guineas meeting whilst positioned out in the country, and has been grandstand commentator at Royal Ascot since the mid-1990s. From the beginning of 1995 he was heard regularly, sometimes as a race commentator but sometimes in the now defunct job of betting and results reader. He replaced Raleigh Gilbert as Channel 4's second commentator, calling the first part of the race at tracks such as Newmarket before handing over to Goode in the grandstand. Goode at that time remained Channel 4's main race commentator, but in the late 1990s Holt covered more and more races such as the Whitbread Gold Cup and the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown Park. Holt became the main commentator from the beginning of 2000, and his first meeting as Channel 4's senior race-caller came at Uttoxeter for the 'new millennium's first race-meeting'.

From 2013 to 2016, he was lead commentator for Channel 4 Racing's coverage of the Royal Ascot meeting. He remained a regular racecourse commentator throughout his time at Channel 4, often working at his local tracks, Lingfield Park, Plumpton, Brighton and Fontwell Park.

It became the main fort of the Burang Kingdom, in the 10th century under King Kori, one of the two sons of Tashi Gon, King of the Guge Kingdom. The Burang kingdom is believed to have ended in the 15th century. Burang is the gateway town for travel to Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar to the north. These are important destinations for Bon, Buddhist, Hindu, Jain and even New Age pilgrims. Traditional cosmology designates Mount Kailash the center of the universe.

Nero. Harvard. 2003. Most scholars set the number of Nero impostors to two or three, although St. Augustine wrote of the popularity of the belief that Nero would return in his day, known as the Nero Redivivus legend.Gallivan, P.A. \\"The False Neros: A Re-Examination,\\" Historia 22 (1973), 364–365; Augustine of Hippo, City of God XX.19.3. In addition to the three documented Pseudo-Neros, Suetonius refers to imperial edicts forged in the dead Nero's name that encouraged his followers and promised his imminent return to avenge himself on his enemies.Suetonius, Life of Nero, 57. Due to the short-lived success of the Nero impostors and Nero's incorporation into eschatological literature, the belief in Nero's imminent return lasted for centuries. Lion Feuchtwanger wrote a historical novel based on the second known Pseudo-Nero, Terentius Maximus, entitled Der falsche Nero. This novel was published in 1936. Source of legend Belief in Nero's survival may be attributed in part to the obscure location of his death, although, according to Suetonius, Galba's freedman Icelus saw the dead emperor's body and reported back to his master. Nero was also denied the lavish burial that was accorded to popular emperors and members of the imperial family, which may have left those plebeians who loved him dissatisfied and suspicious. Furthermore, he was not buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus with the other Julio-Claudian emperors, but in a tomb on the Pincian Hill at the family burial place of the Domitii Ahenobarbi.Suetonius, Life of Nero 50. The postmortem popularity of Nero among the Roman plebeians inspired them to lay flowers at his tomb. Another possible source of inspiration for those who impersonated Nero was the circulation of prophecies that predicted he would regain his kingdom in the East.Suetonius, Life of Nero 40. One version placed his resurgence at Jerusalem. These prophecies have been tied to Nero's natal chart, which has been interpreted as pointing to a loss of his patrimony and its recovery in the East.Molnar, M. \\"Greek Astrology as a Source of Messianic Portent,\\" Ancient World 29 (1998), 139–149. Tacitus may have been referring to such prophecies in veiled language when he wrote of the rumors that circulated about Nero after his death, which had contributed to the belief that he had survived. The return of Nero may have inspired the author of the Book of Revelation when he wrote about the eschatological opponent called the Beast, which is mortally wounded and then miraculously heals.Minear, P.S. \\"The Wounded Beast,\\" Journal of Biblical Literature 72.2 (1953), 93–101. The number of the Beast, 666 or 616, depending on the manuscript, has been identified by some as the numerical value of the letters in Nero's name.Sanders, H. A. \\"The Number of the Beast in Revelation,\\" Journal of Biblical Literature 37.1/2 (1918), 95–99. Nero also appears more explicitly in this role in the Ascension of Isaiah and some of the books of the Sibylline Oracles. Owing to these prophecies and others, Nero was long thought to be the Antichrist. First Impostor The first Pseudo-Nero appeared in the autumn of 68 AD or the early winter of 69 AD in the Roman province of Achaia, today modern Greece. Nero had recently visited Greece (66–67 AD) to participate in its Panhellenic Games, and this may account for some of the support the impostor received.Bradley, K. \\"The Chronology of Nero's Visit to Greece A.D. 66/67,\\" Latomus 37 (1978), 61–72. Tacitus attributed the whole phenomenon to the gullibility and restive nature of the Greeks, whom he seems to have disliked.Tacitus, Histories 2.8 The impostor, according to Tacitus, was either a slave from Pontus, or a freedman from Italy. The historian does not reveal much about the early career of the impostor, except to say that the Pseudo-Nero gathered around him a group of army deserters and then set out to sea. The impostor's group was blown by storm to the island of Kythnos, one of the lesser islands of the Cyclades, which had only one community worthy of the appellation polis in antiquity—the city of Cythnus. Here he supposedly engaged in piracy by waylaying merchants, stealing their cargo, and arming their slaves. Cythnus was long known as a popular base for pirates. The false Nero also made appeals to bring Roman soldiers en route to Italy over to his growing armed force. Nero's successor Galba probably assigned Lucius Nonius Calpurnius Asprenas with the task of hunting down the impostor on his way to take up the governorship of the province of Galatia and Pamphylia.Tacitus, Histories 2.9, for Asprenas see PIR² N 132 With information provided by naval captains that the Pseudo-Nero had attempted to seduce to his side, Asprenas ordered his soldiers to storm the ship and kill the impostor. Asprenas then sent the head of the impostor on a tour of Asia and then on to Rome. Second Impostor The second pseudo-Nero appeared during the reign of Titus. He was an Asiatic named Terentius Maximus and also sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero. He gained a great number of followers across the Euphrates to Parthia. He later fled to Parthia and tried to gain their support by claiming that they owed him some requital for the return of Armenia. Artabanus III, the Parthian King, out of anger towards Titus, both received him and made preparations to restore him to Rome.Cassius Dio, Roman History LXVI.19.3 He was executed when his true identity was revealed. Third Impostor The third pseudo-Nero appeared twenty years after Nero's death, during the reign of Domitian. Supported by the Parthians, they hardly could be persuaded to give him up and the matter almost came to war. Lindsey Davis wrote The Third Nero, a historical novel, based on this episode.

Historically, Lombard Street and Fenchurch Street were the principal streets, forming the cores of the ward's West and East divisions respectively. Boundary changes in 2003 and 2013 have resulted in most of the northern sides of these streets remaining in Langbourn, whilst the southern sides are now largely in the wards of Candlewick, Bridge, Billingsgate and Tower. Three changes to the boundaries of Langbourn took place in 2013; all of the southern side of Lombard Street, with the notable exception of the guild - or ward - church of St Mary Woolnoth, is in Candlewick (from 2003 to 2013 Candlewick extended only to Abchurch Lane); the ward of Walbrook now includes the northern side of Lombard Street from number 68 to Bank junction. In turn, Langbourn expanded by taking another part of Leadenhall Market, from Lime Street ward.

The lobby group was formed to counterbalance British influences in the United States Congress and government, at a time when Northern Ireland was engulfed in violence. The situation was complicated, as Britain and the USA were allied in NATO during the Cold War against the Soviet Union, which collaborated with some Irish republican elements. In the 1976 presidential race, Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter approached the INC in an effort to attract votes from a group, stating his belief that \\"it is a mistake for our country's government to stand quiet on the struggle of the Irish for peace, for the respect of human rights, and for unifying Ireland.\\" On election, Carter did take a stronger position in the conflict.

An educational charity, the Alliance represents the interests of over 14,000 member settings who deliver care and learning to over 800,000 families every year. The Alliance employs over 2,000 national and local staff and is supported by more than 750 volunteers every year. They directly contribute towards the care and well-being of very young children and their families in England. A registered charity, the Alliance was established by parent volunteers in 1961 and has grown significantly since then. The Alliance believes that children learn best through play and first-hand child- led experiences, involving exploration and discovery, which encourage their development and learning. Families are involved in every aspect of service planning and delivery and they encourage parental involvement through consultation, parent-led fundraising events, open days, outings and family learning. Early days In 1961 a reader of the Manchester Guardian, Belle Tutaev, pointed out the inadequacy of state-provided nursery education in the UK. She set up her own playgroup by co-operating with a neighbour. Her suggested Nursery School Campaign resulted the formation of the Pre-School Playgroups Association (PPA) on 16 July 1962.Changing Curriculum for Early Childhood Education in EnglandElizabeth Wilson, Only Halfway to Paradise: women in postwar Britain, 1945-1968 (1980), p. 183; Internet Archive.

He initially studied law at the University of Vienna, but turned to studying music at the Academy for Church Music in Klosterneuburg, and made a name for himself when his Great Mass in D major premiered in Linz in 1913. After participating in World War I, Dostal worked as the theatre Kapellmeister in Innsbruck, St. Pölten, Vienna, Chernivtsi and Salzburg, before moving to Berlin in 1924, where he turned his hand to secular music. He worked in music publishing and as a freelance arranger for Oscar Straus, Franz Lehár and Robert Stolz, among others. Whilst working as a Kapellmeister and composer, Dostal wrote the music for the film The Emperor's Waltz (1933) and enjoyed great success with his first operetta Clivia. This was followed by Die Vielgeliebte (1934) (The Much-Loved), Die ungarische Hochzeit (1939) (The Hungarian Wedding), and numerous pieces of film music.

Watson also recorded as Jimmy Watson, Sunny Jim and Rev. Alfred Pitts. He may have been the earliest-born blues performer to record. Many of his recordings were jug band duets with his wife, Sarah Watson, who was usually credited as Mississippi Sarah. Life Watson was born in Mobile, Alabama. His career began before 1900 in Mexico as a twelve- string guitarist in early mariachi bands. He then established himself as an entertainer with the Rabbit's Foot Minstrels touring around the southern states.Nigel Williamson, Rough Guide to the Blues, 2007, By the 1920s, he was working as a one-man band on Maxwell Street in Chicago, where he acquired the name \\"Daddy Stovepipe\\" from the characteristic top hat he wore. He first recorded in 1924, in Richmond, Indiana, recording \\"Sundown Blues\\" which is regarded as one of the most primitive blues on record. In 1927 he made more recordings, this time in Birmingham, Alabama for Gennett Records, as one half of the duo \\"Sunny Jim and Whistlin' Joe\\". He made more recordings back in Chicago in 1931 for the Vocalion label with his wife, \\"Mississippi Sarah\\", a singer and jug player. The couple's humorous banter made their recordings unique. They recorded together again in 1935 for Bluebird Records, by which time they were living in Greenville, Mississippi, but Sarah's death in 1937 sent her husband back out on the road. He then worked for a while around Texas, playing in cajun bands and, again, with Mexican mariachi bands. By 1948 he had returned to work as a street musician in Chicago, and was recorded in 1960, aged 93, with his repertoire having widened to include traditional popular music tunes such as \\"The Tennessee Waltz\\". He died in Chicago in 1963, from bronchial pneumonia after a gall bladder operation, aged 96. On May 5, 2012 the fifth annual White Lake Blues Festival took place at the Howmet Playhouse Theater in Whitehall, Michigan. The event was organized by Steve Salter of the nonprofit organization Killer Blues to raise monies to honor Watson's unmarked grave with a headstone.

Biography Joseph Alexander Gilfillan was born October 23, 1838, in Gorticross, County Londonderry, Ireland to Alexander Gilfillan and his wife Margaret. He married Harriet Woodbridge Cook April 19, 1877. He graduated from the General Theological Seminary, New York, in 1869. From 1869 until 1873 he was rector successively of two English churches in Minnesota. From June, 1873, until, September, 1908, he served as missionary to the Ojibwas at White Earth. He worked diligently and earnestly to learn the Ojibwe language, to ascertain and record the origins of place names in the areas where he worked, to perform accurate and worthy translations of the Ojibwe place names into English, and to encourage that the names so recorded continue to be used in one form or another after settlement. Gilfillan's work was cited frequently by Warren Upham in his remarkable history of place names in Minnesota, \\"Minnesota Place Names, A Geographical Encyclopedia.\\" Upham characterized Gilfillan's paper \\"Minnesota Geographical Names Derived from the Chippewa Language\\" as one of the two \\"most important resources of information on Minnesota geographic terms of Indian origin.\\" His wife Harriet considered life at White Earth a hardship, and often spent winters socializing in New York, occasionally in Europe. Gilfillan retired in 1908 and went to Washington, D.C. He was the chief editor of the 1911 Ojibwa edition of the Book of Common Prayer entitled \\"Iu Wejibuewisi Mamawi Anamiawini Mazinaigun\\" (\\"Iw Wejibwewizi Maamawi- anami'aawini Mazina'igan\\"). Gilfillan died in New York City on November 18, 1913, after a year's illness. The Minnesota Historical Society keeps a vast inventory of articles and reminiscences by Gilfillan and his wife Harriet on their missionary work; Gilfillan's translations of Ojibwe personal and place names and legends; letters (1883–1893) in Ojibwe from Ojibwe ministers and missionaries, with Gilfillan's translations; miscellaneous letters and memorabilia on Ojibwe language and culture and on church affairs; family and genealogical data; information on the erection of a monument to Gilfillan in Itasca State Park (1940); and articles by Harriet describing her work as a teacher of weaving among the Navaho Indians in 1875 and a trip on the Cumberland Canal.

Geography In chronostratigraphy, the British sub-stage of the Carboniferous period, the 'Arundian' derives its name from Hobbyhorse Bay in the Castlemartin communityarundo being the Latin for hobby horse.Harland, W.B. 1990 A Geologic Time Scale 1989, Cambridge University Press, p43 Castlemartin has of coastline, much of it consisting of spectacular limestone cliffs characterised by large sea caves, natural arches and stacks.  History  Pembrokeshire showing Castlemartin Hundred The village of Castlemartin was in the ancient Hundred of the same name, once centred on a prominent Norman motte-and-bailey castle giving, with the church dedicated to St Martin, the origin of the name.Charles, B. G., The Placenames of Pembrokeshire, National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1992, , p 678 Like other places in southern Pembrokeshire, Castlemartin has been mainly English- speaking for 900 years or more. A 1583 map in the British Library shows Castlemartin parish as Castlemerten. The census population of Castlemartin was 496 (1801): 528 (1851): 460 (1901): 243 (1951): 147 (2001). During the 20th century, much of the land in the community area was cleared by the government for use as an artillery range: Castlemartin Training Area, with its base at Merrion, in Warren. Here, the Pembrokeshire Coast Path has to run inland; by- passing many interesting sections of cliff, although sometimes access may be offered to Flimston. In 2011, the MoD opened up a special diversionary route which was safer for walkers by protecting them from the range fire and preventing them for having to negotiate narrow country roads with fast moving traffic. Castlemartin community amalgamated with Stackpole community in 2012, forming Stackpole and Castlemartin community. Parish church St Michael's Church The parish church of St Michael is a Grade I listed building. It contains a cross-inscribed stone pillar of the 7th century-9th century.

In August 1971 he was arrested in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, after a demonstration, because he intervened to stop the police beating up a young boy. The police stopped beating the boy, and, instead, arrested him. In the following court proceedings he was sentenced to a fine of £20 and proclaimed: > \\"I refused to recognize the Court because it has no legitimate authority. > But that is only the “tip of the iceberg. I do not, I never have and I never > will recognize the colonial State of British Occupied Ireland. This State > exists because of a morally and politically criminal action.

Therefore, its institutions, its laws, and its > legal and political expressions are invalid.” In 1972, McManus was sent to serve as a priest in the United States, owing to his continued activism about injustice in Northern Ireland. In 1974, he founded the Irish National Caucus (INC), a group formed to lobby the United States Congress on behalf of the cause of justice and peace in Northern Ireland. McManus formed the organization around principles promulgated by the 1971 Synod of Bishops in their document \\"Justice in the World\\" which states: \\"Action on behalf of justice ... [is] a constitutive dimension of the preaching of the Gospel ... and [a constitutive of dimension] of the Church's mission for the redemption of the human race and [for] its liberation from every oppressive situation.\\" The INC has developed a solid reputation within Congress, with Ben Gilman, former Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, stating, \\"No one has done more than Father McManus to keep the U.S. Congress on track regarding justice and peace in Ireland. Indeed, I believe historians will record that no one since John Devoy (1842 – 1928) has done more to organize American pressure for justice in Ireland. The only difference being that Father McManus – in keeping with his priestly calling – is committed to nonviolence.\\" In 2011, McManus was chosen to serve on the World Peace Prize Awarding Council (WPPAC). The South Korea-based Council consists of twelve international and interfaith members. In 2013, McManus was selected to be the Chief Judge of WPPAC. = The MacBride Principles = The MacBride Principles—a corporate code of conduct for American companies doing business in Northern Ireland was launched by the Irish National Caucus on November 4, 1984.

The Principles became law in 18 U.S. states and numerous towns and cities. In October 1998, the MacBride Principles were passed by both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives and signed into the U.S. law. Chairman Gilman took to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to welcome this singular achievement, saying: \\"I want to make a special note regarding Father Sean McManus.

He is a native of Shanghai. Hu first won the Chinese National Xiangqi Championship in 1960 at age 15, the youngest record ever. Hu went on to win the next nine consecutive national championships, which gave him a 10-championship streak from 1960 to 1979. (Due to the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese National Xiangqi Competition was not held annually during that period). In the 1980s, he won the national championship in 1983 and 1985. By the mid 1990s, people thought that he was past his prime, and that younger generations of top players would eventually replace him. However, he won yet again in 1997 and another in 2000. See here for the complete list of national champions. Thus, Hu Ronghua holds the record for the greatest number of national titles (14), the youngest champion (age 15 in 1960), and the oldest champion (age 55 in 2000) in the history of xiangqi. Hu has been advocating for a revival of xiangqi. In 2011, Hu launched a reality show called Let's Play Chess to find a new apprentice. Hu made great contributions to xiangqi theory, including pioneer work on the elephant opening (飞相局) and the Back-Palace-Knight (反宫马) opening. The Hu Rule of Xiangqi： Hu devised a new xiangqi rule, that is, the chance of playing black is obtained by auctions of two players. The player who offers less time wins the auction. If the game finally ends in a draw, black wins. The Hu Rule is aimed at eliminating negative draw games and making xiangqi more spectator- friendly. However, the Hu Rule is boycotted by professional players after one year of its birth. Besides xiangqi, Hu also has many other interests. In his early years, he was trained for a short period in weiqi (Go). He also plays a game called daguailuzi (大怪路子)， a popular local game of Shanghai.

Description In it Benedict takes notes of the economic hardship and moral laxity occasioned by the recent World War, and cautions about \\"the advent of a universal republic, which is based on the absolute equality of men and the communion of goods, and in which there is no longer any distinction of nationality, does not recognize the authority of the father upon the children, nor the public authorities and citizens, nor of God on the men in civilian consortium. All things which, if implemented, would lead to terrible social convulsions, like that already happening now in no small part of Europe.\\"Pope Benedict XV, \\"Bonum Sane\\", July 25, 1920 He proposed that instead of being drawn to socialism, \\"the sworn enemy of Christian principles\\", working men should follow Saint Joseph as their guide and special patron. Benedict quoted his predecessor, Leo XIII: He emphasized that the family is the \\"core and basis\\" of human society, and encouraged families to be guided by the example of the Holy Family. Benedict affirmed that strengthening the domestic society with purity, harmony and fidelity, would not only effect an improvement in private morals, but also in the life of the community. Referencing the practices of honoring St. Joseph during the month of March, and on Wednesdays, he called on the bishops to promote veneration of Saint Joseph.

Commissioned in 1942, the boat had an uneventful first war patrol in the Alboran Sea. She intercepted the Vichy French merchant ship SS Mitidja in July, then provided protection for an Allied convoy to Malta in Operation Pedestal the next month. The navy intended that she was to be sighted on the surface by enemy aircraft to discourage potential attacks by surface warships. Though P222 did not encounter enemy forces, the convoy arrived at its destination on 15 August after sustaining severe losses. She then reconnoitred along the coast of Algeria in advance of Operation Torch, and was attacked by a French patrol ship, but sustained no damage. On 30 November, P222 departed Gibraltar to patrol off Naples, Italy, but failed to return at Algiers. The Italian torpedo boat Fortunale claimed to have sunk a submarine with depth charges on 12 December, south-east of Capri. This remains the most probable cause of her loss, although the sinking has never been confirmed. Design and description The S-class submarines were intended to patrol the restricted waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The third batch were slightly enlarged and improved over the preceding second batch of the S class. The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a draught of . They displaced on the surface and submerged.Akermann, p. 341 The S-class submarines had a crew of 48 officers and ratings. They had a diving depth of .McCartney, p. 7 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater.Bagnasco, p. 110 On the surface, the third-batch boats had a range of at and at submerged. P222 was armed with six 21-inch torpedo tubes in the bow. She carried six reload torpedoes for the bow tubes for a grand total of a dozen torpedoes. Twelve mines could be carried in lieu of the torpedoes. The boat was also equipped with a 3-inch (76 mm) deck gun.Chesneau, pp. 51–52 The third-batch S-class boats were fitted with either a Type 129AR or 138 ASDIC system and a Type 291 or 291W early-warning radar.Akermann, pp. 341, 345 Construction and career Ordered on 4 April 1940 as part of the 1940 Naval Programme, P222 was laid down on 10 August by Vickers Armstrong at their shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness. She was launched on 20 September 1941. On 2 May 1942, she shifted from the builder's yard to Holy Loch, where she was commissioned two days later. The submarine was lost before a name could be given to her, she is known as \\"P222\\", her pennant number.Akermann, p. 347 After undergoing training, P222 arrived at Elderslie on 25 May, then sailed for Kames Bay on 1 June. From 2 to 12 June, she conducted exercises off the Clyde River area, then sailed to Gibraltar along with , arriving there on 23 June. On 29 and 30 June, she conducted training exercises off Gibraltar with several other British ships. P222 then departed on 2 July for her first war patrol, in the Alboran Sea. She returned to port on 10 July, having sighted no enemy ships. After additional exercises, she departed Gibraltar again on 18 July with orders to patrol off the west coast of Sardinia. Her orders were changed on 23 July to intercept the Vichy French merchant ship off Cape Palos, Spain. Three days later, P222 successfully intercepted and boarded her target, which was then escorted to Gibraltar by . On 28 July, the boat returned to port, ending her second war patrol. P222 departed Gibraltar on 2 August for a patrol in the Sicilian Channel, with additional orders to provide cover for Operation Pedestal, a British convoy to carry supplies to Malta. On 13 August, along with seven other Royal Navy submarines, she accompanied the convoy on the surface; the intent was that the submarines would be sighted by enemy aircraft and discourage potential attacks from enemy warships. Though the boat did not encounter enemy forces, the convoy operation was a British strategic success, and P222 returned to Gibraltar on 22 August. After an uneventful patrol from 1 to 19 September, the boat was ordered to conduct reconnaissance along landing beaches east of Oran, in preparation for the Allied landings in North Africa. On 8 November, she was attacked by a Vichy French , which dropped several depth charges but caused no damage. P222 returned to port on 19 November 1942. P222 left Gibraltar to patrol off Naples on 30 November. She sent a number of messages on 7 December, but after that date no further communication was received. She failed to arrive at Algiers on her due date and was reported overdue on 21 December. The Italian torpedo boat Fortunale claimed to have sunk a submarine with depth charges on 12 December, south-east of Capri. This remains the most probable cause of the submarine's loss, but there has been no confirmation. Her wreck was claimed to have been found off Cape Negro, Tunisia, by a Belgian amateur diver, but that has not been confirmed. This last claim can be dismissed as signals to and from the submarine clearly show she was following a route that skirted the coast of southern Sardinia and thus could not have strayed in Tunisian waters.ADM199/2252 and ADM199/2253, TNA Notes References  * External links * HMS P222 at Uboat.net * SUBMARINE LOSSES 1904 TO PRESENT DAY British S-class submarines (1931) Royal Navy ship names Ships built in Barrow-in-Furness 1941 ships World War II submarines of the United Kingdom Lost submarines of the United Kingdom Ships lost with all hands Missing submarines of World War II Maritime incidents in December 1942 Submarines sunk by Italian warships ","title":"HMS P222"},{"id":"13165508","text":"Coat-of-arms of Capetids.

As a result of winning the show in its second season, his character is the subject of a Dark Horse Comics comic book written by Jeremy Barlow with art by Kajo Baldisimo and appeared in a Sci Fi Channel original movie entitled Lightning Strikes in 2009.  Fictional character biography  The Defuser is an expert paramilitary superhero who uses non-lethal weaponry and gadgets to stop villains. He has the unique ability to function at 110 percent (this boosts his speed, strength, agility, reflexes, hearing, and eyesight) making him slightly more formidable than virtually any single foe. He has a night vision to a range of 60 feet. The Defuser is susceptible to bright light (he must wear protective eyewear or he risks being blinded). He does not harm his foes severely with weapons. His archenemies are drug dealers. His catchphrase is, \\"When the Defuser's around, the bad guys are going down!\\" In The Defuser's Dark Horse comic, he fought a plane full of hijackers hand-to-hand to save the passengers, which included his wife Norma. He also, with the help of a sympathetic robot cop, disabled an artificial intelligence determined to preserve its own existence by destroying him.

Scare for a Cure started as a haunted house that Jarrett put on in his back yard, asking for donations of canned food for local food banks. It grew year by year, with help from the drama troupes of local high schools. In 2007, shortly after winning the Who Wants to Be a Superhero reality show, Jarrett moved his production to the Austin Elk's lodge. That was when he was joined by many of the volunteers who had done Britannia Manor and Haunted Trails in years past. Props and costumes stored at the Wild Basin wilderness preserve were also given to SCARE for a CURE. The resulting interactive haunted adventure raised close to $10,000 for breast cancer charities and Elk's club sponsored scholarships in 2007, and awarded four $2500 scholarships to deserving students adversely affected by cancer in 2008.

It is served by Amtrak's Coast Starlight passenger train and is the southern terminus of the Amtrak Cascades corridor. The station is also served by the Cascades POINT bus service. History The station was built in 1908 by the Southern Pacific Railroad and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Southern Pacific Passenger Depot in 2007. The current station is the third passenger depot built at this location. Built of masonry, it is one of five masonry depots that still exist along the original Southern Pacific West Coast line. The other depots are in Albany, Medford, Roseburg and Salem. When Amtrak took over intercity rail operations in 1971, it cut back service to a single train through Eugene, what eventually became the Coast Starlight. A brief attempt at corridor service began in 1980 with the Willamette Valley, but ended in 1981. For the next 13 years, the only intercity service through Eugene was the Coast Starlight, which arrived northbound at lunchtime and southbound during the afternoon rush. However, in 1994, Amtrak extended the Seattle-Portland Mount Rainier to Eugene on a trial basis. This proved successful enough that the train was renamed the Cascadia in 1995. The Cascadia was merged into Amtrak Cascades along with all of Amtrak's other Pacific Northwest services in 1998, and a Portland-Eugene round trip was added in 2000. Southern Pacific sold the building to the Jenova Land Company in 1993, and ten years later the city of Eugene bought the depot as part of a plan to develop a regional transportation center. In 2004, the city oversaw a $4.5 million restoration project. Workers restored the exterior brickwork and trim and gutted and renovated the interior. New tile floors, oak and fir trim, covered ceilings, wooden benches and expanded bathrooms were installed.

Along with several other young painters, he challenged the spirit of academism that was prevalent at the Academy and in 1863 left it to become a freelance painter, joining the Peredvizhniki movement in 1876. In 1868, Litovchenko was recognized as an academician for his picture of a falconer serving at the court of Tsar Alexis (one of his several versions of the subject). Among his larger paintings, Ivan the Terrible Showing His Treasures to Jerome Horsey (1875) was purchased by the Tsar for the Alexander III Museum in St. Petersburg, and Tsar Alexis and Archbishop Nikon Venerating the Relics of Patriarch Philip (1886) was acquired by Pavel Tretyakov for his collection in Moscow (as were the finest of his portraits).

Main information The , gauge network is electrified at 3 kV DC. Now the railways in Armenia are operated by South Caucasus Railway of Russian Railways. The railway operating environment in Armenia sharply deteriorated following the collapse of the Soviet Union. According to the World Bank, Armenian Railways was in dramatic need of major investment, including the replacement of rolling stock, rehabilitation of the main line between Yerevan and the Georgian border, renewal of electrification, and bridge reconstruction. Rail transport was slow and unreliable, and traffic remained low compared to European countries with similar sized networks, amounting to only 2.6 million tons of freight and 0.85 million passengers in 2004. At present the only preexisting rail connection between Armenia and Iran is the line which passes through the autonomous region of Nakhchivan, an exclave of Azerbaijan. However, because the border between the two countries is closed, the line from Yerevan is operational only as far as Yeraskh.  Armenian Railways Concession to Russian Railways thumbIn 2007, the government of Armenia conducted a tender process for the modernization and operation of Armenian Railways, with the intention of awarding a concession in 2008. RITES and Russian Railways qualified to bid but RITES, an Indian Railways company, later withdrew. Russian Railways was the only bidder and established South Caucasus Railway CJSC as a wholly owned subsidiary to run the former Armenian Railways. On 1 June 2008, South Caucasus Railway officially commenced its modernization and operation program and, as part of the concession agreement, received assets owned by Armenian Railways consisting of 2,000 freight cars, 58 passenger coaches, 85 locomotives and 30 electric trains. All 4,300 personnel formerly employed by Armenian Railways retained their jobs. The concession agreement was concluded for 30 years, with a right of extension for another 20 years after the first 20 years of operation.  Armenia-Iran Railway Concession to Rasia FZE (Southern Armenia Railway or North-South Railway Corridor)  On July 28, 2012, a concession agreement was awarded to Dubai-based Rasia FZE (a Rasia Group investment company) for the feasibility, design, financing, construction and operation of a new railway link between Armenia and Iran having an operating period of 30 years, with a right of extension for another 20 years. The Armenia-Iran railway is called the Southern Armenia Railway project, which forms the key missing link in the International North-South Transport Corridor between the Black Sea and the Persian Gulf. Prior to the feasibility study being completed, the Southern Armenia Railway was anticipated to be a 316 km railway linking Gavar, 50 km east of Yerevan near Lake Sevan, with the Iranian border near Meghri. On 24 January 2013, during an announcement and press conference, the Chairman of Rasia Group, Joseph K. Borkowski, announced the previously signed Southern Armenia Railway concession agreement as well as the concession agreement for the southern section of the North-South Road Corridor. A separate tripartite memorandum of understanding was signed in Yerevan by Rasia FZE, Russian Railways (RZD) subsidiary South Caucasus Railway, and the government of the Republic of Armenia concerning technical cooperation, investment, and the future operation of the Southern Armenia Railway. Rasia FZE announced its appointment of China Communications Construction Company as the \\"lead member of the development consortium\\" for the project and the commencement of the feasibility study. Following a meeting on 3 September 2013 with Serzh Sargsyan, the President of Armenia, President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation stated that Russian Railways can invest about RUB 15 billion in the development of the Armenian Railway. In mid-September 2013, Rasia FZE announced in a meeting with Armenian Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan the achievement of a key milestone for the Southern Armenia Railway, including the release of a highly favorable feasibility study and the recommended railway design route from China Communications Construction Company. Having reached this key milestone, Rasia FZE moved to secure essential regional cooperation for the financing, construction and operation stages of the project. The feasibility study results indicated that the Southern Armenia Railway would cost approximately US $3.5 billion to construct, have a length of 305 kilometers from Gagarin to Agarak, and provide a base operating capacity of 25 million tons per annum. The railway will have 84 bridges spanning 19.6 kilometers and 60 tunnels of 102.3 kilometers, comprising 40% of the total project length. As the key missing link in the International North- South Transport Corridor, the Southern Armenia Railway would create the shortest transportation route from the ports of the Black Sea to the ports of the Persian Gulf. The Southern Armenia Railway would establish a major commodities transit corridor between Europe and the Persian Gulf region, based on traffic volume forecasts of 18.3 million tons per annum. At completion of railway construction and commencement of operations, transport costs and times for the region are expected to improve substantially, fostering greater regional trade and economic growth with extraordinary direct benefits for the Armenian economy including an alleviation of the economic pressures caused by the illegal Sahakyan, Armen \\"Economic Blockades and International Law: The Case of Armenia\\", 20 February 2014. armenianweekly.com border blockade against Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan. On 24 October 2013, the Armenia-Iran railway was brought up for public discussion for the first time by the Armenian National Security Council on grounds of regional security and it was recently declared a priority project. Arthur Baghdasaryan, Secretary of the Armenian National Security Council, added that the project for the construction of the railway to Iran, as well as the reopening of the railway to Abkhazia represent strategic elements of the Armenian Security Plan 2014–2017.  South Caucasus Railway  South Caucasus Railway elaborated on the work already completed in Armenia in support of a North-South Transport Corridor including, during the period between 2008 and 2012, an investment program exceeding US$225 million, which was allocated by Russian Railways. During this time, as a part of the infrastructure modernization program, more than 300 km of track, 160 technological objects, 33 artificial structures, 130 km of contact network, and 140 km of power lines were repaired. In 2012, three major railway bridges that were built in 1898 were commissioned including the Zamanlinsky bridge, the Satanikamurj bridge, and the bridge on the Kober-Tumanian span. Infrastructure improvements over the past four years have now allowed for the increase of substantial traffic volumes. Expansion of the railway network of Armenia and increased mining activity in Armenia are creating new jobs, economic growth, and increases in traffic volume. During the calendar year 2013, South Caucasus Railway transported 3.2752 million tons of cargo and 415.4 thousand passengers. The cargo volumes comprised 0.456 million tons of exports, 1.2607 million tons of imports, and 1.5585 million tons of local traffic. This cargo comprised 1.3 million tons of non-ferrous ore, 0.455 million tons of grain, 0.2768 million tons of oil loads, 0.1335 million tons of building materials, and 0.1102 million tons of cement.

Early life and career Roberson grew up near Dallas, Texas, and attended the University of Texas, Austin. Graduating with a degree in English literature and a minor in history, he held a variety of jobs - including seven years as a product support engineer for Dell computers - before quitting his job in 2003 to launch small press MonkeyBrain Books. He cites his upbringing in the 1970s and 1980s, as his major inspiration, since science fiction was particular commonplace in America at that time, saying: > \\"Everything from Saturday-morning cartoons to comic books to late-night > B-movies to pulp novel reprints to blockbuster summer movies--it was all > science fiction, in one form or another.\\"Tobias S. Buckell interview with > Chris Roberson for The Eternal Night . Accessed on the 21st of January, 2008 After college, he has suggested that he leaned towards becoming a more literary, post-modernist writer, even writing a couple of novels to that end, which he says will never see the light of day, after realising that he simply \\"wasn't depressed enough for that line of work\\". In his twenties, he wrote a couple of mystery novels, seeing them as a commercial venture, but found himself skirting around turning them into 'genre' titles, falling between the two camps of mystery and science fiction, and interesting publishers of neither. Ultimately he settled on writing science fiction, saying: > \\"My brain tends to work along the lines of science fiction tropes. Whenever > I run into an odd little bit of trivia, some obscure historical fact or odd > scientific principle, I can't help but start thinking of ways I could use it > in a story.\\" His writings have received positive reviews from Locus Magazine, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Asimov's Science Fiction, The New York Review of Science Fiction, Infinity Plus and RevolutionSF. After many years in Austin, Texas, he relocated to Portland, Oregon, with his wife (Allison Baker) and their young daughter, Georgia.Locus Online excerpts from an interview with Roberson, published in Locus Magazine's May 2005 issue. Accessed January 21, 2008 Clockwork Storybook From 1998 to 2002, Roberson was part of writer's collective Clockwork Storybook, alongside noted comics author Bill Willingham (Fables), Matthew Sturges (co-writing with Willingham of Jack of Fables) and Mark Finn (Robert E. Howard scholar and playwright). Starting as a writing group, CWSB became an online monthly anthology, and then a publishing imprint of the same name. Roberson produced four novels under CWSB, as the collective attempted to capitalise on the Print On Demand revolution. This ultimately fell through, and the four went their separate ways. Two (to date) of Roberson's CWSB books have been subsequently expanded and reprinted. Any Time At All (Sep, 2002) became Here, There & Everywhere (Pyr, 2005), and Set The Seas On Fire (Dec, 2001) was expanded for its April, 2007 release by Solaris. Voices of Thunder (Feb, 2001) has been revised to become Book Of Secrets for upcoming publication by Angry Robot in August, 2009. Post-Clockwork works Focusing, after the demise of Clockwork Storybook, on his writing, Roberson sold a short story (his first professional sale) to Roc anthology Live Without a Net, under the editorship of Lou Anders. It was published in 2003, and paved the way for future sales to Asimov's Science Fiction and other anthologies. In 2004, Anders, (by now considered by Roberson \\"something of a personal patron\\") by now an editorial director at Prometheus Books' new SF imprint Pyr, bought an expanded version of one of Roberson's CWSB books Any Time At All, which was published in 2005 as Here, There & Everywhere. In 2003, having \\"discovered.. in the few years of helping run the CWSB imprint, that [he] really enjoyed being a publisher,\\" Roberson started up his own imprint. Partly this move was inspired by the dissolution of CWSB, and Roberson having discovered a few projects by writers that he had wanted to bring out under that banner. He decided, however, that MonkeyBrain Books would deal exclusively in \\"traditional offset trade-paperbacks and hardcovers,\\" distributed internationally, rather than printed on demand.Infinity Plus interview with Chris Roberson. Accessed January 21, 2008 He has also contributed several stories to the annual Tales of the Shadowmen anthologies. He is preparing a series aimed at the Young Adult audience, entitled Celestial Empire, with the first collection subtitled Fire Star. Roberson has also written short stories for such magazines as Asimov's Science Fiction, Postscripts, Black October, Fantastic Metropolis, RevolutionSF, Twilight Tales, Opi8, Alien Skin, Electric Velocipede, Subterranean and Lone Star Stories. He is editor of the Adventure anthology series, first published by MonkeyBrain in November, 2005. Roberson is also writing books for Black Library publishing; Dawn of War II, published March 2009, and Sons of Dorn, which came out in early 2010. MonkeyBrain Since 2003, he is the publisher (along with his business partner and spouse Allison Baker) of MonkeyBrain Books, an independent publishing house naturally based in Austin, Texas, which specialises in genre fiction and nonfiction genre studies. In November, 2005, Roberson edited the first volume in a projected annual series of Adventure anthologies, comprising \\"original fiction in the spirit of early twentieth-century pulp fiction magazines\\" across the genres, featuring contributions from (among others) Lou Anders, Paul Di Filippo, Mark Finn, Michael Moorcock and Kim Newman.

Lectures of Professor William Cleghorn', Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections Division. Cleghorn: David Hume's rival Cleghorn is primarily remembered for being a rival of the more famous philosopher David Hume. In 1744 and 1745, Hume and Cleghorn were competing candidates for the position of Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. Hume was arguably the better of the two candidates. He is clearly of greater historical importance. However, the town council appointed Cleghorn to the position on 5 June 1745. Hume was an atheist, and it is known that many of the ministers of Edinburgh opposed his appointment to the Chair's position, and petitioned the town council, describing Hume as amoral, an atheist, and a sceptic. It has been suggested that a clique of people who disliked Hume's personal beliefs arranged for Cleghorn to be given the Chair's position at the University. However, some historians believe that Cleghorn was appointed to the position, not because of rivalry based on personal beliefs, but rather because of rivalry between two competing schools of thought on moral philosophy. Cleghorn and Adam Ferguson Cleghorn was a friend, and probably also teacher, of Adam Ferguson. It is thought that one of the characters in Ferguson's philosophical work Dialogue on a Highland Jaunt is based on Cleghorn.Mossner, Ernest Campbell. 1963. 'Adam Ferguson's \\"Dialogue on a Highland Jaunt\\" with Robert Adam, William Cleghorn, David Hume, and William Wilkie'. In Carroll Camden (ed.), Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Literature. Chicago: University of Chicago Press: 297–308 It has also been claimed that Cleghorn recommended, shortly before his death, that Ferguson be given the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy once he had died. Ferguson was not given the Chair at this time, although he was given it later. Notes Bibliography *Cleghorn, William. 1746–1747. ' Lectures of Professor William Cleghorn'.

It also borders the town of Ihringen. The valley of Achkarren faces west and is 5 km from the Rhine river and 7 km from Breisach. The German temperature hotspot (highest average temperature) is located between the center of Achkarren and the town of Ihringen.  History  The first documented reference of Achkarren happened in 1064 AD when the village was given to the cloister of Ottmarsheim (a small Town in Alsace) by King Heinrich IV. Based on archeological artifacts the village could have been settled as early as two thousand years ago. The omnipresent wine terraces might have first been established during the settlement by the Alemanni from 260 AD on. The name \\"Achkarren\\" is deduced from the old high German \\"haz karle\\" (Hate Charles), supposedly the name of an early settler from the neighboring village of Oberrotweil. Town folks tell a tale about the origin of the name of the village: During the construction of the castle Hoehingen on the Schlossberg (Castle Mountain) high about the village an accident occurred. A cart full of building material was pushed up the mountain several times. Every time the cart was close to the summit it escaped and rolled back down into the valley. While watching this unfortunate spectacle the future lord of the castle shouted \\"Ach Karren!\\" (Oh Cart). A first destruction of the castle happened 1525 during the German Peasants' War. After rebuilding the final destruction happened during the Thirty Years' War. The Kaiser's catholic troops destroyed it once they could not hold up the attack from the Swedes. Until today artifacts of ruins can be found. Three years after the 30-year-long war seized the village had only a population of 58 left. This means approximately 70% of population was killed during this war. In 1703 AD, during the siege of Breisach by French troops, the village was completely destroyed. This siege was part of the War of the Spanish Succession. In the chaos of wars between the late medieval and modern times, Achkarren as well as its neighboring towns of Ihringen and Breisach were several times part of France for some years. A quarry is located between the Schlossberg mountain and the Buechsenberg mountain. For the construction of the St. Stephansmuenster (cathedral) in Breisach material from this quarry was used. Recently the quarry was revived in order to repair said cathedral.  Miscellaneous  The vineyards of Achkarren are considered part of the best in Germany. In particular the local Ruländer or Grauburgunder (Pinot grigio) respectively is famous. The vintners cooperative society of Achkarren and the wineries of the village have been receiving many prices for the quality of these wines. Besides the loess soil Achkarren has over 50% of volcanic soil. There are several trails dug into the soil in the Schlossberg as well as the Schneckenberg (Snail Mountain). In these trails one can witness the layers of volcanic rock that is covered with a thin layer of loess at the top. Achkarren contain the nature preserve called Buechsenberg which contains a collection of seldom plants and wildlife. A Museum about winemaking is also located in Achkarren. Further the village boasts a 2.4 km long trail that features the geology of winemaking, its soil, climate, grape variety and the history of winemaking of the Kaisersuhl. Besides wine making, tourism as well as small industrial park in the Rhine Rift are the main businesses of the village.

It is the largest Mughal garden in the Kashmir Valley . Shalimar Bagh, which is also located on the bank of the Dal Lake. ‘Nishat Bagh’ is Urdu, and means the \\"Garden of Joy,\\" \\"Garden of Gladness\\" and \\"Garden of Delight.\\" History Nishat Bagh Mughal Gardens Sunset at Nishat Bagh Mughal Gardens Located on the bank of the Dal Lake, with the Zabarwan Mountains as its backdrop, Nishat Bagh is a garden with views of the lake beneath the Pir Panjal mountain range. The Bagh was designed and built in 1633 by Asif Khan, elder brother of Nur Jehan. An anecdote is told of the jealousy of the Emperor Shah Jahan on beholding such a delightful garden, which led to the abandonment of garden for some time. When Shah Jahan saw the garden, after its completion in 1633, he expressed great appreciation of its grandeur and beauty. He is believed to have expressed his delight three times to Asif Khan, his father-in-law, in the hope that he would make a gift of it to him. As no such offer was forthcoming from Asif Khan, however, Shah Jahan was piqued and ordered that the water supply to the garden should be cut off. Then, for some time, the garden was deserted. Asif Khan was desolate and heartbroken; he was uninterested in the sequence of events. When he was resting under the shade of a tree, in one of the terraces, his servant was bold enough to turn on the water supply source from the Shalimar Bagh. When Asif Khan heard the sound of water and the fountains in action he was startled and immediately ordered the disconnection of the water supply as he feared the worst reaction from the Emperor for this wanton act of disobedience. Fortunately for the servant and for the Khan, Shaha Jahan, who had heard about this incident at the garden, was not disturbed or annoyed by the disobedience of his orders. Instead, he approved of the servant’s loyal service to his master and then ordered the full restoration rights for the supply of water to the garden to Asif Khan, his Prime Minister and father-in-law. The Mughal Princess Zuhra Begum, the daughter of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II, and granddaughter of the Emperor Jahandar Shah, was buried in the garden. Layout Even though the layout of Nishat Bagh was based on the basic conceptual model of the Persian gardens, it had to be remodelled to fit the topographic and water source conditions at the site chosen in the Kashmir valley. The plan, instead of being central with four radiating arms in a square pattern as in the case of Chahar (suited for a flat countryside), was changed to an axial stream flow design to fit the hill condition with water source originating at the top of the hill end. This resulted in planning a rectangular layout rather than a square layout. This helped in dispensing with the long side arms. Thus, a rectangular layout with east-west length of and width of was adopted. Architecture Thus, Nishat Bagh as laid out now is a broad cascade of terraces lined with avenues of chinar and cypress trees, which starts from the lakeshore and reaches up to an artificial façade at the hill end. Rising from the edge of the Dal Lake, it has twelve 12 terraces representing twelve Zodiacal signs. However, it has only two sections, namely the public garden and the private garden for the Zanana or harem vis-à-vis the four sections of the Shalimar Bagh; this difference is attributed to the fact that the latter Bagh catered to the Mughal Emperor, while Nishad Bagh belonged to a man of his court, a noble. There are, however, some similarities with the Shalimar Bagh, such as the polished stone channel and terraces. The source of water supply to the two gardens is the same. Built in an east-west direction, the top terrace has the Zenana garden while the lowest terrace is connected to the Dal Lake. In recent years, the lowest terrace has merged with the approach road. A spring called the Gopi Thirst provides clear water supply to the gardens. There are a few old Mughal period buildings in the vicinity of the Bagh. The central canal, which runs through the garden from the top end, is wide and has a water depth of . Water flows down in a cascade from the top to the first terrace at the road level, which could be also approached from the Dal Lake through a shikara ride. The water flow from one terrace to the next is overstepped stone ramps that provide the sparkle to the flow. At all the terraces fountains with pools are provided, along the water channel. At channel crossings, benches are provided. The twelve terraces Fountains on terraces in Nishat Bagh :The details of the twelve terraces have been recorded as originally built: *The first terrace is a water collection chamber that is also linked to the side flow from the garden. *The second terrace is accessed through a gate. This terrace has five fountains that is supplied water from the third terrace, from where it flowed to the lowest terrace. *The third terrace has a different design. The water chute has five arched open niches in the front and similar niches on the sides. A pavilion (baradari), a two-storied structure, which existed here when it was originally built, has since been dismantled. Stairways, on either side of the channel lead to the third terrace, which has a square chamber with five fountains. Moving up the flight of steps (four steps) on either side of the channel leads to the fourth terrace. *The fourth terrace has two levels namely, a water channel and a square pool. Stairways with 7 steps lead to the fifth terrace. *The fifth terrace, where a stone bench is provided to take in the view across the channel. This also has a square chamber with five fountains. *The sixth terrace is at two levels with five fountains and distinctive paving pattern.t *The seventh terrace, where the same pattern continues. *The eighth terrace is only a water channel or chute. *The ninth terrace, at the end of two stairways, there is an octagonal bench. The pool in this terrace has nine fountains. *The stairways to the tenth terrace are along the side retaining walls where only the water chute with fountains is provided. *Engraved paths lead to an impressive eleventh terrace, which has twenty-five fountains in a pool. Up from this dramatic terrace is the last one. *The Zenana chamber, the twelfth terrace, is covered in the front by high wall with a façade of blind arches. Only one arch in this blind facade provides an opening to the twelfth terrace. Two small octagonal towers on either side of the retaining walls provide views of the lower level terraces. A two-storey pavilion here is surrounded by a lovely garden with lush plantings. Out of all the terraces, the second terrace is considered the most impressive in view of the twenty-three niches provided in the arched recess just behind the cascade. Originally lighted lamps used to be placed at these niches. The second terrace also has an abundance of Persian lilacs and pansies coupled with sparkling cascading water over the chute, which provided a lovely sight. Another interesting feature in the Nishat Bagh is of the many stones and marble thrones that are placed at the head of almost every waterfall.

The Friaries of Medieval London: From Foundation to Dissolution (Woodbridge: Boydell), pp. 121, 126, 130; the rest of the church was used as a storehouse, with the monuments sold for £100 and the lead stripped from the roof. The choir, tower and transepts were demolished in 1600. The nave became the first official nonconformist chapel in England under its Polish-born superintendent John a Lasco (known in Poland as Jan Łaski) who had founded a preaching house for a group of Protestant refugees mainly from the Low Countries. The mostly Dutch and French speaking \\"strangers\\" were granted a royal charter on 24 July 1550 that allowed them to establish a Stranger Church and this was incorporated by letters patent from King Edward VI.Holder, Nick (2011). \\"The Medieval Friaries of London (PhD thesis)\\". University of London. Upon incorporation, the church was named the \\"Temple of the Lord Jesus\\" and had four pastors: two for Dutch and two for the French-Walloon who by the 1580s began using St Anthony's Chapel in Threadneedle Street. By 1570, the Dutch community was the largest group of expatriates in London, numbering 5,000 out of the 100,000 total population of the time. About half of the Dutch in London were Protestants who fled the Flemish Low Countries due to religious persecution. Others were skilled craftsman, including brewers, tile makers, weavers, artists, printers and engravers, who came to England for economic opportunities. Engraver Martin Droeshout, famous for his 1623 portrait of William Shakespeare, was among the Flemish Protestant emigrants who arrived in London. A century later, the arrival of William of Orange brought a second wave of Dutch emigrants to London. This second group included noblemen, bankers, courtiers, merchants, architects and artists. 20th century Interior view towards the East The foundation stone of the new church In the night of 15–16 October 1940, just a decade before the Dutch Church celebrated its 400th anniversary, the medieval building was completely destroyed by German bombs. The church's collection of rare books including Dutch Bibles, atlases and encyclopedias had been moved out of London for safe-keeping one day before the bombing raid that destroyed the building. Today the collection is housed in the church library and includes a multilingual Bible published by the Plantin Press of Antwerp in 1569–1571, and a 1649 atlas of all the cities in the Low Countries by Willem Blaeu. The church's manuscript collection and original charter are kept in the London Metropolitan Archives. The church's library collection is currently being digitalised and a launch date for the online catalogue of September 2015 has been announced. The foundation stone of the new church was laid on 23 July 1950 by the 10-year-old Princess Irene of the Netherlands. The new church, built to the design of Arthur Bailey, was completed in 1954. The new building is a concrete box frame, externally clad in Portland stone. It features 1950s stained glass by Max Nauta, Hugh Ray Easton and William Wilson. The church possesses detailed archives,Guide to the City Churches, Betjeman, J: Andover, Pitkin, 1974 . and is a popular tourist attraction.More details The church was designated a Grade-II listed building on 25 September 1998.

History Lying along both banks of the River Dee, the Lands of Culter originally included the parishes of Peterculter and Maryculter. These were in the jurisdiction of the monks of Kelso. However, about the year 1187, William the Lion granted the portion of the Culter lands on the south bank of the river to the Knights Templar. Between 1221 and 1236 Walter Byset, Lord of Aboyne, founded the Preceptory or College of the Knights Templar on the site of Maryculter House Hotel. The barrel-vaulted basement of the house is said to have formed part of the Preceptor's Lodging. The Templars also built a chapel. This became the parish church in 1535, was abandoned in 1782 and is now a fragmentary ruin, the only architectural feature surviving being the piscina built into the south wall. The chapel and surrounding graveyard are a Scheduled monument. The chapel was replaced as the parish church by Maryculter Trinity Church. The Templars were suppressed around 1309 but their lands and the parish church remained in the hands of the Knights Hospitaller until 1563/64. From 1535 to 1811 Maryculter House was first rented and then owned by the Menzies family of Pitfodels, Aberdeen,, though another source says it was owned by the Lindsay family until 1726. In 1811, Maryculter was bought by General William Gordon of Fyvie, and the Gordon family owned the estate until the death of Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon in 1931 led to the sale of the property in 1935. The estate was broken up and the home-park was bought by the City of Aberdeen Boy Scouts' Association to create Templars' Park Scout Campsite. Alterations to the house took place in 1936.

History Early courses in 1923 ranged from Education in Health and Education in Accident Prevention to courses in the Physical Education Department. Vera Fry became Director of the Nursing Education Curriculum in 1944 and was the first to articulate goals and philosophy for a nascent nursing department. Under her leadership, the Department of Nursing was established in 1947. In 1954, Martha E. Rogers became chair of the Department of Nurse Education. With Rogers's leadership, NYU became one of the first universities to treat nursing as a science with a distinct body of knowledge developed through research. Rogers's groundbreaking model for the Science of Unitary Human Beings provided a theoretical basis for nursing practice, education, and research.

Rogers served NYU as a professor and head of the Division of Nursing until 1975, continuing as professor until her retirement in 1979. Estelle Massey Osborne, assistant professor of nursing at NYU, made lasting contributions in the areas of teaching, public health, administration, publication, research, and community service.Archival material : In 1931, Osborne became the first African American nurse to receive a master's degree, awarded by Teachers College, Columbia University. In recognition of her leadership, promotion of her professional colleagues, and advancement of nursing, Osborne received many honors and awards, including Nurse of the Year from the NYU Division of Nursing and an honorary membership in the American Academy of Nursing in 1978. Erline P. McGriff became Division head in 1976. Image. During the next decade, McGriff and her successor, Patricia Winstead- Fry, directed a substantial expansion of the master's degree program — in part by enhancing research involvement for graduate students. Diane O'Neill McGivern led as Division head from 1987 to 2001. Under her direction, new academic programs, community-based practices, expanded research initiatives, and growth took place. In the 90s, NYU Nursing initiated graduate clinical programs in advanced practice nursing. A school-based clinic opened in Brooklyn and the Midwifery Program was established. The Muriel and Virginia Pless Center for Nursing Research, the Martha Rogers Center for the Study of Nursing Science, and the John A. Hartford Foundation Institute for Geriatric Nursing were established. In September 2005, NYU's Division of Nursing moved from the Steinhardt School of Education to form the College of Nursing within the College of Dentistry. In June 2015, NYU's Board of Trustees voted to move the College of Nursing to full college status as of the Fall 2015 academic year, becoming one of the three colleges in the new Faculty of Health. In April 2016, the school announced it would be renamed the NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing after a $30 million contribution from Rose Marie \\"Rory\\" Meyers and her husband Howard Meyers.

ControlNet was earlier supported by ControlNet International, but in 2008 support and management of ControlNet was transferred to ODVA, which now manages all protocols in the Common Industrial Protocol family. Features which set ControlNet apart from other fieldbuses include the built-in support for fully redundant cables and the fact that communication on ControlNet can be strictly scheduled and highly deterministic. Due to the unique physical layer, common network sniffers such as Wireshark cannot be used to sniff ControlNet packets. Rockwell Automation provides ControlNet Traffic Analyzer software to sniff and analyze ControlNet packets. Version 1, 1.25 and 1.5 Versions 1 and 1.25 were released in quick succession when ControlNet first launched in 1997. Version 1.5 was released in 1998 and hardware produced for each version variant was typically not compatible. Most installations of ControlNet are version 1.5.  Architecture  =Physical layer= ControlNet cables consist of RG-6 coaxial cable with BNC connectors, though optical fiber is sometimes used for long distances. The network topology is a bus structure with short taps. ControlNet also supports a star topology if used with the appropriate hardware. ControlNet can operate with a single RG-6 coaxial cable bus, or a dual RG-6 coaxial cable bus for cable redundancy. In all cases, the RG-6 should be of quad-shield variety. Maximum cable length without repeaters is 1000m and maximum number of nodes on the bus is 99. However, there is a tradeoff between number of devices on the bus and total cable length. Repeaters can be used to further extend the cable length. The network can support up to 5 repeaters (10 when used for redundant networks). The repeaters do not utilize network node numbers and are available in copper or fiber optic choices. The physical layer signaling uses Manchester code at 5 Mbit/s. =Link layer= ControlNet is a scheduled communication network designed for cyclic data exchange. The protocol operates in cycles, known as NUIs, where NUI stands for Network Update Interval. Each NUI has three phases, the first phase is dedicated to scheduled traffic, where all nodes with scheduled data are guaranteed a transmission opportunity. The second phase is dedicated to unscheduled traffic. There is no guarantee that every node will get an opportunity to transmit in every unscheduled phase. The third phase is network maintenance or \\"guardband\\". It includes synchronization and a means of determining starting node on the next unscheduled data transfer. Both the scheduled and unscheduled phase use an implicit token ring media access method. The amount of time each NUI consists of is known as the NUT, where NUT stands for Network Update Time.

The Barmaley (Russian: Бармалей) is an informal name of a fountain in the city of Volgograd (formerly known as Stalingrad). Its official name is Children's Khorovod (Round Dance). The statue is of a circle of six children dancing the khorovod around a crocodile. While the original fountain was removed in the 1950s, two replicas were installed in 2013. History The original fountain is believed to have been installed in the 1930s, when the Soviet Union was being adorned with various outdoor architectural works, including similar fountains designed by sculptor Romuald Iodko, a co-author of the Girl with an Oar, an archetype of the Soviet kitsch. The Barmaley Fountain was made widely known from several August 1942 photographs by Emmanuil Evzerikhin that juxtaposed the carnage of the Battle of Stalingrad with the image of children at play.'Children's Khorovod'\\" The fountain was restored after World War II and was removed in the 1950s. A replica has been installed at the original site for the 23 August 2013, 71st anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad. Two replicas of the fountain were installed in 2013 at different locations in Volgograd, one of them nearby the very same railway station. A terrorist attack in December 2013 once more placed the fountain against the scene of destruction, reminiscent of the wartime photo. File:Открытие фонтана.jpeg File:Бармалей фонтан.jpg File:Реплика фонтана Бармалей.JPG Another replica was installed near the Gergardt Mill. The statue featured prominently in the films Enemy at the Gates, Stalingrad and a similar statue was seen in V for Vendetta. It is also seen in the film A Clockwork Orange, in the documentary footage shown to the main character Alex as part of the sinister aversion therapy to \\"cure\\" him of \\"ultra-violence\\". In December 1943, Edith Segal's choreographed work, The Magic Fountain, inspired by the picture of the fountain was held at Carnegie Hall. Name The allegory of the monument was derived from the eponymous fairy tale poem Barmaley written in 1925 by Korney Chukovsky. Excerpt (literal translation): While being burned in fire by Barmaley, Doctor Aybolit asked a crocodile brought in by a gorilla to swallow up Barmaley, so that he could no longer harm little children. The crocodile did so, but Barmaley was later released after promising to change. Barmaley became nicer and proclaimed he would be kinder, that he now loved little children and would become a friendly baker.

Biography Edmund Eysler was born in Vienna to a merchant family. He was supposed to enter the engineering profession, but his acquaintance with Leo Fall led him to study music at the Vienna Conservatory, where he studied composition under Robert Fuchs, and became educated as a piano teacher and Kapellmeister. After completing his degree with many plaudits, Eysler made ends meet by teaching piano. In 1898, he married Poldi Allnoch, with whom he would have two daughters, and in 1901, he found a position as a Kapellmeister. After that, he composed chamber music and piano pieces, as well as the opera Fest auf Solhaug (Celebration on Solhaug), and the ballet Schlaraffenland. Through a magnanimous relative, Eysler met the librettist Ignaz Schnitzer, who was compiling the text for Zigeunerbaron (Gypsy King). Eysler was given the task of setting this text to the opera Der Hexenspiegel (The Witches' Mirror) by Schnitzer. Originally, the work was supposed to be staged at the Vienna Court Opera upon completion, but it was spurned by the director for having overly simple music. Josef Weinberger encouraged Eysler to turn the music for Hexenspiegel into an operetta. It became the operetta Bruder Straubinger, which was a big success on its premiere on 20 February 1903, with Alexander Girardi in the main role. Eysler composed the operetta Der unsterbliche Lump (The Immortal Blight), with a libretto by , for the Vienna Bürgertheater. On 14 October 1910, this work was performed for the first time, with overwhelming success. Critics claimed Eysler's operetta signalled a change in the genre. The composer's music was praised, especially the solid instrumentation and the simple harmonies. The success ensured that Eysler would remain the Bürgertheater's \\"house composer\\". On 23 December 1911, his newest operetta, Der Frauenfresser (The Woman-Eater) was also well received. This was followed by the premiere of Der lachende Ehemann (The laughing groom) in March 1913. What was especially well received by reviewers were the catchy, unpretentious melodies. This work had been performed 1793 times by 1921. Even during the years of World War I, more and more of Eysler's operettas were staged at the Vienna Bürgertheater every season, such as Frühling am Rhein (Rhine Spring), Die – oder Keine! (That One – Or No One) und Der dunkle Schatz (The Dark Treasure). After the end of World War I, Eysler published one further, very successful operetta, Die gold’ne Meisterin (The Golden Mistress), which was very successful in Vienna. Due to Eysler's Jewish background, his works were banned from being performed by the Nazis, leading Adolf Hitler to discover that his favourite operetta, Die gold'ne Meisterin, was by a Jew. Instead of fleeing immediately, he found shelter with relatives and friends. The title of Honoured Citizen of Vienna gave him a certain protection. After the war, he achieved his last great success with the operetta Wiener Musik (Viennese Music), which premiered on 22 December 1947 at the Bürgertheater. For his 75th birthday, he was given the Ring of Honour by the city, and the memorial plaque on his birthplace in Thelemanngasse, which had been removed during the time of the Nazis, was reinstated. Eysler died on 4 October 1949, in Vienna as a consequence of a fall from the stage, and was buried in a grave of honour at the central graveyard in Vienna. With a total of 60 operettas, Eysler's influence in shaping the Austrian music environment of the time was felt very strongly. International success was less forthcoming because Eysler's music was Vienna-centric and based on local folklore.

The model 102 telephone was a version of Western Electric's first widely distributed telephone set that featured the transmitter and receiver in a common handset. Although this type designation was not used before ca. 1930, predecessor types were produced starting approximately in 1927 with the A handset mounting, and the B handset mounting in 1928. Earlier telephones by Western Electric had been of the candlestick type which featured a transmitter fixed to the base, and a receiver held by the user to the ear. The design of the A handset mounting was inherited from the candlestick desk stands, while the B-type was slightly reshaped. Although the B handset mounting was produced until 1932, Western Electric introduced a newly designed models, the D handset mounting in 1930, which had an oval foot print to improve physical stability during dialing. The model 102 telephone was the version of the D handset mounting with the traditional sidetone circuit. It consisted of the handset mounting typically placed on the desk top and a physically separate desk set box or subscriber set. This box was typically mounted on a wall near the phone or on the side of a desk. The desk set contained only the dial, a handset cradle with hook switch, and the handset positioned in the cradle, while the subscriber set contained the ringer and the electrical components to interface the unit with the telephone network. The 102 telephone was plagued by problems with excessive sidetone, resulting in a poor experience for users hearing their own voice very loudly, and in extreme cases in early versions also unstable feedback from the receiver into the transmitter. This sometimes caused users to lower their voices to the point where the other party found them difficult to hear. This problem was resolved with a new anti-sidetone circuit for the D1 telephone which became known as the 202 hand telephone. History As early as 1890, Western Electric had been experimenting with handset types that combined the transmitter and the receiver in the same hand-held unit, but two technical problems prevented them from reaching production at that time. First, the transmitters of the day did not work well unless oriented in a vertical plane. If operated at other angles, as would be expected in a hand- held unit, carbon granules in the transmitter would shift and move in an unacceptable manner, resulting in poor voice quality. Another hurdle to the acceptance of a common handset model was that audio from the receiver was picked up acoustically by the transmitter either via the air space to the receiver, or transmitted through the handle. Multiple passes via these paths result in amplification, and producing howling tones. The problems were aggravated by the signal boosting circuitry used in the subscriber set which resulted in a strong signal (sidetone) at the receiver of the speech of the user.M.D. Fagan (Ed.) A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System. The Early Years (1875-1925), AT&T; Bell Laboratories (1975), p.144. Sidetone is desirable only to some fraction of volume so that the user has the assurance that the telephone is working correctly. Strong sidetone may cause users to lower the voice to unacceptable levels, so that the recipient receives insufficient signal level. In the 1920s, developments in anti- sidetone circuitry and non-positional transmitters, which worked in any orientation, permitted Western Electric to develop a handset model substantially free of these problems. The resulting E1 handset was ready for production in 1927. This handset was paired with a base that was essentially a candlestick with a shortened neck of approximately one inch in height, topped with a new cradle for the handset. The cradle incorporated the hookswitch as a vertical plunger actuating the electrical switch contacts. This initial design was released in limited supply as Western Electric's first handset subscriber telephone, issued with the type designations A1, A2, and A3, for various types of service. A Western Electric B1 hand telephone with E1 handset with spit-cup mouthpiece Shortly after the introduction of A-type desk set, a new base design was ready for the E1 handset to replace the shortened candlestick. The new design streamlined the design to include the neck into the contour of the base, resulting in the type B handset mounting. This type retained a circular foot print of the base. The B-type desk set was followed by a wall-mounted handset telephone, designated as the C-type hangup telephone, with the E1 handset hanging on one side of the unit in a cradle for the receiver end. In use, the B-type telephone base proved unstable during dialing, and was replaced with the D-type handset mounting in 1930. A wider, oval base improved its stability. While the D1 mounting base was initially deployed electrically identical to the prior models, the anti-sidetone audio circuitry was introduced in short order the same year. With the introduction of the anti- sidetone circuit, Western Electric began assigning assembly codes to telephones based on the electrical configuration. Until then, telephones were primarily referred to by the part numbers used to construct them. With the new circuit variants, this became insufficient, resulting in the distinction between 100-series hand telephones and 200-series hand telephones. Thus, the type 102 was the new designation for the D1 handset mounting when used on common battery lines with a side-tone circuit,AT&T;, Bell System Practices, Section C32.102 Issue 2 (1 June 1931) Sidetone Hand Telephone Set and the 202 was the anti-sidetone version with a D1 handset mounting.AT&T;, Bell System Practices, Section C32.103 Issue 1 (1 June 1931) Anti-Sidetone Hand Telephone Sets The previous types, i.e. the A and B handset mounting were not designated with these manufacturing codes,AT&T;, Bell System Practices Section C32.101 Issue 1 (1 August 1930), Hand Telephone Sets—B Types—Description and Use although they were covered by the same specifications and maintenance procedures.

The screenplay concerns a Mormon pioneer wagon train to the San Juan River in Utah. The film inspired the US television series Wagon Train (1957–1965), which starred Ward Bond until his death in 1960. The film was a personal favorite of Ford himself, who told Peter Bogdanovich in 1967 that \\"Along with The Fugitive and The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master came closest to being what I wanted to achieve.\\" While the critical and audience response to Wagon Master was lukewarm on its release, over the years several critics have come to view it as one of Ford's masterpieces. Plot The film opens with a prelude showing a murderous robbery by the outlaw Clegg family (the patriarch Shiloh (Charles Kemper) and his four \\"boys\\"). The credits then follow the prelude, which was a stylistic innovation at its time. A Mormon wagon train led by the Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) around 1880 has reached Crystal City, and needs a wagon master to lead it further to its destination—the San Juan River country in southeastern Utah Territory. Their wagon train is being expelled from Crystal City by the townspeople there, and at the last minute horse traders Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey, Jr.) take the wagon master job. After resuming its journey west, the train finds and adds the wagon of a medicine show troupe, who, en route to California, have become stranded without water. The onward passage of the wagon train is marked by the beginnings of romances between Travis and Denver (Joanne Dru), a female entertainer with the medicine troupe, and between Sandy and a Mormon's daughter, and also by a Mormon square dance celebrating a successful desert passage, and by a pow-wow dance with a band of Navajo. All goes well enough until the Cleggs, fleeing a posse from Crystal City, force themselves into the wagon train. The train surmounts an encounter with the posse, a washed out trail blocking the way west, and ultimately a violent confrontation with the homicidal Cleggs. The film's conclusion leaves the wagon train and its wagon master on the verge of entry into the San Juan country. There is a final montage, which Richard Jameson characterizes as follows: \\"Wagon Master has scant interest in the prosaic, being preeminently a musical and a poem. ... it's the final montage that lifts the movie into another realm entirely. There are shots we've seen before—landmarks, vistas, the communal dance—but also shots we haven't. ... It's a subtler, deeper variation on the closing, transfiguring memory images of How Green Was My Valley (1941).\\" Casting alt=Printer poster with a photograph and text underneath.

They are dressed in cowboy garb: jeans, kerchiefs around their necks, and cowboy hats. The man on the left is holding a lasso near his waist. A section of what appears to be a covered wagon is visible behind them. Wagon Master did not use either John Wayne or Henry Fonda, the stars in many of Ford's films. The absence of any major stars of the day reduced the cost of making the film as well as its box office potential. As noted by Dennis Lim, the casting of Wagon Master was consistent with the film's focus on the emergence of a community instead of the heroic actions of individuals. Many of the cast and crew of Wagon Master were members of the \\"Ford stock company\\", having also worked on previous films directed by Ford. The principal roles were played by: * Charles Kemper as Uncle Shiloh Clegg, the patriarch of the outlaw Clegg Family. Wagon Master was Kemper's first appearance in a film directed by Ford. Writer Dave Kehr notes that this was consistent with his role in Wagon Master as an outside, evil force. * Ben Johnson as Travis Blue, an itinerant horse trader who becomes the wagon master for the Mormon wagon train. Johnson was a member of the Ford stock company; he was a noted horseman whose skill is featured when he gallops away from a band of Navajo. * Harry Carey Jr. as Sandy Owens, Travis' partner. Carey was the son of Harry Carey, a superstar of silent films who worked with Ford on many films in the 1910s and 1920s. Carey's memoir, Company of Heroes: My Life as an Actor in the John Ford Stock Company (1994), provides many details of the production of Wagon Master. Carey and Peter Bogdanovich did a commentary soundtrack when Wagon Master was released to DVD in 2009. * Ward Bond as the Mormon Elder Wiggs, the leader of the wagon train (and future star of the television series). Bond acted in many films directed by Ford; their relationship is described in the book Three Bad Men: John Ford, John Wayne, and Ward Bond (2013). * Joanne Dru as Denver, an entertainer, and apparently a prostitute, attached to Dr. Hall's medicine show. Dru had previously starred in Ford's She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949). * Alan Mowbray as Dr. A. Locksley Hall, the principal of the medicine show whose wagon joins the wagon train. \\"Locksley Hall\\" is an 1842 poem by Alfred Tennyson. Mowbray's role in Wagon Master is reminiscent of his role as Granville Thorndyke, a Shakespearean actor, in Ford's My Darling Clementine (1946). * Jane Darwell as the Mormon Sister Ledyard. While often on camera, Darwell rarely speaks in the film; she is charged with blowing a crude hunting horn. Darwell appeared in seven of Ford's films from 1940 through 1958. * Hank Worden as Luke Clegg. Appeared in 17 movies with John Wayne and 6 movies with Ward Bond. * Movita Castaneda as Young Navajo Indian, who accuses Reese Clegg (Fred Libby) of attacking her. * Ruth Clifford as Fleuretty Phyffe * Russell Simpson as Adam Perkins * Kathleen O'Malley as Prudence Perkins * Mickey Simpson as Jesse Clegg * Cliff Lyons as Marshal of Crystal City Several of the minor roles in the film were also played by notable actors such as James Arness (the future star of the long-running television series Gunsmoke) as one of the Clegg boys, Francis Ford (John Ford's elder brother, and a very successful director and actor of the silent film era) as the mute drummer of the medicine show, and Jim Thorpe (the famed Native American athlete) as a member of the Navajo band in his last film role. Themes =Emergence of a community= Wagon Master portrays the evolution of a Mormon community in passage towards a promised Eden. Sean Axmaker wrote in 2009, \\"It's as gentle and warm a film as he ever made and it follows a classic Ford theme—the creation of a community in the west—through an often lighthearted tale ...\\" Dave Kehr wrote similarly in 1985: \\"Ford treats one of his central themes—the birth of a community—through a sweeping visual metaphor of movement. Seldom has the western landscape seemed such a tangible emblem of hope and freedom.\\" The portrayal of community predominates over portrayals of individuals; thus Dennis Lim wrote, again in 2009, that \\"Wagon Master is at once the plainest and the fullest expression of Ford's great theme: the emergence of a community. So committed is the film to the idea of a collective hero that there is no one central character, no leading man or marquee name. Instead of Wayne or Henry Fonda, Wagon Master is filled with lesser-known but familiar faces from the Ford stock company.\\" =A film poem= Wagon Master has been called a \\"film poem\\" or its equivalent by several critics and scholars, which connotes that the film's storyline is less important than its visual portrait of the community of the wagon train. Scott Eyman and Paul Duncan wrote in 2004 that Wagon Master \\"is a lyrical ballad, an affirmation of Ford's folk vision of America, where a dance or a graveside ceremony speaks more for the communally minded pioneers than all the dramatic battles in the world.\\" Jeremy Arnold wrote, Lindsay Anderson wrote in 1954 that, \\"Ford often abandons his narrative completely, to dwell on the wide and airy vistas, on riders and wagons overcoming the most formidable natural obstacles, on bowed and weary figures stumbling persistently through the dust.\\"Anderson, Lindsay (April–June 1954). Quoted in And Richard Jameson, in 2003: =Pacifism and arms= Filmed about four years after the end of World War II (1939–1945), Wagon Master treatment of violence was unusual, especially for a Western. In the film, the Mormons are pacifists and unarmed; this was Ford's story choice, as 19th century Mormons often took up arms. The Mormon wagon train of the film is thus vulnerable to armed threats, which include its encounters with the band of Navajo, who prove to be peaceable, and with the Clegg family, who are certainly not. Travis and Sandy are armed, but Sandy has apparently never fired a weapon at a person, and Travis claims that he's only shot \\"snakes\\". They are nonetheless able to defeat the Cleggs in a brief gunbattle precipitated by the Cleggs' murder of one of the unarmed Mormon men. Glenn Erickson writes, \\"Travis says he only draws on snakes, not people, and when he's forced to fight he throws his gun away afterward. That's also a feeling I felt from the men in my family, all ex-soldiers. The war was over and done with; as far as they were concerned victory and peace would last forever.\\" Shigehiko Hasumi notes that Ford's films often show the throwing of objects at significant moments. In his 1984 book about Ford, Lindsay Anderson discussed the \\"pacific (not pacifist) theme\\" of Wagon Master and also of Ford's cavalry trilogy of films (Fort Apache (1948), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), and Rio Grande (1950)) that were made at about the same time. Tag Gallagher wrote in 1986 that \\"... the Mormons are lambs, not willing to protect themselves. Without Travis they would have maintained their pacifism, Wiggs would have died, the grain would have been lost and the colony destroyed. Yet—and this compromise of ideology for practicality fascinates Ford—the Mormons will accept protection from a shepherd, thus (a trifle hypocritically?) maintaining their innocence.\\" Gallagher has made his revised version of this book freely available for download; see Page numbers in the e-book do not match the numbering of the 1986 printed version. As noted, however, actual Mormon wagon trains were armed and would defend themselves if necessary.  Production  alt=A wooden wagon wheel with 16 spokes occupies the right half of the image; the camera was perhaps 3 or 4 feet from this wheel. The wheel is biting about 6 inches into loose soil. Rays of sunlight are coming through just a few of the upper spokes, and are readily visible in the dusty air. The left half of the image shows the back side of a horse in harness that is straining to pull the wagon. Wagon Master was produced by Argosy Pictures, which was the independent production company formed by Ford and Merian C. Cooper mostly to give Ford a control over his films that was impossible for films produced by the major film studios. Ford and Cooper were credited as co-executive producers, with Lowell J. Farrell as associate producer. Between 1946 and 1953, Ford and Cooper produced eight films through Argosy Pictures, of which Wagon Master was the fifth. The story idea for Wagon Master emerged while Ford was directing She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) on location in southern Utah. Patrick Ford, a screenwriter and Ford's son, learned the history of the Mormon Hole in the Rock expedition (1879–1880) from some local Mormon horsemen. Ford developed a story loosely based on the historical expedition. It was unusual for Ford to base his films on the stories he wrote, and it had been nearly 20 years since he'd last done so (Men Without Women (1930)). Ford commissioned Patrick Ford and Frank S. Nugent to write the screenplay. As was typical for Ford, he changed the screenplay significantly while directing the film; he was quoted as telling Patrick Ford and Nugent that, \\"I liked your script, boys. In fact, I actually shot a few pages of it.\\" Ford had been shooting the film She Wore a Yellow Ribbon the year before (1948) in Monument Valley, near the town of Mexican Hat, Utah, close to the locations where he had also filmed Stagecoach (1939), My Darling Clementine (1946), and Fort Apache (1948). He wanted a different look for his next film and drove to Moab, Utah. Filmed in black and white on location, mainly north-east of the town of Moab, Utah in Professor Valley (with additional shooting at Spanish Valley south-west of Moab, and a few stage shots were done at Monument Valley). Ford selected Bert Glennon as the director of photography. He'd worked with Glennon on five films between 1935 and 1939, including Stagecoach, for which both Ford and Glennon were nominated for Academy Awards. Ford chose to film Wagon Master in black and white; in 2009, Glenn Kenny wrote that the film \\"... reveals Bert Glennon's cinematography for the miracle that it was/is. Watching the disc this evening I wondered if it was not, in fact, frame-by-frame one of the most gorgeous motion pictures ever shot.\\" Location filming was done in less than a month. Wagon Master was edited by Jack Murray, who had edited six of Ford's previous films, including all of the Argosy Pictures productions. =Musical elements= alt=This is an outdoor scene with trees and the night sky visible in the background. In the foreground is a wooden dance floor consisting of long wooden boards butted roughly together. Four couples form the four sides of a square about 10 feet across. Two of the men are starting to move towards the center; all of the individuals are smiling and jovial. In the background there are about twenty more people watching, and behind them on the right there is a medicine show wagon. The wagon has several signs and banners. The topmost and largest reads \\"Dr. A. Locksley Hall\\"; smaller signs say \\"Hair Restored\\" and \\"Teeth Pulled\\". A man in a top hat is sitting regally on a small platform in front of the wagon. On the left are two musicians, one playing a flute and the other carrying a drum. The film's score was composed by Richard Hageman, a noted conductor and composer of art songs and other musical works. Commencing with Stagecoach (1939), Hageman wrote music for seven films directed by John Ford; Wagon Master was the last. Kathryn Kalinak has written that Ford \\"got great work out of the people he worked with, and often those he was hardest on produced the best work of their careers. One of those was Richard Hageman, the Philadelphia Orchestra notwithstanding.\\" Songs are important in Wagon Master. Critic Dennis Lim has written, \\"Practically a musical, Wagon Master is filled with frequent song and dance interludes and accompanied by a steady stream of hymns and ballads, performed by the popular country group the Sons of the Pioneers.\\" Filmgoers learn of Travis Blue's and Sandy Owens' decision to accept the wagon master job when Travis and Sandy break into song. Stan Jones wrote four original songs that were performed by the Sons of the Pioneers for the film's soundtrack. At its conclusion, the film incorporates a \\"spirited\\" rendition of the Mormon hymn, \\"Come, Come, Ye Saints\\". John Ford had insisted that Harry Carey Jr. lead the company of the film, which included many Mormons, in singing the hymn; the version used for the film's soundtrack was apparently recorded by the Robert Mitchell Boys Choir. Release The film was apparently not widely reviewed upon its 1950 release. Variety noted that \\"Wagon Master is a good outdoor action film, done in the best John Ford manner. That means careful character development and movement, spiced with high spots of action, good drama and leavening comedy moments.\\" The picture was distributed by RKO Pictures. The film recorded a loss of $65,000 and was the last co-production between Argosy and RKO. Critical response Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond Film critic Tag Gallagher wrote at length about Wagon Master in his 1986 book, John Ford: the man and his films. His summary is, \\"That Wagon Master (1950), one of Ford's major masterpieces, grossed about a third of any of the cavalry pictures surely came as no surprise. It was a personal project, with no stars, little story, deflated drama, almost nothing to attract box office or trendy critics. Its budget was $999,370, its highest paid actor got $20,000 (Ward Bond). Almost every frame bursts with humanity, nature and cinema, quite like Rossellini's Voyage in Italy. The story, resembling the Carey-Fords of the teens more than a 1950s western, was written by Ford himself, the only such instance after 1930.\\" There have been a number of reviews of Wagon Master since its 2009 DVD release. Most contemporary critics appear to concur with Gallagher's view that Wagon Master is a major masterpiece. Linda Rasmussen wrote, \\"This wonderful film emphasizes the virtues of solidarity, sacrifice and tolerance, and shows John Ford at his most masterful, in total control of the production from the casting to the bit players to the grandeur and scope of the visual compositions. The film, with its breathtaking scenery, brilliant performances by a cast of character actors, and an engaging sense of humor, is a superlative example of the American western.\\" While respectful of the film's accomplishments, other critics are more muted. In George N. Fenin and William K. Everson's 1973 overview, The Western: from silents to the seventies, they wrote that \\"Wagon Master is as close to a genuine Western film-poem as we have ever come, but attempts by Ford's admirers to enlarge it beyond that do both it and Ford a disservice.\\" David Fear wrote in 2009, \\"For a modest little movie, this still has all the solid storytelling and visual majesty of Ford's classic works; scholars like Joseph McBride and Peter Bogdanovich actually think it's his masterpiece.\\" =Mormonism and Wagon Master= The film's story is inspired by the 1879–1880 Mormon Hole in the Rock expedition, and Ford has been quoted as saying of the Mormons that \\"These are the people I want.\\" The film depicts the prejudice against Mormons; the marshall in Crystal City is expelling their wagon train, and he lumps them together with other outcasts: \\"Mormons, Cleggses, showfolk, horse traders.\\" Following a discussion of somewhat earlier films (Brigham Young (1940) and Bad Bascomb (1946)) that also depict Mormons sympathetically, Randy Astle and Gideon Burton write, \\"It is less surprising, then, to find Mormons featuring prominently in one of the most humanistic films ever made, John Ford's Wagon Master (1950). Although its scale could not equal that of Brigham Young, it deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest of Mormon films.\\" The film ends with a chorus of perhaps the best-known Mormon hymn, \\"Come, Come, Ye Saints\\". Home media A region 1 DVD was released by Warner Home Video in 2009. Contains a commentary soundtrack by Harry Carey, Jr. and Peter Bogdanovich, who also incorporates some recordings from his interviews of John Ford in the 1960s. There is also a Spanish language soundtrack that was noted favorably; see Critic Glenn Kenny wrote of this release, \\"the main attraction is the film itself, buffed to a lustrous (but still grain-rich) sheen that reveals Bert Glennon's cinematography for the miracle that it was/is. Watching the disc this evening I wondered if it was not, in fact, frame-by-frame one of the most gorgeous motion pictures ever shot.\\" A region 2 DVD was released in Europe in 2002; it has a French language soundtrack as well as the English one. This version has both French language and English language soundtracks. It is listed at 80 minutes, which is about 6 minutes shorter than the English language release. There was a release to videotape (VHS) in 1990. A colorized version was also released as a VHS tape. Colorized version; catalog #6230. In 1998, the copyrights to both the original and colored versions of the film were donated to The Library of Congress, along with an original master reel copy of the film. The reel is stored in an individual secure vault at the Packard Campus in Culpeper, Virginia in order to preserve the film for future generations.

She was played by Christine Hargreaves between 1960 and 1963. Creation =Casting= Salford-born 21-year-old Christine Hargreaves was one of the first actors to read for creator Tony Warren's new script 'Florizel Street' (later renamed Coronation Street), and even played the part of Christine in the dry runs, before the show was commissioned for broadcast, alongside, among others, Patricia Phoenix and Doris Speed. =Background= Christine was born in 1939 to parents George and May Hardman. George had quit his job as a bank manager in 1949 in order to buy a grocery shop and the family moved away from Coronation Street when the business venture proved successful. However, when George died from a massive heart attack at the age of just 50 in 1955, he left May and Christine in debt and they were forced to move back to their old home at No.13, which they had lived at since 1927. Storylines Christine was born in 1939. Her family had lived in 13 Coronation Street, Weatherfield since 1930, and Christine attended Bessie Street School, where she was close friends with Ken Barlow (William Roache). Her father, George Hardman, was a bank teller but by 1953 he had saved enough money to buy a grocery shop and a detached house in Oakhill. Christine was upset to be moving away from her friends, but although the family returned to live at No.13 in 1955, it was under unpleasant circumstances as her mum May (Joan Heath) had had to sell the house and shop to pay off creditors following George's death. Christine coped with the move better than May, who was too ashamed to face the neighbours. Christine spent the next few years looking after her mother, who constantly dwelled on the past and eventually suffered a breakdown. Christine got a job as a machinist as Elliston's Raincoat Factory but by 1960 her mother's health weighed heavily on her mind as well as the gossip in the street. May died of a brain tumour at the end of the year. May's death was a shock for Christine. As if having her mother die wasn't enough, she now had to manage the house and money on her own. The neighbours - especially Esther Hayes (Daphne Oxenford) - went out of their way to help her, but help also came from an unexpected source; plumber Joe Makinson (Brian Rawlinson) did her plumbing for free and asked her out. Christine was worried that he was taking advantage, but agreed to date, and a relationship soon emerged that led to a proposal after only a short time. Christine dumped Joe as they weren't quite on the same level. Later in 1961, Christine met Ken Barlow at the train station. He was intending to move to London to get away from the expectations of his family in the wake of Ida Barlow's (Noel Dyson) death. Christine convinced him to stay. Despite taking control of her life and coping well, Christine was very unhappy. The repetitive and dull work at Elliston's did her no favours, and in 1962 she started wondering how people could be happy with their lives living in Coronation Street. In June, she climbed up onto the roof of the factory, intending to jump off, but she was talked down by Ken, who reminded her how she had stopped him from making a big mistake. He had sometimes wanted better things from life as well, but told her she shouldn't give up. After the rooftop incident, Christine quit the factory and tried to live life differently. An old flame of Christine's, Colin Appleby (Lawrence James), read about Christine in the newspaper, and met up with her. Christine seized the opportunity and decided to move out of Weatherfield when the relationship got serious. The pair settled in Leeds and eloped only two weeks later, but Colin was killed in a car crash in October. Christine returned to Coronation Street and took a job at Miami Modes with Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and Dot Greenhalgh (Joan Francis). The residents were shocked when Christine went out with Ken's father Frank Barlow (Frank Pemberton) in 1963 - Frank being twice her age and Christine having previously been interested in Ken. Frank was enthusiastic about the relationship, and Christine went along with it, but she was still confused about what she wanted now that Colin was dead. Frank was always one step ahead, already thinking about marriage, which almost alienated him from Ken. The news sent neighbourhood gossip into overdrive, and Elsie decided to spread the news that Christine had another boyfriend so that Christine and Frank would have peace. Frank popped the question to Christine but she didn't answer him right away. Before she decided, Christine met up with Joe Makinson again and couldn't decide whom to choose. She was going to reject Joe, but he dumped her first, leading her to accept Frank's proposal. What mainly put Christine off was the gossip in the street. It was so bad that Christine wrote a letter to the landlord of No.11, where she was living with Elsie, informing him that she was living there illegally, resulting in her having to move out. Christine soon realised that she didn't love Frank and only saw him as a possible means to get out of the street for good. She decided to be honest with him and called off the engagement. Christine eventually got out of the street when she was promoted at Miami Modes and butted heads with Elsie and Dot, who didn't like the way she used her newfound authority. Christine was transferred and after briefly sharing a flat with old friend Esther Hayes, she left Weatherfield for good. Christine sent a telegram to congratulate Elsie and Steve Tanner (Paul Maxwell) on their wedding day in 1967. When Esther returned for Valerie Barlow's (Anne Reid) funeral in 1971, she revealed that Christine now lived in Southampton. In 1973, Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) mentioned that she had since remarried and had children.

It was founded in 1903 and opened its doors to students in 1906 as the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women. The school was closed in 1973. Founding and early history MMCC was founded in 1903 as one of the four colleges of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (Carnegie Tech). Andrew Carnegie, the founder of Carnegie Tech, named the college after his mother. MMCC's principal aim would be to train young women to earn their livelihood. The curriculum in the first year included principles of science and economics, history, English, accounts, social ethics, sewing, drawing, cookery, and personal hygiene. In their second and third years, students could choose to specialize in secretarial courses, household arts and institutional management, technical dressmaking, costume design, applied design, or architectural and interior decoration. Of the goals of the college, Eileen McConomy, steering committee chairperson of the MMCC Centennial, stated, \\"although some of the major disciplines available to us may seem archaic to current students, for our era they were relevant [...] our education was rigorous. Our women professors were the forerunners of the feminist movement and inspired us to take charge of our lives, to not be afraid to speak out for what we believed was right, and to demand excellence in all that we did.\\" Closing Margaret Morrison Carnegie College closed in 1973 due to declining enrollment: \\"Entering on the coattails of the 1950s were societal and institutional changes that would ultimately seal the fate of MMCC. Homemaking was less apt to be considered a profession; women students were turning increasingly to careers based in the liberal arts and sciences. A steadily climbing enrollment in these fields led to the integration of many MMCC programs into Tech’s other schools.\\" Legacy Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall The end of Margaret Morrison Carnegie College also marked the beginning of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (now known as the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences), and several programs and departments were absorbed into the new college as well as the Mellon College of Science and College of Fine Arts.

Plot After a heated argument with her military police turned cop husband, Lawson (Michael Dudikoff); Russian immigrant house wife, Lara (Savina Gersak) storms off into the night convinced he's more married to his job than her. On her drive to a friend's house, she takes pity on a mournful hitchhiker Justin Mckay (Mark Hamill), desperately searching for a ride. Her offer of a lift to him plunges her into a night of pure terror as Justin is seriously disturbed, twisted by a tortured childhood which ended in being made to see his little sister's shocking murder and mutilation at the hands of his brutal alcoholic mother (who took a butcher knife to her head and used it like a comb) who systematically slays anyone who harms or offends him on a murderous impulse, as he captures their dying moments on his Polaroid camera. As Lawson struggles to follow Lara despite a leg in a cast, he is left for dead by Justin, but recovers and now must search the steadily darkening roads for Lara, while her deeply troubled captor Justin continues his uncontrollable slaughter-spree, rampaging through the night leaving behind carnage and fiery devastation on his path of madness. As soon as Justin and Lara reach the hospital, Justin pretends Lara is paranoid and soon encounter Dr. Hardy, Justin's doctor who tried to help Justin when he first met him. While Lawson arrives at the hospital, Justin forces Dr. Hardy to give Lara the treatment of electric shocks. As much as Dr. Hardy tries to persuade Justin not to, he ignores him and gives Lara electric shocks, thus trying to kill her.

Many alternative styles and approaches have been developed, many of which are called \\"narrative\\" in either style or content. Narrative Preaching (also known as \\"the New Homiletic\\") is a branch of homiletics that developed in the 20th century. The term \\"Narrative\\" refers to the style of the sermon, not its content; many Narrative Style sermons contain no stories at all. Narrative Preaching is a deliberate break from \\"the Old Homiletic,\\" the traditional style of Christian preaching derived ultimately from Augustine of Hippo's championship of using Greek forms of rhetoric derived from Aristotle's Rhetoric and Poetics. \\"The Old Homiletic\\" was based on reasoning in which a general thesis is stated which leads to particular applications and proofs. \\"The New Homiletic,\\" in contrast, is based on reasoning in which particular details lead both the preacher and the congregation to new ways of thinking.  Narrative Homiletics: Common Characteristics  The New Homiletic is a reaction against propositional preaching. It requires the preacher to take an expectant, imaginative stance before the biblical text. The goal of the sermon is a transformative event, often requiring a strategic delay of meaning. In other words, the preacher does not give the congregation the thesis or point at the beginning of the sermon; they are required to follow along as the preacher explores the text and its meaning. Language is used carefully to produce the desired effect; what language does is considered more important than what it says. Poetic and metaphorical language is privileged. Stories and metaphors are points; they do not illustrate them. The sermon is structured in such a way that an early imbalance or disconnect leads to some sort of resolution by the end of the sermon; a story is not required. Stories function as the structure and logic of the sermon, not necessarily its content.  The Old Homiletic  The majority of Christian sermons have historically been preached using rhetorical and logical styles derived from Greek philosophy and rhetoric. The preacher would start with a thesis and prove it using a variety of techniques including Scriptural citation, story, and a series of logical deductions. This was the model used, for example, by John A. Broadus in his 1870 text on preaching, A Treatise on the Preparation and Delivery of Sermons, which was the standard homiletics manual in English-speaking non-Catholic seminaries for over seventy years and shaped generations of preachers. Proof-texting, in which small pieces of Scripture are taken out of context to \\"prove\\" the speaker's point, is a particular hazard of this style of preaching.  Preludes to a Narrative Homiletic  Development of the \\"new\\" or \\"narrative\\" homiletic came from a combination of new ways of thinking in theological, philosophical, and Biblical studies. = Theology = Neo-orthodoxy was a movement that called theologians to disengage themselves from popular/philosophical movements by letting scripture define itself. It was championed by Karl Barth and Emil Brunner. This was not a fundamentalist or literalist view of the text; it was instead a call to listen to what the text said without reducing it to rhetoric or depending on natural theology. It inspired Narrative Theology, a movement that developed at Yale Divinity School and also contributed to the development of the New Homiletic. The Biblical Theology movement, championed by H. Richard Niebuhr, emphasized narrative structure and particularity. There are three variations on the narrative theme. In the first variation, the structure of Biblical narrative equals the structure of reality. Hans Frei argues that the historical-critical method separates truth from fact by ignoring what is \\"behind\\" the text. Sallie McFague argues that all understanding comes through metaphor. In the second variation, associated with Paul van Buren, the doctrine is embedded in the story to the extent that philosophical categorization or discussion of theology outside the narrative is useless. The third variation, associated with Stanley Hauerwas, deals with narrative ethics: we see the world the way we've been trained to see it through the stories we've been told, both large and small; how a person tells his or her stories defines how that person thinks. = Philosophy = Narrative preaching is based on the philosophical belief that language creates reality. If you cannot say something, you cannot experience it. Language is what creates people and communities. Communication is not about content, it is about connecting in the moment. The New Hermeneutic, associated with Ernst Fuchs and Gerhard Ebeling, argued that parables are more than \\"mere\\" fables—they create a world in themselves. The story is the reality. Paul Ricoeur and Stephen Crites also developed hermeneutical arguments regarding the interaction of language and meaning. = Biblical Studies = Several theologians, including Robert W. Funk, Amos Wilder, Dan O. Via, and John Dominic Crossan, have made contributions in the area of rhetorical and literary critical approaches to biblical studies. Their various contributions to the field include the idea that form and content cannot be separated; what the text does is as important as what it says. They argue that texts don't just have a past, they have a present and a future through their readers and hearers. Walter Brueggmann argues that in preaching, we construct an alternate world.  Early Pioneers and their contributions  Henry Grady Davis: the sermon is an organic thing. David Randolph: the story was the point; a preacher should show, not tell. Charles Rice: a sermon isn't a lecture hall Edmund Steimle: a sermon should weave together the Biblical story and our story. Henry Mitchell: sermons should be approached organically, using poetic language and celebration. Fred Craddock: a sermon should move from examples to a thesis, taking the congregation through an encounter with the text.

Libyan agricultural projects and policies are overseen by a General Inspector; there is no Ministry of Agriculture, per se.Doing Business In LIBYA: A Country Commercial Guide for U.S. Companies, March, 2006 History of agricultural development Historically, Libyan agriculture has had an inverse relationship to growth in the oil industry. In 1958, agriculture supplied over 26% of GDP. Although gross agricultural production was relatively constant, increasing oil revenues resulted in declines in agriculture's share of national income. Agriculture contributed 9% of GDP in 1962, 2% in 1978, 3.5% in 1984 and 5.6% by 1997. In 1977 imported food valuations were over 37 times higher than in 1958. However, while a large part of oil wealth was spent on imported food this was not necessarily disturbing. The 1950s agricultural sector masked high poverty, low productivity and limited alternatives. Petrodollars provided urban employment, resulting in higher rural migration. In 1961-63, government loans to buy land from Italian settlers, encouraged urbanites to purchase land for recreation rather than farming, thereby inflating values and reducing production. =Libyan Soils= Soils and their characteristics in Libya are affected to the great extent by nature and conditions in which these soils were formed. Generally, aridity is the main characterizes of such soils. Most of these soils are undeveloped or partially developed. Soils in the study are classified in accordance with US Soil Taxonomy. Aridisols and Entisols are the main soil orders in the study area. The salt-affected soils are widespread in the study area such as Salic Haplocambids, Typic Aquisalids, Typic Haplosalids, Typic Haplocalcids, Lithic Haplocalcids, Typic Torriorthents. =Agriculture since 1962= Since 1962 agriculture has received more attention. The government bag began providing inducements for absentee landlords to encourage productive land use and initiated agricultural wage policies. Agricultural was the cornerstone of the 1981-85 development plan, attaching high priority to funding the GMMR project, designed to bring water from aquifers in Sarir and Kufra. In 1981, the National Libyan Agricultural Bank provided agricultural credit totaling almost 10,000 loans averaging nearly LD1,500 each. This may explain why many Libyans (nearly 20% of the labor force in 1984) remained in the agricultural sector. By 1997, about 17% of the labor force worked in agriculture. In 1984, Libya imported over 2 million mt of cereals (up from 612,000 mt in 1974). Also in 1984, the average index of food production per capita indicated a 6% decline from 1974 to 1976. Through the 1980s about 70% of Libya's food needs were imported. By 1998, cereal production was 207,000 mt and met only 15% of the country's needs. . National Economies Encyclopedia: Libya Agriculture Land use and irrigation View from Jebel Akhdar in Libya near Benghazi is Libya's wettest region. Annual rainfall averages at between 400 and 600 millimeters. The total area of Libya is estimated at 1,760,000 km². Area suitable for cultivation approximates 22,000 km² of which 2,390 km² dedicated to irrigated agriculture, 15,500 km² to rain fed farming, and 140,000 km² of forest and range lands.Food Self-Sufficiency and Agricultural Research in Libya. Taher Azzabi, Agricultural Research Center, Tripoli (Libya) Under 2% of the land is arable and about 4% is suitable for grazing livestock. Most arable land is in the Jebel Akhdar region near Benghazi, and the Jifara Plain near Tripoli. The highest parts of Jebel Akhdar receive 400-600 mm of rain annually, and the adjacent area, north to Marj Plain, receives 200–400 mm. Central and eastern Jifara Plain and Jabal Nafusa average 200 to 400 mm. The remaining coast and southern areas average 100–200 mm. Jifara Plain has an underground aquifer, enabling well-driven irrigation. Between these areas is a 50 km land strip with enough scrub vegetation to support livestock. Desert dominates the south with occasional oasis cultivation at Kufra, Sabha and Murzuk. Studies from the 1970s indicated that at any given time, about one-third of total arable land remained fallow and up to 45% of farms were under 10 ha. Most farms in the Jifara Plain were irrigated by individual wells and electric pumps, although in 1985 only about 1% of arable land was irrigated. Since 1969, the Gaddafi government has been very concerned with land reform. After the \\"al-Fatah\\" revolution, confiscated Italian-owned farms (about 380 km²) were redistributed. The state retained some confiscated lands for state farming ventures, but overall, the government has not sought to eliminate the private sector from agriculture. In 1971, uncultivated land was declared state property. This measure targeted tribes in the Jebel Akhdar claiming large land tracts. Another law in 1977 further restricted tribal groups, emphasizing use in determining land ownership. Since 1977 families receive enough land to satisfy their personal requirements; this policy was designed to prevent large private sector farms and end using fertile \\"tribal\\" lands for grazing. Partly as a result of these policies and Islamic inheritance law, which stipulate each son receive an equal share of land upon the father's death, in 1986 farms tended to be fragmented and too small to efficiently use water. This was especially severe in the Jifara Plain, which has been Libya's single most productive agricultural region. Falling water tables caused by over irrigation posed a long-term ecological threat. The government recognized this in 1976, and took measures discouraging citrus and tomato cultivation, which require large water amounts. However, the steps required to save coastal water resources – i.e., irrigation regulation and land tenure reform to make it more water-efficient - conflicted with Gaddafi's concept of economic equity, which favored intensive irrigated cultivation of small plots for family use. Thus, instead of reforming harmful practices, agricultural policy since 1983 focused on pumping water to the coast from fossil reserves in the desert as part of the GMMR project. =Libyan Soils= Soils and their characteristics in Libya are affected to great extent by nature and conditions in which these soils were formed.

Fishing Coastline of Benghazi, Libya's second largest city. With the longest Mediterranean coastline among African nations, Libya's mostly unspoilt beaches are a social gathering place. Although Libya has nearly 1,800 km of coastline and the second largest continental shelf in the Mediterranean, its waters are not particularly rich in plankton needed to sustain fishing waters. In 1977, Libya's fishing catch was 4,803 tons and 6,418 tons by 1981. Most fleets were located on the western coast near Tripoli. In 1979, fishing boats were estimated at 325, 13 being commercial trawlers; the rest small and medium-sized boats. There were approximately 1,000-1,200 professional fishermen by 1981. The government has encouraged fishing and attempted to stimulate demand. In 1986 a fishing port was constructed at Zuwara, and ice plants were built at several coastal sites. Agreements for joint fishing development were signed with several countries, including Tunisia and Spain. Sponge fishing was monopolized by Greek fishers.For background on the Libyan fisheries sector covering pre-WWII until the late 1980s, refer to: Serbetis (1952): Asciak (1964); Laskaridis (1969); McKellar (1981); Arrundale and Curr (1989). A tiny percentage of the harvest was obtained by Libyans using small boats and skin-diving equipment from shallow waters inshore. In 1977, the government established freshwater fish farms in several inshore locations. In 1997, the low annual catch of 34,500 mt demonstrates Libya’s still underdeveloped fisheries. Low investments in fishing boats, ports, and processing facilities are major obstacles to growth. The country has one major fishing port (Zliten), one tuna plant and two sardine factories with small processing capacities (1,000 metric tons per year each). Libya is planning to build 24 fishing ports in addition to one under construction at Marsa Zuaga. With a primary and secondary productive employment base of around 12,000 persons by 2006, the national fisheries sector provides a small fraction - around 1% - of the total labor force. Its estimated contribution to Agricultural GDP is negligible, standing at around 10%.The marine wealth sector of Libya: a development planning overview. Fisheries and Aquaculture Department Forestry Libya lacks forests for commercial purposes. Although the government designated over 624 km² as woodland or forest, this land is covered in scrub and minor vegetation. During the 1960s the government began an afforestation program. An estimated 213 million seedlings were planted by 1977, 33 million being fruit trees. Most reforestation occurred in western Libya. During reforestation, scientists experimented with a petrochemical spray that is sufficiently porous to allow rain to seep through, yet sturdy enough to prevent seedlings from being blown away during sandstorms. Planting program goals included growing enough trees to meet domestic lumber needs, soil conservation and reclamation, and windbreaks for crops and settlements.The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook Statistics *Area: **total: 1,759,540 km². **land: 1,759,540 km². **water: 0 km² *Coastline: 1,770 km. *Maritime claims: **territorial sea: 12 nm **note: Gulf of Sidra closing line - 32 degrees, 30 minutes north **exclusive fishing zone: *Climate: Mediterranean along coast; dry, extreme desert interior. *Elevation extremes: **lowest point: Sabkhat Ghuzayyil -47 m **highest point: Bikku Bitti 2,266 m *Land use: **arable land: 1.03%. **permanent crops: 0.19%. **other: 98.78% (2005). *Irrigated land: 4,700 km² (2003). *Geography: more than 90% of the country is desert or semidesert. *Agriculture - products: wheat, barley, olives, dates, citrus, vegetables, peanuts, soybeans; cattle.

Early life  Born in Kiev in the family of a general with German background, Vinberg studied in high school in Kiev and in the Alexander Lyceum. From 1891 to 1892, he worked in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1893, he entered military service. Serving in the cavalry, he rose to the rank of colonel in 1911. In the years before World War I, he became involved in extreme right-wing politics, joining the Black- Hundredist Union of Archangel Michael and writing for right-wing publications. During the war, he commanded the Second Baltic cavalry regiment. He became personally acquainted with Tsarina Aleksandra for whom he developed a strong emotional attachment. There were even rumours of an affair.Kellogg pp 43 & 169 After the February Revolution, he left the army. Revolutionary Russia After the October Revolution, he was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks for his role in an alleged plot to overthrow the Provisional Government. He pleaded not guilty and pointed to the absurdity of such charges by the Bolsheviks, as they had overthrown the Provisional Government themselves. He was sentenced to one year's imprisonment by the revolutionary tribunal but was released in early 1918. There, he met fellow right-wingers, including Pyotr Shabelsky- Bork,Burbank p72 who became his friend and collaborator. In prison, he kept notes, which he later published. He made a dangerous journey to Kiev to fight with the White Army, where he was arrested and rescued by German forces and accompanied them in retreat to Germany. In 1919 he was in Berlin, where he published the short-lived right-wing newspapers/magazines Prizyv (\\"The Call\\") and Luch Sveta (\\"A Ray of Light\\"). Vinberg personally introduced the Protocols of the Elders of Zion from Russia to Germany, and via his magazines, republished and promoted the Protocols while advocating the destruction of the world's Jewry. Later life In the wake of the Kapp Putsch of March 1920, Vinberg moved from Berlin to Munich. In 1921 he published in Russian a book, Krestny Put (The Way of the Cross\\"), translated into German as Via Dolorosa. There, in 1922, as a leading member of the conspiratorial Aufbau Vereinigung (Reconstruction Organisation)Kellogg calls him Aufbau's 'leading ideologue' (P168) he had lengthy and detailed discussions with Adolf Hitler on ideological matters.Kellogg p230 (information obtained by the French Secret Service) Later that year, under suspicion for his involvement in the assassination of Russian émigré Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, he moved to France, where he died in 1927.  Beliefs  Vinberg was a loyal Russian monarchist with an aristocratic contempt for the masses. He was much influenced by the anti-Semitic speculations in Fyodor Dostoyevsky's A Writer's Diary.Kellogg pp. 220 He called for \\"Aryan peoples\\" to unite against the \\"Jewish plan for world domination\\". For Russia, he advocated a return to the strong authority of the Tsar, which he hoped to restore, with German help. He also wanted Orthodoxy to unite with Catholicism and to learn from its methods in waging ideological war against the enemy, by anathematising the Freemasonry and all of Satan's servants \\"at Easter Week in all the churches and all the cathedrals of our homeland\\".Burbank p176 Burbank comments that it would be \\"in other words a nationwide pogrom\\". Walter Laqueur describes his ideas as \\"a half-way house between the old Black Hundred and National Socialism\\" and claims that Vinberg distinguished two kinds of anti-semitism: the \\"higher\\", concerned with restrictive laws against the Jews, and the \\"lower\\", the brutal and homicidal behaviour of the lower classes, which was terrible but essential if the Jewish menace, recently responsible for communist revolution, is finally to be laid to rest.Laqueur p129 David Redles mentions Vinberg's belief that the German and Russian peoples have to unite to defeat the Jews, which would result in world peace. Norman Cohn says that \\"in all his writings Vinberg insists that one way or another the Jews must be got rid of\\".Cohn p141 Although as a political programme his ideas could not be taken seriously, he correctly foresaw the propaganda success of the Protocols of Zion in Germany.Cohn p143 According to Kellogg, neither Vinberg nor his Aufbau colleagues publicly proposed \\"exterminating Jews along the lines of the National Socialist policy that became known as the Final Solution\\".Kellogg p236 Nevertheless, his apocalyptic language was so extreme that Laqueur concluded, \\"Vinberg is quite emphatic about this, the only solution is total physical extermination.\\"Laqueur p129 Richard Pipes writes that \\"it was Vinberg and his friends who first called publicly for the physical extermination of the Jews\\",Pipes p258 giving Laqueur as a reference. Notwithstanding Laqueur's conviction that his upper class ideas would have been of little interest or value to Hitler,\\"he was a madman but not a dangerous one\\" Laqueur p117 Vinberg appears to have been responsible for Hitler's conversion to the idea of worldwide Jewish-Bolshevist conspiracy.Kellogg p230 Also many of Alfred Rosenberg's own ideas were said to have been lifted straight from the writings of his friend Vinberg. Although his influence on Nazi thought declined following the failure of the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, when anti-Slav sentiment gained ascendancy in Nazi policy, Kellogg argues that the influence revived with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and that he bears some responsibility for the horrors that occurred.Kellogg pp. 278-280  Bibliography  *Ahad Ha'am. :Taĭnyĭ vozhdʹ īudeĭskīĭ.: Perevod s frantsuzskago :[of Miss L.

There was also a conservative artisanal rural tradition of French country furniture which remained unbroken until the advent of the railroads in the mid-nineteenth century. Provincial furniture Furniture made in provincial centers such as Blois and Orléans in the Loire valley, and at Lyon or Liège (Not part of France politically but within its cultural orbit), followed at some distance the design innovations that were initiated in the luxury trades of Paris, often with a time lag that could amount to decades. Features typically associated with French Provincial furniture include cabriole legs, and simple scalloped carving. Dining chairs often have a wheat pattern carving reflecting the country surroundings of the maker. The ladder back chair with a woven rush seat is the typical French Provincial dining chair. Finishes vary though common to all colours is the accumulation of polish or grime in the carving over time resulting in an aged patina and emphasis on the carving regardless of whether the furniture is painted or stained. Parisian furniture In the metropolitan culture of France, French furniture, connoting Parisian furniture, embodies one of the mainstreams of design in the decorative arts of Europe, extending its influence from Spain to Sweden and Russia, from the late seventeenth century to the last craft traditions in workshops like Jacques- Emile Ruhlmann, which came to an end only with the Second World War. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, French furniture of the classic period 1660-1815, has been collected as passionately by non-French amateurs, with the English in the historical lead,Much of the French furniture in the Royal Collection was purchased by George IV, beginning with his furnishing of Carlton House, London. and has set record prices consistently, since the Hamilton Palace sale of 1882,The Hamilton Palace Sale with the result that it is represented in many national museums. In Paris, an unbroken tradition of apprenticeship, already fully formed when the design center for luxury furnishings shifted from Antwerp to Paris in the 1630s, was slowly disrupted by the Industrial Revolution after the mid-nineteenth century. Perhaps the last of the Parisian ébénistes working from a traditional atelier was Émile- Jacques Ruhlmann (1879-1933). French royal furniture The grand tradition of French royal furniture received its impetus from the establishment of the Manufacture royale des Gobelins under the organisation of the arts in the service of Louis XIV of France that was controlled and directed by his minister of finance, Colbert. Favoured craftsmen would be eligible for premises in the galleries of the Palais du Louvre, a practice that had been initiated on a small scale under Henri IV. At the Gobelins, much more than tapestry was made for the furnishing of the royal palaces and the occasional ambassadorial gift: the celebrated silver furnishings for the Galerie des Glaces at Versailles was produced by silversmiths working to designs by Charles Le Brun at the Gobelins. Mid-18th century \\"Louis XV\\" seat furniture, with integrated flowing lines, and a lacquer-veneered Parisian commode, mounted in gilt bronze, (Château de Talcy) In Paris, the furniture trade was divided among craft guilds with jealous regard for infringements. Menuisiers were solely occupied with carved furnishings, which included beds and all seat furniture, as they were for the carved boiseries of the interiors they were destined to occupy. Carvers and gilders worked directly for them. Ébénistes, who drew their name from the ebony that they worked into cabinets that were carved in shallow relief and incorporated veneers of tortoiseshell and ivory, a specialty of Paris furniture in the mid-seventeenth century, retained their control over all carcase furniture that was intended to be veneered, often with elaborate marquetry. The bronze mounts that decorated these high-style case-pieces, from the 1660s to the abolition of guilds in the French Revolution, was furnished, and even carried to the ébéniste's workshop by separate guilds of foundrymen. An encoignure by royal cabinetmaker Jean-Pierre Latz circa 1750 is richly ornamented with marquetry and ormolu. French furniture of the Ancien Régime, often characterised by dealers and collectors by reign-names, as \\"Louis Quinze furniture\\", etc., can be seen as representative, even formative, manifestations of broader European styles: French Gothic furniture, of which so little has survived; French Renaissance furniture of the sixteenth century; Early Baroque furniture associated with Louis XIII, comparable to what was produced at Antwerp; sculptural and tectonic High Baroque furniture associated with Louis XIV; Rococo furniture, associated with the Régence and the reign of Louis XV; and Neoclassical furniture, associated with Louis XVI. French furniture of the Revolution and the First French Empire is imbued with a more severe, self-consciously archaeological phase of Neoclassicism, which began to lose its grip on styles in the 1830s, with Gothic and Rococo revivals, leading to the eclecticism of the French Second Empire. Art Nouveau provided one form of reaction to the battle of the historicist styles, and Modernism marked a more rigorous break with the past. Art Deco offered a decorative version of Modernism. Since the Second World War, the manufacture of furniture in France, devolved from the prominence of the capital itself, has been part of the increasingly international world of industrial design.

Location  The castle is located on the top of the Schlossberg ( above sea level) in the Rhine rift in the neighbourhood of Breisach. The height difference between the town in the valley and the former castle is about 150 m (460 ft). Hoehingen was an important castle for centuries. The distance to the strategically important and hard-fought fortification Breisach was just about 7 km (4.5 mi). The reason for the strategic importance lies in the topographic situation which allows only two narrow passages for north-south routes of commerce on the right side of the Rhine. One route goes between Riegel and the Black Forest and the other one between Breisach and Achkarren. Besides this, the Burg Höhingen played a counterpart to the more important Breisach during the changing history that was punctuated by war - particularly in the times of the Thirty Years' War.  History  The Schlossberg seen from the town of Achkarren. Engraving by Matthäus Merian from 1644 AD seen from the west (Rhine Rift). Only little is known about the beginnings of the first castle buildings on the top of the Schloßberg. But there are references of first castle buildings in the year 1064 AD when the town Achkarren was mentioned first time in documents on the occasion of the giving of the village to the cloister of Ottmarsheim (a small Town in Alsace) by King Henry IV. In the following centuries the buildings have been extended several times. The first documented reference of the castle dates from the year 1259 AD. After surviving for centuries, the castle was burned down in 1525 AD during the German Peasants' War with participation of the peasants of Achkarren. In 1620 AD, the castle was extended into a strong defensive fortification because the Schlossberg gave excellent views of the war events in the Rhine valley and the fortification of Breisach. In a contemporary report from Breisach's mayor to the imperial governor of the lands of Further Austria in Waldshut the castle is described as follows: \\"The location (of the castle) is excellent, because it stands atop a hill and stands on hard rock, which is hard to access because of its steepness and therefore cannot be commanded by any nearby town. The building is constructed of heavy stonework, surrounded on one side by a deep trench and an unaccessible praecipitium (=sheer) on the other side, which was used as a quarry. The castle possesses a good cistern.\\" In 1633 AD, the castle was attacked from Breisach. The Catholic troops of the emperor succeeded in conquering and plundering the castle which had been occupied by the Swedes who were supported by the Protestant inhabitants of Ihringen. According to reports, the booty included, amongst other things, about 15,000 litres of wine. The property of the inhabitants of Ihringen, which was stored in the castle, was totally lost. Reports tell of a loss of 200 horses and about 300 head of cattle, which gives an indication of the size of the castle. After several serious disputes the castle finally was burned down by the emperor's occupying forces when they lost the ability to hold the castle. Because from 1671 AD on it was officially allowed to use the stones of the resulting ruins for the fortifications in Breisach and later for private houses, today only poor relics of the ruins can be seen.  Appearance  Detail of the castle from the engraving by Matthäus Merian An impression of the possible appearance of the castle from an engraving by Matthäus Merian from 1644.

The film was released in 1983, and has grossed $4.3 million. Mortuary was officially released on DVD for the first time on May 25, 2012, followed by a limited Blu-ray release on October 7, 2014. Plot Wealthy psychiatrist Dr. Parson is bludgeoned and drowned in his pool, an incident his daughter Christie believes was murder, but which her mother Eve insists was an accident. Several weeks later, Josh, an ex-employee at a local mortuary, sneaks into the mortuary warehouse with Christie's boyfriend Greg, planning to steal tires as compensation for unpaid wages from his boss, Hank Andrews. Inside, the two men observe an occult sabbath, which Josh is impervious to, having been fired for witnessing one before. While retrieving the tires, Josh is stabbed to death with a trocar by a cloaked assailant. Shortly after, Greg observes Josh's van speed away. Later that night, Greg and Christie search for Josh at the local roller skating rink, but cannot find him. The following day, Christie is pursued by a car en route to her family's secluded coastal mansion. After an argument with her mother, Christie is accosted by a hooded figure at the pool. She flees into the house, and Eve assures her it was only a dream. The next day, Greg confesses to Christie that he saw Eve in attendance at the sabbath he witnessed at the mortuary. Christie suspects her mother and Hank, whom Eve began dating only weeks after her husband's death, may have murdered Christie's father, and are orchestrating a plot to drive her insane. Meanwhile, Paul, Hank's son and an embalmer at the mortuary, vies for Christie's attention. She and Greg dismiss his eccentricities on his mentally-ill mother's recent suicide. That night, Greg and Christie spend time alone in her home, but are subjected to various electronic interruptions, such as lights turning on and off, and the stereo playing by itself. The next day, Greg and Christie follow Eve to the mortuary, where they observe her engaging in a séance, attempting to contact her late husband. That night, Christie is attacked by a cloaked figure resembling Paul, and smashes a glass window, startling her mother. Eve assumes it to have been a nightmare, but asks Christie if the alleged attacker could have been Paul; she explains that Paul was a patient of Christie's father, and that he had been obsessed with her. After Christie and Eve return to their bedrooms, a cloaked figure viciously stabs Eve to death while she lay in bed. The assailant, revealed to be Paul donning a white latex mask, chases Christie through the house. He attempts to stab her, but she unmasks him before he renders her unconscious. He brings her to the mortuary, where he begins the process of embalming her alive, but is stopped when Hank arrives. Paul explains that he had to \\"punish\\" Eve for telling Christie about his psychiatric condition, and that he had murdered Dr. Parson for previously having him incarcerated. Paul stabs his father in a rage, killing him, before being confronted by Greg, who has come searching for Christie. Paul manages to lock Greg in the embalming room. Paul takes Christie and the corpses of Eve and his father to the warehouse, where he has arranged a makeshift wedding ceremony for himself and Christie. Surrounded by the preserved bodies of his victims, Paul pretends to conduct a Mozart symphony; among them is the body of Paul's mother, whose death he faked and whom he has induced into a coma. As he attempts to cut Christie's throat with a scalpel, Paul is attacked by Greg, who has broken free and armed himself with an axe. In the mélee, Christie begins to sleepwalk, and proceeds to take the axe and drive it into Paul's back, killing him. Greg and Christie embrace, before Mrs. Andrews suddenly awakens from her coma, lunging at the couple with a knife.

In 1993, Kommer led a voluntary formation of the Estonian army, the Läänemaa Vabatahtlik Jäägrikompanii. The formation was ordered to requarter from Haapsalu to Paldiski. Concerned about an inevitable confrontation with much larger Russian military units who were still quartered on the base, he refused the order on behalf of his company. Estonian military command responded by issuing an order relieving Kommer from duty, which Kommer did not honour, leading to the Pullapää crisis, which ended in Kommer's conviction of several crimes and resignation of two ministers.  Pullapää crisis  In 1991, Kommer became a shooting range instructor of the Pärnu branch of Estonian Defence League. By 1993, he had risen to be a leader of the Läänemaa Vabatahtlike Jäägerkompanii. On 6 July 1993, his company was ordered to requarter from Haapsalu to a former Soviet base in Paldiski. Concerned about an inevitable confrontation with much larger Russian military units who were still quartered on the base, he refused the order on behalf of his company. Estonian authorities responded by relieving him from duty and demobilising the unit, but both of these orders were refused. By end of July, the (now demobilised) company and a number of its civilian supporters were preparing for a battle at Pullapää, but this didn't occur. Instead, Hain Rebas, then Estonian Minister of Defence, resigned on 3 August 1993, and, the military opposition having wound down, the crisis was further handled as a criminal rather than military matter. On 4 September 1993, Asso Kommer and two other men took a businessman, Pavel Kalmõkov, into their car in Tallinn, and Kalmõkov ended up missing. (Later, on 9 December, Kommer directed the investigators to the place of Kalmõkov's burial.) On 26 November 1993, a firefight between Kommer and police occurred, under unclear circumstances, and Koit Pikaro and Argo Aunapuu, two police officials, end up wounded by bullets fired by Kommer. Kommer was arrested the same day. On the next day, 27 November 1993, however, Lagle Parek, Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs, resigned over the incident. = Sentence = On 26 November 1993, Kommer was convicted of unlawful imprisonment, resisting arrest with lethal force (he wounded two policemen, Koit Pikaro and Argo Aunapuu), and of military rebellion, and sentenced to six years and six months of imprisonment. He requested a pardon from Lennart Meri, then President of Estonia, but it was denied. He was ultimately released in 1998 on account of good behaviour. = Feud with Koit Pikaro = During arrest of Kommer, he shot several bullets into a leg of Koit Pikaro, then an employee of Estonian police, under circumstances that are not entirely clear. This began a long feud between him and Pikaro, mostly manifested by occasional hostile statements made in public press.  Professional affairs  Having been released from imprisonment, Kommer became an instructor of the Estonian Boy Scout organisation's Pärnu branch. In 1999, a controversy emerged when it was made public that as a part of his instruction's survival training programme, he had demonstrated to his group skinning and field preparation as food of a domestic cat.Postimees 17 April 1999: Endine jäägrijuht Kommer õpetas skaute kassi sööma In a public explanation, Kommer stressed that the cat hadn't been stray, nor was it stolen, but its owner, a local farmer who was in trouble with its custom of killing chickens, had given it to Kommer's group. As of 2007, Kommer is still a Boy Scout instructor.Estonian Scout Union: Hundumatk 29.–30.

Ain Seppik, who back in 1993 had belonged in a commission investigating Kommer's activities and who is now a member of the board of Keskerakond supported Pikaro's opposition, leading to the board not accepting the application, and requesting the local Pärnu branch office of the party to reconsider. Five months later, Pärnu branch office decided to defer the decision until 2007, possibly until after a new board of Keskerakond would be elected.Postimees/BNS 19 November 2006: Pärnu keskerakondlased võtsid Kommeri osas aja maha As of September 2007, no final decision is known to have been published.

Kit Lively from Hysteria Lives! awarded the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing, \\"Although no film with David Hess, Mimsy Farmer AND Charles Napier could be a complete waste of time, Body Count is still fairly routine. In addition to some fairly bad dialogue, it also features the most annoying variation on the chubby practical-joker character that I've ever seen, and it takes entirely too long for the killer to end the audience's discomfort.

In the 17th century the Palazzina dell’Orologio, with dominant clock tower, was constructed. The gardens were created in the second half of the 17th century, in the Giardino all'italiana style, influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens and Baroque gardens. Features ;The features include: *Teatro d'Acqua — Theatre of Water; fountains, statues, prominent pebble mosaic and tufa exhedra axis terminus.Plumptre, George: \\"The Water Garden\\", page 54.

She acquired the adjacent Villa del Vescovo with its sixteenth-century Italian Renaissance garden and grotto, and other bordering properties, which doubled the estate's size. Reale (royal) joined the property's name, to become Villa Reale di Marlia, or locally Villa Reale. The property had become an official royal residence to serve her upon becoming the Duchess of Lucca and Princess of Piombino, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, and Countess of Compignano — with the power as the monarch to rule over these Tuscan territories granted by Napoleon. In 1811 Elisa Bonaparte had the villa renovated in the Neoclassical style, and the Neoclassical pair of palazzine gatehouses and entrance elements were built. From the Villa del Vescovo gardens the elaborate nymphaeum pavilion, Grotta del Dio Pan or Pan’s Grotto, was left in Baroque splendor. The lower original Italian gardens were redesigned into an expansive English landscape park, then in fashion. It has the Laghetto or Small Lake, as a reflective focal point and water garden, with a broad terrace accented by statues. Bonaparte added naturalistic groups of trees to transition into the woodland gardens. In 1814, after her brother's downfall and exile, Bonaparte was replaced as monarch by the victorious Bourbons, and Marie Louise Borbón of the House of Bourbon-Parma became the Duchess of Lucca and owner of Villa Reale di Marlia. Lorenzo Nottolini was commissioned to construct the Specola, an observatory, in the lower garden of the landscape park. 20th-21st centuries The estate was acquired by the Count Pecci—Blunt family in 1923, who restored the villa and follies, and the gardens were replanted with the original plant selections. The Giardino Spagnolo, a Moorish Spanish Garden with fountains and rills, and Art Deco design influences, was created to connect the 17th century Palazzina dell’Orologio and Grotta del Dio Pan. In 2015 the Villa Reale Di Marlia was sold. The villa will return to host cultural events such as Lucca Classica Music Festival, the Exhibition of Ancient Camellias of Lucca, and the Festival Le Rinascenze. Meanwhile, the gardens are open to the public and can be visited paying an entrance ticket.

Speculation as to why the Alabama–Auburn series was discontinued was originally thought to have been done as a safety precaution due violence both on the field and amongst the fans in the 1907 game. Instead, the game was canceled due to a disagreement between the schools on how much per diem to allow players for the trip to Birmingham, how many players each school should bring and where to find officials, and by the time all these matters were resolved, it was too late to play in 1908. For forty years the two teams failed to play each other, even though they were in the same state and members of the same conferences. Finally, pressure from the state legislature resulted in the renewal of the rivalry in 1948.

Miller and starring Robert Carradine, Nicholas Bell, Brian Wimmer and Stacy Haiduk. It was filmed on location in Fiji Islands and premiered on the Sci Fi Channel on July 14, 2005. Niles, a multimillionaire, creates a new resort and theme park on an island in Fiji that features genetically-engineered sabre-tooth cats. He brings a huge group of investors, and a group of student tourists to the island to show off his creation, only to have a power failure result in the cats getting loose. The students and the park personnel try to avoid the bloodthirsty cats as they munch their way through every human in sight. Plot On a remote island, a Primal Park security guard enters a locked restricted area, where a sabre-tooth cat kills him. As Alan performs an inspection, Niles takes his ex-brother-in-law Grant and Autumn to a hotel where other investors are waiting. Security guards Savannah and Sundip ignore an alert on a gate, but Alan insists on checking it. College students Kirk, Alaina, Robbie, Alys, and Collette arrive to complete a scavenger hunt, and Niles takes them to the hotel. After reporting an open gate, Alan finds the dead guard, and a sabretooth kills him. Sundip radios Savannah to let her know about the breach. As the students break into a shopping center complex, Savannah learns the cats have not returned to their pens. After Niles' pitch to investors, Savannah recommends to him they shut down the park, but he refuses. Kirk and Robbie set off an alarm. When Robbie and Alys hack into the computer system to turn it off, they accidentally release all the sabretooths. Sundip discovers the dead guards, but is unable to contact Savannah because the security system is down. A sabretooth kills him as he hunts it. The students split up to find their objects. Savannah and Brian discover the power is out and the cats have free run of the island. Brian meets up with Sachariah in the park area, where Sachariah lets him know he was able to get the cats back in their pens. As the students locate their objects, Brian and Savannah fail to get the system back up. Niles takes Grant and the other investors to the shopping area, and the students split up to avoid being caught. As Brian works on the main switch board, a sabretooth kills Alaina. Robbie hears her screams, runs to help, but is too late; he flees to the lab. Sachariah tells Savannah the cats are loose because of the power failure, and she decides to kill them despite Sachariah's objections. Brian finds Alys and Collette, who tell him there are two more kids to find. When Autumn complains of feeling ill, Niles takes her and Grant to his office. Niles reveals to Grant the planned zoo will feature a mated pair of nearly 800 lbs sabretooth cats, but Niles refuses to allow Grant, who doubts he has the cats, to invest. Once Niles leaves, Autumn cracks his safe and steals his research. Brian and the girls arrive in the lab and find Robbie. Savannah finally reaches Brian on the radio, but the transmissions are too garbled to understand. While Brian leads the students to safety, they run into the female sabretooth. After hiding the students in a nearby room, Brian uses himself as bait, lures the cat into the lab, and kills it via an explosion. Brian tells the students there is another, larger male still on the loose. As Kirk and a drunk investor make out, the male sabretooth tiger kills her; Kirk runs off. Brian and the kids run into Sachariah, who reveals there are three cats total, not two. The third one, which Niles kept secret, is one ton and can only move around by dragging itself. He also reveals that all three cats are bulimic, which means they must constantly eat. When Savannah tells Niles about Alaina's death, he blows it off, and she leaves angrily. Back in the complex, Robbie offers to fix the system if they can get to the control center. Niles orders Brian to find and save the cats, but Brian refuses. The male sabretooth kills Kirk before Brian shoots it. As Robbie fixes the system, the male cat kills Sacharaiah. Savannah warns the investors to leave. In the park, a cat kills Grant, but Autumn does not notice. As Brian tracks the male's blood trail, Savannah finds the deformed cat. Niles attacks her, but he flees when the cat approaches, only to be accidentally killed by a sabretooth cat model. Savannah kills the deformed cat as Brian arrives. He tells her he shot the other cat and that it probably crawled off to die. They get the students and leave, while the male cat kills Autumn.

It is commonly believed that the Queen Anne style 1889 depot burned down on March 5, 1917, but newspaper reports from the time say it was unsightly and, except for the baggage wing, demolished.Salem Depots Historic Explanation.pdf The current Beaux-Arts-style structure was designed by Southern Pacific's Chief Architect John H. Christie. It is constructed of masonry, and is one of five masonry depots that still exist along the original Southern Pacific West Coast line. The other depots are in Albany, Medford, Roseburg and Eugene. A restoration project by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) was completed in 2000. Amtrak leases the station from ODOT for $1 a year, in exchange for maintenance of the building and grounds. An 1889 Railway Express Agency (REA) freight depot/baggage shed from the previous station was kept and is the oldest freight depot still in existence in the state. Either after the 1917 fire or in preparation for constructing the new depot, the Queen Anne-style REA depot was relocated from its original site to the south. The REA depot had not been used since the mid-1970s, but ODOT restored it in the late 2000s for use by Greyhound.Communications Salem Railroad Baggage Depot Project The station and baggage depot were added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 12, 2010. In 2011, daily ridership on Amtrak between Salem and Portland reached 24,146 boardings. Greyhound Lines moved operations from its downtown station to here in 2013, first to the north wing of the station building and, upon completion of renovations in 2018, to the former freight shed.

Chronology  On 6 July 1993, Läänemaa Vabatahtlike Jäägerkompanii, a volunteer formation of the Estonian Army led by Asso Kommer, was ordered to requarter from Haapsalu to Paldiski. Concerned about an inevitable confrontation with much larger Russian military units who were still quartered on the base, he refused the order on behalf of his company. On 23 July, Aleksander Einseln issued an order relieving Kommer from duty and directing him to take a training course for officers, but Kommer also refused this order. On 25 July, the company expressed their support for Kommer and announced they'd \\"withdraw\\" from Estonian military command structure. Estonian government responded by demobilising the whole unit on 27 July, but once again, the company refused the order. The next day, the company left the facilities of Paldiski and went to Pullapää. Estonian military moved the Kuperjanov battalion, complete with armour units, to Jägala, and, by all appearance, prepared for an attack, but this didn't, in the end, happen. However, Kommer's company, who had received a rumour that the President, Lennart Meri, had ordered an attack to begin at 16:00 on 31 July, prepared for such attack, and a number of members of the Defence League, as well as several women, joined the company in the preparations. The rumour's source has not been tracked down. On 2 August, Estonian Internal Security Service arrested Jaak Mosin, a deputy leader of the (by then, demobilised) company Kommer was leading. As a response, the company withdrew its 25 June statement. On 3 August, Hain Rebas, the minister of defence, resigned. The military opposition wound down, and the crisis was further handled as a criminal rather than military matter. On 12 August, a criminal investigation was launched against Asso Kommer and Jaak Mosin, on suspicion of abuse of power. On 4 September, Asso Kommer and two other men took a businessman, Pavel Kalmõkov, into their car in Tallinn, and Kalmõkov ended up missing. (Later, on 9 December, Kommer directed the investigators to the place of Kalmõkov's burial.) On 12 September, Jaak Mosin, who had been released pending investigation, fled to Sweden and requested political asylum. On 26 November, a firefight between Kommer and police occurred, under unclear circumstances, and Koit Pikaro and Argo Aunapuu, two police officials, end up wounded by bullets fired by Kommer. However, Kommer was successfully arrested the same day. On the next day, however, Lagle Parek, Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs, resigned over the incident. On 26 November 1993, Asso Kommer was convicted of several crimes of these events, and sentenced to six years and six months of imprisonment.  Analysis  Comparable incidents of military insurrections also happened in Latvia and Lithuania around the same time. Accordingly, Johannes Kert, an Estonian general, has expressed his conclusion that these were incited by a common foreign agent. No foreign involvement in any of these incidents has been proven; however, it is known that a member of Russian Federation's army had offered Russian citizenship to the whole company, \\"should the need arise\\". A commonly cited background for the incident is Estonian military administrators' inability to organise acceptable living standards, and an approach, considered by some provocative or overly bureaucratic, towards the soldiers' petitions and complaints. (At least two such petitions by members of the Jäägrikompanii had gone unanswered, and a third had been answered on basis of insubordination rather than addressing the issues presented.) These problems might have ended triggering the active rebellion when the restationing order was issued. However, the restationing order itself is surrounded by obscurity. Several months later, Hain Rebas, the Estonian Minister of Defence who resigned over the incident, testified to a governmental commission that he didn't know who had initiated the restationing. Asso Kommer has declared that the order was a provocation by the Estonian Army's staff of generals, and that it is this provocation that led to the unit's withdrawal from Estonian military command structure. It is also generally accepted, and explicitly stated by Lagle Parek, the Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs who resigned over the incident, that several opposition politicians used the incident's background in an opportunist manner, to deliberately incite the conflict. Jüri Pihl has traced Kommer's support to Tiit Made, Kalle Eller, Jüri Toomepuu, Katrin Linde, and noted the company's contacts with Hardo Aasmäe, Tiit Madisson and Jüri Põld. Hain Rebas has implied that the incident was masterminded by Tiit Made, who, according to him, might have been plotting a military coup. This was supported by circumstantial evidence collected during the criminal investigation; however, this evidence didn't lead to any further convictions. Made, nor any other politician (of 1993) has never been officially charged with the rebellion, or incitement to rebellion. (Asso Kommer's official political career began only in 2006, when he applied for membership of Keskerakond, but the application has been stalled for more than a year.) On the other hand, Jüri Toomepuu, who publicly supported activities of Jäägrikompanii, claimed that Trivimi Velliste's activities were influenced by a foreign power or foreign powers. Kalle Kulbok, a member of Riigikogu during the time and a leader of the Independent Royalist Party of Estonia, has said that the military preparations were centered on containment rather than attack, and Estonian army would only have fired if the Jäägrikompanii would have fired first.  Aspects of vigilantism  In the 1990s, police suspected that members of the Jäägrikompanii were involved in murdering and burial of about 30 ethnic Russians involved with the (now probably defunct) Perm mafia group. The company might have considered itself one of few forces capable of avoiding a supposed invasion by Russian organised crime interests. The company might in this context have behaved largely as a mere military arm of the Linnuvabriku mafia group consisting mostly of ethnic Estonians. (The Linnuvabriku group and the Perm mafia group were involved in the so-called \\"metal war\\" over possession of large coloured metal shipments. In particular, a shipment of cobalt has been implicated.) For an example, an incident involving Jäägrikompanii members forcing to stop several members of the Perm mafia group, whose corpses were later found in Jõgevamaa, buried in a farm belonging to a Linnuvabriku mafioso's mother.

A third great nephew and Brady brother, Pat was also a professional footballer. A fourth great nephew, Frank, won the FAI Cup with Shamrock Rovers in 1968. Brady played twice for the Irish Free State during the 1920s. He made his international debut in a 3–0 away defeat against Italy on 21 March 1926. His teammates on that day included Harry Cannon, Jack McCarthy and Bob Fullam. Brady was a controversial inclusion in the team. At the time he was in dispute with his club, Fordsons, having been dropped for an FAI Cup replay against Shelbourne on 16 January. He took no further part in his club's successful cup campaign and did not retain his place until after his return from Italy. However, during this time he played for a League of Ireland XI in a 3–1 win against an Irish League XI and impressed the selectors. In the subsequent game against Italy he played at right-back and, despite finishing on the losing side, put in an impressive performance. Brady won his second cap on 23 April 1927 against an Italy B team in a 2–1 defeat at Lansdowne Road. Playing as a left-back, Brady captained a team that also included Tommy Muldoon, Mick O'Brien, Joe Kendrick, Harry Duggan, Bob Fullam and Bill Lacey.

Early life Lynch, initially named Jeremiah, was born in Granig, Tracton, County Cork. His mother died while he was young and his father, who had remarried, died when Diarmuid was thirteen years of age. In his autobiography, Lynch recalls being taken to a political meeting in Cork city by his father in 1886 which was addressed by Charles Stewart Parnell. He also describes attending a monster Land League rally at Minane Bridge which was addressed by William O'Brien and Dr. Charles Tanner MP. He was politically influenced by his teachers, particularly Michael McCarthy, head master at Knocknamana National School. Career Like other ambitious rural Irishmen of his generation, such as Michael Collins and J.J. Walsh, Lynch found employment in the Postal service. He began working as a sorting clerk in the Cork GPO and studied at Skerry's College for entrance to the Civil Service. In an open competitive examination he secured a place as a \\"Boy Clerk\\" at the Mount Pleasant money order office, London. Mount Pleasant would play a very significant part in the growth of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), because it was here that individuals such as Collins, Sam Maguire and others first became acquainted. Lynch himself would become a member of the IRB Supreme Council. While in London he played hurling with the London Gaels. =Emigration to US= Lynch accepted an offer of employment from his uncle Cornelius Dunlea in New York. His skill as an organiser was soon recognised having joined the New York Philo-Celtic Society in the summer of 1897. By December of that year, he had been elected secretary. Within a short period, membership in the organisation had almost quadrupled. The primary function of the society was the preservation of the Irish language and culture in the Irish-American nationalist community. Lynch \\"was convinced that restoration of the Irish language would increase the self respect of the Irish people.\\" His activities in New York, and in particular his work for the Irish language, saw him elevated to the position of the State President of the Gaelic League of the State of New York. It was this role which would bring him to the attention of the Clan na Gael leadership of John Devoy, its president, and Daniel F. Cohalan, two of the most important figures in Irish-American politics. It was Lynch and his persuasive powers that influenced Judge Cohalan to accept \\"that the propagation of the language, instead of hindering the objective of the Clan, was essential to its achievement.\\"National Council, 18 June 1920, NY, Irish American Historical Society, FOIF papers As Lynch's reputation grew so did his sphere of influence. Before he returned to Ireland in 1907, he could boast a circle of friends, including Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Dr Thomas Addis Emmet, Richard O'Sullivan Burke, John J. Breslin and Tom Clarke. Having spent almost eleven years in America, Lynch decided to return to Ireland. He had been back in 1902 for a short period, when, with the aid of Liam de Róiste, he had organised an Irish cultural feis at Minane Bridge. Return to Ireland On his return to Ireland, he was employed by Thomas McKenzie & Sons, Dublin, a large wholesaler of agricultural supplies. He later joined the IRB at the invitation of Seán T. O'Kelly. By 1911 he had been appointed to the IRB Supreme Council as the Divisional Representative for Munster. Lynch played a role in the planning of the 1916 Easter Rising. He was chosen by Patrick Pearse to go to Tralee and identify the best area to land German arms. Lynch reported directly to Pearse that Fenit would be the most secure location for the proposed landing. At this time, he was the only member of the IRB Supreme Council to attend meetings of the even more secret IRB Military Council. After Eoin MacNeill cancelled the orders for the planned manoeuvres over the Easter period, Lynch attended a hastily arranged meeting at 27 Hardwick Street, which also included Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Joseph Mary Plunkett and Seán Mac Diarmada, at which it was decided to go ahead with the Rising. Easter Rising Lynch was aide-de-camp to James Connolly and Staff Captain in the GPO during the Rising. He was also considered to be the last man to leave the GPO. Initially sentenced to death, his sentence was, like Éamon de Valera's, commuted to life, because of his American citizenship. Lynch was sent to prison in England, but was released from Pentonville Prison on 16 June 1917. Sinn Féin reorganisation Immediately following his release, Lynch became active again, and, along with Michael Collins and Thomas Ashe, participated in the reorganisation of the IRB. After the 1917 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis, Lynch, like Collins, held three senior posts in the IRB, Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers. His position as Sinn Féin food controller resulted in his deportation to England in 1918. During this period much of the Irish agricultural produce was being sent to Britain to support the war effort. Lynch ordered that a specific shipment of pigs at the North wall ready for shipment to England be slaughtered for the Irish market and the money given to owners of the stock. He was arrested and sentenced to deportation, but before this was enforced he was secretly married. His fiancée Mary Quinn and a priest were smuggled into Dundalk Jail and Lynch was married. This event was a propaganda coup as the British authorities had originally refused permission for the marriage. Return to the US When Lynch was deported to America he thought \\"It certainly greatly enhanced the prestige of Sinn Fein...the party of action and not of talk\\". They dedicated a new ballad \\"The Pig Push\\" to Lynch: \\"We'll have pig's cheeks and pork chops enough for you and me, there'll be rashers for our breakfast and some sausages for tea.\\"\\"The Big Push\\" dedicated to Diarmuid Lynch the IRA's Food Controller. Lynch threateningly said \\"there'll hear G Division squeal as far off as Berlin\\".'The Big Push', National Library of Ireland MS 5657., cited by Townshend, p.25. Shortly afterwards he was appointed Secretary of the Friends of Irish Freedom, originally set up to raise funds and lobby in Washington DC to promote the Irish cause for independence.Townshend, Charles, \\"The Republic: The Fight For Irish Independence\\", (Penguin 2014), p.70. Under his tenure, the organisation became nationwide, and on 4 March 1919, as a result of its lobbying, Congress voted 216 to 41 to adopt the following motion: \\"That it is the earnest hope of the United states of America that the peace conference, now sitting in Paris, in passing upon the rights of various peoples, will favourably consider the claims of Ireland to the right of self-determination.\\" While this was not what the recognition of the Irish Republic which Lynch, Devoy and Colohan had sought, it was a call for Ireland to present its case at the Versailles Peace Conference. In the 1918 general election after Eugene Crean MP stood down, Lynch was returned unopposed while in absentia in America. He became Teachta Dála (TD) in the First Dáil for Cork South East. =Tension with De Valera= The arrival of Éamon de Valera to America in 1919 was followed by the establishment of a rival organisation to the Friends of Irish Freedom. In 1920, Lynch resigned his Dáil seat in sympathy with Devoy and Colohan. He wrote a letter of resignation in July 1920, which was read out to the Dáil the following month. In it he said that: \\"Differences have arisen since July 1919, between De Valera and the recognised leaders of the movement here as to the proper conduct of the campaign in America for the recognition of the Irish Republic and these circumstances have governed my actions in resigning.\\" De Valera and Lynch would again become embroiled in a bitter battle in 1929, when associates of De Valera tried unsuccessfully to claim the unused funds raised by the Friends of Irish Freedom in 1919 and 1920. De Valera sought to claim this money to establish the Irish Press. Lynch's eventual victory in the case was attributable to his record-keeping and organisational skills. Civil War and later life Lynch played no part in the Irish Civil War, but along with his IRB comrade Seán O'Hegarty, made several unsuccessful attempts to stop it. In an impassioned letter, written in 1922 to the members of Friends of Irish Freedom, he wrote: \\"Our influence may be exercised towards securing for Ireland the greatest need of the moment – Peace.\\" In 1933 he returned to Ireland, living initially in Mallow but settling in Tracton, County Cork. He contributed to the work of the Bureau of Military History in collecting witness statements from those who had taken part in the War of Independence and in reviewing historical publications. He attempted to run for the Senate in 1944 but was not successful. Lynch died in 1950 and his funeral took place at Minane Bridge in County Cork.http://feniangraves.net/Lynch,%20Diarmaid/Lynch%20Bio.htm References Sources * De Blacam, Aodh, What Sinn Fein stands for: The Irish Republican Movement, its History, Arms and Ideals (Dublin 1921) * Lynch, Diarmuid & Florence O'Donoghue : The IRB and the 1916 insurrection, Cork: Mercier Press, 1957. * Group photograph with Harry Boland, De Valera, John Devoy, Liam Mellows and Pat McCartan.

It has a much milder abrasive effect than sandblasting. An early use was in the conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty in the 1980s. Sodablasting is a non-destructive method for many applications in cleaning, paint and varnish stripping, automotive restoration, industrial equipment maintenance, rust removal, graffiti removal, molecular steel passivation against rust, oil removal by saponification and translocation, masonry cleaning and restoration, soot remediation, boat hull cleaning and for food processing facilities and equipment and tooth cleaning at the dental laboratory. Applications Sodablasting can be used for cleaning timber, wood, oak beams, oak floors, doors, stairs & banisters, cars, boat hulls, masonry, and food processing equipment. Sodablasting can also be used to remove graffiti and to clean structural steel. Sodablasting is very effective for mold and fire/smoke damage cleanup as it cleans and deodorizes. Equipment Sodablasting A sodablaster is a self-contained system that includes a blast generator, high pressure compressed air, moisture decontamination system, blast hose, and a blast nozzle. The blasting material consists of formulated sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda). Blasting soda is an extremely friable material that undergoes micro fragmentation on impact, literally exploding away surface materials without damage to the substrate. Since sodium bicarbonate is much softer than the silicon carbide or aluminium oxide used in sandblasting, the blast nozzle used for sodablasting applications can be made of soft metals such as brass or steel. The pressures used are very low compared to those used in sandblasting, e.g. 20psi as opposed to 120psi.

Although sources are not readily available, Buddhists are believed to constitute 0.1% of the total population in Ukraine. History Despite the fact that on a superficial level Buddhism was known in Ukraine long ago due to the regular contacts of the Ukrainian Cossacks with the Kalmyks, who profess Buddhism, the interest in Buddhism in its philosophical and ethical aspects among the Ukrainian cultural and scientific intelligentsia arose not earlier than in the 19th century. Closer acquaintance with Buddhism was interrupted in the Soviet period, when any interest in religious teachings different from Soviet ideology was persecuted. As a result, such interest could not be fully satisfied and, moreover, grow into certain organizations. Therefore, the first open systematic lectures on Buddhism, sermons and lessons on Buddhist studies, date back to 1989, when the political and ideological pressure of the Soviet system was considerably eased. At that time the first Buddhist teachings took place in Ukraine, and the first secular followers of Buddhism appeared, they took Buddhist refuge in the Three Jewels: Buddha, the Teaching (Dharma) and the Community (Sangha). Ukraine’s first officially registered Buddhist community was set up in the village of Ol'hynka, Volnovakha Raion, Donetsk Oblast in 1991, and in 1993 Buddhist Center Lunh-zhonh-pa (which means \\"The Wardens of the Commandments\\" in the Tibetan language) was built there. This school conducts both lay and monastic activities. Contemporary Development Today Ukraine has nearly 100 Buddhist communities and groups, 38 of them are officially registered and enjoy the status of legal entity. The largest communities and groups belong to the Tibetan tradition in Buddhism, that is, the tantric tradition of Vajrayana (\\"Diamond Vehicle\\"). The most widespread among them are Karma Kagyu communities, the main branch of the Tibetan Kagyu-pa School. They are united into the All-Ukraine Religious Center Ukrainian Association of Karma Kagyu Buddhists. In Ukraine, the religious studies of this center are intended for laypeople. Communities and groups of followers of this tradition are present in almost all regional centers of Ukraine.\\" There is a Drikung Kagyu center which was officially registered in Kyiv on 2006 in order to fulfill a joint aspiration of H.E. Garchen Rinpoche and his students. The Center is a part of global community of the Garchen Rinpoche’s Centers. During the last ten years, Garchen Rinpoche visited Kyiv four times. Many Drikung Kagyu masters and teachers has visited the Center in the past years. Among them H.E. Garchen Rinpoche, Khenchen Rinpoche, Nubpa Rinpoche, Drupon Tsering Rinpoche, Drupon Yeshe Rinpoche, Drupon Tsering Rinpoche, Lama Dawa Zang, Drupon Yeshe Zangmo, Khenpo Samdrup.

Under the guidance of Gyetrul Jigme Rinpoche \\"Ripa\\" center was founded. International Dzogchen Community also have number of its followers and communities in Ukraine. It developed as a separate Buddhist School in the West in the late 20th century through the efforts of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, the Tibetan Lama in emigration. Like Karma Kagyu, this school is oriented to lay Buddhists in Ukraine.

Starring Robin Askwith as football-mad milkman Dave Deacon, the series mined comedy of the broadest sort from randy Dave's amorous adventures, in a style similar to the Confessions films which had also featured Askwith. However, as well as the sexual innuendo of his earlier big-screen adventures, Askwith was equally likely to find himself embroiled in more off-the-wall exploits, and found himself at various points in the series dressing up as a cow, inadvertently engaged to Sharon the secretary, and meeting then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (played by an actor). The part of Dave Deacon was originally written for Jim Davidson, who was by this time moving into sitcom with Up the Elephant and Round the Castle, also on ITV. Future BBC controller John Birt, during his tenure at London Weekend Television, suggested that Askwith take the part. Critical reception The series has acquired something of a reputation as one of the worst British sitcoms ever produced. Mark Lewisohn, writing in the Radio Times Guide to Comedy observes that \\"ITV sitcoms had often plumbed the depths, but this was the limit\\", and also notes that Bottle Boys was reputedly despised by comedy executives at ITV. He described Bottle Boys as his \\"worst ever\\" British sitcom. Writer Vince Powell was no stranger to working on shows that attracted a bad press, however, having created two of the most controversial comedy shows of the 1970s: Love Thy Neighbour and Mind Your Language. The programme also made number 97 in Channel Four's 100 Greatest TV Moments from Hell list show, a retrospective of television's low points of the last fifty years.

The process was used on U.K. Decca recordings and also those of its American subsidiary London Records during the 1960s. Phase 4 Stereo recordings were created with an innovative 10-channel, and later 20-channel, \\"recording console\\" (actually a mixing console.) The concept of Phase 4 Stereo has no connection with Quadraphonic sound or \\"four channel stereo.\\" But because there often are sounds in the extreme right or extreme left channels, the records may also give pleasing results when played on Hafler circuit systems or other simulated four channel systems. Approximately two hundred albums were released with the process, including popular music, \\"gimmick\\" records engineered to make the sound travel from speaker to speaker, records featuring percussion effects, and historical sound effect records. In 1964, a light classical Phase 4 \\"Concert Series\\" was produced. In 1996 a CD, The Phase 4 Experience, was released with classical and soundtrack recordings from 1966 to 1979 (London 444 788-2 LPX/PY 871). In 2014, a 41-CD boxed set of Stereo Concert Series classical albums was released, and in 2017 another 40-CD box set of soundtrack and Easy listening/popular recordings, called Spectacular: Nice 'n' Easy. A space themed version, An Astromusical Odyssey, was arranged by Johnny Keating which included songs from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. A selection can be heard on YouTube.  History and development  By the end of the 1940s Decca had consolidated a remarkable prestige among music lovers in the field of high-fidelity music recording through its ffrr (full frequency range recording) series. These recordings took advantage of the technological advances developed by the firm during World War II at the request of the Royal Navy. In the hands of innovative sound engineers like Kenneth Wilkinson, the recordings of the Decca-London stood out for their wide frequency response and good resolution. The ffrr series was continued at the end of the following decade by another in stereo sound called ffss (full frequency stereo sound), equally appreciated for its quality. The sound shots were obtained by three omnidirectional microphones suspended at 1.5 meters over the orchestral group (Decca tree). Although the specialized music lover enthusiastically welcomed stereophonic recordings for his ability to reproduce the music in an analogous way as it would be heard in a concert hall, the system in principle did not have a good response at popular level. This was mainly due to the high cost of reproduction equipment that did not correspond to appreciable advantages by potential buyers. In the early 1960s, strong competition began among the various record companies in an attempt to introduce the system to the non- specialized client. The emphasis was then placed not on achieving a realistic reproduction of the sound, but rather on dazzling the listener with effects and sound acrobatics that the stereo allowed to achieve artificially at the mixing tables (gimmick). Phase 4 Stereo was the label of Decca-London to compete in this segment. The title referred to a series of stages or phases that the stereo would have previously gone through. The recordings, which benefited from the previous technological advances of the firm, were processed in a ten-channel console, although later one of twenty was used. Then the mixture was recorded on four-track tape, then masterized to two channels and turned to stereophonic vinyl records. The sound engineer, in close collaboration with orchestra directors and arrangers, controlled the volume of certain musical instruments or orchestral groups to enhance their presence in the recording, or caused them to move between the left and right channels. It was also processed with electronic reverberation effects, microphone offset etc. The sound engineers Arthur Lilley and Arthur Bannister made most of the series' recordings, but was Bannister who used sound manipulation with more exaggeration. During the initial stage, some artists of the Decca's easy listening catalogs participated in the series, like Eric Rogers, Ted Head, Werner Müller, Ronnie Aldrich, Edmundo Ros or Stanley Black. The series was successful in sales and a total of about 300 long play albums were published. In 1964 Decca-London decided to include within the label a series with works of classical music known and accepted by the general public (Concert Series). The task initially fell to the ease listening director Stanley Black. These recordings were not well received by the specialized critic who described them as having an unnatural sound and the director's approach being superficial. However, the famous Leopold Stokowski, always aligned with the popularization of the great classics, had no objection in making several recordings for Phase 4 Stereo Concert Series, a way followed by other directors of established fame such as Antal Dorati, Erich Leinsdorf, Anatole Fistolulari, Charles Munch, Lorin Maazel or Bernard Herrmann. It is fair to recognize, however, that in these cases, the sound, although not exempt from exaggerated brightness, was not so artificial. In the series of classical composers almost 200 albums were released. At the same time Decca continued recording classical music and popular music with traditional criteria. The series stopped 1979, and almost all stereo phase 4 LPs were reissued on compact discs, including the classical music series.

After his death, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, working with Chase's parents, created the Chase McEachern Tribute Fund. As a result, there are now automated external defibrillators in schools and other locations throughout Canada. Shortly before his death, Chase wrote to sports legend Don Cherry asking for help in highlighting the need for this lifesaving equipment. Soon after his death Don Cherry dedicated time to Chase's plight on Coach's Corner.  The Chase McEachern Act  In 2006, the Ontario government introduced the Chase McEachern Act (Heart Defibrillator Civil Liability Act, 2006). This Act protects people from liability if they assisted someone, using a defibrillator, at an emergency (under certain conditions) or (again under certain conditions) if they made defibrillators available in good faith. Rocco Rossi of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario said of this measure, \\"Today's action is a fitting tribute to Chase's vision, which will aid in our campaign with the family to introduce 1,000 defibrillators across the province and serve as a catalyst to make these devices as common as fire extinguishers, giving Ontarians the best possible chance of surviving cardiac arrest.\\" The legislation has been passed.  Legacy  Through the Chase McEachern Tribute Fund, Chase's vision has resulted in defibrillators being made available in Ontario government buildings. A hockey tournament has been named after him.

Upon his election, he was the youngest governor in Japanese history at the age of 43. While serving as Iwate's governor, Masuda developed a reputation as a reformist by cutting spending through personnel cuts and took the initiative in introducing an industrial waste tax system. Masuda implemented a nationwide public relations campaign starting in 2001 that branded Iwate as a slower, \\"no effort\\" lifestyle alternative to Tokyo and other major cities. The campaign was popular locally, and Masuda was re- elected in 2003 with 88% of votes cast. = Minister for Internal Affairs = alt= Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appointed Masuda to head the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in 2007.

He was reappointed as Minister of Internal Affairs when Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda reshuffled the cabinet on August 1, 2008.Japan Times, \\"Fukuda's new lineup\\", 3 August 2008, Pg. 3. In the Cabinet of Prime Minister Taro Aso, appointed on September 24, 2008, Masuda was replaced by Kunio Hatoyama. \\"Aso elected premier / Announces Cabinet lineup himself; poll likely on Nov. 2\\", The Yomiuri Shimbun, 25 September 2008. = Later activities = Masuda served as chairman of the government's postal privatization committee from 2013 to 2016. In this role, he gradually relaxed limits on deposits and life insurance policies at Japan Post, resisting political pressure from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to relax these limits more quickly. Masuda wrote a 2013 article in Chuo Koron magazine arguing that growth in Tokyo was leading to population decay in other regions of Japan, further describing Tokyo as a \\"population black hole\\" due to the difficulty of raising children there. Political and corporate leaders in Japan were jolted by the conclusions of a 2014 book by Masuda called Local Extinctions, a detailed report of population changes that used the latest official figures from the National Institution of Population and Social Security Research to show that 896 cities, towns and villages throughout Japan were facing extinction by 2040. At first glance, the book simply repeated what earlier reports had concluded; however, it also included the percentages by which child-bearing women between the ages of 20 and 40 were expected to decline in each and every city, town and village. Masuda was approached in 2016 by twenty-one of the twenty-three Tokyo ward mayors to run for Governor of Tokyo in the July 2016 election. The Tokyo branch of the Liberal Democratic Party threw its official support behind Masuda, warning members that they would be reprimanded if they supported rival Yuriko Koike (also an LDP member).  Japan Post  Masuda was appointed as President and CEO of Japan Post Holdings in January 2020 in the wake of a scandal related to improper sales of insurance products.

Archived shows, comprising hundred of hours from The Secret Museum, are available here: http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/SM Parallel to his long radio career, Citizen Kafka also performed actively as a bluegrass musician. This included a stint as a leader of perennial New York bluegrass band the Wretched Refuse String Band.

They cite their major influences as including Ryan Adams, Neil Young, The Band, Bob Dylan and Teenage Fanclub. History =Cherryfalls= The New York Fund started out life as an indie outfit named Cherryfalls, formed in 2003. Lead singer, Joseph McAdam, originally from Glasgow, Scotland met guitarist Adrian Woodward at an acoustic gig in London and the two hit it off with their joint love of Teenage Fanclub proving to be a creative link between the two. Shortly after this initial meeting the two hooked up for a rehearsal, found drummer, Reuben, and finally bassist, James Anthony Austen Lewis and Cherryfalls was born. The band toured round small venues throughout London and attracted the attention of the major label Island Records at the Cross Keys in Chiswick where the managing director of Island Records spotted them, which led to them being signed. Whilst signed with Island Records they released their debut single, \\"All My Sins\\" in May 2004, and wrote and recorded their debut album Winter/Winter, which was released on-line. However, although \\"All My Sins\\" never made it on to the album, two further singles from that album; \\"Standing Watching\\" (UK No. 64) and \\"In Your Arms Again\\" were released in 2004. In 2005, a support slot alongside Feeder helped them to raise people's awareness of them, and coincided with the release of their fourth single, \\"My Drug\\". However, despite their obviously increasing popularity, Island decided to only put out 500 copies of their LP for the whole of London, and were subsequently dropped by Island. Drummer, Reuben left the band and Leo Sutherland was drafted in as the drummer in the newly named The New York Fund. =The New York Fund= The new band led to a new sound, with the band taking advantage of the creative freedom that being unsigned had given them, Joe stating that > 'It’s also really exciting to see yourself and your band and your music > growing and changing. I guess that’s one of the big positives that came out > of losing our ‘Big Major Deal’. It really gave us a lot of freedom to > experiment, which I’m sure that we wouldn’t have had if we’d stayed with > Island.' Their sound was influenced by country artists such as Ryan Adams, and yet maintained the rockier edge that they had developed as Cherryfalls. Following another run of shows around the London venues, The New York Fund released their first six track EP entitled The Guns EP in February 2007. This EP was well received and led to them being championed by several radio DJs, most notably Dermot O'Leary on his show on BBC Radio 2, which has led to their track, \\"Nobody Home\\", being included on his compilation album, The Saturday Sessions: The Dermot O'Leary Show. The EP also caught the attention of other, well established bands, which led to a supporting slot with The Hold Steady and one date supporting Ash on their 2007 UK tour. They have finished a string of music festival appearances in 2007, with shows including the Glastonbury Festival, T in the Park, Loch Lomond and two appearances at V Festival (Chelmsford and Stafford). In 2008, Sutherland left the band and original Cherryfalls drummer, Reuben Humphries, was welcomed back. After months of recording, producing and mixing the band released their debut album in 2010.

It stars Michel Piccoli, Anita Pallenberg and Annie Girardot. The story is a darkly satiric blend of fantasy and reality. It follows a bored, alienated man over the course of one night in his home. The title comes from a newspaper headline featured in the film which proclaims the death of the real life American gangster John Dillinger. The film proved controversial on its initial release for its subject matter and violence but is now generally regarded as Ferreri's masterpiece. It was acclaimed by the influential French film magazine Cahiers du cinéma and afterwards Ferreri worked and lived in Paris for many years. Since the mid-1980s the film has been screened only very rarely. Plot Glauco, a middle-aged industrial designer of gas masks, is growing tired of his occupation. Having discussed alienation with a colleague at the factory, he returns home. His wife is in bed with a headache but has left him dinner, which has become cold. He is dissatisfied with the food and begins preparing himself a gourmet meal. While collecting ingredients he discovers an old revolver wrapped in a 1934 newspaper with the headline \\"Dillinger is dead\\" and an account of the famous American gangster's death. Glauco cleans and restores the gun while continuing to cook his dinner, then paints it red with white polka dots. He also eats his meal, watches some television and projected home movies, listens to music and seduces their maid. With the gun he enacts suicide a number of times. At dawn he shoots his wife thrice in the head as she sleeps. Then he drives to the seaside where he gets a job as a chef on a yacht bound for Tahiti. Themes The film, and especially its surreal finale in which the character Glauco leaves home and finds a job on a yacht, has been interpreted variously. Author Fabio Vighi approached it from a psychoanalytical standpoint, suggesting the uxoricide is an attempt to \\"kill\\" something inside himself. Glauco repeatedly stages his own suicide throughout the film. The final murder, then, is a means to escape his life by eliminating the primary link to his bourgeois lifestyle, which he would otherwise be unable to leave. Writer Mira Liehm posits director Marco Ferreri followed in the style of the Theatre of the Absurd and did not apply psychology or logic to his characters but then placed his absurdist creations in a real world context. The home with its many luxuries, such as the gourmet dining and film projector, as well as the cleaning and decoration of the gun, are meaningless diversions which trap Glauco in a metaphorical prison and suffocate him. His isolation leads to death or an \\"illusionary escape\\". As Italian film historian Paolo Bertetto explained, \\"The escape to Tahiti means a total closure of all horizons, the paralysis of all possibilities; we are brought down to zero, stripped of all perspectives, and restored to the original nothingness.\\" Cast * Michel Piccoli as Glauco: a middle-age designer of protective masks which allow people to breathe under inhospitable conditions. Isolated, ennuyed and insomniac, he searches his house for diversion. Piccoli viewed the role as that of an \\"eternal child or this childlike rebirth of 'mature' man, between despair, suicide, simple insomnia, dream.\\" * Anita Pallenberg as Anita, Glauco's wife * Annie Girardot as Sabina, the maid Production Director Marco Ferreri first met leading man Michel Piccoli when he visited the actor on the set of Alain Cavalier's La Chamade (1968). Ferreri had Piccoli read a few pages from Dillinger Is Dead and hired him immediately. Piccoli has said Ferreri did not direct his performance and only gave simple blocking instructions. He played the character as solitary and volatile, comparing it to his role in Agnès Varda's The Creatures (1966). Release and reception The film was entered into the 1969 Cannes Film Festival. Dillinger Is Dead was the subject of controversy on its release for its violence and depiction of the parvenu set. Critics have also called it director Marco Ferreri's masterpiece. The influential French film magazine Cahiers du Cinéma praised the film, interviewed the director and translated two of his previous interviews from the Italian magazine Cinema & Film. The acclaim opened the resources of Paris to Ferreri and he spent much of the next 15 years living there. During that time he made his internationally best known films, including The Last Woman (1976) and Bye Bye Monkey (1978). Ferreri and Michel Piccoli became fast friends and worked together subsequently on films such as The Last Woman and La Grande Bouffe (1973). According to critic Viano Maurizio, by the mid-1980s Reaganomics' effect on the film market resulted in Dillinger's near disappearance and it has been rarely seen since. It appeared in the 2006 Marco Ferreri Retrospective in London. A new print was provided by The Criterion Collection for the 2007 Telluride Film Festival.

For details of Buddhism in the individual countries of the United Kingdom, see: * Buddhism in England * Buddhism in Northern Ireland * Buddhism in Scotland * Buddhism in Wales History In Britain, the earliest Buddhist influences came from the Theravada traditions of Burma, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. Interest in them was primarily scholarly to begin with, and a tradition of study grew up that eventually resulted in the foundation of the Pali Text Society, which undertook the huge task of translating the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhist texts into English. The start of interest in Buddhism as a path of practice had been pioneered by the original Theosophists, the Russian Madame Blavatsky and the American Colonel Olcott, who in 1880 became the first Westerners to receive the Three refuges and Five precepts, the ceremony by which one traditionally accepted and becomes a Buddhist. The Buddhist Society, London (originally known as the Buddhist Lodge) was founded in 1924 by Christmas Humphreys, another Theosophist who converted to Buddhism.Bluck (2006), pp. 7–9 In 1925, the Sri Lankan Buddhist missionary Anagarika Dharmapala brought to England the Maha Bodhi Society, which he had founded with the collaboration of the British journalist and poet Edwin Arnold. A slow trickle from United Kingdom travelled to Asia for deeper spiritual commitment via monastic ordination, mainly as Theravadin monks, like Ñāṇavīra Thera and Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu who went to Island Hermitage in Sri Lanka for their Sāmaṇera ordination in 1949. Theosophical and Theravadin influences continued throughout the early twentieth century, though the 1950s saw the development of interest in Zen Buddhism. In 1966, Freda Bedi, a British woman, became the first Western woman to take ordination in Tibetan Buddhism. In 1967, Kagyu Samyé Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre was founded in Eskdalemuir, Scotland; it is the largest Tibetan Buddhist centre in Western Europe. It has many affiliated centres in major UK cities, including Kagyu Samye Dzong London. Jamyang Buddhist Centre (JBC) in London is affiliated to the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, an international network of Gelugpa Tibetan Buddhist centres. There is also a branch centre in Leeds and affiliated groups around across England. The resident teacher is Geshe Tashi Tsering.Jamyang Buddhist Centre The Manjushri Institute, a large Buddhist college at Conishead Priory in Cumbria, was founded in 1976 under the guidance of Thubten Yeshe, a Tibetan Gelugpa monk.Bluck (2006), p. 129 Buddhist organisations in the UK from the Tibetan tradition that have been founded by Western lamas include Dechen, Diamond Way Buddhism and Aro gTér. Dechen is an association of Buddhist centres of the Sakya and Karma Kagyu traditions, founded by Lama Jampa Thaye and under the spiritual authority of Karma Thinley Rinpoche. 'Diamond Way Buddhism' is a network of lay Buddhist centres in the Karma Kagyu tradition, founded by Lama Ole Nydahl and under the spiritual authority of the 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje. A Theravada monastic order following the Thai Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah was established at Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in West Sussex in 1979, giving rise to branch monasteries elsewhere in the country, including the Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in the Chiltern Hills and Aruna Ratanagiri in Northumberland. Quite a number of British citizens like Ajahn Khemadhammo, Ajahn Sucitto, Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Brahm and Ajahn Jayasaro were ordained into this monastic order, become serious practitioners and dedicated Dhamma teachers. A lay meditation tradition of Thai origin is represented by the Samatha Trust, with its headquarters retreat centre in Wales. Sōtō Zen has a priory at Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey in Northumberland. The Community of Interbeing, part of the Order of Interbeing, founded by Vietnamese Zen Buddhist Thich Nhat Hanh (who currently resides in Plum Village, France), had about 90 sanghas meeting across the UK as of 2012.Community of Interbeing > Groups Accessed 14 April 2012. The Order of Interbeing (Tiep Hien) was founded within the Linji School of Dhyana Buddhism (Zen (Rinzai)). New religious movements in Britain include the Triratna Buddhist Community founded by the British teacher and writer Sangharakshita (Dennis Lingwood) in 1967, which has been associated with many allegations of abuse. The New Kadampa Tradition was founded by the Tibetan monk (formerly a Gelugpa) Kelsang Gyatso in 1991 when it took over the Manjushri Institute (Conishead Priory); its practices have sparked much controversy, including official rebukes by the Dalai Lama. There is also a UK section of the Soka Gakkai International, a worldwide organization which promotes a disputed, modernized version of the ancient Japanese Nichiren school of Mahayana Buddhism.Bluck (2006), p.89 Interest in secular Buddhism, stripped of supernatural elements and doctrines that are deemed insufficiently rational (including ancient, shared Indian religious beliefs in rebirth and karma), has developed from the writings of the British author and teacher Stephen Batchelor.Secular Buddhism UK Accessed 14 April 2012.

Central Plains Water, or, more fully, the Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme, is a large-scale proposal for water diversion, damming, reticulation and irrigation for the Central Plains of Canterbury, New Zealand. Construction started on the scheme in 2014. The original proposal involved diversion of water, the construction of a storage dam, tunnels and a series of canals and water races to supply water for irrigation to an area of 60,000 hectares on the Canterbury Plains. Water will be taken from the Rakaia and Waimakariri Rivers. In June 2010, resource consents for the scheme were approved in a revised form without the storage dam. From 2010 to 2012, the resource consents were under appeal to the Environment Court. In July 2012, the resource consents for the scheme were finalised by the Environment Court. The Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme originated as a feasibility study jointly initiated and funded by Christchurch City Council and Selwyn District Council. The Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme is contentious. It is opposed by community, recreation and environment groups, some city and regional councillors, and some corporate dairying interests. The scheme is supported by Christchurch City Council and Selwyn District Council staff and some councillors, irrigation interests, consultants, farming interests, and more recently, some corporate dairying interests.

A brief history In 1991, Christchurch City Council and the Selwyn District Council, in their annual planning process, agree on a feasibility study on irrigation of the Central Plains. The two councils provide a budget and set up a joint steering committee. In 2000, the steering committee contracts consulting firm URS New Zealand Limited to prepare a scoping report. In late 2001, the steering committee applies for resource consent to take 40 m3/s of water from the Rakaia River and the Waimakariri River. In January 2002, the steering committee releases the feasibility study and seeks to continue the project. In 2003, the Central Plains Water Trust was set up to apply for resource consents, and the Trust establishes a company, Central Plains Water Limited, to raise funds from farmers via a share subscription. In 2004 Central Plains Water Limited issued a share prospectus and the share subscription is over- subscribed. In November 2005, further consent applications for land and water use were lodged with Canterbury Regional Council and Central Plains Water Limited becomes a 'requiring authority'. In June 2006, further consent applications for land use and a notice of requirement, the precursor to the use of the Public Works Act to compulsorily acquire land, are lodged with Selwyn District Council. In July 2007, the trustees of Central Plains Water Trust informed Christchurch City Council that they had run out of money to fund the lawyers and consultants needed for the consent and notice of requirement hearings. Christchurch City Council gave approval for Central Plains Water Limited to borrow up to $4.8 million from corporate dairy farmer Dairy Holdings Limited. The hearing to decide the resource consent applications and submissions and the notice of requirement commenced on 25 February 2008. In September 2012, Selwyn District Council approved a loan of $5 million to Central Plains Water Limited for the design stage. Supporters The Central Plains Water enhancement scheme has had a small but influential group of supporters, some of whom have been involved as steering committee members, trustees and company directors. The supporters have included development-minded council politicians, council staff with water engineering backgrounds, directors of council-owned companies, farmer representatives and consultants. The advancement of the scheme appears to have coincided with career moves and business interests of some of these supporters.

Court actions with other competing abstractors Central Plains Water Trust has been in some lengthy litigation with Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited and Synlait. The three entities have resource consents or applications for resource consents to take the same water - the remaining water from the Rakaia and Waimakariri Rivers, allocated for abstraction by the Rakaia Water Conservation Order or the Waimakariri Rivers Regional Plan. The issue before the courts is 'who has first access to limited water? The first to have consent granted? The first to file an application to take water? The first to file all necessary applications? The first to have replied to requests for information so that the application is complete and therefore 'notifiable'? The cases have been appealed up to the Supreme Court. =Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited= On 28 January 2005, Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited had applied for competing resource consents to take 3.96 m³/s of water from the Waimakariri River and use it for irrigation of 5,700 hectares of land to the north of the Waimakariri River. On 17 September 2005 the Ngai Tahu applications were publicly notified. A hearing before independent commissioners was held in February 2006.Ngai Tahu Properties Limited - Decision by Commissioners Philip Milne and Dr Brent Cowie, 21 July 2006. On 26 and 27 June 2006, Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited sought a declaration from the Environment Court that their application to take water from the Waimakariri River had 'priority' over the 2001 CPWT application and therefore could be granted before the CPWT application. On 22 August 2006, the Environment Court released a decision that Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited had priority to the remaining 'A' allocation block of water from the Waimakariri River over the Central Plains Water Trust application.Ngai Tahu Property Limited, Decision No.c104/2006, Principal Environment Judge R J Bollard. The Central Plains Water Trust then appealed the decision to the High Court on the grounds that as they had applied first their priority to the water should be upheld, in spite of the fact that a decision would be some time in the future. The High Court agreed with the Environment Court that priority to a limited resource went to the applications that were ready to be 'notifiable' first, not the applicant who applied first. That decision confirmed that Ngāi Tahu Properties Limited would be able to take water under their consents from the Waimakariri River at a more optimal minimum flow than any later consent granted to Central Plains Water Trust.Central Plains Water Trust v Ngai Tahu Properties Limited and anor HC CHCH CIV 2006-409-2116 [2006] NZHC 1482 (1 December 2006), In the High Court of New Zealand Christchurch Registry CIV 2006-409-2116.

The amount initially borrowed from Dairy Holdings Limited is $NZ1.7 million out of a maximum of $4.8 million. The law firm Anthony Harper had certified that the loan was not contrary to the Memorandum of Agreement as the resource consent applications were not used as security. However, the loan agreement grants a sub-licence from CPWL to Dairy Holdings Limited to use the CPW water consents by taking water for irrigation from the Rakaia River. The sub-licence will start from the date the consents are granted to the date that the whole scheme is operational.'Item 5. Central Plains Water Trust issues ', Report prepared for the Christchurch City Council meeting of 13 December 2007, Author: Peter Mitchell, Officer responsible: General Manager Regulation and Democracy Services. The Christchurch City councillors voted (eight votes against, five votes for) not to accept the report. A resource consent is specifically declared by the Resource Management Act 1991 not to be real or personal property.Section 122(1) Resource Management Act 1991 (New Zealand) Resource consents are not 'owned'; they are 'held' by 'consent holders'.The Resource Management Act 1991 (New Zealand) specifically refers to 'consent holders'. See Sections 120(1)(a), 122, 124, 127, 128, 129, 130, 132, 136, and 138. The Central Plains Water Trust applications for resource consents may not have been technically used as security for the loan from Dairy Holdings Limited. However, the Christchurch City Council report clarifies that Dairy Holdings Limited, will now get the benefit of the first use of water from the Rakaia River, under the loan arrangement. That benefit will flow from the date the consents are granted, which will be some years before any of the 'ordinary' farmer shareholders in CPWL receive water, once the full scheme is constructed. The concept of guaranteed public 'ownership' of the resource consents by Central Plains Water Trust, is somewhat of a fiction, given that a private company, Central Plains Water Limited, has an exclusive licence to operate the consents to take and use water for irrigation, and particularly given that Central Plains Water Limited has already granted a sublicence for the Rakaia River water to Dairy Holdings Limited.

The dam would result in a loss of habitat for the endangered Canterbury mudfish. The dam would also affect amenity and landscape values, especially for the settlement of Coalgate. Water abstraction from the rivers will have an effect on ecology and other natural characteristics. The intensification of farming as a result of water being made available by the scheme has led to fears of increased nitrate contamination of the aquifers. =Canterbury mudfish habitat= The Canterbury mudfish is a native freshwater fish of the galaxiid family that is found only in Canterbury. It is an acutely threatened species that is classified as 'Nationally Endangered'.New Zealand mudfish (Neochanna spp.) recovery plan (Northland, black, brown, Canterbury and Chatham mudfish). 2003. Department of Conservation Threatened Species Recovery Plan 51. 25 p. In October 2002, staff of the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), were engaged by Central Plains to survey fish populations in the Waianiwaniwa River catchment as part of the investigation into the potential dam site. The survey identified a large and abundant population of Canterbury mudfish that had previously been unknown. NIWA concluded that the dam would be problematic for the mudfish as their habitat would be replaced by an unsuitable reservoir and the remaining waterways would be opened to predatory eels.Glova, G.; Duncan, M.; Henderson, R.; Kelly, D.; Walsh, J. 2001. 'Central Plains water enhancement: an assessment of potential environmental effects'. NIWA Client Report: CHC01/85. Although NIWA did no further work for Central Plains Water, much of NIWA's fish survey was included in the assessment of effects on the environment prepared by URS New Zealand Limited. However, a new approach to the effects on the mudfish was included. Mitigation of the loss of habitat would be further evaluated following consultation with the Department of Conservation.URS (2006), Central Plains Water Enhancement Scheme: Assessment of Environmental Effects for Resource Consent Applications to Canterbury Regional Council, Section 8, page 8.40, para 8.6.5 , Prepared for Central Plains Water Trust, 23 June 2006, 42156547.66140 \\\\ AEE R001C, by URS New Zealand Limited. In July 2006, and in January and February 2007, University of Canterbury researchers surveyed the Waianiwaniwa Valley for mudfish. The fish identified ranged from young recruits to mature adult fish, indicating a healthy population. Canterbury mudfish occur in at least 24 kilometres of the Waianiwaniwa River. Also, sites in the Waianiwaniwa Valley accounted for 47% of all fish database records known for Canterbury mudfish (based on mean catch per unit effort). Therefore, it was concluded that the Waianiwaniwa catchment is the most important known habitat for this species.Harding, J. S., Norton, D. A. & McIntosh, A. R.

Forest and bird's expert witness, Ecologist Colin Meurk concluded that the Waiainiwaniwa catchment \\"represents the largest known Canterbury mudfish habitat and is substantially larger than any other documented mudfish habitats.

He disagreed with the CPW evidence on mudfish. He made three conclsuions: * The Waianiwaniwa Valley population of Canterbury mudfish (Neochanna burrowsius) is the largest and most important population of this nationally endangered fish in existence. * The construction of the dam in the Waianiwaniwa Valley will eliminate the natural population and mudfish will not be able to live in the reservoir or any connected streams. * CPW's proposed measures to mitigate the loss of the Waianiwaniwa population of Canterbury mudfish are inadequate to address the significance and characteristics of the mudfish population that would be lost and are largely undocumented.Hearing Evidence - Angus McIntosh Statement of evidence of Angus Ronald McIntosh on behalf of the Director General of Conservation, May 2008.

Central Plains Water Trust lodged one of the appeals as applicant in order to change some consent conditions which limit the taking of water to 12 hours a day. Christchurch City Council's appeal was because it considered to much water would be taken from the Waimakariri River which may affect Christchurch's water supply. Fish and Game's appeal was motivated by concern over the Waimakariri River take and 'inadequate' fish screening conditions. Ngāi Tahus appeal concerned the Waimakariri River take and the legality of the change in scope of the consents granted from what had been applied for. Other appellants were a member of the Deans family and some extractors of river gravel. In July 2012, the resource consents for the scheme were confirmed by the Environment Court.

The defect density of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) increases with light exposure, causing an increase in the recombination current and reducing the efficiency of the conversion of sunlight into electricity. It was discovered by David L. Staebler and Christopher R. Wronski in 1977. They showed that the dark current and photoconductivity of hydrogenated amorphous silicon can be reduced significantly by prolonged illumination with intense light. However, on heating the samples to above 150 °C, they could reverse the effect. Explanation =Some experimental results= * Photoconductivity and dark conductivity decrease rapidly at first before stabilizing at a lower value. * Interruptions in the illumination has no effect on the subsequent rate of change. Once the sample is illuminated again, the photoconductivity will drop as though there was no interruption. =Suggested explanations= The exact nature and cause of the Staebler–Wronski effect is still not well known. Nanocrystalline silicon suffers less from the Staebler–Wronski effect than amorphous silicon, suggesting that the disorder in the amorphous silicon Si network plays a major role. Other properties that could play a role are hydrogen concentration and its complex bonding mechanism, as well as the concentration of impurities. Historically, the most favored model has been the hydrogen bond switching model. It proposes that an electron-hole pair formed by the incident light may recombine near a weak Si–Si bond, releasing energy sufficient to break the bond. A neighbouring H atom then forms a new bond with one of the Si atoms, leaving a dangling bond. These dangling bonds can trap electron-hole pairs, thus reducing the current that can pass through. However, new experimental evidence is casting doubt on this model. More recently, the H collision model proposed that two spatially separated recombination events cause emission of mobile hydrogen from Si–H bonds to form two dangling bonds, with a metastable paired H state binding the hydrogen atoms at a distant site. Effects The efficiency of an amorphous silicon solar cell typically drops during the first six months of operation. This drop may be in the range from 10% up to 30% depending on the material quality and device design. Most of this loss comes in the fill factor of the cell. After this initial drop, the effect reaches an equilibrium and causes little further degradation. The equilibrium level shifts with operating temperature so that performance of modules tend to recover some in the summer months and drop again in the winter months.Uchida,Y and Sakai,H. Light Induced Effects in a-Si:H Films and Solar Cells, Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc., Vol. 70,1986 Most commercially available a-Si modules have SWE degradation in the 10–15% range and suppliers typically specify efficiency based on performance after the SWE degradation has stabilized. In a typical amorphous silicon solar cell the efficiency is reduced by up to 30% in the first 6 months as a result of the Staebler–Wronski effect, and the fill factor falls from over 0.7 to about 0.6. This light induced degradation is the major disadvantage of amorphous silicon as a photovoltaic material.Nelson, Jenny (2003). The Physics of Solar Cells. Imperial College Press. Methods of reducing the SWE *Using nanocrystalline silicon instead of amorphous silicon *Operating at a higher temperature. This can be accomplished by integrating the PV in a photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector (PVT). *Stacking one or more thinner layers of amorphous silicon together with other materials to form a multijunction solar cell.Staebler-Wronski effect in amorphous silicon PV and procedures to limit degradation , EY-1.1: 28 October 2005, Benjamin Strahm, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Centre de Recherches en Physique des Plasmas(Power Point Slide Show) The higher electric field which applies in the thinner layers appears to reduce the SWE.

Arrested when other members of her group were caught planting dynamite in National Guard trucks, she pleaded guilty to conspiracy, but a month before her scheduled sentencing jumped bail and went into hiding. After four and a half years of wandering the country working at low-level jobs under false names, she surrendered in November 1974 and was sentenced to 27 months in prison for the conspiracy conviction. In October 1977 she was sentenced to an additional four months imprisonment for contempt of court, for refusing to testify at the 1975 trial of another defendant in the 1969 bombings. During her fugitive years, Alpert saw that the radical left was in decline and began to identify with radical feminism, mailing a manifesto to Ms. magazine, along with a set of her fingerprints to authenticate it. That document, Mother Right: A New Feminist Theory, denounced \\"the sexual oppression of the left\\" and detailed her conversion from militant leftist to radical feminist. Early life Alpert was born in May 1947 and grew up in the New York City area. Her grandparents, who were Jewish, immigrated from Russia to escape the pogroms.Sanders (2002) One of her grandfathers gave up his Orthodox faith after coming to America and became a socialist in the 1930s. Jane Alpert's mother graduated from high school at fourteen and then graduated from Hunter College at eighteen. When she was three years old her parents had their second child, Andrew. Andrew was born with several birth defects, including a severed optic nerve that caused him to be legally blind. According to Jane, \\"Skip (Andrew) survived, with above- average intelligence, but almost blind, with respiratory difficulties and permanently stunted physical growth. I remember him as a large, inert lump who took all my mother's time and attention.\\" In 1956, her father took a job as vice president of the Linz Glass Company in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. \\"It was there that Jane Alpert first became aware of the fact that she was an outsider, not only because she was Jewish, but also because she was from the city and unaccustomed to country ways.\\"Alpert (1981) When she was twelve, they moved back to New York, and she felt like an outsider once again. Alpert graduated from Forest Hills High School two years before her graduating class and attended Swarthmore College. She continued to do well academically, read constantly, and began to make friends. Among a variety of influential books she read were those of Ayn Rand. Alpert was involved in her first demonstration in the fall of her first year of college. Alpert had attended graduate school at Columbia University but had not been active in the movement there. In April 1968, she became involved in the Strike Committee's Community Action Committee that started the Columbia Tenants Union. The committee attempted to mobilize more community residents to actively resist Columbia's \\"gentrification\\" policies.Feldman (2007) Alpert attended Swarthmore College, graduating with honors in 1967 after developing an interest in radical politics. She did graduate work at Columbia University but quit after the 1968 student uprising. She wrote for Rat, a New York City underground newspaper, and had become involved with the Black Panther Party by the time she met Sam Melville in 1968. Her autobiography Growing up Underground was published in 1981. Sam Melville After graduating from Swarthmore, Alpert took a job as an editor in a publishing firm and started graduate work at Columbia University. Alpert met Sam Melville at the CAC (Community Action Coalition).Weissman (1982) Melville and Alpert became more involved with politics; they became romantically involved as well, and Alpert moved to the Lower East Side to live with Melville at his apartment. \\"On the Lower East Side Alpert began writing for Rat.\\" In her book, Alpert says Melville was able to turn insults into compliments. \\"His voice suggested helpless lust, as though his accusation of wanton sexuality were also an admission of my power over him.\\" Alpert became drawn into the world of radical politics which she had always watched from the outside. \\"If Sam had been the most conventional, straight-laced businessman, I would have found his affection hard to resist. The combination of sexual love and radical ideology was more than irresistible. It consumed me. After a few weeks with Sam, it was obvious to me that I was going to quit graduate school.\\" The pair was involved with several bombings, and Alpert wrote several communiqués in 1971 that were released to the press. Alpert, Melville, and two others were arrested in November 1969. Alpert was released on bail and lived underground while Melville was incarcerated. Alpert learned that Melville was killed at Attica Prison, in New York, in 1971 and wrote an epitaph that was published in the Rat. She wrote: \\"I no longer had to worry over how much loyalty I owed him or whether I was betraying him when I said, 'I love you,' to another man. ... I could try to feel grateful that he died in a way he would have chosen.\\" Bombings Weathermen claimed responsibility for at least twenty bombings between 1970 and 1975.Foss (1992) 129 Alpert was involved with several bombings and authored the letters that were released to the press. Alpert was charged with bombing eight government and corporate office buildings during a three-month bombing spree in 1969. Targets included: * Chase Manhattan * New York Federal Building * Standard Oil * General Motors * Marine Midland Bank * Foley Square * New York City Police Headquarters * United States Capitol * United States State Department building * Armed Forces Induction Center * New York Corporate Office Alpert planted a bomb on the floor of the New York Federal Building, which housed U.S. military.Varon (2004) p.120 Alpert said she felt a sense of hyperawareness surrounding her, and she felt happy and fearful at the same time. Alpert watched the bomb go off from a distant building and felt that the 2 A.M. eruption brought the revolution an inch or two closer. Alpert said: \\"the bombings had made us the toast of the movement and the talk of all New York. ... Weighed in the balance against the fear of arrest was the anticipated thrill that we would soon be openly celebrated as heroes.\\" Relations with members of the WUO When Alpert was arrested in 1969 with Sam Melville and two others in regards to the 1969 bombings,Treaster (1969) Alpert's parents bailed her out, and with the advice of others, Alpert forfeited the $20,000.00 bail and went underground. Jane Alpert was not arrested for the New York Corporate Office bombing and was still wanted. While underground Alpert got in contact and met with Mark Rudd.Jacobs (1997) p.144 While with Rudd, the pair got pulled over by a police officer, but they gave false identification papers and were let off. From there Alpert visited Bernardine Dohrn in San FranciscoJacobs (1997) 144 at the Golden Gate Bridge. The following day, Dohrn and Alpert went to Mt. Tamalpais to speak to a group of women.Jacobs (1997) p.145 The two parted ways and Dohrn gave Alpert Kathy Boudin's address. Alpert headed back to the east coast and stopped in Boston to visit Boudin. Although Boudin and Alpert argued over the new left movement. Alpert was impressed with the Weathermen and said, \\"Nothing was more important to them than staying together.\\" Surrender in 1974 As a fugitive, Alpert saw that the radical left was in decline and began to identify with radical feminism, once mailing a feminist manifesto to Ms. magazine along with a set of her fingerprints.Time Magazine (1975) After four years of wandering the country working at low-level jobs under false names, she surrendered in November 1974 and was sentenced to 27 months in prison for the conspiracy conviction. In October 1977, she was sentenced to an additional four months imprisonment for contempt of court, for refusing to testify at the 1975 trial of Patricia Swinton, another defendant in the 1969 case. The New York Times wrote: \\"Jane Lauren Alpert, who pleaded guilty May 4 to being part of a conspiracy to bomb Federal office buildings here last fall, was declared yesterday to have forfeited her $20,000 bail. The reason was that she violated the conditions of bail by not checking in with the United States Attorney's office this week.\\"New York Times (1970) Jane Alpert turned herself in on November 17, 1974 at the Office of the United States Attorney in New York CityFoss (1992) p.129 after being underground for four and a half years. According to The New York Times and TIME magazine, Alpert was sentenced to 27 months in prison for bombing conspiracy and jumping bail. Alpert said that the \\"plea was not a copout.\\"Time Magazine (1970) Jane Alpert's admission of her deviance – inherently part of the act of surrender – was bolstered by her statement that she returned from underground because \\"it was the right thing to do\\"Foss (1992) 135 Alpert said. \\"It wasn't a political thing—just a purely pragmatic choice on our part.\\" Alpert affirmed her ongoing commitment to political activism and did not offer regrets about the actions she had undertaken in the past.Foss (1992) p.132 She declared that she and her co- conspirators \\"believed they were acting morally; that if anyone was doing anything concrete to stop the war it was us.\\"Foss (1992) 132 Contrary to some reports, Alpert was not a member of the Weather Underground, although she knew several people who were. In Alpert's surrender statement she mentioned work in the feminist movement as a major goal. Alpert also differentiated between her self now and her self then in her surrender statement; she explained her role in the bombings as \\"craziness\\", and suggested that her relationship with Sam Melville was a catalyst for her actions.Foss (1992) p.133 Alpert acknowledged her feminism, which provided evidence that she would not engage in the same activities now that she did then because of a heightened awareness of power relationships in the male-female interactions. At Alpert's surrender her attorney said, \\"She is no longer in the grip of the mistaken ideology which caused her to flee; the war is over and the man with whom she was in love and for whom she pleaded guilty is now dead.\\" Mother Right (1974) Writes The New York Times reviewer Eden Ross Lipton: > And in November 1974, anticipating the post-Watergate easing of judicial > attitudes toward radicals, Jane Alpert turned herself in. She received and > served a 27-month jail sentence for the bombing conspiracy and for jumping > bail. The radical left reviled her for a tract, Mother Right, that she had > written while underground (and in which she had repudiated Sam Melville), > and for presumably informing on others, a charge that she has always denied. Alpert wrote Mother Right: A New Feminist Theory in 1974;Alpert (1974) her audience was women involved in the Feminist Media. Alpert had been underground for three years when she released her piece for publication. \\"I regard this piece as a distillation of what I have learned in these three years. The piece describes the process by which I became a feminist, and devotes a fair amount of space to my vision for the future, for you, for myself, for the planet.\\" In Alpert's letter she says that the first part is in the form of an open letter to, \\"my sister-fugitives in the Weather Underground.\\" The second part of the piece is structured around, \\"my political/religious vision as a feminist and as a woman.\\" Alpert became a fugitive in May 1970, a few days before her scheduled sentence for conspiracy to bomb military and war related corporate buildings in Manhattan. At that time she was not a member of the Weathermen, and she was never part of SDS (Students for a Democratic Society). \\"For now, I only want to set the scene of my renewed acquaintance with the Weather Underground by saying that when it occurred, I was decisively through with the left and had, at least mentally, rededicated myself to the cause of a revolution made by and for women.\\" Growing Up Underground (1981) Jane Alpert wrote Growing up Underground in 1981. Her book is a confessional memoir wherein she writes about her experiences as a political activist. Alpert wrote the book to set the record straight about her personal role in the bombings of New York City buildings in 1969 and her life underground in the early 1970s. Alpert explains what happened in 1969 and how she got involved in the Weather Underground Organization. She writes about her misunderstood childhood and her account of her life underground. She was supported by her family and friends financially while she lived underground. Mary Moylan wrote a critique of Alpert's book that was published in Jonah Raskin's book, \\"The Weather Eye\\" Communiqués from the Weather Underground (1974). Murray Kempton also wrote a critical review of Alpert's book for The New York Review of Books., though the New York Times review offered a dissenting view.

After retirement, he changed from publishing as William E.M. Lands to Bill Lands as he put increased attention to primary prevention of health disorders related to excessive actions of omega-6 mediators and describing consequences of imbalanced dietary intakes of omega-3 and omega-6 nutrients. More recently, Lands described an Omega 3-6 Balance Score that indicates the likely impact of individual food items on the balance of HUFA accumulated in tissues. Lands emphasized that efficient conversion of linoleic acid (18:2n-6) to the n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acid (n-6HUFA), arachidonic acid (20:4n-6), competitively displaces n-3 HUFA from tissue phospholipids and creates a narrow therapeutic window for dietary linoleic in the absence of n-3 nutrients. The HUFA balance seen with a finger- tip blood-spot assay monitors dietary intakes of essential fatty acids and predicts the likely intensity of n-6 eicosanoid-mediated pathophysiology.

In the , Sheldon had a population of 1,704 people.  Geography  Sheldon is south-east of the Brisbane CBD. The suburb is sparsely populated, consisting of mostly bushland, including some residential properties on acreage. The presence of multiple protected areas is notable, preserving the region's natural eucalyptus forests, and protecting endangered species such as the koala. Tingalpa Creek flows through the western edge of the suburb, forming a border between the City of Brisbane. Since Tingalpa Creek's headwaters are located in the Sheldon region, the suburb is a catchment area for the entire Leslie Harrison Dam, which provides drinking water to much of the Redlands. The region is also home to a significant koala population. As a result, the suburb retains much of its natural bushland, extending north from the Venman Bushland National Park in Mount Cotton. Nature areas of Sheldon include: *Brisbane Koala Bushlands *Emu Street Bushland Reserve *Ford Road Conservation Area *Summit Street Reserve History Previously a largely uninhabited rural area, the suburb of Sheldon was officially named in 1980. It combined the southern and northern portions of neighbouring suburbs Capalaba and Mount Cotton, respectively. The Sheldon name likely originated from the village of the same name in Devon, United Kingdom, which itself came from an Old English word meaning \\"steep-sided hill and wooden valley\\". Sheldon College opened on 1997 near the roundabout at which Sheldon, Capalaba, Alexandra Hills, and Thornlands meet at a quadripoint.. Sheldon College, one of the largest schools in Redland City, was founded in the suburb in 1997. Its campus is situated At the Sheldon had a population of 1,690 people.

It is privately owned. Originally called Bayley Park, the mansion was begun by James Plummer in 1677 and continued by Raymond Blackmore in the early eighteenth century. George Augustus Eliott (created Lord Heathfield in 1787) purchased the property after gaining a substantial amount of prize money following his successful leadership during the siege of Havana in 1762. It was altered and enlarged in 1766 by Robert (later Sir Robert) Taylor. Elliot owned the house until his death in 1790. It was renamed Heathfield Park after him in 1791 by his successor Francis Newbery, son of the publisher John Newbery; Newbery hired Humphrey Repton to landscape the park. From 1819 to 1890, Heathfield Park was the seat of the baronets of the Blunt family. In 1895 it was remodelled in Georgian Revival style, brick facing being substituted for stucco, and the south-east wing being added, by Sir Reginald Blomfield for the art patron William Cleverley Alexander.Heathfield Park: A private estate and a Wealden town (1996) Roy Pryce Alexander, who owned Aubrey House in London, died when he fell down the basement stairs of the house in 1916.

Steward began playing Second XI cricket for Essex during the 1962 season, scoring a duck on his debut for the team, before making fourteen further appearances for the team before the end of the year. While he spent the following year still as a part of the Second XI, it was his consistent performances this season which brought him up to the first-team squad, for whom he made his debut first-class appearance in 1964, playing a single University Match prior to his first appearance in the County Championship a month later. Steward batted well from the Essex lower order, frequently scoring in double-figures with tenacious partnership-building from more experienced members of the team, and making nine County Championship appearances before the season came to a close. Steward's second and final season of first-class cricket in England came the following year, but Essex underperformed, finishing third-bottom in the 1965 County Championship table. Steward found himself out of the team and moving back to South Africa at the end of the season. Steward made a return to cricket during the 1967/68 season, playing three games for Natal B in the Currie Cup.

He was the founder of a Madrasa in Dammaj which was known as a centre for Salafist ideology and its multi-national student population. Biography Wadi'i was born sometime during the late 1920s and early 1930s near the city of Sa'adah in northern Yemen. He was said to be from a Zaydi tribe, and he was initially a Zaydi Shia. He left Yemen as a young man and travelled to Saudi Arabia to work and became acquainted with Sunni works of Islamic scholarship.Bonnefoy, L. (2009) in Meijer, R. (ed.) Global Salafism =Education= After finishing primary education in Yemen, Wadi'i spent roughly two decades studying Islam in Saudi Arabia. In 1963 he began by studying at the Salafi teaching centre developed by Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen in Najran before then being accepted to study at the Islamic University of Madinah where he attended Halaqas led by Hadith scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani and Abdul-Ghaffar Hasan Al-Hindi as well as former Grand Mufti Abd- al-Aziz ibn Abd-Allah ibn Baz while also studying under Muhammad al- Sumali.Zahab, M. (2009) Salafism in Pakistan in Meijer, R. )ed.) Global Salafism) Wadi'i is said to have graduated from the Islamic University of Madinah with a masters degree in the science of hadith. =Return to Yemen= In 1979, his stay in Saudi ended abruptly when he was indicted on suspected involvement in the Grand Mosque Seizure. After spending a few months in prison, Grand Mufti ibn Baz negotiated his release, though Wadi'i was forced to return to his home country where he would eventually become known as the father of the modern Salafi movement within Yemen. It was there that he began to spread the Salafi Da'wah in Yemen, with much initial opposition from the local Shafi\`is, Ismailis and Zaidis. Wadi'i went on, soon after his return to his native region, to found and establish an institute that he named Dar al- Hadith al-Khayriyya in Dammaj. It would become one of the most important and influential educational institutions for Salafism in the world, teaching tens of thousands of students ranging from the Arab world to Africa to Southeast Asia and the Western world. It was during this time that Wadi'i, along with Ja'far 'Umar Thalib, established close ties between Yemeni and Indonesian Salafis. In the 1980s Wadi'i accepted grants from various sources such as Ibn Baz and the Saudi Government of 15,000 Saudi Riyals every two months. However, his continued critique of the Saudi monarch, due to his believed wrongful imprisonment, led him to be more independent in the financing of the institute's operations. He stated that managing the mosque and institute in Dammaj required little funding and was easily covered by local donations and zakat. In 2014, Wadi'i's institute, Dar al-Hadeeth would be shut down after a long Siege of Dammaj by Houthi rebels. The manager of the institute, Yahya al- Hajuri, as well as thousands of foreign students were forced to relocate to Al Hudaydah Governorate. =Death= After a prolonged illness, and hospital treatment in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Cologne,Germany and Los Angeles, California, Wadi'i died on July 21, 2001 from either cirrhosis or liver cancer. His funeral prayer was performed in the Masjid al-Haram in Makkah and he was laid to rest in the Al-'Adl cemetery close to the graves of Ibn Baz and Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen.Tarjamah Abee ‘Abdir-Rahmaan (1999) [2nd Ed.] After his death, reports continued to surface of changes in curriculum and power struggles at the Dar al-Hadith, although these rumours were dispelled a few years later by contemporary Muslim scholar Rabee Al-Madkhali. Links to Guantanamo detainees Joint Task Force Guantanamo counter-terrorism analysts prepared Summary of Evidence memos offering justifications for continuing to hold them in extrajudicial detention. Several of the captives had their detention justified, in part, through their association with Al Wadi.Though Shaykh Muqbil never supported terrorism or terrorists as can be seen in his harsh criticism of Usaamah ibn Laden Views =On Terrorism= Wadi'i made a number of statements against terrorism and attempted to advise Osama bin Laden against it, whom he blames - along with older movements like the Muslim Brotherhood - for many of the problems Muslims face today; he further commented in an interview:Interview with \\"Ar-Rayu Al-Aa’m\\" newspaper, issue #11503, 19 December 1998 > I did in fact send my advice and warning (to bin Laden) but only Allah knows > if it actually arrived or not. However, some of those people did come to us, > offering their help and assistance in preaching and calling to Allah. > Afterwards, we found them sending money, requesting that we distribute it > among the leaders of various tribes; they were trying to buy rocket- > launchers and machine guns. But I refused them and told them to never come > to my house again. I made it clear to them that what we do is preach only > and we don’t allow our students to do anything but that. Waadi'ee had earlier authored a book as well, referring to bin Laden as the head of all \\"sectarianism,\\" \\"partisanship,\\" \\"division,\\" and \\"religious ignorance,\\" and accusing him putting money into weapons while ignoring his religion.Tuhfah Al-Mujeeb, from the chapter “Who’s Behind the Bombings in the Two Sanctuaries (Mecca & Medina)?”, 1996 Wadi'i's Dar ul-Hadith seminary and institute of Dammaj was known to oppose al-Qaeda and other radical extremist organisations, as Wadi'i himself stated in an interview with Hassan al-Zayidi of the Yemen Times in 2000. =His Fiqh= In terms of Islamic jurisprudence, Wadi'i did not follow any established school of thought in Islam and opposed the practice of Taqlid, or subordination to higher legal authority. His views on the principles of Islamic jurisprudence were almost identical with those of the Zahiri school; he rejected the usage of Qiyas, or analogical reasoning, in deriving rulings in Islamic jurisprudence entirely, recommending the books of Zahiri scholar Ibn Hazm in the principles of jurisprudence for details on the topic.Al-Waadi'ee, Muqbil, \\"Ijabat al-Sa\`il fi Ahamm al-Masa\`il,\\" Question #157 Waadi'i was fond of the works of Ibn Hazm, to the point that, when asked about Ibn Hazm's Zahirism, he advised every Muslim \\"to be a Zahiri.\\"Al- Waadi'ee, Muqbil, \\"Ijabat al-Sa\`il fi Ahamm al-Masa\`il,\\" Question #320, pg.562 =On Yemen= Wadi'i believed that even the sinful and corrupt leaders must be obeyed by the Muslims while advising the leader must be done by the learned scholar in private. Additionally the Muslims are commanded to endure hardship and be patient until Allah removes the burden of an oppressive ruler for that of a better one. Wadi'i thought that South Yemen's colonial rule by Britain was better than its independence in 1967, due to the fact that independence had allowed a socialist government to come to power and also resulted in the unnecessary death of Muslims. Although claiming to be neutral by assuming a neutral or apolitical stance, Wadi'i maintained excellent relations with the Yemeni government after unification. This was in fact done by his de facto support of the Yemeni government via his stances on issues such as not partaking or calling to elections and political parties or candidates as well as cooperating with the Yemeni government against common enemies such as extreme Zaydi militias and the Muslim Brotherhood's local chapter.Meijer (2009) Global Salafism =On Saudi Arabia= While critical of the Saudi government throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Wadi'i never compromised by siding with the Sahwa movement and its preachers. He vocally opposed them and their methods of overtly calling to politics and labeled them with hizbiyyah, or partisanship. He harbored hard feelings against Saudi Arabia up until toward the end of his life, when he would ultimately recant his criticism, speaking highly of the country and its authorities.

It is not known when Henry became an Augustinian nor when he became Abbot of Holyrood Abbey. His latest known predecessor, Elias son of Nicholas, occurs as abbot on 29 May 1236,See Watt, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 93. and no abbot of Holyrood is known from then until 1253 when the Chronicle of Melrose informs us that \\"Sir Gilbert, the bishop of Whithorn, died; and after him, sir Henry, the abbot of Holyrood, was elected\\".Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, pp. 574-5; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 129; Watt, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 93 This date is not however certain, as Henry's name occurs merely as Abbot, not even \\"bishop-elect\\", in a Dunfermline Abbey document dated to October 1254.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 129. He was elected with the support of the Comyn faction who at that time dominated the minority of the young King Alexander III of Scotland, an election that John I de Balliol initially opposed, with Balliol citing the \\"ancient liberty of his subjects\\", i.e. the rights of the Lord of Galloway and the Galwegians.Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, p. 575, n. 1O; Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 184; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 129. This objection is at first sight confusing, since John de Balliol himself was a Comyn ally and part of the Comyn regime. Richard Oram argues that Balliol's objection was more concerned with his own rights of patronage, but at any rate Balliol's objections came to nothing.Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 184. There was an examination of the election at York on 11 February 1255, and the election was apparently confirmed by the Archbishop of York on 24 February; there was however a delay in consecration of the bishop, as the report of his consecration in the Melrose Chronicle follows that of Gamelin as Bishop of St Andrews, which took place on 25 December 1255.Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, p. 584; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 129. The sources give contradictory accounts of the consecration, with the Melrose Chronicle stating that it was conducted by Walter de Gray (d. 1 May 1255), whereas the Lanercost Chronicle reported that the consecration, conducted by Walter of Kirkham, the Bishop of Durham, took place on 7 February 1255, at St Agatha's near Richmond.Dowden, Bishops, p. 358; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 129. D. E. R. Watt thinks that the consecration may in fact have taken place in early 1256. He was a witness to the foundation charter of Sweetheart Abbey, dated April 1273.Dowden, Bishops, p. 358, give 2 April 1273; Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 78, gives 10 April. The Archbishop of York, in 1287, authorised that Bishop Henry, because of his old age, be excused from the annual visit to York usually paid by bishops of Galloway.Dowden, Bishops, p. 358. The bishop was nevertheless able to visit Ireland, where on 4 August 1291, his presence was recorded.Dowden, Bishops, p. 359. He was at Birgham on 17 March 1290, for the negotiation of the Treaty of Birgham. He was one of the men chosen by John de Balliol the younger, afterwards King John of Scotland, to represent him at the Great Cause in 1292. He died on 1 November 1293. He had been described by the Lanercost Chronicle as \\"a man discreet, holy, and provident for his house and his parish\\".Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, p. 575, n. 1. An excavation of Whithorn Priory during 1957-67 uncovered the remains of various senior ecclesiastical figures whose identities were not known at the time. Research funded by Historic Scotland in 2007 led to the identification of six bishops from the bones and artefacts in the graves, Henry amongst them. The techniques employed allowed the researchers to conclude that all the clerics enjoyed a diet of quality meat and fish and probably came from southern Scotland or Cumbria.McGinty, Stephen \\"Bishops' lives unmasked as science peels back 600 years\\".

They are especially prevalent in the southern hemisphere, with some types described from Japan, Thailand and the Persian Gulf. Most are found at less than depth. Anatomy Gynodiastylidae have a small free telson, usually lacking terminal setae, though in some cases there may be two. The interior branch (endopod) of the uropods is present on segments one through three. The number of free thoracic somites is never reduced. The first pereopods have a group of long rigid fibres (setae) on the propodus. Males have no pleopods. The flagellum of the second antenna does not reach further than the hindmost edge of the carapace. Females have a very small second antenna (much smaller than the first). They also have no exopods (outer branches) on their third maxillipeds. Because they lack exceptions to the two most important diagnostic characteristics (the lack of pleopods in males and of exopods on maxilliped 3 in females), Gynodiastylidae have a pre- eminent place among monographic descriptions.

For many years, the Company operated under the authority of the Anglican bishops in Winnipeg (diocese of Rupert's Land), the diocese of Edmonton and the diocese of Toronto On November 17, 1990, the Company of the Cross was unincorporated in Manitoba. Overview It was founded in 1962 by Frank Wiens and Ted Byfield who later also published magazines, and was originally named the Dynevor Society after Baron Dynevor and the historical St. Peter's Dynevor Anglican diocese.Saint John’s School of Alberta: Company of the Cross – What Is It and Why did it come to be? The name Company of the Cross came from Byfield's reading of C.S. Lewis. Individual members of the Company of the Cross in Alberta still meet and renew their vows.Saint John’s School of Alberta: Company of the Cross Vow Service =St. John's traditional private Anglican schools for boys= It ran three boys' boarding schools: Saint John's School of Alberta near Stony Plain, Alberta (closed in 2008), Saint John's School of Ontario (closed in 1989) and Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School (closed in 1990). The religious and social viewpoints of the Company of the Cross were conservative. Its principles and ideas have been controversial. Although few investigations or law suits resulted in claims being against these private schools, a January 19, 1990 child welfare investigation undertaken by Ted Shaw, then manager of the Leduc District Office, described in detail the punishments that were meted out on students by staff at St. John's Anglican School in response to an \\"abusive discipline complaint.\\"Wikisource St. John' School of Alberta, child welfare investigation In an October 21, 1996 Alberta Report article, Byfield wrote that the most traditional of all St. John's schools' rules, was discipline. In his articles, Byfield described his belief in the use of discipline to strengthen the character of his students by pushing them to their psychological breaking points. Byfield described how was enforced \\"with a flat stick across the seat of the pants -- failure to complete assignment, four swats; late for a work detail, three swats; caught smoking, six swats.\\" He admitted that such punishment was \\"barbarous\\" in comparison with \\"what would follow over the next three decades\\" but it was \\"unremarkable\\" when \\"compared with what had gone before, over the previous two to three millennia of human history.\\" In a 1990s CBC radio's Tapestry interview with Don Hill, Ted Byfield, a co-founder of St. John's, said standards for disciplining students had changed, and that he would have been arrested in the 1990s\\" for the \\"harsh discipline...meted out to children\\" in the 1970s in their schools. By 1998, Byfield's columns had attracted the attention of Alberta Human Rights.Albert Courts appeal document There were lawsuits regarding abuse of students at its schools, and improper preparation for arduous wilderness excursions. In his February 8, 2003 Calgary Herald article, Daryl Slade reported on a 2003 lawsuit by a former Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School student, who said that his life was put at risk in 1976, when he was forced to undertake \\"100-kilometre hike through steep mountain passes and a 500-kilometre canoe trip through some of the most treacherous parts of the North Saskatchewan River\\" for which the 13-year old was \\"untrained, unprepared and unsuitable\\", according to the defendant's Calgary-based lawyer, Vaughn Marshall. This article was also published on the website of the Marshall Attorneys. A year later, a child died at the same school while on a lengthy snowshoe march. The next year, in 1978, at Saint John's School of Ontario—also operated by the Company of the Cross—twelve boys and one teacher from its Saint John's School of Ontario died while canoeing on Lake Temiskaming. While the coroner's inquest ruled it was an accident and no charges were laid, the coroner's report said, \\"We feel that for boys from 12 to 14 years of age, this entire expedition constituted an exaggerated and pointless challenge.\\" Two books were written describing the accident and The New York Times and The Washington Post covered the story. In a May 26, 2002 statement, a former student of the school who survived the accident, described the canoe trip undertaken by 27 boys and 4 leaders. It was meant to be a three-week trip to re-trace the journey of Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes, a 17th-century French explorer who canoed along Lake Timiskaming on the Quebec-Ontario border to James Bay. While the schools have been criticized for their harsh conditions and discipline, some of the former students and parents appreciated the character building and the outdoor experience, the St. John's schools offered. By 2008 the last school that remained open had self- described as nondenominational implying that it was no longer operating under the auspices of an Anglican bishop and it was no longer affiliated with the Anglican Church of Canada. Publications The Company of the Cross also operated St. John's Edmonton Report in the 1970s with the staff of both the school and the paper living as lay members of the religious community. Originally, the staff of the schools and the magazine were paid $1.00 per day, plus living expenses. This changed in the 1970s, when the Byfields renamed the paper the Alberta Report, shifting the management style to that of a commercial magazine paper, and began to pay the magazine staff regular wages. The Alberta Report increased circulation and became influential in the province reaching a peak in the mid-1980s. Its circulation declined from the late 1980s onward and Ted Byfield began publishing a series of history books with United Western Publishers, which has been also referred to legally as the Alberta Report/United Western Publishers. The Report discontinued operations in 2003. The Alberta Report was also referred to legally as the United Western Publishers through which Byfield published a series of books. Originally, the staff of the schools and the magazine were paid $1.00 per day, plus living expenses. Its formal operation of the Company of the Cross, which included publishing magazines as well as running schools ended.

The club was originally developed as a summer retreat by the naturalist and outdoor writer John Bird Burnham in the early 1900s. Currently the Crater Club consists of over 40 homes, a clubhouse, playing fields, four clay tennis courts, and a waterfront featuring a permanent pier and a screened building known as Burnham's Landing. This latter building is also the headquarters of the Split Rock Yacht Club, which maintains a small but active racing fleet of Cape Cod Knockabout sailboats and holds weekly sailboat races during the summer season open to these and other small one- design classes. Like the Scouting Movement, the Crater Club is an example of the American movement that embraced basic, \\"frontier\\" values in contrast to the rampant urbanization and industrialization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early members purchased lots from Burnham then built simple cottages that deliberately eschewed the luxuries and decorative excesses of Adirondack \\"Great Camps\\" such as those designed by William L. Coulter of Saranac Lake. Crater Club members swam, sailed small boats, and hiked for pleasure, believing in the salubrious effects of exposure to Nature on work- wearied urbanites and their children. Although many of the early residents were in business, others were academics and other professionals.

In 1983, Anderson had a 4.08 earned run average. On the day of his final major league appearance, October 2, he pitched three innings and allowed three earned runs. At the time of his retirement Anderson had a 4-10 record, a 3.68 ERA, 62 walks, and 76 strikeouts.

A jackup rig or a self-elevating unit is a type of mobile platform that consists of a buoyant hull fitted with a number of movable legs, capable of raising its hull over the surface of the sea. The buoyant hull enables transportation of the unit and all attached machinery to a desired location. Once on location the hull is raised to the required elevation above the sea surface supported by the sea bed. The legs of such units may be designed to penetrate the sea bed, may be fitted with enlarged sections or footings, or may be attached to a bottom mat. Generally jackup rigs are not self-propelled and rely on tugs or heavy lift ships for transportation. Jackup platforms are used as exploratory drilling platforms and offshore and wind farm service platforms. Jackup platforms have been the most popular and numerous of various mobile types in existence. The total number of jackup drilling rigs in operation numbered about 540 at the end of 2013. The tallest jackup rig built to date is the Noble Lloyd Noble, completed in 2016https://www.infield.com/rigs/noble-lloyd-noble-jackup-61323 with legs 214 metres (702 feet) tall.https://www.equinor.com/en/magazine/industry-world- records.html Name Jackup rigs are so named because they are self-elevating with three, four, six and even eight movable legs that can be extended (“jacked”) above or below the hull. Jackups are towed or moved under self propulsion to the site with the hull lowered to the water level, and the legs extended above the hull. The hull is actually a water-tight barge that floats on the water’s surface. When the rig reaches the work site, the crew jacks the legs downward through the water and into the sea floor (or onto the sea floor with mat supported jackups). This anchors the rig and holds the hull well above the waves. History A DeLong platform at Consolidated Western, Orange, Texas, in 1955 An early design was the DeLong platform, designed by Leon B. DeLong. In 1949 he started his own company, DeLong Engineering & Construction Company. In 1950 he constructed the DeLong Rig No. 1 for Magnolia Petroleum, consisting of a barge with six legs. In 1953 DeLong entered into a joint-venture with McDermott, which built the DeLong-McDermott No.1 in 1954 for Humble Oil. This was the first mobile offshore drilling platform. This barge had ten legs which had spud cans to prevent them from digging into the seabed too deep. When DeLong-McDermott was taken over by the Southern Natural Gas Company, which formed the Offshore Company, the platform was called Offshore No. 51. In 1954, Zapata Offshore, owned by George H. W. Bush ordered the Scorpion. It was designed by R. G. LeTourneau and featured three electro- mechanically-operated lattice type legs. Built on the shores of the Mississippi river by the LeTourneau Company, it was launched in December 1955. The Scorpion was put into operation in May 1956 off Port Aransas, Texas. The second, also designed by LeTourneau, was called Vinegaroon. http://iadc.org/dcpi/dc-septoct05/Sept05-anniversary.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ibvuWmF7Dc Operation A jackup rig is a barge fitted with long support legs that can be raised or lowered. The jackup is maneuvered (self-propelled or by towing) into location with its legs up and the hull floating on the water. Upon arrival at the work location, the legs are jacked down onto the seafloor. Then \\"preloading\\" takes place, where the weight of the barge and additional ballast water are used to drive the legs securely into the sea bottom so they will not penetrate further while operations are carried out. After preloading, the jacking system is used to raise the entire barge above the water to a predetermined height or \\"air gap\\", so that wave, tidal and current loading acts only on the relatively slender legs and not on the barge hull. Modern jacking systems use a rack and pinion gear arrangementRack and Pinion jacking system example where the pinion gears are driven by hydraulic or electric motors and the rack is affixed to the legs. Jackup rigs can only be placed in relatively shallow waters, generally less than of water. However, a specialized class of jackup rigs known as premium or ultra-premium jackups are known to have operational capability in water depths ranging from 150 to 190 meters (500 to 625 feet). Types =Mobile offshore Drilling Units (MODU)= This type of rig is commonly used in connection with oil and/or natural gas drilling. There are more jackup rigs in the worldwide offshore rig fleet than other type of mobile offshore drilling rig. Other types of offshore rigs include semi-submersibles (which float on pontoon-like structures) and drillships, which are ship-shaped vessels with rigs mounted in their center. These rigs drill through holes in the drillship hulls, known as moon pools. =Turbine Installation Vessel (TIV)= This type of rig is commonly used in connection with offshore wind turbine installation. =Barges= Jackup rigs can also refer to specialized barges that are similar to an oil and gas platform but are used as a base for servicing other structures such as offshore wind turbines, long bridges, and drilling platforms.

Active SETI (Active Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) is the attempt to send messages to intelligent extraterrestrial life. Active SETI messages are usually sent in the form of radio signals. Physical messages like that of the Pioneer plaque may also be considered an active SETI message. Active SETI is also known as METI (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence). The term METI was coined by Russian scientist Alexander Zaitsev, who denoted the clear-cut distinction between Active SETI and METI: In 2010, Douglas A. Vakoch of the SETI Institute addressed concerns about the validity of Active SETI alone as an experimental science by proposing the integration of Active SETI and Passive SETI programs to engage in a clearly articulated, ongoing, and evolving set of experiments to test various versions of the Zoo Hypothesis, including specific dates at which a first response to messages sent to particular stars could be expected. On 13 February 2015, scientists (including Douglas Vakoch, David Grinspoon, Seth Shostak, and David Brin) at an annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science discussed Active SETI, and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the Cosmos was a good idea. That same week, a statement was released, signed by many in the SETI community including Berkeley SETI Research Center director Andrew Siemion, advocating that a \\"worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent\\". On 28 March 2015, an essay with a different point of view was written by Seth Shostak and published in The New York Times. Rationale for METI In the paper Rationale for METI, transmission of the information into the Cosmos is treated as one of the pressing needs of an advanced civilization. This view is not universally accepted, and it does not agree to those who are against the transmission of interstellar radio messages, but at the same time are not against SETI searching. Such duality are called The SETI Paradox. Radio message construction The lack of an established communications protocol is a challenge for METI. First of all, while trying to synthesize an Interstellar Radio Message (IRM), we should bear in mind that Extraterrestrials will first deal with a physical phenomenon and, only after that, perceive the information. At first, ET's receiving system will detect the radio signal; then, the issue of extraction of the received information and comprehension of the obtained message will arise. Therefore, above all, the constructor of an IRM should be concerned about the ease of signal determination. In other words, the signal should have maximum openness, which is understood here as an antonym of the term security. This branch of signal synthesis can be named anticryptography. To this end, in 2010, Michael W. Busch created a general- purpose binary language, later used in the Lone Signal project to transmit crowdsourced messages to extraterrestrial intelligence. Busch developed the coding scheme and provided Rachel M. Reddick with a test message, in a blind test of decryption. Reddick decoded the entire message after approximately twelve hours of work. This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the Lone Signal hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the hailing message. Also characteristics of the radio signal such as wavelength, type of polarization, and modulation have to be considered. Over galactic distances, the interstellar medium induces some scintillation effects and artificial modulation of electromagnetic signals. This modulation is higher at lower frequencies and is a function of the sky direction. Over large distances, the depth of the modulation can exceed 100%, making any METI signal very difficult to decode. =Error correction= In METI research, it is implied that any message must have some redundancy, although the exact amount of redundancy and message formats are still in great dispute. Using ideograms, instead of binary sequence, already offers some improvement against noise resistance. In faxlike transmissions, ideograms will be spread on many lines. This increases its resistance against short bursts of noise like radio frequency interference or interstellar scintillation. One format approach proposed for interstellar messages was to use the product of two prime numbers to construct an image. Unfortunately, this method works only if all the bits are present. As an example, the message sent by Frank Drake from the Arecibo Observatory in 1974 did not have any feature to support mechanisms to cope with the inevitable noise degradation of the interstellar medium. Error correction tolerance rates for previous METI messages * Arecibo Message (1974) : 8.9% (one page) * Evpatoria message (1999) : 44% (23 separate pages) * Evpatoria message (2003) : 46% (one page, estimated) Examples The 1999 Cosmic Call transmission was far from being optimal (from our terrestrial point of view) as it was essentially a monochromatic signal spiced with a supplementary information. Additionally, the message had a very small modulation index overall, a condition not viewed as being optimal for interstellar communication. * Over the 370,967 bits (46,371 bytes) sent, some 314,239 were “1” and 56,768 were “0”—5.54 times as many 1's as 0's. * Since frequency shift keying modulation scheme was used, most of the time the signal was on the “0” frequency. * In addition, “0” tended to be sent in long stretches (white lines in the message). Realized projects These projects have targeted stars between 17 and 69 light-years from the Earth. The exception is the Arecibo message, which targeted globular cluster M13, approximately 24,000 light-years away. The first message to reach its destination was the Altair (Morimoto - Hirabayashi) Message, which likely reached its target in 1999. * The Morse Message (1962) * Arecibo message (1974) * Cosmic Call 1 (1999) * Teen Age Message (2001) * Cosmic Call 2 (2003) * Across the Universe (2008) * Wow!

Notable among its critics was Stephen Hawking, and scientist and science fiction author David Brin, particularly in his article \\"expose.\\" However, Russian and Soviet radio engineer and astronomer Alexander L. Zaitsev has argued against these fears. Indeed, Zaitsev argues that we should consider the risks of not attempting to contact extraterrestrial civilizations. To lend a quantitative basis to discussions of the risks of transmitting deliberate messages from Earth, the SETI Permanent Study Group of the International Academy of Astronautics adopted in 2007 a new analytical tool, the San Marino Scale. Developed by Prof. Ivan Almar and Prof. H. Paul Shuch, the San Marino Scale evaluates the significance of transmissions from Earth as a function of signal intensity and information content. Its adoption suggests that not all such transmissions are created equal, thus each must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis before establishing blanket international policy regarding Active SETI. In 2012, Jacob Haqq-Misra, Michael Busch, Sanjoy Som, and Seth Baum argued that while the benefits of radio communication on Earth likely outweigh the potential harms of detection by extraterrestrial watchers, the uncertainty regarding the outcome of contact with extraterrestrial beings creates difficulty in assessing whether or not to engage in long-term and large-scale METI. In 2015, João Pedro de Magalhães proposed transmitting an invitation message to any extraterrestrial intelligences watching us already in the context of the Zoo Hypothesis and inviting them to respond. By using existing television and radio channels, de Magalhães argued this would not put us in any danger, \\"at least not in any more danger than we are already if much more advanced extraterrestrial civilizations are aware of us and can reach the solar system.\\" Douglas Vakoch, president of METI, argues that passive SETI itself is already an endorsement of active SETI, since \\"If we detect a signal from aliens through a SETI program, there’s no way to prevent a cacophony of responses from Earth.\\" Beacon proposals One proposal for a 10 billion watt interstellar SETI beacon was dismissed by Robert A. Freitas Jr. to be infeasible for a pre-Type I civilization, such as humanity, on the Kardashev scale. However, this 1980s technical argument assumes omni-directional beacons which may not be the best way to proceed on many technical grounds. Advances in consumer electronics have made possible transmitters that simultaneously transmit many narrow beams, covering the million or so nearest stars but not the spaces between. This multibeam approach can reduce the power and cost to levels that are reasonable with current mid-2000s Earth technology. Once civilizations have discovered each other's locations, the energy requirements for maintaining contact and exchanging information can be significantly reduced through the use of highly directional transmission technologies. A 2018 study estimated a 1 to 2 megawatt infrared laser focused through a 30 to 45 meter telescope could be seen from about 20,000 light years away.

In a game against Gonzaga University on March 22, 1968, he pitched a perfect game. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the first round of the secondary phase of the 1968 Major League Baseball Draft, and began his professional career with the AA Waterbury Indians. In 1968, Austin had a 1-8 win-loss record and a 2.73 earned run average (ERA), and in 1969 he split the season between Waterbury, the Indians' rookie team, and the Portland Beavers. With Portland, he had a 5-6 record and a 3.66 ERA in 16 games. After the season, he, along with Rich Hand, were noted as two of the Indians' top pitching prospects. Austin started the 1970 season with the Wichita Aeros, and pitched in six games before being promoted to the major leagues. He made his debut on June 21, and finished the season with a 2-5 record and a 4.79 ERA in 31 games. The following season, he had a 5.09 ERA in 23 games, and was sent back to Wichita to finish up the year. Partway through the 1973 season, the Indians released him, and he was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers, finishing the year with the Evansville Triplets. In 1974, Austin moved to Japan and played for the Hankyu Braves of Nippon Professional Baseball. That year, he had one win, one loss, and a 2.33 ERA in eight games. After the season, the Braves noted that they had \\"purchased two mistakes\\" by signing him and Gene Ammann due to Austin's control problems. He returned to the states and rejoined the Brewers in 1975, and the next two seasons he split time between the majors and minors. He had a 2-3 record and a 4.05 ERA in 32 games in 1975, and a 5.06 ERA in three games in 1976, retiring after the season ended.

The school is a member of the Houston Independent School District and is a school-of-choice for residents in the city of Houston. Eastwood Academy has been an \\"exemplary\\" high school since 2008, and is rated by the Texas Education Agency and was nominated as a Blue Ribbon School in 2010 and received the award, officially, in 2011. Eastwood Academy has been ranked number 2 in the Greater Houston area by Children at Risk, number 70 in the nation by The Washington Post, and number 53 in the nation by U.S. News . History Eastwood was built in 1954 as a Baptist Church before the Houston Independent School District bought the property and admitted the school as an internal charter in 2001. The building was renovated and expanded for \\"re-adaptive\\" use for 175 students. The renovation included administrative offices, library, cafeteria, classrooms, science laboratories, computer laboratories and a multi-purpose room with a stage. The school was originally supposed to be a 9th grade school and feeder to the nearby Austin High School. After some consideration, the founders decided that the school would serve as a small-school alternative to Austin HS, Milby HS, and Chavez HS. none Since then Eastwood Academy has admitted students from all around the Houston area; the majority enrolled are from nearby schools, some of which include Jackson Middle School, Edison Middle School, and Project Chrysalis Middle School, but others include Rice Middle, Lanier Vanguard, and TH Rogers Middle. Project Chrysalis Middle School makes up 38% of the class of 2016. Students are required to apply since it is a charter school and are admitted based on their grade point averages, standardized test scores, teacher recommendations, and interviews (which are conducted by the faculty and administration.) =Eastwood Campus Expansion= As a part of the Houston Independent School District's 2007 bond, Eastwood Academy has expanded in the form of a new two-story wing attached to the original building. This new wing included two science classrooms, a lecture hall, and additional classrooms, which include a smart board. The school has completed its planning and building of the expansion of the brand-new building as a part of the Houston Independent School District's 2012 bond. The new building completed construction in January of 2018. Academics Eastwood Academy offers Advanced Placement courses and Dual-Credit courses (through the Houston Community College system). Advanced Placement courses include: Statistics, Calculus AB/BC, Biology, Chemistry, Physics 1, Environmental Science, English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, Spanish Language and Culture, Spanish Literature and Culture, Human Geography, World History, U.S. History, European History, Art History, Studio Art, Computer Science A, U.S. Government and Politics, and Macroeconomics. Dual Credit courses include: English 1301 and 1302, Psychology 2301, Sociology 2301, Economics 2301, Government 2301, and Speech 1315. Along with these courses, students are encouraged to self-study or seek assistance for AP examinations not available as a class through the school (such as Comparative Government and Politics) or not being taken as a course by the student. Community-based organizations, which provide additional assistance and learning opportunities, are also available at the school for students to apply. These include: DiscoverU, the HISD EMERGE Fellowship, and OneGoal.  Athletics and Clubs  Eastwood Academy formerly offered volleyball and rugby through local divisions. However, the school continues to have a soccer team that participates in a local division. Due to the small size of the school, Eastwood Academy students that wish to participate in other athletic sports must do so through the school they are zoned to. Eastwood Academy offers several clubs that students can participate in. These include: the Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA), National Honor Society, Science National Honor Society, National Technical Honor Society, Debate (through the Houston Urban Debate League ), Motion Picture Society (Film Club), Anime Club, Fitness Club, Social Activists Club, CyberPatriot, and SkillsUSA. In addition, students are able to start their own clubs, if approved by the staff, via a form. Graduation and college acceptance Eastwood Academy has averaged, over the past seven years, a 99.7% graduation rate. In some cases juniors (11th graders) are able to graduate early because they have completed the required coursework earlier than their peers (3-5% of students each year). 100% of each graduating class has been accepted to college since 2007.

This example of rock cut architecture contains over 7,200 Buddhist sculptures and over 1,000 square meters of murals. Construction began in the Later Qin era (384–417 CE). They were first properly explored in 1952–53 by a team of Chinese archeologists from Beijing, who devised the numbering system still in use today. Caves #1–50 are on the western cliff face; caves #51–191 on the eastern cliff face. They were later photographed by Michael Sullivan and Dominique Darbois, who subsequently published the primary English-language work on the caves noted in the footnotes below. The name Maijishan consists of three Chinese words () that literally translate as \\"Wheatstack Mountain\\", but because the term \\"mai\\" () is the generic term in Chinese used for most grains, one also sees such translations as \\"Corn rick mountain\\". Mai means \\"grain\\". Ji () means \\"stack\\" or \\"mound\\". Shan () means \\"mountain\\". The mountain is formed of purplish red sandstone. They are just one of the string of Buddhist grottoes that can be found in this area of northwest China, lying more or less on the main routes connecting China and Central Asia. History Maijishan is located close to the east–west route that connects Xi'an with Lanzhou and eventually Dunhuang, as well as the route that veers off to the south that connects Xi'an with Chengdu in Sichuan and regions as far south as India. At this crossroads, several of the sculptures in Maijishan from around the 6th century appear to have Indian—and SE Asian—features that could have come north via these north–south routes. The earliest artistic influence came, however, from the northwest, through Central Asia along the Silk Road. Later, during the Song and Ming Dynasties, as the caves were renovated and repaired, the influences came from central and eastern China and the sculpture is more distinctly Chinese. Cave shrines in China probably served two purposes: originally, before Buddhism came to China, they may have been used as local shrines to worship one's ancestors or various nature deities.Michael Sullivan, The Cave-Temples of Maichishan. London: Faber and Faber, 1969, p. 1. With the coming of Buddhism to China, however, influenced by the long tradition of cave shrines from India (such as Ajanta) and Central Asia (primarily Afghanistan), they became part of China's religious architecture. Buddhism in this part of China spread through the support of the Northern Liang, which was the last of the \\"Sixteen Kingdoms\\" that existed from 304–439 CE—a collection of numerous short-lived sovereign states in China. The Northern Liang was founded by Xiongnu \\"barbarians\\". It was during their rule that cave shrines first appeared in Gansu, the two most famous sites being Tiantishan (\\"Celestial Ladder Mountain\\") south of their capital at Yongcheng, and Wenshushan (\\"Manjusri's Mountain\\" ), halfway between Yongcheng and Dunhuang. Maijishan was most likely started during this wave of religious enthusiasm. Sometime between 420 and 422 CE, a monk by the name of Tanhung arrived at Maijishan and proceeded to build a small monastic community. One of the legends is that he had previously been living in Chang'an but had fled to Maijishan when the city was invaded by the Sung army. Within a few years he was joined by another senior monk, Xuangao, who brought 100 followers to the mountain. Both are recorded in a book entitled Memoirs of Eminent Monks; eventually their community grew to 300 members. Xuangao later moved to the court of the local king where he remained until its conquest by the Northern Wei, when he, together with all the other inhabitants of the court, were forced to migrate and settle in the Wei capital. He died in 444 during a period of Buddhist persecution. Tanhung also left Maijishan during this period and travelled south, to somewhere in Cochin China, when in approximately 455, he burned himself to death.Michael Sullivan, pp. 2 ff. How the original community was organized or looked, we don't know. \\"Nor is there any evidence to show whether the settlement they founded was destroyed and its members scattered in the suppression of 444 and the ensuring years, or whether it was saved by its remoteness to become a heaven of refuse, as was to happen on several later occasions in the history of Maijishan\\".Michael Sullivan, p. 4. The Northern Wei was good to Maijishan and the grottoes existence close to the Wei capital city of Luoyang and the main road west brought the site recognition and, most likely, support. The earliest dated inscription is from 502, and records the excavation of what is now identified as Cave 115. Other inscriptions record the continued expansion of the grottoes, as works were dedicated by those with the financial means to do so. Design These Wei caves are fairly simple and most follow the pattern of a seated Buddha flanked by bodhisattvas and other attendants, sometimes by monks or lay worshippers. The most common Buddha is Amitābha, the principal Buddha of the Pure Land sect. Amitābha enables all who call upon him to be reborn into his heaven, the \\"Pure Land\\". There they undergo instruction by him ultimately to become bodhisattvas and buddhas in their own right. This was a very popular school of Mahayana Buddhism during this period. The bodhisattvas who accompany him are usually Avalokitesvara on the Buddha's right, and Mahasthamaprapta on his left. Avalokitesvara can be identified by his headdress which holds a small image of the Buddha Amitābha, and the fact that he often carries a small water flask. Sometimes he holds a heart-shaped, or pippala-leaf shaped object (which art historians still can't positively identify). Mahasthamaprapta is slightly more difficult to identify, but this is the usual pairing with Avalokitesvara (who will, in a few hundred more years, change gender and morph into the Goddess or Bodhisattva of Mercy, Guanyin). The monks are usually the two most famous associated with the historical Buddha: the younger Ananda, and the older Kasyapa, although sometimes the monks are simply generic monks. We also find statuary of nuns and lay worshippers and donors. Standing near the doorways guarding the Buddha and his entourage are often pairs of dvarapala or the four Heavenly Kings (lokapala). There are also statues of the historical Buddha, Sakyamuni, and the Buddha of the Future, Maitreya, recognizable by his seated position, legs crossed at the ankle. Some of the statues of the historical Buddha show Gandharan influences from Central Asia. The clue is in the volume and drapery of the robes as well as the shape and proportions of the statue's body and head. Nearly all of the statuary at Maijishan is made of clay with the addition of some sort of binding agent to help preserve the sculpture. When stone sculptures appear (for example, in caves 117, 127, 133 and 135), they are generally made of sandstone, and many are exquisite. The sandstone is reported not to be indigenous but instead of unknown origin. It is also unknown where the statues were made, or how they were hauled up into the caves. Of special note is Cave 133 with 23 stone stele. Comparison While there are many examples of Wei statuary, there are fewer examples from the Northern Zhou, which replaced the Wei with more solid, massive, and sculptural forms. The influences mentioned earlier that came from India (and perhaps SE Asia) begin to be apparent in this period and the subsequent Sui, when stiffly posed figures are replaced by more liquid tribhanga stances. One of the most common types of caves found at both Dunhuang and Yungang—that of a cave with a central shaft—is not found at Maijishan. We have almost no records of Maijishan during the Tang, a period during which it was probably in part under the control of the Tibetans as a result of the An Lushan rebellion (An saw an opportunity to swoop in and capture Chang'an and its regions). Because both Dunhuang and Maijishan were under Tibetan occupation in 845 CE, the year of the great Buddhist persecutions, both were fortunately saved. Today, we can find some Tang sculptural influence in the powerful modeling of some of the guardian deities, for example, the very large dvarapala on the narrow open terrace from which lead the Seven Buddha Halls. Upkeep The Tang was also an era of noteworthy earthquakes, including a very severe one in the region in 734. The Tang poet Du Fu visited the site 25 years later, and wrote a poem entitled \\"Mountain Temples\\" that probably is a description of Maijishan. It translates: : The Sung Dynasty brought major restoration initiatives to Maijishan so that much of what visitors see today are older grottoes with new or replaced Sung-period sculpture. The most notable change in this period is the shift in emphasis from the Buddha to the bodhisattvas \\"shown most dramatically in Cave 191 on the extreme western [cliff] face.... \\"The middle Ming was a period of revival and restoration [remember this is prime earthquake zone]—the last to make any significant mark on Maijishan before the present century.\\"Michael Sullivan, p. 17. It was also during this period that the two huge triads of statues on the eastern and western faces of the cliff were repaired—on the southeast cliff face, a seated Maitreya with legs pendant, flanked by two standing bodhisattvas; and on the southwest cliff face, an incomplete triad of a tall standing Buddha flanked by two attendants. In summary, construction and restoration extended over 12 dynasties at Maijishan: over the course of the Later Qin, Northern Wei, Western Wei, Northern Zhou, Sui, Tang, Period of the Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing. Although the region has fallen victim to many earthquakes and other natural and man-made disasters, 194 caves remain, encompassing 7200 pieces of sculpture, and 1000 square meters of frescoes, all excavated on a cliff face 30 to 80 meters above ground. Caves #1–50 are on the western cliff face; caves #51–191 on the eastern cliff face. These numbers were given the caves by the original 1952–53 Chinese archaeological team.

History The project was initiated by the Dundee Corporation Waterworks in 1964 and absorbed into the newly created East of Scotland Water Board in 1968, before final completion and the official opening by Queen Elizabeth II on 9 October 1969. Scottish Water are the present owners and operators of the reservoir, following the amalgamation of the East of Scotland Water Authority with the West of Scotland and North of Scotland Water Authorities to form a single company. Scottish Water is owned by the Scottish Government. Technical The dam is an embankment type, measuring 42.6 metres high by 570 metres long. The reservoir extends for 3 kilometres behind the dam and has a peak capacity of . An unclassified road runs across the spillway and embankment before following the east bank of the reservoir. This road runs for a further 2 kilometres before coming to an end. The dam was the first in Britain to use chemical grouting to create a waterproof barrier below the embankment.

Later, Snook was the head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at The Ohio State University. He invented the snook hook, a surgical instrument which is still used in spaying animals. He also was a founding member of the Alpha Psi veterinary fraternity. Snook was convicted of murdering Theora Hix, a 24-year- old medical student with whom he had had a three-year sexual affair. Snook claimed at his Columbus, Ohio, trial that he had killed Hix because she was threatening to kill Snook's wife and family, and that he feared she would shoot him. The trial was considered shocking for the sexual activities discussed, including fellatio. The jury took 28 minutes to deliberate before finding Snook guilty, after which he was sentenced to death by electrocution. Snook was executed on 28 February 1930 at the Ohio Penitentiary, by means of the electric chair. He was buried in Green Lawn Cemetery after a short service at the King Avenue Methodist Church.

This species of thrips is native to the Southwestern United States but has spread to other continents, including Europe, Australia (where it was identified in May 1993), and South America via transport of infested plant material.Kirk, DJ; Terry, IL (2003). The spread of the western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). Agricultural and Forest Entomology 5: 301 – 310. It has been documented to feed on over 500 different species of host plants, including a large number of fruit, vegetable, and ornamental crops. The adult male is about 1 mm long; the female is slightly larger, about 1.4 mm in length. Most western flower thrips are female and reproduce by arrhenotokous parthenogenesis; i.e. females can produce males from unfertilized eggs, but females arise only from fertilized eggs.Clarke, G. M., Gross, S., Matthews, M., Catling, P. C., Baker, B., Hewitt, C. L., Crowther, D., & Saddler, S. R. 2000, Environmental Pest Species in Australia, Australia: State of the Environment, Second Technical Paper Series (Biodiversity), Department of the Environment and Heritage, Canberra. Males are rare, and are always pale yellow, while females vary in color, often by season, from red to yellow to dark brown. Each adult is elongated and thin, with two pairs of long wings. The eggs are oval or kidney-shaped, white, and about 0.2 mm long. The nymph is yellowish in color with red eyes. The lifecycle of the western flower thrips varies in length due to temperature, with the adult living from two to five or more weeks, and the nymph stage lasting from five to 20 days. Each female may lay 40 to over 100 eggs in the tissues of the plant, often in the flower, but also in the fruit or foliage. The newly hatched nymph feeds on the plant for two of its instars, then falls off the plant to complete its other two instar stages. The insect damages the plant in several ways. The major damage is caused by the adult ovipositing in the plant tissue. The plant is also injured by feeding, which leaves holes and areas of silvery discoloration when the plant reacts to the insect's saliva. Nymphs feed heavily on new fruit just beginning to develop from the flower. The western flower thrips is also the major vector of tomato spotted wilt virus, a serious plant disease. Western flower thrips are a year-round pest, but are less destructive during wet weather. Damage can be reduced by growing barriers of nonhost plants around crops and by eliminating reservoir plants, plants to which the thrips are especially attracted, such as jimson weed. The thrips' natural enemies include pirate bugs of genus Orius. Other agents show promise as biological pest control, including the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae,Ansari, M.A., et al. (2007). Control of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) pupae with Metarhizium anisopliae in peat and peat alternative growing media. Biological Control 40:3, 293-297. and the mirid Dicyphus hesperus. Flower-feeding thrips are routinely attracted to bright floral colors, especially white, blue, and yellow, and will land and attempt to feed. Some flower thrips will \\"bite\\" humans wearing clothing with such bright colors, though no species feed on blood; such biting does not result in any known disease transmission, but skin irritations are known to occur.Childers CC, Beshear RJ, Frantz G, Nelms M (2005) A review of thrips species biting man including records in Florida and Georgia between 1986-1997.

Both photographs were of the same V-J Day embrace of a woman in a white dress by a sailor. Eisenstaedt's better known photograph, V-J Day in Times Square, was published in Life. On the day after the images were taken by the two photographers, the one taken by Jorgensen was published in The New York Times. His photograph, which was taken while he was on duty, is retained in the National Archives and Records Administration. Biography Jorgensen's Navy photograph of the V J Day kiss in Times Square Future president Gerald Ford is the jumper on the left of this 1943 photograph by Jorgensen CDR Edward Steichen photographed above the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Lexington by Jorgensen, November 1943. Jorgensen was born in Portland, Oregon. He attended the University of Oregon and Reed College, graduating in 1936. He married Betty Price on June 17, 1935. After college, he joined the staff of The Oregonian, working his way up from copy boy to night city editor. During his time at the newspaper, he became interested in photography and by the advent of World War II he was becoming a respected photographer. In 1942, Jorgensen enlisted in the Navy and was one of six initial photographers recruited by Edward Steichen to join the Naval Aviation Photographic Unit during the war.Faces of War: The Untold Story of Edward Steichen's WWII Photographers, pg. 48, Mark D. Faram, Berkeley Caliber, New York, New York, 2009, He served aboard aircraft carriers USS Lexington in the Gilbert Islands (fall 1943); the USS Monterey in the Mariana Islands (1944); destroyer USS Albert W. Grant and shore duty in Borneo and the Philippines during Douglas MacArthur's return in 1944; and the hospital ship USS Solace off Okinawa, spring 1945. While aboard the USS Monterey, he captured Navy pilots in the forward elevator well of the ship playing basketball during June 1944. One of the subjects, the jumper of the left, is Gerald Ford, who later became the president of the United States upon the resignation of Richard Nixon. On V J Day, 1945, both Jorgensen and Eisenstaedt captured the image of a U.S. sailor grabbing a nurse for an impromptu kiss in the midst of Times Square celebrations. In a 2010 article, The New York Times described it as \\"a defining image of the American century, one that expressed the joy of a nation at its moment of greatest triumph.\\" In the post-war decade, Jorgensen and his wife traveled the world as a photographer researcher team, contributing to magazines including Fortune, Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, Life, and Ladies Home Journal. Jorgensen served as president of the American Society of Media Photographers, working to establish minimum pay scales and fair practices for the photography industry. Later life After he left the Navy, Jorgensen settled in Maryland. He took over Chesapeake Skipper magazine, renaming it The Skipper and boosted its subscriptions from 1,500 to 50,000 by 1968. He and his wife moved to Portland at that time and started a boaters' consumer report newsletter. Jorgensen died of cancer in 1994 and was survived by his wife; two daughters; and two sisters.

Since 2004 Gauja NP is a part of Natura 2000 network as a territory, which is designed for conservation of protected species and biotopes. Tourism history has a long tradition in the Gauja NP. The first visitors were hiking in the Sigulda area with walking-sticks as far back as in the 19th century.Gauja National Park Every year thousands of visitors are attracted by the unique landscape, the largest Devonian rock outcrops – sandstone precipices, rocks and caves, as well as monuments of culture and history, which are twined with many legends and stories. In the national park, there are over 500 monuments of history and culture – hillforts, stone castles, churches, manors, water and windmills, as well as other archeological, architectural and art monuments.

It was completed in 1943 and was the last engine built by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, which was affectionately known as \\"The Cotton Belt Route\\" or simply \\"Cotton Belt\\". It was also the last locomotive built in Arkansas. Today, it was now located at the Arkansas Railroad Museum, awaiting for restoration back to operating condition. History The Cotton Belt initially purchased ten \\"Northern\\" 4-8-4 engines (#800–809) from Baldwin Locomotive Works located at Eddystone, Pennsylvania in 1930. Seven years later, the Cotton Belt built five more Northern engines (#810–814) from their own shops in Pine Bluff, Arkansas in 1937. These Northern locomotives were Class L1 on the Cotton Belt. In 1942, Cotton Belt officials petitioned the War Production Board for authorization to buy five new EMD FT diesel locomotives for their growing freight business. Instead, they were granted approval to produce five more 4-8-4 type locomotives (#815–819). Although similar to the previous set of five steam engines, these new locomotives had many modern improvements. Since 819 was built during World War II, some materials were in short supply. The Cotton Belt emblems, which would have normally been made of brass, were made of steel to save brass for the war effort. Decorative emblems, numbers, etc., were also made of steel and chromium plating was entirely eliminated. Work on the new L1 Northerns began on Tuesday June 2, 1942. But delivery of the boilers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works lagged. The five new boilers were shipped by Baldwin to Pine Bluff between November 5 and December 12, 1942. The rail journey from Philadelphia to Pine Bluff took about five days for each boiler. Work by the Cotton Belt shop forces took an additional five or six weeks to complete each new locomotive. On Monday February 8, 1943, the last of these five steam locomotives, Engine 819, was placed in active service. It was the final locomotive constructed by the Cotton Belt's own staff of mechanical engineers, mechanical officers, foremen and workers in the company shops at Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The cost to build was $143,607.00 and it was to be the last locomotive produced in Arkansas.Pine Bluff Commercial, February 7, 1943 Engine 819 traveled more than 804,000 miles during its 10½ years of service, before being forced aside by the more modern diesel locomotives. On July 19, 1955 Cotton Belt's President H. J. McKenzie presented retired Engine 819 to the City of Pine Bluff to show the Cotton Belt's gratitude for the part the city had played in their steam locomotive operations. McKenzie commented that this model engine is generally conceded to be one of the best designed and most attractive of its type ever built. He recalled how the engine had been built by local craftsmen, who were very proud of them and he hoped that the people of Pine Bluff would be equally proud to display it in their public park. Retirement In order to raise money for the cost of moving and constructing a permanent display structure for the engine, the City of Pine Bluff sold \\"shares\\" in the locomotive to the school children in Jefferson County. Children were requested to \\"buy\\" Engine 819 by contributing one penny per pound (the engine & tender weigh 541,300 pounds) and were presented with cards signed by the mayor indicating the number of \\"shares\\" purchased. It had been estimated they needed to raise $4,000.00 for the concrete based, metal roofed, pipe framed shed surrounded by a concrete walkway and fence. The problem of getting the locomotive moved to the display was solved when Cotton Belt agreed to lend materials for a temporary spur to the park. Cotton Belt and Missouri Pacific employees contributed the labor in building the spur and moving the historic locomotive and tender.Pine Bluff Commercial, Hey Kids! You Can Buy Shares in a Real Choo-Choo by Jack Bradley - April 15, 1955 However, just four years later, the Pine Bluff Commercial ran this note in the October 6, 1959 edition: :A Commercial newsman's inspection this week of the Cotton Belt locomotive permanently on display on a site between Oakland and Townsend Parks revealed the old steam engine has been neglected by the city. When the railroad donated the engine to the city it did so with the stipulation that the locomotive would receive proper care. Not only had the engine been allowed to deteriorate through rust, the effects of the weather in non-metal portions and acts of vandalism, but the grounds have been allowed to grow up around the fenced-in area so that visitors must trudge through weeds to get an up-close look at the locomotive.Pine Bluff Commercial, October 6, 1959 It took most of a year to get 819's situation improved. It was decided to move the engine to a new location approximately 150 yards west of its old spot, near the front of the Reserve building. The Pine Bluff Jaycees spearheaded the drive to build a green and white steel shed at the new location, while the move and reconditioning was being coordinated by members of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and Cotton Belt employees. Several civic organizations talked of undertaking the project of restoring the engine to better condition, only to find out that such a project required technical know-how that only railmen possessed. That was when BRT stepped in and offered to assist with the engine. \\"Before we're through,\\" one of the men said \\"that old engine will look just like it did the day it rolled out of the shop she was built in. We hope to have her fixed where she'll be better taken care of, too.\\"Pine Bluff Commercial, Trainmen Moving 'Old No. 819' to New Home - September 25, 1960 During the move to her new location between Townsend and Oakland Parks, Engine 819 \\"broke loose\\" and coasted down an incline on her temporary track. The locomotive, after starting to coast, rammed the park's lake embankment and finally stopped against a large black oak tree. The workmen labored the next day to get the engine back on her rails and into place. Crews stated they expected to have the locomotive in her new quarters in about two more weeks.Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society Newsletter alt= Although the engine and tender were successfully relocated during the Fall of 1960, it was several more years before the steel shed was erected overhead to protect the locomotive. In addition to the Pine Bluff Jaycees, the City of Pine Bluff and the Pine Bluff Park Commission each donated $500. Pine Bluff Mayor Franks personally donated $250 and another $250 was donated by the Townsend Park Commission. Gene Gardner, an engineer with International Paper, designed the green and white steel shed and drew up the plans for it. International Paper Company and the Pine Bluff Sand & Gravel Company furnished the concrete footings for the shed, while Varco Steel did the construction work. Construction of the shed was completed in September 1965 when a chain- link fence was installed and the landscaping was finished. Upon completion of Engine 819's new home in 1965, Mayor Austin Franks shared one of the two keys to the gate with long-time railfan James Norris. Norris' father had taken the locomotive out for her first run in 1943 and young James always remembered his late-father when he saw the engine. Despite being in his late 50s and in failing health, James Norris faithfully visited the locomotive every week to knock off the bird nests and occasionally replace some broken glass in the cab. He would open the gate on Sundays while he was there to let kids climb on the locomotive, ring the bell and answer their many questions. \\"Every time I come out here I can see my daddy standing right on that step.\\" Norris said \\"It kinda gets down in your heart.\\"Pine Bluff Commercial, Locomotive at Oakland Park Now in Shape; Painting Over - September 3, 1965 (page 3) It is uncertain when Mr. Norris' health got so bad that he could no longer continue his weekly maintenance visits to the 819, but he admitted in 1965 that his doctor had told him to stay away from the locomotive. Records indicate that Mr. Norris died in 1970 and by 1983 the Arkansas Democrat described the locomotive as \\"covered in graffiti and vandals have removed, or tried to take, whatever wasn't too heavy to carry off.\\" Miss Arkansas of 1958, Sally Miller Perdue, from Pine Bluff complained \\"It had been abandoned and stripped of all its dignity. It has become the iron-horse that was put out to pasture, neglected and abused.\\" Ms. Perdue, whose family had a long history with the railroad, agreed to chair a sub-committee of the Chamber of Commerce's Publicity & Tourism to get the 819 rejuvenated and relocated. With a slogan of \\"Let's Put the Steam Back in Pine Bluff\\", she felt that a lot of volunteers, mainly retired Cotton Belt craftsmen and engineers, would be interested in working to restore the 819. Superintendent R. R. McClanahan of the Cotton Belt Pine Bluff Division worked hard to get the locomotive and tender transported from the park back to the shops to make those repairs.Arkansas Democrat, Former Miss Arkansas Tries to Put the Steam Back Into '819' by Randy Tardy - April 10, 1983 Return to the Cotton Belt shops On December 1, 1983, a force of between 50–100 Cotton Belt employees, most of them volunteers, assisted railfans and rail historical groups, placed Engine 819 back on Cotton Belt rails for the first time in nearly three decades and transported the engine from the park back to the site of its manufacturing 40 years earlier. Members of the newly formed Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society moved the locomotive back to the Cotton Belt shops, where it was to be restored in a bold project to show Arkansans what past gigantic locomotives looked like.Cotton Belt News, Spring 1984. Vol. 31, No. 1 Although the ownership of the locomotive was retained by the city, the restoration of the 819 was the responsibility of \\"Project 819\\", an all-volunteer effort by two rail historical preservation groups: the Arkansas Railroad Club and the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society. The project leased space needed at the Cotton Belt shops in Pine Bluff to complete the restoration, which was projected to take 18–24 months.Arkansas Gazette, Restoration of the Old 819 to Start From the Ground Up by Randy Tardy - December 18, 1983 While the engine languished in the park, various parts disappeared including its bell, whistle, Cotton Belt emblems and many of the gauges. Jake Commer, President of the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society at the time, offered a \\"no questions asked\\" policy for the return of these items and received many of the parts back, including the whistle and one of the emblems. The original bell was never located however and the one currently on the engine is from another 800 class locomotive. That bell was used for many years by the Wesley United Methodist Church in Pine Bluff before being donated to Project 819.Arkansas Democrat, Restoration of Steam Locomotive Chugs Along by Randy Tardy - May 1, 1985 Led by Bill B. Bailey, the Restoration Director for \\"Project 819\\", seven separate volunteer groups worked six days a week on various sections of the locomotive and tender in hopes of getting the engine totally restored and federally certified as worthy to run on the rails again. Mr. Bailey estimated that about 20% of the volunteers had actually worked on the locomotive or went through an apprenticeship in the early 1940s when the 819 or other 800-class steam locomotives were built in the Cotton Belt Shops at Pine Bluff. Engine 819 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.  Excursions  alt= On April 6, 1986, Engine 819 moved out of the Cotton Belt Route's yard at Pine Bluff marking the first time it had moved under its own power since 1953. The large crowd gathered at the railyard, including a number of railroad employees, burst into applause and shouted their approval as the locomotive's nose emerged from the shop building and into the bright sunshine. The American flag and the Arkansas state flag affixed to the right and left sides of the shiny black engine gave a patriotic air to the event. Members of the Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society invested over 35,000 man-hours into this restoration project. Jake Commer praised the efforts the Cotton Belt Route had extended stating, \\"They helped us so much I can't even begin to tell you about all of it. If it hadn't been for the railroad, we couldn't have done it.\\"Arkansas Gazette, '819' on the Rails Again by Philip Launius - April 10, 1986 Twenty days later, on April 26, 1986, Engine 819 pulled into Fordyce on her first full-fledged trip out of Pine Bluff in 31 years. School children from Pine Bluff, Rison, Kingsland and Fordyce waved and shouted their delight at the engine. Cars of railfans followed the train's path, taking pictures.Pine Bluff Commercial, New 819 Rolls out to Cheers by Jane Gore - April 26, 1986 On June 13, 1986, Engine 819 participated in the Arkansas State Sesquicentennial with a trip to Little Rock and was perhaps Pine Bluff's most visible contribution to the weekend events marking the state's 150th birthday. In addition to Pine Bluff's Mayor Robinson, Louis Ramsay - Chairman of the state's Sesquicentennial Commission, and Judge Earl Chadick, Sr. of Jefferson County, Hillary Clinton also rode up from Pine Bluff in the opulent VIP car named \\"The Houston\\" on loan from the Cotton Belt. Governor Bill Clinton joined his wife and the other riders on board when the train slowed to a crawl behind Barton Coliseum, just minutes from Little Rock's Union Station. Engine 819 spent the weekend on display at Union Station, just a few blocks north of the state capitol, as part of Arkansas' Sesquicentennial celebration, before returning to Pine Bluff.Pine Bluff Commercial, Engine Travels to Capital by James M. Hopkins - June 14, 1986 During the summer of 1986, film crews came to Pine Bluff for the production of the movie End of the Line. Engine 819 played a minor role along with 35 Pine Bluff residents turned-actors, many of them members of the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society who had helped restore the steam engine. Arkansas-born actress Mary Steenburgen was the film's executive producer, who worked hard to be able to use the newly restored locomotive for the movie.Pine Bluff Commercial, Cameras Roll on 'Hot' Local Star by James M. Hopkins - July 27, 1986 On August 27, Pine Bluff residents were treated to a special premiere showing of the Orion Pictures film at the Pine Mall Cinema. Proceeds from the $5.00 tickets were given to the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society. For the next seven years, the locomotive traveled on numerous excursions, including a trip to the 1990 NRHS convention in St. Louis, where it stood at Union Station with Union Pacific Railroad's No. 844, Frisco No. 1522 and Norfolk & Western No. 1218. No. 819 ran its final excursion train to Tyler, Texas in October 1993. Today, the locomotive is partially disassembled for its mandated 15-year Federal Railroad Administration inspection. The boiler has been “ultra- sounded” and documented, with only a small area of the firebox remaining to be checked. The flue tubes were removed with plans made for their replacement. A sudden increase in material costs and various emergency repairs needed at the museum over the years have exhausted funds that were hoped to be used to complete the project. The locomotive has sat idle inside the museum, awaiting its return to steam and possible future travels.\\"NRHS News\\" National Railway Historical Society, Chapter Seeks Funds to ‘re-steam’ Locomotive by Steve Rankin, April 2009 Newsletter, page 5 References External links *Cotton Belt Engine 819 Railway locomotives on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Individual locomotives of the United States 4-8-4 locomotives Preserved steam locomotives of the United States Arkansas Railroad Museum St. Louis Southwestern Railway Standard gauge locomotives of the United States Railway locomotives introduced in 1943 ","title":"St. Louis Southwestern 819"},{"id":"13168733","text":"The National Police Academy (NPA) is the National Institute for training of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officers who have been selected through the prestigious Central Superior Services (CSS) examination.The trained officers on passing out hold the rank of ASP (Assistant Superintendents of Police).

Name The name Shifen was taken from the 10 original families who develop the area in Pingxi. The waterfall also is nicknamed the Little Niagara of Taiwan. Geology The riverbed of the waterfall consists of several potholes which was caused by the uneven flow of the river, thus creating vortexes that traps passing rocks and causing them to spin and carve holes. Access The waterfall is at about 2 km northeast of Shifen station of Taiwan Railways. The land surrounding the waterfall was private land for a long time and a private company collected entrance fees from the visitors. In 2014, New Taipei city's Tourism and Travel Department acquired the land around the waterfall and created a municipal park and made the admission to the park free.

Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual Enrollment The high school does not offer the Pennsylvania Dual Enrollment program which permits students to earn deeply discounted college credits (up to 75% off) while still enrolled in high school. Students retain full access to all activities and programs at the high school, including the graduation ceremony. The program is offered through over 400 school districts with the assistance of a state grant. There are minimal administrative costs to the school district for this program. Graduation project By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district.Pennsylvania Code §4.24 (a) High school graduation requirements Secondary Reading I and II Karns City High School requires summer reading as part of the curriculum in both Secondary Reading I and II. Students are mandated to read two books for a total of 400 pages. Additionally, the student regularly write reading responses which they submit to the teacher via email during the summer or on paper the first day of school in the new school year. A list of the books that may be read is posted on the district's website. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.Home- Schooled, Charter School Children Can Participate in School District Extracurricular Activities, Pennsylvania Office of the Governor Press Release, November 10, 2005 References External links * Public high schools in Pennsylvania Schools in Butler County, Pennsylvania Education in Pittsburgh area Education in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania Education in Clarion County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Karns City High School"},{"id":"13168838","text":"Holiday is an independent English-language newsweekly published on Fridays in Bangladesh.

He was apparently a nutritus, or foster son, of Robert V de Brus, Lord of Annandale, and seems to have been closely linked in some way to Adam de Kirkcudbright, the man who held the church of Dalton in Annandale.Watt, Dictionary, p. 308. He was likely a native Galwegian or perhaps a native of Annandale. As the chaplain of Robert de Brus, he was elected by the chapter of Whithorn Cathedral to replace the recently deceased Henry of Holyrood as Bishop of Galloway, sometime before 13 January 1294.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 129. He offered obedience to the Archbishop of York on 30 May and was consecrated on 10 October.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 129-30. His election was initially opposed by John Balliol, King of the Scots, though John was eventually reconciled to the election. By the time of his election to the bishopric, he was already a priest and was styled magister, indicating the completion of a university education - though not details of his university education are not known. Although naturally better disposed to the Bruces than Balliols, his exact role during the turbulence of the First War of Scottish Independence is not clear; after the deposition of Balliol by King Edward I of England, he was co-operative with the English crown, both in his role as a senior inhabitant of the Kingdom of Scotland and as a suffragan of the Archbishop of York.Watt, Dictionary, pp. 308-9. He spent a great deal of time in this period both in Galloway, and in England, and was a close associate of John de Halton, Bishop of Carlisle. The latter, a papal tax collector, granted Thomas a £40 loan from the papal funds stored at Tongland Abbey, in August 1294, undoubtedly related to his accession as Bishop of Galloway. It came to be thought by some York authorities that he had never adhered to the cause of King Robert I of Scotland, when they called him to a council on this basis on 5 March 1323.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 130. Bishop Thomas however had spent a lot of time in the post-Bannockburn kingdom, attending the Ayr assembly of 27 April 1315, where he added his seal to a declaration about the Bruce succession; he added his seal to another pro-Bruce document at some point between October 1314 and November 1316, and attended the Scone parliament of 3 December 1318.Watt, Dictionary, p. 310. His date of death is unknown exactly, but it was after 4 April 1324, and had occurred by 23 September 1326, when his successor Simon de Wedale was elected to succeed him.This date differs significantly from that given in Dowden, Bishops, p. 360, who thought him to be dead by 1320; this however is based on an error: see Watt, Dictionary, p. 310; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 130; Notes References * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed.

Antibodies to ganglioside subtypes Autoantigenic gangliosides that are currently known are GD3, GM1, GQ3 and GT1. =Anti-GD3= Anti-GD3 antibodies have been found in association with specific forms of Guillain–Barré syndrome. In vivo studies of isolated anti- GM1 and GD3 antibodies indicate the antibodies can interfere with motor neuron function. Anti-GD1a antibodies were highly associated acute motor axonal neuropathy while high titers of anti-GM1 were more frequent indicating that GD1a possibly targets the axolemma and nodes of Ranvier most of the Ab+ patients had C. jejuni infections. Patients with Anti-GalNAc-GD1a antibodies were less common but had more severe disease (rapidly progressive, predominantly distal weakness). =Anti-GM1= Levels of anti-GM1 antibodies are elevated in patients with various forms of dementia. Antibodies levels correlate with more severe Guillain–Barré syndrome. Levels of anti-GM1 antibodies are especially elevated in patients with prodromal diarrhea. Titers to GM1 in other diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, primary Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus) was also elevated. Additionally highly significant association was found with rheumatoid arthritis and peripheral neuropathies. Conflicting evidence suggests no significant elevation in motor neuron neuropathy but marginally elevated IgA in sensory neuron neuropathies. The autoimmune role of anti-GM1 is still unclear. Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction block is closely related to CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy). Anti-GM1 antibodies are positive in around 80% of cases. MMN will present with asymmetrical motor neuropathy where reflexes are usually preserved (or slightly increased), affecting upper limb more than lower limb. MMN is potentially treatable with immunomodulation. =Anti- GQ1b= Anti-GQ1b are found in Miller-Fisher syndrome. This presents with the classical triad of ataxia, areflexia and ophthalmoplegia.

Perhaps the most internationally acclaimed Colombian artist is painter and sculptor Fernando Botero (1932).  Pre-Columbian sculpture  = Pottery = There is archaeological evidence that ceramics were produced on Colombia's Caribbean coast earlier than anywhere in the Americas outside of the lower Amazon Basin. Fiber-tempered ceramics associated with shell middens appeared at sites such as Puerto Hormiga, Monsú, Puerto Chacho, and San Jacinto by 3100 BC. Fiber-tempered ceramics at Monsú have been dated to 5940 radiocarbon years before present. The fiber-tempered pottery at Puerto Hormiga was \\"crude\\", formed from a single lump of clay. The fiber-tempered pottery at San Jacinto is described as \\"well-made\\". Sand-tempered coiled ceramics have also been found at Puerto Hormiga. The Piartal culture (750–1250 AD) in the mountainous region on the Colombia–Ecuador border produced unique methods of producing pottery as well as patterns inspired by animal or snake skin. Vessels were created for use in secondary burial, or the practice of allowing the flesh to decompose and then reburying the bones. These vessels were also used to hold relics and jewelry belonging to the deceased. Poporo Quimbaya and pestle. Phytomorphic (fruit-shaped) lime container, gold, 300 BCE – 1000 CE = Goldwork = The earliest examples of gold craftsmanship have been attributed to the Tumaco people of the Pacific coast and date to around 325 BCE. Gold would play a pivotal role in luring the Spanish to the area now called Colombia during the 16th century (See: El Dorado). One of the most valued artifacts of Pre-Columbian goldwork is the so-called Poporo Quimbaya, a small (23.5 × 11.4 cm), hollow, devotional object (used to mambeo or coca leaf chewing ritual) made of gold whose aesthetic harmony, simple elegance, and mathematical symmetry are striking and almost modern. The Museo del Oro in Bogotá displays the most important collection of pre-Columbian gold handicraft in the Americas. = Stone = Roughly between 200 BCE and 800 CE, the San Agustín culture, masters of stonecutting, entered its “classical period\\". They erected raised ceremonial centres, sarcophagi, and large stone monoliths depicting anthropomorphic and zoomorphhic forms out of stone. Some of these have been up to five meters high. Related to the San Agustín culture were the inhabitants of Tierradentro (“inner land”, so called because of its inaccessibility) who created over one hundred and fifty underground tombs, or hypogea; their walls and ceilings were richly decorated with geometric forms recalling the interior of palm huts. Also in the tombs were found funeral urns, bowls, and pitchers.

During the early period of the Colombian republic, the national artists were focused in the production of sculptural portraits of politicians and public figures, in a plain neoclassicist trend. During the 20th century, the Colombian sculpture began to develop a bold and innovative work with the aim of reaching a better understanding of national sensitivity.

Santander Department Colombian colonial art includes altar wood carving masterpieces and the statues for religious processions. = Colonial period = Painting in the colonial period reflected the power and prestige of the Catholic Church and the Spanish aristocracy in Colombia or as it was then known The New Kingdom of Granada (c. 1548-1717) and later The Viceroyalty of New Granada (1717–1819).  Early colonial period  Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá (flanked by St. Anthony of Padua and St. Andrew the Apostle) by Alonso de Narváez, tempura on rustic cloth, 16th century Colombian painting in the early colonial period (1530s–1650) was mostly ecclesiastical in subject and based on mannerist, renaissance, and medieval styles, with some minor influence from indigenous culture. Spanish explorers first set foot on Colombian soil in 1499 and established Santa Marta, the first city and government in the territory of Colombia, in 1599. King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabela of Castille had in 1492 year unified Spain and conquered the remaining Moorish stronghold in southern Spain (Granada); expelled Jews with the Alhambra Decree and continued the Inquisition; and sent Christopher Columbus on his first expedition. It is from this context of reconquista or the Christianizing of the Iberian peninsula that the similarly strongly Catholic colonial project in the Americas might be understood. In this period, Spain and Portugal were the greatest powers in Europe and the most dogged defenders (and enforcers) of Catholicism. Workshops in Seville produced many of the early paintings sent to Colombia. Colombian artists in this period were mostly considered common tradesmen, like cobblers or coopers. As throughout much of the history of art around the world, these usually anonymous artisans produced work that served the ideological needs of their patrons, in this case the Catholic Church. The churches and homes of wealthy families in the main towns of Cundinamarca and Boyacá contain some of the oldest extant examples of colonial art in Colombia, mostly in the form of mural painting. The first colonial-era painter to work in Colombia, or as it was then known as, Nueva Granada, was the Seville native Alonso de Narváez (d. 1583). He is credited with painting an image of the Virgin Mary (Our Lady of the Rosary) that later became itself an object of devotion, known as Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá thanks to, as Catholics believe, a miraculous repairing of the painting's fabric. Holy Trinity by Gregorio Vázquez de Arce y Ceballos, oil on canvas, 17th century  Baroque period  Baroque art (starting in Rome around 1600), including Latin American Baroque (1650-1750 :es:Gregorio Vásquez de Arce y Ceballos), tended towards emotionalism, an appeal to populism, and large gestures and flowing garments. In line with the Counter-Reformation a generation prior, the Jesuits, an order formed to counter Protestantism, were the first to embrace the Baroque. The major influences on Colombian artists in this period were Spanish Baroque painters like Francisco de Zurbarán (1580–1664), as well as Flemish, Italian, and also Quito and Cuzco influences, through engravings and various original images imported for churches and monasteries. Another Seville native, Baltasar de Figueroa El Viejo (1629–1667), settled in Bogotá in the early 17th century and set up an artist's workshop. He and his many descendants would be prolific and would invent a kind of creolized Colombian form of Baroque painting that combined the borrowing of forms and subjects from European engravings (mostly religious in nature: saints in various states of mortification or ecstasy, the Virgin Mary, or Christ) with native motifs and decoration. But it would be one of the Figueroa family's apprentices, Gregorio Vázquez de Arce y Ceballos, who would stand out among all painters of the colonial era. Gregorio Vasquez de Arce y Ceballos (1638–1711) is considered the greatest master of the colonial period. In his lifetime he produced around five hundred paintings, mostly devotional, with a technique that juxtaposed figures taken from paintings by European masters using innovative materials found in the New World. His depictions of the Trinity as a single figure with four eyes and three faces, an innovation unique to Latin America, would be later condemned as heretical in part because they resembled Hindu deities. The Sopo Archangels is a series of twelve paintings, each featuring an archangel (three canonical, plus eight apocryphal, and one guardian) engulfed in a tenebrous (cloudy) background. Their figures are life-sized, clad in rich apparel, full of drapes and folds, and are meant to be \\"read\\" through their various iconography. Like many depictions of angels, these ostensibly male figures are depicted with soft, feminine faces and round hips. The origin of this series is unknown, as is the artist. It is considered one of the enduring enigmas of Colombian art.

This period marked a period of resurgence and the first sparks of Enlightenment in Spain. Rococo, a decadent form, replaced baroque as the dominant style. The new viceroy court in Bogotá led to a surge in demand for portraits of civilians and clergymen. The leading portrait painter of this period was Joaquín Guttiérrez. He depicted members of the aristocracy in frozen forms, surrounded by richly embellished furniture and decoration, and usually printed the subject's name and family title beneath their image. = Republican period = File:Policarpa Mercedes Delgado Mallarino.jpgPolicarpa Salavarrieta portrait by Mercedes Delgado Mallarino File:General Santander.jpgPortrait of Francisco de Paula Santander (1874) by Martín Tovar y Tovar (1827-1902). Oil on canvas File:JoaquínMosquera2.jpgPortrait of Joaquín Mosquera by Ricardo Acevedo Bernal (1867) = 20th century and modernism = From 1920 to 1940, Marco Tobón Mejía, José Horacio Betancur, Pedro Nel Gómez, Ignacio Gómez Jaramillo, Santiago Martinez Delgado and Alipio Jaramillo produced several mural paintings influenced by the Mexican muralists, with neoclassic features and influences of Art Nouveau. During the 1940s, a raising internacional disinterest in the Colombian art caused to the local artis to try new ways of expression such as post-impressionism and French scholar style. An example of this is the landscape painter Ricardo Gómez Campuzano and his depictions of Cartagena. Several art critics point to the 1950s as the time when Colombian art started to have a distinctive point of view, reinventing the traditional elements under the 20th century concepts. Examples of this are the Greiff portraits by Ignacio Gomez Jaramillo, showing what the Colombian art could do with the new techniques applied to typical Colombian themes. Carlos Correa, with his paradigmathic “Naturaleza muerta en silencio” (silent dead nature), combines geometrical abstraction and cubism in a style still recurrent today in many artists. Pedro Nel Gómez, in his “Autorretrato con sombrero” (1941) (self-portrait with hat) shows influences from Gauguin and Van Gogh. He also shows a strong influence of José Clemente Orozco in his series about the Barequeras (women extracting gold from the rivers banks) and his self-portrait (1949) shows strong influences from Cézanne. Alejandro Obregón is often considered as the father of modern Colombian painting, and one of the most influential artist in this period, due to his originality, the painting of Colombian landscapes with symbolic and expressionist use of animals, (specially the andean condor). In his work is noticeable the influences of Picasso and Graham Sutherland. Currently, some of the most recognized painters in the international scene are Fernando Botero and Omar Rayo.

At the end of the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th century the most important center of theater in Colombia was the Colon theater in downtown Bogota. These theaters were built resembling Italian architecture style. During the 20th century interest for theater had spread all over Colombia and many theater were built in the biggest cities of Colombia. Colombia currently holds one of the biggest theater festivals in the world, properly called the Ibero-American Theater Festival. As in many other parts of the world, future actors and actresses begin their performing experience in theater many of them with the goal of making it to television or film. Theater in Colombia is informally known as \\"tablas\\" (woods) because of the wooden stages on which actors perform their plays. Colombia has a mature system of theater companies which reaches an audience mostly in the city of Bogota.

Luxembourg wines in general have been described as lighter-style Alsace wine but are not very often encountered outside Luxembourg and neighbouring Belgium as the most of the production tends to be consumed by the Luxembourgers themselves. Sparkling wine (Crémant de Luxembourg) makes up a significant portion of the production, but is a designation within AC Moselle Luxembourgeoise rather than a separate appellation, which is usually the case with French Crémants.

Portrayed as one of the protagonist's first friends, Hayato Gokudera is introduced as a 14-year-old bad boy born in Italy. He inherits many traits from his mother, and is half-italian and half-japanese. After the protagonist Tsuna Sawada prevents him from dying due to his own explosives, he joins Tsuna's Vongola Mafia family. He later becomes the Vongola Storm Guardian Character outline =History= When he was younger, he was a talented pianist. However, he soon decided to join the Mafia after his mother's death. His father is also reportedly a member of a Mafia family. Unfortunately, no one wanted to accept him into their family; the fact that he was an oriental half-breed lessened his chances of finding a Mafia family to take him in. To become stronger, he sought advice from Dr. Shamal, who, at the time, was working for his family. Gokudera seemed to have looked up to Shamal who taught him how to use dynamite. He and Bianchi are actually half siblings, by their father. Gokudera's mother was a woman with whom his father had an affair. She was a very talented pianist, whom their father fell in love with at first sight. Not long after, they became involved and the woman bore a child. However, in the mafia, illegitimate children are not tolerated, and everyone was told that Gokudera was also from Bianchi's mother. His real mother was killed after driving off a cliff on her way to see her son. It slid off the road at an impossible location. It's been said that there weren't even tire marks. Suicide was considered, but she had been looking forward to that day and had even brought a present for the young Gokudera. Gokudera himself was unaware of what had happened until he was eight and fled the mansion the day following the revelation. However, it was then said that the reason Gokudera's mother slid off the cliff at an impossible place was because the accident had been deliberately caused by one of Gokudera's father's organization members. In Chapter 282 or episode 89, however, it turned out that Gokudera's mother was already sick with a disease and it was she that turned down Gokudera's father's proposal because she knew she was going to die soon. According to Bianchi, Gokudera's mother had already died before slipping off from the cliff. Gokudera did not decide to join the Mafia until after he found out about his mother's death, as he wanted revenge on his father because of this. He wandered about, with no family wanting him, until the Vongola finally agreed to let him join. He worked as a hitman for Vongola for several years, which is where he gained his title of Hurricane Bomb Hayato. =Personality= Gokudera knows how to play the piano and has an obsession with cryptozoology. At school, Gokudera is adored by many of the female classmates who view him as the \\"rebellious, cool badboy.\\" However, despite his image of a rebel, Gokudera excels in his schoolwork and aces all his tests, much to the surprise of Tsuna. Still, he respects Tsuna greatly and considers himself to be the perfect candidate to be Tsuna's right-hand man. For this reason, Gokudera tends to regard most of Tsuna's friends as an enemy for the chance to be Tsuna's right-hand man. This is most notably shown with Takeshi Yamamoto, but, along the series, he starts developing a friendly relationship with him though he tries to stay cool. Due to a traumatic childhood experience, every time he sees the face of his older sister, Bianchi, he collapses, sometimes even falling unconscious. He is however immune to his sister when she happens to be wearing something that covers part of her face (mainly the eyes). He has problems showing his feelings to people other than Tsuna because Tsuna was the one who opened his heart. =Abilities= Gokudera is a dynamite specialist who uses it to either threaten or battle opponents. He was revealed to be able to conceal dynamite on his body. Originally, Gokudera's main weakness was the fact that it was difficult to pinpoint and calculate the exact distance between himself and his target and sync it with the amount of time it would take for the bombs to actually explode. Gokudera learned from Dr. Shamal, to use a type of Rocket Bombs. Each one, once thrown, causes the backside of the bombs to fire up and rocket towards his opponent like high-speed missiles, which then explode on impact. he also smokes in the manga but doesn't in the anime which makes his way of lighting his bomb a mystery In the future arc of the manga, the future Gokudera created Sistema Cambio Arma Istantaneo (lit. System Change Arms Instantaneous; Italian for Instantaneous Arms Rearrangement System), commonly called Sistema C.A.I., a system of box weapons that utilize the five different Dying Will Flames that flow within his body. Each attribute of flame has a different effect when used with the storm-attribute rockets fired with the C.A.I.; the storm attribute attacks causes the object or person to degenerate, the rain attribute slows and weakens enemy attacks or dying will flames, it can even go through a solid shield of lightning attribute flames, the lightning attribute creates a solid laser beam, which is his most powerful attack with Sistema C.A.I., Gokudera calls it Flame Thunder, the cloud attribute creates a branching effect, the cloud flame's special ability is propagation, and the sun attribute gives his projectiles an unpredictable acceleration. His box weapons contain a number of miscellaneous accessories used in battle; one creates a lightning disc to ride atop in battle, while two others create shields to defend against enemy attacks. He also possesses a box containing a wild cat which he named Uri. While in his natural form Uri is useless and shows no respect for Gokudera, often scratching and biting him, with Sun Flames, Uri can transform into a massive leopard. Uri is later given an upgrade and now can transform into the Storm Vongola Box, G. Archery, a weapon similar to a crossbow attached to Gokudera's arm that lets him store up his energy to release in powerful flame shots. Appearances =In Reborn!= During the Kokuyo Arc, he ranked 3rd as Namimori Junior High's strongest. During his confrontation with Chikusa, he is nearly killed, but manages to survive, after treatment from the lecherous Dr.Shamal. Although he does not fully recover, he joins Tsuna and his friends in looking for the Kokuyo Gang. Gokudera later frees Hibari and gives him the cure to the Sakura-kura virus. In the Varia arc, Hayato was trained by Shamal . Hayato was later pitted against Belphegor for the Ring of Storm. A struggle for the rings ensued, as area they were in had large explosives timed to go off shortly. Hayato wanted to please Tsuna and become his right-hand man. But suddenly Tsuna had an outburst saying that they were fighting to have fun with each other. Because Hayato abandoned the rings, Belphegor was deemed the winner. Later, during the Sky match, Hayato was saved by Hibari and after defeating Levi-a-than, proceeded to save Lambo and Ryohei. After Hayato was transported to the future, he decoded a note left by his future self written in Gokudera - Drawings, his own secret code. To return to the past Tsuna must gather the guardians and defeat Byakuran and Irie Shouichi. He later engages in a fight with a Black spell member, Gamma. He soon came to realize that he was no match for Gamma and, as he was about to receive the finishing blow, was saved by Hibari. After recovering, Gokudera begins his training with his sister. At first he refused, however Bianchi offered him something that belonged to their father if he completed his training. He later escapes from her training and is not heard of again for some time. During that time, Gokudera is in the base's library, trying to figure out how Sistema C.A.I. works. When Tsuna searches for him after training he emerges with a new technique. Gokudera is involved in the raid on the Millefiore's Melone base. After being separated from Yamamoto and Lal Mirch, he and Ryohei found themselves face to face with Gamma. After Ryohei is injured fighting Gamma, Gokudera battles Gamma and the two battle to a stalemate. He was later saved and carried off by Kusakabe. After the Melone Base arc, Gokudera is instructed by Dino to teach the ten years younger Ryohei and Lambo on how to use their Vongola box weapons. He then participates in the Choice battle, which the Vongola lose, before the group are tasked with protecting Uni, the granddaughter of the Sky Arcobaleno, from Byakuran. Gokudera gets injured, but joins Lal and Gamma in a battle against the Funeral Wreath, Zakuro, and uses his Vongola Box against him. In the Inheritance Arc, he is one of the guardians who accompanied Tsuna to inherit the title as Vongola 10th. Later, his Vongola Storm Ring was destroyed when the Shimon Family, friends of Vongola who wanted revenge, attacked at the inheritance ceremony. He later gains the Vongola Gear 'Belt of the Storm'. =In other media= Besides his appearances in the manga and the anime, Gokudera has a character CD along with Takeshi Yamamoto entitled . It was released by Pony Canyon on January 23, 2008, and it contains various dialogues and phrases by Gokudera and Yamamoto's voice actors, Hidekazu Ichinose and Suguru Inoue, respectively. He has also been featured as a playable character in various video games based on the Reborn! series. Reception Various pieces of merchandise have been developed based on Gokudera's appearance such as keychains, plush and figurines. His character has continuously appeared in the Top 5 of the official Shonen Jump popularity polls. In the first poll, he ranked at the top with a total of 3926 votes. In the second poll which was divided between heroes and villains, Gokudera ranked as the third most popular hero losing to Tsuna Sawada and Kyoya Hibari. In the third poll of the series, he ranked as the fourth most popular male character, while in the latest he ranked third, once again losing to Tsuna and Hibari. In the fourth poll Gokudera's future self also appeared sixth in the division in which voted which characters' future selves they wanted to see. While reviewing the ninth volume from the manga series, Sam Kusek from popcultureshock.com liked Gokudera's fights in such volume, but he mentioned that the \\"real winners\\" were Tsuna and Mukuro Rokudo. In mangalife.com Michael Aronson's review of the second volume, Gokudera was noted as one of the several \\"oddball characters\\" appearing in the series. Manga-sanctuary saw his rivalry with Yamamoto as repetitious.

The film follows five English freestyle footballers as they try to raise money by showcasing their skills, in order to fund a trip to Buenos Aires to meet their idol Diego Maradona. The five freestyle footballers are: Sami Hall, Danny Robinson, Paul Wood, Jeremy Lynch, and Mikey Fisher. They have no money for food, travel, or accommodation. Two of them were actually living on the streets prior to starting their mission. Their journey takes them through North, Central, and South America and tests them both physically and mentally. It is a journey that takes them far from their homes on a trip that will change their lives forever. The title is a reference to Maradona's famous Hand of God goal. The film was made by Fulwell 73, a production company based in London, founded and run by Leo Pearlman, Gabe Turner, Ben Turner, and Ben Winston. The film was directed by the Turner brothers and produced by Pearlman and Winston. Lionsgate distributed the film in the United Kingdom and it was released on the opening weekend in over 60 screens, making it the widest-released documentary ever in the United Kingdom. Plot The movie follows five British freestylers from distinct backgrounds who try to track down Maradona. In order of appearance, they are Paul Wood (nicknamed Woody), Danny Robinson, Mikey Fisher, Jeremy Lynch, and Sami Hall. The freestylers fly to the United States to raise money for their trips across North America, firstly to perform on the streets of New York, as well as famous landmarks such as Times Square and Central Park. They travel to Memphis and Dallas, where they are used as half-time entertainment during a FC Dallas match. However, they do not have the money to go on a direct fight to Mexico, so they take a coach to get to Mexico City. The freestylers perform in different cities across the country, including at the Azteca Stadium, where the Hand of God goal took place. After it is revealed that the group have only have enough money for two plane tickets, they are unsure on what to do. Lynch wants the group to stay together, but tickets for the five of them would cost approximately $3000, which Wood thinks is unlikely to happen in such a short space of time. The group decide on a lucky dip and have it announced by two strangers; Hall and Robinson's names are the ones chosen. Robinson gives up his spot to Wood, mainly due to him feeling that Wood is a better freestyler. Hall and Wood travel further down South America towards Guatemala. The remaining three go back to the United States, in particular to Los Angeles, where they perform at Venice Beach. Fisher gets increasingly frustrated with Robinson and Lynch, and feels that they are not taking the opportunity seriously. He strikes out on his own, making money off-screen, as well as performing at a bar, where he earns enough to buy a plane ticket to Buenos Aires. Hall and Wood stay overnight with a Guatemalan family, and travel across the country in a back of a pickup truck in order to get to La Aurora International Airport, where the duo fly to Rio de Janeiro. They reach the Argentina–Brazil border by walking over a bridge connecting the two countries. Fisher goes to La Bombonera, the home stadium of Boca Juniors. Maradona is a fervent supporter of the club, and Fisher hopes to meet him at the ground. He talks to Maradona's chauffeur on whether if it is possible to perform tricks in front of the car to attract Maradona's attention, but he barely gets a look in when a crowd surround the car as it drives off. Fisher is disappointed not to meet him, but since the brief interaction is the closest any of the five has come to meeting the Argentinean, Fisher believes that it will still be possible. He also meets a woman named Camilla, who acts as a translator for the rest of the trip. Hall and Wood arrive in Buenos Aires by coach, and are reunited with Fisher who explains the situation to them. Their freestyling draws a steady crowd of people, they meet Daniel Arccuci, a journalist for La Nación, and are photographed for a newspaper article written about them. They also go on a television show, Fox para todos, which Maradona is known to watch and call in on. The taxi driver that takes them there stops by at Maradona's house, and lets a family member know about their appearance that afternoon. On the show, Wood reads out an impassioned speech in Spanish directed to Maradona. After the broadcast, presenter Germán Paoloski tells Fisher that Maradona was sleeping as he was set to fly out to Peru that evening, and Wood is clearly distraught having heard this news. They go to the Ezeiza International Airport in the small chance that they will meet Maradona there, however, Camilla speaks to his chauffeur, who tells her that the Argentinean would like to meet the three freestylers at his house. They finally meet Maradona, who embraces them, signs their shirts and poses with them for a couple of photographs, before he is driven off. Having earned enough money for two plane tickets to Buenos Aires, Robinson and Lynch arrive at the airport. They watch a news report documenting the others meeting Maradona; the final shot shows Robinson smiling, happy that his friends were able to meet their idol. Reception The film received critical acclaim across the board, achieving 4 and 5 stars from the BBC, Total Film, The Guardian, Film4, and many more. Aftermath * Hall had a short stint as a model, being represented by Storm Management. He also appeared in the 2009 documentary Oh My God, where he spoke about his faith. * Robinson briefly reunited with Wood and Lynch after the film's release. He remained on the freestyle circuit as late as 2009, wherein he went into coaching, and is part of the backroom staff at Pymmes SFA. * Wood went on to appear in the third series of Britain's Got Talent, alongside his friend and fellow freestyler, Paul Klein, but did not make it to the live shows. He and Klein run a YouTube channel, although much of their material is now based on comedy and pranks. In addition, Wood has run a sports academy in his name since 2001. * Lynch went on to appear in the second series of Britain's Got Talent, reaching the semi-finals. He later met fellow freestyler Billy Wingrove and the two formed F2Freestylers. They are known for their successful YouTube channel, where they have collaborated with many professional footballers, and have been involved in charity and exhibition matches, such as Soccer Aid and the Wembley Cup. * Fisher went on to appear in the fifth series of Britain's Got Talent, but did not make it to the live shows. He has performed as an on-screen body double for professional footballers in various adverts, and was in an episode of The Only Way Is Essex as part of a speed dating storyline. * Maradona was appointed manager of Argentina, a year after the film's release. Under Maradona, Argentina qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, despite equalling a record defeat, with a 6–1 loss to Bolivia. At the World Cup, Argentina reached the quarter-finals, where they were beaten 4–0 by Germany. Maradona has since managed clubs in the United Arab Emirates and Mexico, but has never gone past a season with any of them. He was present as a spectator at the following World Cups in 2014 and 2018, hoping that Lionel Messi and Argentina would bring back the World Cup trophy since Maradona and his teammates won it in 1986. His behaviour in the latter tournament caused concern among football pundits, including Gary Lineker (who interviewed him in 2006 for a BBC documentary), where he was shown giving the finger to hecklers below, before slumping in his seat and being treated by paramedics, following Argentina's win over Nigeria. Maradona is also the subject of the 2019 film Diego Maradona, which covered his time at Napoli and is directed by Asif Kapadia. According to Kapadia, he has not seen the finished product.

It is widely considered to be the best comedy club in the country. It was founded in 1982 by then stand-up comedian, and current television writer/producer Bill Grundfest. It is located in the heart of Greenwich Village on 117 Macdougal Street between West 3rd Street and Minetta Lane. Above the club is a restaurant called The Olive Tree Cafe to which it is connected, where many of the comedians hang out after performing. The club is owned by Noam Dworman, who inherited it from his late father, Manny, and run by booker Estee Adoram, who has developed the club's talent for nearly four decades. The businesses share the same menu, kitchen, and staff. The Comedy Cellar, like The Comedy Store, uses a showcase format, as opposed to a headline format like most clubs. A show will consist of between five and seven comics performing sets of roughly 10-15 minutes each. Each week consists of three to six shows a night on Sunday through Thursday and ten shows each Friday and Saturday, between both the original room and the larger Village Underground around the corner.  Notable comedians  Regular performers there include Louis C.K., Dave Chappelle, Dave Attell, Todd Barry, Judah Friedlander, Colin Quinn, Jim Norton, Mitch Fatel, Darrell Hammond, Michael Mittermeier,michael mittermeier - Comedy Cellar Rich Vos, Nick Di Paolo, Artie Lange, Greer Barnes, and Marc Maron. Rising stars in comedy frequently perform at the Comedy Cellar, including Dov Davidoff, Ryan Hamilton, Robert Kelly, Harrison Greenbaum, Sherrod Small, Keith Robinson, Gregg Rogell, Nikki Glaser, Ben Bailey, and Andrew Schulz. Celebrity comedians Aziz Ansari and Jon Stewart started their comedy careers at the Comedy Cellar, and both continue to occasionally perform there. Other celebrity comics who have performed at the club include Sarah Silverman, Robin Williams, Patton Oswalt, Kevin Hart, Chris Rock, and Bill Burr. Musician John Mayer can also be seen dabbling in stand-up here occasionally. Comedian Matteo Lane called the Comedy Cellar one of his favorite places to perform in New York City.  In the media  Much of Jerry Seinfeld's 2002 documentary Comedian was filmed at the club, and it also can be seen in a 2006 Pepsi commercial starring Jimmy Fallon. The beginning sequence of Louis CK's television series Louie shows him walking into the Comedy Cellar. Many scenes in the show are filmed in and around the Comedy Cellar and Olive Tree Cafe. Speaking with ESPN's Bill Simmons about the club on a Grantland podcast in June 2012, CK discussed playing shows at the Cellar to empty rooms in the 1990s, stating that then-owner Manny Dworman \\"kept comedy alive\\" by making comedians perform on empty stages, in an effort to lure in potential customers.http://espn.go.com/espnradio/grantland/player?id=8099523 The club was also featured in Chris Rock's film Top Five, including a performance by his character, Andre Allen. It appeared regularly on HBO's Crashing, and is the home for Comedy Central's \\"This Week At The Comedy Cellar\\" In September 2015, the club launched its public-policy debate series timesofisrael.com/not- much-funny-as-ny-comedy-club-plays-host-to-iran-deal-debate/ with a debate on the Iran nuclear deal. The debate featured professor and lawyer Alan Dershowitz and journalist Fred Kaplan, among others. The New York Post regularly rates the Cellar as the best comedy club in New York. In March 2016, writers Jessica Pilot and Katla McGylnn wrote an oral history of the club for Vanity Fair.  Las Vegas location  In 2018, the Comedy Cellar opened a third location at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas.
