Mildred Alice Doran (10 May 1905 ‚Äì 16 August 1927) was a Canadian pilot who was the only woman to enter the Dole Air Race in 1927, created to be the first to fly from California to Hawaii. During the race, she and several other competitors disappeared.  Early life and education  Doran was born in Ontario to a Canadian father, William Doran, a farmer, and American mother, Minnie Doran. She was raised in Flint, Michigan.1920 United States Federal Census Her father was from Canada and her mother, who was born in Michigan, died in about 1922 when she was 16. She raised her younger sister, Helen, and had brothers William and Floyd. Doran worked her way through high school as a telephone operator, continuing to do so after her graduation in 1924. A local businessman and owner of the Lincoln Petroleum Company, William Malloska, heard about her and paid for her to attend a teacher's course at Michigan State Normal School. She got interested in flying at a local airshow while she was in college. By the time of the race she was about 22 years old and working as a fifth-grade school teacher in Caro, Michigan. While in college, Doran became a member of Alpha Sigma Tau. The air-race Doran convinced Malloska to enter an airplane in the Dole Air Race and to allow her to fly along. The plane, a biplane Buhl Airsedan, was named the Miss Doran in her honour. The pilot was John 'Auggy' Pedlar and the navigator was Vilas Knope. Because of the attitudes of the day, Doran was popular for interviews with the press. It was considered strange for a woman to take part. She was quoted as saying ‚ÄúA woman should fly just as easily as a man.‚Ä¶ Women certainly have the courage and tenacity required for long flights.‚Äù Doran wanted to be the first woman to make such an ocean flight. She had been on long overland flights with the crew before. Despite engine trouble early in the race, and attempts by the crew and crowd to get her to remain behind, Doran stayed with the plane. However, although other planes arrived in Hawaii, nothing was heard from the Miss Doran or her crew again. There was a search by the Army and Navy, and also a competitor's plane which then also went missing after joining the search. James Dole offered $20,000 to find the missing planes. Malloska added $10,000 to find his friend and the others. Hearst also added a reward. There were many tributes after her death. Ontario, Canada named a lake in her honour and Doran Tower was put up beside Lincoln Field in Flint. The tower was destroyed in 1973 because the owner could no longer afford the taxes.

Development The Retreating Rook option occurs after Black and White exchange pawns on the second file. 6\\\\. R-28. Black's rook retreats back to their camp on rank 8. (See: Double Wing Attack.) Following this, White has the option immediately trading their rook pawn on the eighth file in order to get a pawn in hand. Alternately, White may attempt to delay trading the rook pawn and instead develop other pieces first. =White's pawn trade= 6\\\\. ...P-86, 7. Px86 Rx86. After Black's rook has retreated, White now has the option of exchanging their rook pawn in order to get a pawn in hand and clear their eighth file in order to activate their rook. This is played with a similar sequences of moves used for Black's earlier second file pawn exchange. 8\\\\. P*87. A pawn drop by Black. After the pawn exchange and Black's pawn drop on move 15, White also has the option of either floating their rook just above their line of pawns to the rank 4 (¬ß White's Floating Rook) or retreating their rook awhile back to the rook's start position on rank 2 (¬ß White's Retreating Rook). White's Floating Rook is the more common variant. White's Floating Rook 8\\\\. ...R-84. White floats their rook to rank 4. The Floating Rook position defends rank 4 from further encroachment by Black. =Climbing Silver= After White's Floating Rook (or also Retreating Rook), a common variant of Double Wing Attack Retreating Rook is for Black to play Climbing Silver. 9\\\\. S-38. Black moves their right silver up to advance up the second file. This can lead to the most direct way to play Climbing Silver which is called Primitive Climbing Silver. 9\\\\. ...P-34. White moves their third file pawn to open their bishop's diagonal. =Reclining Silver= Other variants of Double Wing Attack Retreating Rook include Reclining Silver. The Reclining Silver has the right silver positioned on central file above the central pawn and to the right of the silver is the pawn that was advancing in order to let the silver move through the line of pawns. The silver is said to recline on the seat of pawns. White's Retreating Rook The Retreating Rook option occurs after Black and White exchange pawns on the eighth file. This option results in a Double Retreating Rook variation of Double Wing Attack. 8\\\\. ...R-82. White's rook retreats back their camp on rank 2. This option is less common than White playing a Floating Rook position. (See above.) It gives White less protection from an attack strategy by Black such as Climbing Silver. However, it does lead to the Stagecoach joseki. (See below.) Note that if White retreats their rook to 8b, then, compared to the Double Wing position before Black's pawn exchange, the following moves have effectively only removed each player's rook pawn and placed them in hand. =Stagecoach= The Stagecoach joseki (ÈßÖÈ¶¨ËªäÂÆöË∑° ekibasha jouseki) is a symmetrical Double Retreating Rook and Double Reclining Silver variant of Double Wing Attack. It was named after the American movie Stagecoach. =Delaying the pawn trade= White need not trade the eighth file pawns immediately after Black's second file trade. For instance, White may choose to wait and instead advance their right edge pawn. 9\\\\. ...P-94. White pushes their ninth file pawn. 10\\\\. P-96. Black usually pushes their same edge pawn in response. If Black does not respond with their own edge pawn push, then White is threatening to push their edge pawn further to the middle rank 5 (10. ...P-95), which will prevent Black from pushing their edge pawn at all and leaving Black's bishop without a square to escape to from White's pawn drop (P*87). This puts pressure on Black in the sense that Black must carefully prepare any further pawn advancement when their bishop has no path of escape since White may attempt to capture that pawn after the eighth file pawn trade. 10\\\\. ...P-34. White activates their bishop by opening its diagonal. Other moves are possible such as making the rook pawn trade now (with 10. ...P-86) or advancing their attacking silver (10. ...S-72). 11\\\\. S-38. Black advances their right silver up the third file allowing for both Climbing Silver or Reclining Silver options. 11\\\\. ...S-72. White also develops their right silver in the same way.

Stress-induced epigenetic changes, particularly to genes that effect the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal (HPA) axis, persist into future generations, negatively impacting the capacity of offspring to adapt to stress. Early life experiences, even when generations removed, can cause permanent epigenetic modifications of DNA resulting in changes in gene expression, endocrine function and metabolism. These heritable epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation of the promoter regions of genes that affect sensitivity to stress.  Mechanism  Epigenetic modification in response to stress results in molecular and genetic alterations that in turn results in mis-regulated or silenced genes. For example, epigenetic modifications to the gene BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) as a result of stress can be passed on to offspring. Chronic variable stress induces offspring hypothalamic gene expression modifications, including elevated methylation levels of the BDNF promoter in the hippocampus. Maternal separation and postnatal maternal abuse also increases DNA methylation at regulatory regions of BDNF genes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, leading to potential stress vulnerability in future generations. Stress can also result in inheritable changes DNA methylation in the promoter regions of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). These changes lead to altered expression of these genes in offspring that in turn leads to decreased stress tolerance. Stress and the HPA axis Gene regulation as it relates to the HPA axis has been implicated in transgenerational stress effects. Environmental prenatal stress exposure, for example, alters glucocorticoid receptor gene expression, gene function, and future stress response in F1 and F2 generations. Maternal care likewise contributes to HPA-related epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic re-programming of gene expression alters stress response in offspring later in life when exposed to decreased maternal care. Inattentive mothering has led to increased levels of gene methyl marks, compared to attentive mothers. Female offspring with low licking-grooming mothers have decreased promoter methylation and increased histone acetylation, leading to increased glucocorticoid receptor expression. Epigenetic modifications as a result of absent maternal care lead to decreased estrogen receptor alpha expression, due to increased methylation at the gene‚Äôs promoter.  Animal studies  = Paternal stress inheritance = As rodent offspring are fostered mono-parentally and have no direct exposure with their fathers, offspring born of stressed male rodents provide a good model for transgenerational stress inheritance. Direct injection of sperm RNAs to wild type oocytes results in reproducible stress-related modifications. Small non-coding RNAs may serve as a potential mechanism for stress-related genetic changes in offspring. Mouse models of traumatic early life stress exposure result in microRNA modifications and subsequent differences in gene expression and metabolic function. This effect was reproducible by sperm RNA injection, leading to similar gene modifications in future generations. The novelty of this research suggests direct mechanisms capable of altering epigenetics by stress-related factors. = Phenotypic effects = Early life experiences and environmental factors may lead to epigenetic modification at specific gene loci, leading to altered neuronal plasticity, function, and subsequent behavior. Chromatin remodeling in rodent offspring and altered gene expression within the limbic brain regions that may contribute to depression, stress, and anxiety-related disorders in future generations. Variations in maternal care, such as maternal licking and grooming, indicates reduced HPA axis reactivity in subsequent generations. Such HPA axis modifications lead to decreased anxiety-like behavior in adulthood and increased glucocorticoid receptor levels leading to negative feedback on HPA reactivity and further behavioral modifications. Rodent models of maternal separation also reveal increased depressive-like behavior in offspring, decreased stress coping abilities, and changes in DNA methylation.  Stress inheritance in humans  Human models illustrating transgenerational stress effects are limited due to relatively novel exploration of the topic of epigenetics as well as lengthy follow-up intervals required for multi- generational studies. Several models, however, have investigated the role of epigenetic inheritance and transgenerational stress effects. Transgenerational stress in humans, as in animal models, induces effects influencing social behavior, reproductive success, cognitive ability, and stress response. Similar to animal models, human studies have investigated the role of epigenetics and transgenerational inheritance molecularly as it relates to the HPA system. Prenatal influences, such as emotional stress, nutrition depravation, toxin exposure, hypoxia, increased maternal HPA activity, and cortisol levels may activate or affect HPA axis activity of offspring, despite placental barrier. Biological vulnerability and HPA axis alterations may be observed after maternal epigenetic programing during pregnancy, leading to similar modifications in future generations. Child abuse exposure, for example, is associated with lower baseline infant cortisol levels as well as modified HPA axis function. Human studies investigating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its effects on offspring have illustrated similar molecular and HPA axis modification and function. PTSD patients who experienced trauma from genocides or terrorist attacks frequently exhibited aggressive or neglectful behavior toward offspring during critical developmental periods, possibly contributing to permanent glucocorticoid deregulation in offspring. PTSD mothers and children illustrate lower basal cortisol levels and glucocorticoid receptors and increased mineralocorticoid receptors when exposed to stress. Therefore, developmental experiences, such as stress exposure, may have critical effects on neuromodulatory mechanisms transgenerationally. Strong relationships between maternal care and subsequent epigenetic modification in offspring, similar to that found in animal models, has been observed in humans. Severe emotional trauma in the mother, for example, often leads to modified methylation patterns of DNA in subsequent offspring generations. PTSD exposed offspring illustrate epigenetic modifications similar to that seen in PTSD mothers, with an increased NR3C2 methylation in exon 1 and increased CpG methylation in the NR3C2 coding sequence, leading to alterations in mineralocorticoid receptor gene expression. Additionally, investigation of post mortem hippocampal tissue indicates decreased levels of neuron-specific glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and decreased DNA methylation in promoter regions among suicidal individuals with lifelong stress and/or abuse exposure. Epigenetic mechanisms as a result of early life stress may be responsible for neuronal and synaptic alterations in the brain. Developmental stress exposure has been shown to alter brain structure and behavioral functions in adulthood. Evidence of decreased complexity in the CA1 and CA3 region of the hippocampus in terms of dendritic length and spine density after early-life stress exposure indicates transgenerational stress inheritance. Therefore, environmental and experience- dependent synaptic reorganization and structure modifications may lead to increased stress vulnerability and brain dysfunction in future generations.

The Constitution of Nepal guarantees the fundamental rights of citizens, including the freedom of expression. The right to freedom of expression includes the freedom of opinion and thought no matter what a source is. As the Constitution has been developed to push forward as a democracy state, inconsistencies of the Constitution reform create different meanings of prohibiting censorship. The 2004, 2009, and 2015 Constitution are infamous with the restrictions of the rights which are obscure and open for misinterpretation compared to the Constitution announced in 1990. Media Censorship The Constitution of Nepal guarantees the freedom of expression in media; media should not be subject to direct censorship. In 2012, International Mission acknowledges that the progressive media policy in Nepal to follow the constitution is necessary, as the Ministry of Information and Communications (Nepal) has published a draft Media Policy on its website. The media, however, were still limited only in capital, and it was hard to find the access outside the capital. Moreover, the government approved the Online Media Directives 2015 without any hesitation, while it provides censorship or shut-down online media within their contents, which denies the Constitution. As a result, the government-owned media disseminate information to public and causes the disbelief in mass media. =Press= According to the Article 115 of the 1990 Constitution, any form of censorship was outlawed, and a free press was strongly guaranteed with announcement of parliamentary democracy. Unfortunately, press media was heavily censored in 2001 and 2002 by the king Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, unlike he promised. The king implemented Clause 1 of Article 115 of the 1990 constitution to suspend the guaranteed freedom of thought and expression that banned censorship. As a result, in 2002, hundreds or maybe even thousands of journalists who indicated their political opinions on the media were arrested, beaten, or detained, and some of them were killed to fight for freedom of expression guaranteed in the constitution. In 2006, massive protests occurred to force the king to realize parliamentary democracy, and this resulted in returning some of fundamental press freedom. Until now, the government has not solved instability of censorship of media and creates norms and fragile democratic structures. The Nepal Press Council and the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) have a code of conduct, but it lacks effective systems and mechanisms, and it needs more support from media stakeholders. =Internet= The government controls the Internet in Nepal. The international internet connections were cut off by the government due to the martial law declared by the King in 2005. Self censorship can be forced on internet content by intimidation as happened in the case of a satirical folk song Lutna Sake Lut, which was taken down from youtube by the author amid threats to his person. =Film= The Film Censor Board was established in 1951 to work as a machinery of state control. It mainly controls sex, violence, and politics in film and commands to cut off the scenes harmful to the society and the state. It also discredits the certification of prohibited movies if the whole cinema is assumed to be inappropriate for the state and society. For those of sexual scenes in movies are usually removed in chunks, and this censorship often causes low cinematic values with clumsiness and lacks completeness of movies. Political Censorship Any forms of publications that contain political thoughts or opinions are censored by the government. Police directly suppress Nepalese journalists and make them self-censored when journalists criticize politicians or politics on the newspapers. For example, because a journalist wrote an article about Nepalese politician on the newspapers, police gathered all the newspapers and burned all of them in front of journalists. Moreover, the government was going to arrest journalists who made the publications of Political cartoon that depicted the constitutional monarchy as a dead animal to indicate the Press Act as completely inconsistent and violating the freedom of expression of media guaranteed in the constitution. Religious Censorship Nepal had an official religion as Hinduism until the government declared democracy of state in 2006. After that, the constitution has prohibited any acts leading to conversions from one religion to another. Nevertheless, the government controls the religious expression or defamation, especially when it publicly dissents Hinduism or does not comply rules of it. For instance, in 2010, the song of Komal Oli was banned from Nepal Television, because it was against Hindu sentiments. Also, in 2012, paintings of Hindu gods and goddesses Manish Harijan depicted in super hero costumes and innocuously displayed in the Siddhartha Art Gallery were considered as offensive to Hinduism, and the police shut down the gallery.

JBC aims to regulate and monitor the media industry; more importantly, it runs with full power of the regulation making and the control of the programming‚Äôs standard and technical quality. However, broadcasting regulation contains some very vague clauses, like Regulation 30(d) and Regulation 30(l)... which causes more difficult for JBC of dealing with the related issues. Censorship in Jamaica has been reported extensively on the issues of dancehall culture, film, and street art. Broadcasting in Jamaica has been characterized by increased imported foreign media, mostly from United Kingdom or United States.  The Jamaican broadcast commission  The Jamaica broadcasting commission implements two broadcasting laws: the Broadcasting and Radio Re-diffusion Amendment Act and the Television and Sound Broadcasting Regulations. The commission has informally adopted the principles of the Freedom of the Press clause contained in the United States' first amendment. As mentioned earlier, because the commission itself lacks clear legal guidelines, it is hard to analyze the related censored content.  Dancehall Culture censorship  In Jamaica, Dancehall culture acts as communication tool between activists and the government. Lyrics normally involve violence, sexuality, and questions of race. In 2008, ‚Äúdaggering‚Äù music and dance were introduced to Jamaica mainstream. Different from other Jamaican dancehall culture, ‚Äúdaggering‚Äù involves explicit lyrics that discuss sex and homosexuality. JBC placed a ban in Feb, 6th 2009 on ‚Äúdaggering‚Äù music. According to Television and Sound Broadcasting Regulations, the ‚Äúdaggering song‚Äù violates provisions of ‚ÄúRegulation 30(d) and Regulation 30(l). 30\\\\. No licensee shall permit to be transmitted d) any indecent or profane matter, so, however, that any broadcast to which regulation 26 relates shall be deemed not to be indecent; Reg. 30(d) (l) any portrayal of violence which offends against good taste, decency or public morality. Reg. 30(l)  Film censorship  The movie Amistad, directed by Steven Spielberg, had an opening scene in Jamaica that discussed slavery. Due to the Jamaican unique history of colonialism, more than 90 percent of the Caribbean islanders are slaves who originate from West Africa. Considering this slave trade history, the Jamaican Cinematographic Authority thought the scene of a slave ship revolt was inappropriate for Jamaican audiences. Rex Nettleford who is vice chancellor at the University of the West Indies referred to such censorship as \\"a real disappointment.\\" He thought the government should not use censorship as a tool to control public and conceal historical truths, referring to the instance as a \\"conspiracy of silence\\".  Street art censorship  From the Gleaner News: In a recent decade, Jamaica Popular Mural Movement has gone global, the street art mostly paints political figures, community heroes, and religious images. This movement occurs when people cannot meet the basic demand of the society, like employment, health care, and education. An interview of police commissioner on Jamaica's CVM TV discusses how Jamaican police often carry paintbrushes or spray paint to censor what they perceive as dangerous to society. But the removal of the murals can also be seen as a \\"violent censorship\\", against the freedom of expression based on the Jamaican Constitution.

The street is named after the 16th-century Lutheran theologian Niels Hemmingsen. History Gedde's district map from 1757 The street has existed since the Middle Ages but was formerly known under different names. The street section from Amagertorv to Valkendorfsgade was called Lille Helliggeiststr√¶de (Little Holy Ghost Street) after the adjacent church. It was a very narrow alley. The inclusion of \\"Little\\" in the name distinguished it from Store Helliggeiststr√¶de (\\"Large Holy Ghost Street\\") as Valkendorfsgade was then called. Gedde's district map from 1757 The section of present-day Niels Hemmingsens Gade which runs from Gr√•br√∏dretorv to Skindergade was called Trompetergangen or Trompetergade after Ambrosius L√∏ffelman, a trumpeter, who owned a property at the site. The short section from Valkendorfsgade to Gr√•br√∏dretorv(L√∏vgade was called Tugthusporten (Jailhouse Gate) after a Children's jail established at the site by Christian IV but soon moved to Christianshavn (see Women's Prison, Christianshavn. It was a narrow, vaulted passageway which ran through a building. The building had six window bays along the square and two window bays across the street. Lille Helliggejststr√¶de seen on a print with the wall that was demolished in 1779 Tugthusporten was merged into Lille Helliggeiststr√¶de in 1843 after complains from the residents who found the name unappealing. Trompetergade was renamed Store Helliggeiststr√¶de. In 1881, the entire street was renamed Niels Hemmingsens Str√¶de to commemorate the theologian Niels Hemmingsen. The churchyard was originally surrounded by a low wall. It was demolished and replaced by an iron fence in 1797.

It is used in geochemistry as a biomarker, interpreted as an indication of dinoflagellate presence due to its derivative dinosterol high occurrence in extant dinoflagellate species and its rarity in other taxa, although it has been shown to be produced by a single species of marine diatom as well.  History of use as a biomarker  A 1984 study was conducted which established the dinoflagellate origin for dinosterane based on distributions of modern dinoflagellates and dinosterane abundance in sediment. In 1993, dinosteranes were discovered in a section of the Bristol Trough that was dated to the Rhaetian Age. Due to the co-deposition of these dinosteranes with dinoflagellate cysts and comparison of microfossil abundance with hydrocarbon abundance, the dinosterane was associated with marine dinoflagellates. This was the first stratigraphic evidence for Mesozoic dinoflagellates. In 1998, dinosteranes were found in high relative abundance in samples from the L√ºkati Formation, which were collected from the Kopli quarry in Estonia. This evidence was used to place the origin of dinoflagellates as early as the Early Cambrian, much earlier than the Bristol Trough studies had been able to.  Characterisation  Dinosterane's mass spectrum shows a highly increased abundance of the m/z = 98 ion compared to 24-ethyl-4Œ±-methylcholestane, which is likely due to preferential cleavage of the C-22,23 bond.

He was a tall man for his times, standing at 6‚Äô1‚Äù and of heavy build, and was nicknamed Rocky for the crags and deep pock marks of his face. Crimes Whelan was found guilty and sentenced to seven years in the Chester Quarter Sessions in 1827. He was put on the Marquis of Hastings and transported from England and arrived in Sydney on 31 July 1827. He escaped from the custody of the Crown and took to highway robbery for which he was arrested and tried in Sydney, then transported to Norfolk Island, where he was involved in the unsuccessful taking of the brig ‚ÄúGovernor Phillip.‚Äù For these crimes Rocky spent a total of eighteen years on Norfolk Island after which, in 1854 the penal colony closed and all the convicts were relocated to Port Arthur. He was sent to Hobart and was assigned to the public works gang. He only lasted two days before he absconded again, this time into the rugged bush land of Mount Wellington which stands over Hobart. He roamed the countryside with Peter Connolly with whom he was incarcerated with on Norfolk Island, and the two took to highway robbery. Like all bushrangers in Tasmania, they targeted the many isolated homesteads for plunder; but they also roamed the forests ambushing lone travelers, robbing them. An argument one night in Hobart caused the two men to separate, only to come together again on the gallows months later. Capture and death Whelan was captured on 19 May 1855 in Hobart outside a bootmaker shop. He had gone to the shop with a pair of boots he took off Magistrate Dunn. The boots had 'Dunn' branded on them and were left by the front door. A passing constable saw the boots that belonged to the missing Dunn and with the help of a civilian managed to arrest the outlaw. Whelan did try to use his weapon but it failed to fire. The decomposed body of Magistrate Dunn was found three days later on the slopes of Mount Wellington. Confession of \\"Rocky\\" Whelan After his capture, Whelan confessed to the murders of at least five men, including Dunn. When he was apprehended, he was still wearing the murdered man's clothes. Whelan described the location of the murder, and a search party was able to recover Dunn's badly decomposed body. Whelan also confessed to murdering a man near Brown's River, thought to be a Mr Grace, as well as the murder of an elderly man who was thought to be a Mr Axford. The identities of the other two murdered men remained unknown. Whelan was hanged at the Hobart gaol with three other condemned men (including Connolly) on the infamous six-man scaffold. He ranks alongside Alexander Pearce and Thomas Jeffries as one of the most infamous criminals in Australia's colonial history.

It is a 20 carat diamond of pale orange-pink colour, cut into a five-sided shape, and with a \\"feather\\" (a fine visible crack) running from its tip to its girdle. The Hortensia was purchased by King Louis XIV of France in 1643 and was in his custody until 1715. It was stolen in 1792 during the unrest of the French Revolution from the Garde-Meuble de la Couronne in Paris (today the H√¥tel de la Marine), where royal art and furniture was stored and administered. It was recovered from an attic in the Parisian district of Les Halles in a bag together with other crown jewels, among them the Regent Diamond. An apocryphal account states that its location was given up in the confession of a man shortly before his execution. It was stolen again in 1830, this time from the Ministry of the Navy, but recovered shortly thereafter. It acquired its name in the early 1800s from Hortense de Beauharnais, Queen of Holland, stepdaughter of Napoleon Bonaparte and mother of Napoleon III. Notably Hortense never owned the diamond or even wore it, and it remains a matter of speculation why it was named for her. During the French First Empire, the Hortensia was worn by Napoleon on his epaulette braid. Around 1856, the diamond was set into a headband for the wife of Napoleon III, Empress Eug√©nie, by court jeweller Christophe-Fr√©d√©ric Bapst. In 1887, the Third French Republic sold most crown jewels to quell fears of a royalist coup d'√©tat, from which only jewels of historic significance were exempted.

History The funeral industry in America emerged after the Civil war as a means of disposing of the countless bodies that were accumulated during the war. Prior to this, care of the sick and recently deceased was largely done at home by women. However, the Civil War led to the need to transport many bodies long distances from their place of death to the final resting place, and thus to the common practice of embalming bodies. Due to the chemicals required in the embalming process professionals were needed to care for North America's deceased. As time progressed caring for the deceased transitioned from being a practice performed in the home to an extremely profitable industry. During the early development of the funeral industry, undertaking became one of the few trades that allowed women to participate during a time when the business world predominately consisted of ‚Äúlandowning, educated, white men.‚Äù Although women were not prohibited from entering the death service industry they were rarely given the position of undertaker unlike their male counterparts. During the Victorian era, women were only allowed to care for the bodies of women and children due to the time period‚Äôs strict enforcement of propriety. In addition to this fact ‚Äúthe further the funeral industry headed toward becoming a profession, the further women were left behind.‚Äù To further exclude women from the funeral industry, Civil War-era trades journals, for instance, The Casket and Embalmer‚Äôs Monthly, published articles to discourage women from entering the trade. In the late nineteenth century, Lina D. Odou pioneered and advocated for women‚Äôs involvement in embalming. Odou is quoted as saying, \\"Over and over again have I heard mothers ask undertakers if they could not furnish women embalmers for their dead daughters, and many others to whom the dead are sacred have asked the same question, and I have invariably heard such men say there are no women to be had for such a purpose.\\" The lack of female embalmers, due to social stigma, motivated Odou to become an expert in the field by studying in Switzerland; and later in 1899 she opened an institute for women at the undertaking establishment of the Reverend Stephen Merritt. Odou's first class graduated 10 students. She established the Lina D. Odou Embalming Institute in 1901.  Present-day  Small family owned funeral homes are still in practice, although large specialist organizations managing funerals have gained prominence due to societal and technical changes and the institutionalization of death. ‚ÄúThe funeral industry is laden with sexism and specific roles based on sex.‚Äù During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a stigma against females as funeral directors that lasted until 1980; it was extremely difficult for women to find employment in the funeral industry outside of a family practice. Females have recently started to regain prominence in the funeral industry, as more than half (57%) of mortuary science students are women. Funeral homes such as White Lady Funerals have a staff completely composed of women.

Early life  James Mathers was born in Lurgan, County Armagh, son of Scottish born parents and raised in Glasgow. Mathers joined the Free Church of Scotland after being converted at the Moody and Sankey mission in 1874. His younger brother Thomas was also moved by the 1874 mission to evangelise and also moved with his family to Sydney.  Career  = Scotland = Mathers began work for the Caledonian Railway Company (DC), before moving into construction engineering. Following his conversion he pursued evangelistic activity as a lay missionary in several city missions in the region of Glasgow. His mission work included open-air preaching and organising worship music for bands at Dykehead and Motherwell missions. = New South Wales = Mathers emigrated to New South Wales in 1897 with his wife Margaret and five children to work as a missionary amongst Sydney's inner-city poor. Based in The Rocks he worked for the Sydney City Mission until his death. Sydney City Mission pioneered outreach to residents of slum areas of the inner-city. The mission required its workers to make home visits, spend time with the aged, infirm and lonely as well as to dispense practical help in the form of food, clothing and financial assistance. His mission activity combined charitable work and evangelism. He visited the poor and sick, providing food parcels and Sunday breakfasts from Mission Hall in lower Fort Street. From here ran open-air services as well as Sunday evening evangelistic meetings.  Personal life  In emigrating to New South Wales, James Mathers, followed in the footsteps of his brother and sister who had settled in Sydney. James Mathers and his family settled in the Sydney suburb of Mosman. The Sydney City Mission divided the city into four districts and assigned its missionaries to each district. Mathers was assigned as missionary to the Millers Point District, which included the Historic Rocks.  Mather's Journal  Missionaries were required to keep detailed journals to be submitted for review to the Mission Secretary.

The plant will be the first of its kind in Armenia and will be situated at the Karkar site in the southernmost province of Armenia, Syunik. Initial studies envisage the construction of a 28-30 MW capacity geothermal power plant with an annual electric output of 250 million kilowatt hours (kWh) according to data provided in 2016. The Karkar GTPP will allow for the production of heat to be used in the heating of greenhouses, residential buildings, and industrial sites. Commissioned in 2008-2009, the Karkar GTPP is a unique project in Armenia in that it does not possess an analogue in the region, and positively differs from other energy producing power plants in its renewability of resources, independence from imported energy sources, as well as its minimal environmental impact.  Site selection  A thermal lake near Satani Kamurj, Syunik Province The Karkar site was selected for exploratory drilling on the basis of field investigations for the prospective sites of Jermaghbyur and Karkar, which were recognized as the most promising by both local and international geothermal experts. In 2006, the World Bank (WB) Energy Invest PIU contracted Ameria CJSC, a professional advisory and insurance services company registered in Armenia to draft a detailed feasibility study for the construction of the Karkar GTPP. The study was executed in the framework of a governmental plan aimed at diversifying energy sources in Armenia, and achieving greater independence from foreign imported energy sources. The results of the feasibility study demonstrated the possibility of constructing a flash type geothermal power plant functioning on the basis of 6 production boreholes at 2.5‚Äì3 km depth, and 2 boreholes for return flow at 3 km depth with an installed capacity of 25 MW. The necessary investment was estimated in the amount of 17.6 billion AMD, with specific costs per kilowatt of installed capacity at US$1564. At the time of the study, the annual average electricity production was thought to be 199.4 million kWh. That number has today grown to 250 million kWh. The study demonstrated the strategic importance and effectiveness of using geothermal energy in Armenia for the provision of heat supply and the generation of electric power. The field investigations at the prospective sites, which included field scoutings, magnetotelluric (MT) sounding and 3D MT studies, along with independent interpretations of the results of these studies, were supported under the Geofund 2: Armenia Geothermal Project financed by the GEF and were completed in 2012.  Exploratory Drilling  The Geothermal Exploratory Drilling Project (GEDP) is a new project consisting of two independent stages, which aim to confirm the suitability of the geothermal resource at the Karkar field for electric power generation. If confirmed, future steps will include involvement of the private sector in the development of a geothermal power plant. Geothermal resources differ from other renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydro in that the commercial exploitability of a geothermal field largely depends on its meeting of certain specific parameters of temperature and pressure. These parameters may be considered with sufficient confidence only upon viable assessment of the results of exploratory drillings. The GEDP was implemented with the support of the World Bank. On Monday, 8 June 2016 the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a US$8.55 million grant for the realization of the first stage of the project, with Arthur Kochnakyan appointed as the World Bank Task Team Leader for the project. The objective of the Government of Armenia is to construct a geothermal power plant at the Karkar site upon confirmation of the availability of exploitable geothermal resources. With a total potential for geothermal power currently estimated at approximately 150MW, indigenous Armenian geothermal resources have the potential to become an affordable source of base load electricity, in turn contributing to the country's energy security.  Initial stage  Initial exploration consists of drilling of three separate wells 1500 m deep, which will require the use of the US$9 million provided by the Climate Investment Funds and the 2 million AMD supplied by the Government of Armenia. The much- needed involvement of commercial investors for the funding of the resource validation phase of the project has been greatly deterred by a combination of high capital requirements, with drilling costs typically ranging between US$2 and US$5 million per well, highly uncertain results, and the time required for its completion. The R2E2 Fund, a non-profit organization established by the Government of Armenia in 2005 with the specific objective of promoting development of renewable energies and energy efficiency markets in Armenia, will be responsible for the implementation of the project. The Fund has the required capacity and necessary experience in implementing Bank financed projects. July 2016 saw the construction of the first slim well for exploratory purposes. An access road to the Karkar site was previously constructed to allow for the transportation and installation of rig pads required for drilling of the slim well(s), as well as other infrastructures. Should primary drilling yield positive results, a full feasibility study of the area will be completed to provide necessary information regarding the type of geothermal technology to be installed at the site. The feasibility study will also allow for the determination of future economic and financial performance estimates, as well as for helping find solutions to issues ranging from compliance with environmental and social safeguards to legal and regulatory concerns. The contribution of the Government of Armenia to the project is expressed in the form of land provision, support in obtaining all the necessary permits, co-financing of taxes, supporting the construction of transmission lines and the infrastructure demanded at the site, as well as the provision of tax exemptions. During a policy seminar held on 23 September 2016 regarding \\"The Challenges of Energy Security in Armenia\\", Deputy Minister of Energy Infrastructures and Natural Resources of Armenia, Areg Galstyan, announced that the first results of exploratory drilling of geothermal sources were due in 2016. In a latter interview given on 27 October 2016, the same deputy minister informed journalists of the completion of the appraisal of geothermal resources in the Karkar site with optimistic first results for the survey, particularly with regards to compliance of specific temperature and pressure requirements. A final assessment of the area's geothermal power capacity is to be drafted on the basis of the results obtained upon completion of the exploratory drilling stage.  Second stage  The second stage of GEDP envisages the construction phase of the geothermal power station. Initial construction costs of the geothermal power plant are projected to be US$90 million to 110 million, which are to be subsidized by public and private capital (i.e commercial debt and equity) in accordance with a specific financing plan of the Government of Armenia. An international tender is to be announced based on the final results of the exploratory drillings to attract investors for the development of the plant, where priority will be given to the lowest bidder. In the event of its construction, the Karkar Geothermal Power Plant is set to occupy an approximate area of 1.5 hectares, which will include piping and parking areas, warehouses and maintenance facilities, a fluid storage house, workers' quarters, and associated facilities pursuant to the building footprint of the future plant. A total of 4 to 10 production and injection wells with casing diameters of 18 5/8 inches at the surface narrowing to 7 inches at 1250 meters are to be drilled and installed to harness the heat of the rocks situated at similar depths. The heat trapped by these rocks reach temperatures of 99 ¬∞C at depths of 920 meters, escalating towards 250-300 ¬∞C at 2500‚Äì3000 meters as demonstrated by the Jermaghbyur borehole data.

Some sources declare it to be the biggest multifunctional Jewish community center in Europe or in the world. The heart of the complex is the historic Golden Rose central synagogue, built in the 19th century. The dedication ceremony of the Menorah center took place on October 16, 2012 with guests that included the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel Shlomo Amar, Israel Minister of Information and Diaspora Yuli-Yoel Edelstein, Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch, representatives of Jewish institutions (including Hillel, the Jewish Agency, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee etc.), Ukrainian state and local authorities, and diplomatic corps.  Idea  The idea to create Menorah center, as one of the biggest such centers in the world, belongs to the President of the Dnipropetrovsk Jewish community Gennadiy Bogolyubov Europe and the President of the United Jewish Community of Ukraine (also the founder of European Jewish Union) Ihor Kolomoyskyi. They both provided full financial support for the project implementation. The supposed concept of the Menorah center construction is to combine three functional elements (spirituality, culture and business) in one complex building.  General description  The center is built in the shape of a seven-branched synagogue candelabrum (menorah). It consists of seven made of precious marble towers, highest one of which is 20 stories (77 m.) tall. The construction has total floor area of about 50,000 sq.m. There are synagogue, museums, office premises, shopping spaces, publishing house, art galleries, kosher restaurants and cafes, conference halls, banquet halls, a luxury hotel, youth hostel, classrooms, tourist information center, visa center of Israel. General project design was made by architect Alexander Sorin. Signs and labels in Menorah are written in four languages - English, Ukrainian, Russian and Hebrew. The official address of the center is Sholom- Aleikhema St., 4/26, Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, 49000, Ukraine. One of the center's declared priorities is to use business profits for funding charitable projects. The presumed purpose is to serve Jewish community of about 30,000 in Dnipro and its other population disregarding background.

It is an erect shrub with its branches and leaves densely covered with a layer of brownish hairs. The leaves are egg-shaped and the tube-shaped flowers are pink with purple spots inside. Description Quoya oldfieldii is an erect shrub, growing to a height of and which has its branches densely covered reddish to dark brown hairs, fading to pale brown on older branches. The leaves are egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide, densely covered with woolly hairs, greyish green on the top and yellowish- green on the lower side. The flowers are arranged in the upper leaf axils, usually in a short, broad leafy group with 3 to 7 flowers on a densely hairy stalk long. The flowers are surrounded by bracts and bracteoles which are hairy on the outer surface and glabrous on the inside. The five sepals are long and joined for about half their length into a tube. The sepal tube and lobes are densely hairy on the outside and mostly glabrous inside. The five petals are joined to form a tube long and which is pale pink with purple dots inside and has five lobes on its end. The lowest lobe is very broad, more or less circular and twice as large as the others. The outside of the petal tube is hairy, although not so hairy as the sepals, and glabrous inside apart from a ring of hairs around the ovary. The four stamens are about the same length as the tube, one pair shorter than the other. Flowering occurs mainly from May to October or November and is followed by fruit which is oval in shape, long and densely hairy with the sepals remaining attached. Flowering occurs mainly from June to November or December and is followed by fruit which is hairy, oval or almost spherical and has the sepals attached. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Chloanthes oldfieldii. The description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected by Augustus Oldfield near the Murchison River. In 2011, Barry Conn and Murray Henwood changed the name to Quoya oldfieldii and published the change in Australian Systematic Botany.

Synopsis Jennifer Brea is a Harvard PhD student about to marry the love of her life, when she is struck down by a fever that leaves her bedridden. Months before her wedding, she becomes progressively more ill, eventually losing the ability even to sit in a wheelchair. When doctors tell her it's \\"all in her head\\", she goes online and finds a hidden world of millions confined to their homes and bedrooms by myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also commonly called chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Unrest tells the story of Jennifer and her husband Omar Wasow, as newlyweds grappling with how to live in the face of a lifelong illness. In search of answers and initially bedbound, Jennifer sets off on a virtual voyage around the world, meeting four extraordinary ME patients in the US, UK, and Denmark. Their bedrooms connected by Skype and Facebook, these patients teach Jen how to make a life of meaning when everything changes. Unrest is a first-person story of resilience in the face of life-altering loss, exploring how we treat people with illnesses we do not yet understand ‚Äî how confronting the fragility of life teaches us its value and, ultimately, how we all have the need to find community and connection. Production The production of Unrest began when Brea picked up the camera to film her symptoms because she was being dismissed by doctors in the spring of 2012. Brea used a Skype teleprompter to conduct interviews, and eventually found a way to stream an on-set camera to her computer. Gradually, she built a global team. The whole process took four years. She was bedridden throughout much of the production of the film, conducting interviews on Skype and directing remotely with producers and crews around the world. The film is a combination of professionally shot v√©rit√©, self-filmed iPhone videos, and interviews conducted via Skype. Release The film premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival on January 20. It was screened during the 2017 SXSW Film Festival in March. In fall of 2017, the film opened theatrically in the United States and United Kingdom. The film aired in the United States as part of the Independent Lens series on the Public Broadcasting Service in January 2018. It became available to view on Netflix on January 15, 2018. Reception The film was well-received. The Los Angeles Times called the film, \\"sensitive and arresting rally cry for increased awareness about this disease, and an existential exploration of the meaning of life while battling a crippling chronic illness...remarkably intimate, deeply edifying and a stirring call to action.\\" Unrest was shortlisted for the Academy Award for best documentary feature, but was not one of the final five nominations.

Career  After studying with the Jesuits, he went on to study higher education at the University of Maine, where he discovered late Antiquity with Jacques Biarne. After he was a professor of history in 1976 at the secondary level, he entered higher education in 1989 as an attach√© temporaire d'enseignement et de recherche at the University of Maine. In 1991, in Sorbonne, he defended his Ph.D. thesis under the direction of Charles Pietri, the then director of the √âcole fran√ßaise de Rome: Maladies, malades et th√©rapeutes en Gaule du IIIe au VIe. He taught Ancient History at the University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambresis (Valenciennes, Cambrai) from 1993 to 1996, then between 1996 and 2012 at the University of Western Brittany, Brest and Quimper. Since 2012, he has been a Professor of Roman History at the University of Limoges.  University publications  At the request of Fran√ßois Hartog and John Scheid, he wrote his first book, Le monde romain tardif. in 1992. With this book and the rest, he took up the \\"battle\\" initiated by Henri-Ir√©n√©e Marrou against the received ideas about the so- called \\"decadence\\" of the Roman Empire. He then combined textbooks for students and articles on illness and healing in the Roman world as well as various mental and cultural aspects of the late Roman society. His field of investigation is that of mentalities, behavior, culture and religiosity in a Roman society in the process of Christianization. In the course of his research, he conceived the neologism \\"nosomonde\\" to designate the perception of the world by Christians - in this case [StoicismStoicians] - of late antiquity as intrinsically ill. In 1995, he published Rome dans l'Antiquit√© tardive which presented itself as a continuation of the famous book by J√©r√¥me Carcopino. He also devoted himself to the study of certain Emperors of the 4th century such as Constantine the Great (in the series \\"Que sais-je ?\\" or Theodosius I (379-395). With Beno√Æt Jeanjean, Bertrand Lan√ßon is at the origin of the French translation of the \\"Chronique\\" of Jerome, first part of Chroniques latines de l'Antiquit√© tardive et du haut Moyen √Çge. whose translation and commentary were provided by the study group set up in Brest in 1998 with Herv√© Oudart, the Gestiat (Groupe d'√©tudes sur les sources textuelles et iconographiques de l'Antiquit√© tardive), followed in 2013/2014y by volume 2 of these chronicles, those of Marcellinus d'Illyricum (379-534). From 31 May 2007 to 2 June 2007, he gathered in Brest an international symposium on Le sens du poil : histoire et anthropologie de la chevelure et de la pilosit√©, which attracted the interest of researchers from several disciplines. The proceedings of this colloquium, gathered by Marie-H√©l√®ne Delavaud-Roux, were published by L'Harmattan in 2011. In collaboration with Tiphaine Moreau, he published Les premiers chr√©tiens (Collection des Id√©es Re√ßues du Cavalier Bleu), as well as a new biography of Constantine the Great (2012) : Constantin, Auguste chr√©tien (Armand Colin). With Adeline Gargam, a specialist in French literature of the 18th century, he published a book on L'histoire de la misogynie (Arkh√®, 2013). His most recent work is a biography of Theodosius (Paris, , 2014). Several of his books have been translated into English, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish and Japanese.  Novels  In 2006, Bertrand Lan√ßon also began publishing a series of novels entitled Les Enqu√™tes de Festus, whose main character is a Roman investigator of the generation of Augustine of Hippo. The two first volumes, Le Complot des Parthiques. and Le Prix des chiens,. were followed in 2007 by a third one, Le rire des Luperques.. He describes himself as the author of \\"Roman detective novels\\", taking place in an era of \\"pre-industrial polar (detective novel)\\" where Christianity and the \\"barbaric\\" immigration create a social and cultural boiling peculiar to late antiquity. Several years apart, the investigations make it possible to confront an aging character to the major events of his time, as well as to the displacements in the different countries of the vast Empire.  Other  In addition to his other activities, while studying the lute with Xavier Cauh√©p√©, Bertrand Lan√ßon gave the first French translation of the \\"Treatise of the lute\\" by Vincenzo Capirola (Venice, 1506) in Tablatures (revue de la Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de luth). He also founded the association \\"Lucs & Guiternes\\", which organized lectures and lute concerts in western France during the 1980s.

At that time, the area, which is now the Grosserroder Feldmark, was still a large forest. Gunther, a younger son of Hardenberg, who had no desire to enter the spiritual offices like other younger sons of noblemen, went with a number of his father's attendants; they cleared the forest as far as was necessary, and called the freed surface Rode or, as was customary, with a Latin name, Novalis.\\" In 1389, the Hardenbergs sold the property.

He was also a Visiting Associate Professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) studying ‚ÄúThe role of the hormone Relaxin on human reproduction‚Äù which is the title of his MD thesis (University of Glasgow, awarded 1985). In 1977, MacLennan was invited to move to Adelaide, Australia by Professor Lloyd Cox, who was Australia's first reproductive endocrinologist and the foundation professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Adelaide. He moved to Australia to take up a position as a Senior Lecturer at the University of Adelaide, initially for a term of three years, and he remained there as a clinical academic for over 40 years. From 1986 to 1999, he headed the University of Adelaide Obstetric Clinic and Menopause Clinic. He became the Professor and Head of the Discipline of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 2006, a position which he held until his retirement in 2012. Since 1977, he has also been a Senior Visiting Specialist at the Women and Children's Hospital in Adelaide, and at the Queen Victoria Hospital until it closed in 1989. His research projects, funded by grants from the NHMRC, the Cerebral Palsy Foundation, and The Tenix Foundation (2010‚Äì2017), investigated foetal growth restriction, prematurity, parturition, and cerebral palsyespecially disproving the previously widespread belief that it is caused by oxygen deprivation due to delivery problems. In 2013, the Cerebral Palsy Alliance's Research Foundation provided his team with a grant of AU$800,000 to help establish an Australian Cerebral Palsy Biobank. He leads the Australian Collaborative Cerebral Palsy Research Group, investigating the roles that genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers have in cerebral palsy. After retiring from his full-time academic position, he remains on the emeritus staff of the Robinson Institute, where his research team challenged the myth that cerebral palsy is usually due to lack of oxygen at birth. Their research identified that genetic causes, rather than oxygen deprivation or other delivery issues, were the primary cause of cerebral palsy. In May 2018 they announced the results of a large-scale genetic study which identified disruptions in RNA signalling and inflammatory pathways that are common to children with cerebral palsy and autism. He is Head of the Cerebral Palsy Research Group in the university's Paediatrics and Reproductive Health unit. His gynaecological specialty was menopausal medicine. Researching postmenopausal hormone therapy, he ran the second-largest randomised trial globally. His service to professional organizations include chairing the International Expert Task Forces and Consensus Statements on Cerebral Palsy in 1995, 1999 and 2003; founding member and past president of the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand; chief Australian Investigator of the Women's International Study on Long Duration Oestrogen after Menopause (\\"WISDOM\\"); founding member and past president of the Australasian Menopause Society. He has served as an examiner for Melbourne University, Sydney University, Australian Medical Council, Australian College of Midwives, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. He has published over 350 papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals and five books. He served as editor-in-chief of Maturitas (journal of the European Menopause and Andropause Society) for ten years, and founding editor-in-chief of Climacteric (journal of the International Menopause Society). He and his late wife Dr Alice MacLennan co-wrote the book \\"Menopause: Presenting a Positive Outlook\\", which is in its 20th edition. They also made more than 30 videos on related topics in English, Indonesian, Japanese and Filipino.  Community engagement  In addition to his formal academic roles, MacLennan has championed evidence-based medicine and educating the general public. He has challenged alternative health practices to show evidence that they are safe and effective. His initial focus was on the damage caused by chiropractic treatment to new-born babies, and the abuse of non- prescription hormone replacement substitutes. He estimated that in Australia in 2000, AU$2.3 billion was spent on visits to complementary practitioners or use of complementary medicines.. Cited in He expressed particular concern about the lack of understanding in the general public: his longitudinal study in 2004 observed that \\"the public is often unaware that CAMs are not tested by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for efficacy or safety\\" ‚Äì on the contrary, his studies found that most Australian consumers believe that alternative preparations have been tested to determine whether they are safe or effective, when they have not. MacLennan is Vice-President of the \\"Friends of Science in Medicine\\" (FSM), which he jointly founded in 2011. The University of Adelaide described FSM as \\"a public health watch dog group of distinguished lay members, scientists and health professionals who are concerned about honesty in medical claims and the need for evidence-based medicine particularly in the growing alternative therapy industry\\". MacLennan has engaged with universities to discourage them from teaching subjects which are not supported by evidence as if they were science. In 2011, he identified 17 universities that offered \\"degrees in quackery\\", and he approached them to show how this undermines those universities' credibility. He used a 2016 graduation address to warn the new graduates about the pressure they would experience to promote therapies that were not based on evidence, and that \\"they should not be seduced into the lucrative but unproven and therefore untenable amalgam of traditional medicine and pseudoscientific alternate practices.\\" In 2018, he strongly criticized courses endorsed by the Australian College of Midwives that promote unproven practices including moxibustion and acupressure to reposition a breech baby, claiming they pose a direct risk to the mothers and babies. His criticisms also extended to some aspects of conventional medical practice, especially the rapid increase in unnecessary testing, advising students \\"don‚Äôt order a test if it is not going to change your management.\\" He serves on the Board of the Channel 7 Children's Research Foundation, which distributes money for children's medical research. Awards and recognition In the 2011 Australia Day honours, MacLennan was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in recognition of his distinguished service to medicine in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology, his research into the causes of cerebral palsy, and his contributions to medical education and to professional development. He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (FRCOG), a Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (MRCOG), a Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society and a Fellow of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (FRANZCOG). The University of Adelaide appointed him as an Emeritus Professor in 2013 to recognise his distinguished service to the university.

The system is composed of two devices: a diagnostics reader which connects to a vehicle's OBDII and a speaker with Bluetooth connectivity that can be clipped to the visor. A monthly subscription is required, but also includes a mobile application for reviewing collected data and receiving alerts as well as roadside assistance. The Hum was first revealed in January 2015 under the name Verizon Vehicle, but was rebranded before its release in August of that year. The initial product launch included features such as maintenance reminders, parking assistance, incident alerts, emergency assistance and stolen vehicle location assistance. In 2016 Verizon added location-based features that were marketed to parents as a way of keeping track of teen driving habits. The newer features allow users to set alerts for when the vehicle exceeds certain speeds or goes outside of set geographical boundaries (called geo-fencing). A new model, Hum X, was launched in March 2017, featuring Wi-Fi hotspot capability, and priced at $15/month.  Advantages of the Verizon Hum vs. Similar Systems  Unlike previous aftermarket in-vehicle telematics solutions, such as OnStar FMV, Verizon Hum could be installed on any vehicle from the 1996 model year or newer that included an OBD II (On- Board Diagnostics Version II) port under its dashboard. The OnStar FMV system was only tested to function in select vehicles 2000 or newer. Also, Verizon Hum can be installed by the consumer, whereas other systems must be professionally installed, which usually entails an installation fee. All the consumer has to do after removing the Verizon Hum from its box is plug the transmitting device into his or her OBD II port on the underside of the vehicle's dashboard (Verizon provides a pictorial make-and-model guide to assist in finding the port), and clip the speaker unit onto their sun visor and power the speaker unit on. The consumer would then activate his or her Verizon Hum device online. The only maintenance required is charging the speaker unit, which can simply be charged via a Micro USB cable. Some telematics systems also do not provide a Bluetooth connection for hands-free and voice-activated calling, as well as the playback of music on a user's device, whereas Verizon Hum offers this compatibility. When the 'Check Engine' light illuminates on their vehicle's dash, the driver can talk to a certified mechanic via Verizon Hum, who can analyze the Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) in real time, and provide expert advice as to how to remedy the problem. Finally, not all telematics systems provide an in-vehicle 4G LTE Wi-Fi connection like Verizon Hum.

The burgstall is in private hands and may not be visited.  Location  The burgstall of the spur castle lies in the southwestern part of the parish of Wolkenstein at a height of 455 metres on a southwest-facing hill spur of the Thosberg. It is about 4.8 kilometres east of the church in Pretzfeld. South of the old castle of Wolkenstein lies the burgstall of Eberhardstein in the valley of the Altenthalbach, to the southeast is the burgstall of Wichsenstein and to the west is that of Dietrichstein above the village of L√ºtzelsdorf.  History  Siebmacher's Armorial Neither the date of construction nor the builder of the castle are known. It was first mentioned in the records in 1470. The castle, which was probably an allod, was occupied by the free knights of the House of Aufse√ü in the early 15th century. Conrad IX of Aufse√ü was held prisoner at the Altenburg during a feud with the Bishop of Bamberg, George I of Schaumberg (1459‚Äì1475), and, in 1470, had to grant the bishop right of access or √ñffnungsrecht to Wolkenstein Castle. In the period that followed several members of the House of Aufse√ü used the title \\"von Wolkenstein\\". Whether the castle was destroyed during the Peasants' War, as a 1624 document suggests, is doubtful. In the otherwise very detailed lists of destroyed castles, it is not mentioned. This could mean, however, that the castle had already been destroyed or had fallen into ruins by that time.

Lovett is a co-founder of Crooked Media, along with fellow former White House staffers during the Obama administration, Jon Favreau and Tommy Vietor. Lovett is a regular host of the Crooked Media podcasts Pod Save America and Lovett or Leave It. As a speechwriter, he worked for President Barack Obama as well as for Hillary Clinton when she was a United States Senator and a 2008 presidential candidate. Lovett also co- created the NBC sitcom 1600 Penn, and was a writer and producer on the third season of HBO's The Newsroom. Early life and education Lovett was born in Woodbury, Long Island to a Reform Jewish family of Ukrainian ancestry that operated a box factory started by his grandfather. He attended Syosset High School. Lovett graduated from Williams College in 2004 with a degree in mathematics. His senior thesis, Rotating Linkages in a Normed Plane led to a related publication on the same topic in American Mathematical Monthly. Lovett was also the 2004 Williams College Class Speaker at his commencement. After graduation, Lovett spent a year working as a paralegal and doing stand-up comedy on the side. Political speechwriter In 2004, Lovett volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign. He was asked to write a statement for the candidate, and his work led to an offer of a writing internship. Then, he briefly worked in Jon Corzine's Senate office. He was hired in 2005 to assist Sarah Hurwitz as a speechwriter for then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and he continued to write speeches for her through her 2008 presidential campaign. When Clinton lost the 2008 Democratic primary contest, Lovett won an anonymous contest to write speeches for President Barack Obama in the White House. Lovett wrote speeches in the Obama administration for three years, working closely with Jon Favreau and David Axelrod. Prominent speeches that he wrote include policy speeches on financial reform and don't ask, don't tell, as well as remarks at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Lovett secretly officiated the first same-sex marriage in the White House, before the Obama administration supported same-sex marriage. Television and podcasting =1600 Penn= Before Barack Obama ran for reelection, Lovett moved to California to become a screenwriter, citing a desire to write independently and focus on creative comedy full-time. Lovett collaborated with Josh Gad and Jason Winer on the television series 1600 Penn, of which Lovett was a co- creator, executive producer, and writer from 2012 until its cancellation in 2013. Lovett then worked as a writer, producer, and advisor on season three of HBO's The Newsroom. From 2012 to 2015, Lovett also contributed opinion pieces to venues like The Atlantic. =Crooked Media= Starting in March 2016, Lovett co-hosted The Ringer's political podcast Keepin' it 1600 with former fellow Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Dan Pfeiffer, and Tommy Vietor. The podcast was intended to cover the 2016 presidential race, and not expected to continue after that. But after the November 2016 election, Lovett, Favreau and Vietor wished to become engaged in politics again without having to leave Los Angeles or return to political campaigning. So they founded a liberal media company, Crooked Media, with the flagship podcast Pod Save America.Rutenberg, Jim, Opposition and a Shave: Former Obama Aides Counter Trump, Media, The New York Times, March 20, 2017 Crooked Media, and Pod Save America in particular, has been compared to previous left-wing efforts like Air America to match America's Conservative talk radio, and Lovett has been characterized as providing comic relief to the programming. The company has since launched a range of podcasts, several of which regularly feature Lovett. In March 2017, Lovett began hosting Lovett or Leave It, a panel show podcast produced by Crooked Media. The podcast is typically recorded in front of a live audience in Los Angeles, but Lovett and Crooked Media have embarked on national and international tours featuring live versions of both Pod Save America and Lovett or Leave It. Lovett was also involved in launching Crooked Media's voter recruitment and education project, Vote Save America. Personal life Lovett is gay. He and Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and author Ronan Farrow have been romantically involved since 2011. In October 2019, Farrow published Catch and Kill, where he publicly announced their engagement, having proposed to Lovett in an earlier draft of the book.

Art historian Millard Meiss was the first to distinguish this artist from his contemporary colleague Jacquemart de Hesdin. Pseudo-Jacquemart seems to have been in the employ of John, Duke of Berry, working in the shadow of other illuminators retained by the duke: Jean Pucelle, the Limbourg brothers, and Jacquemart, at the end of his career, from whom he borrowed his style.

In January 1398, a painter, named Jean de Holland, accused them of stealing pigments and models from his box.

The house that stands today was built in the last part of the 18 century replacing an earlier manor house thought to have been built in the 16 century. That house had been constructed of an early medieval manor house.  Description  The house seen today is a late 18 century Georgian style construction built on a rectangular plan with a service wing running of to rear facing east forming a right angle to the body of the house. The main body of the house is built over three storeys with the front facade facing to the south. The south elevation has five bays with the centre three bays forward of the building line with stone quoins which match the same featured at the corners of the building. This facade is topped with a brick parapet set above a stone cornice with corbel or Modillion underneath supporting the cornice. The parapet is topped with stone copings. The main body of the building is built in a red-brown brick  History  = Etymology = The name Bayfield devolved from the Anglo-Saxon language and has the meaning of the Open Field owned by the B√¶ga's. = The deserted village = The hall stands next to the ruins of the medieval church of Saint Margaret which was the parish church for the lost settlement of the village of Bayfield which once stood around the ruined church. = Domesday Book = The village is listed in the Domesday Book, where it is under the name \\"Baiafelda\\". In the survey the manor is said to be land owned by the King. The main tenant in chief was Walter Giffard, and on the land there was a mill. In the Domesday survey, fractions were used to indicate that the entry, in this case a mill, was on an estate that lay within more than one parish. Before the Norman Conquest of 1066, the manor of Bayfield had been owned by a freeman called Godric, but after 1066 he was ejected from the land. During the reign of Edward I, the manor of Bayfield was owned by Sir John de Vaux, along with Holt and Cley next the Sea. The land and manor then changed ownership many times until in 1661, when the Yelvertons sold the manor to Colonel Robert Jermy. By this time there were just a few houses in the village, with the medieval house and Saint Margaret's church. = Colonel Robert Jermy = Robert Jermy was a lawyer in the reign of Charles I. He was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge followed by the Middle Temple, one of the four Inns of Court. In 1629 he was called to the Bar. To continue his affluent and privilege status he took the side of the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War. He became a Colonel in Cromwell's New Model Army. He also became a Member of Parliament and a commissioner. Following the crushing of Royalist up-rising in Norfolk in December 1650, Jermy was given a position on the special court set up on 20 December to deal with the rebels. Within a short period of time, Jermy and his fellow commissioners had sentenced twenty Royalists to death. This made Jermy unpopular within the Holt area as he was instrumental in the execution of a local man by the name of Thomas Cooper. Cooper was an usher and one time headmaster at Gresham's School. He was hanged on Christmas Day in front of the school and then his body was left on display outside the school. In 1659 Robert Jermy involved himself in a scheme to rig the parliamentary election in Castle Rising. The unpopular Jermy decided it would be wise to remove himself from the limelight. He was granted permission to leave the country and fled to New England, although he was still a Member of Parliament. So unpopular was Jermy that a song was written that told the story of his misdeeds, calling him \\"the Baby of Mars\\", \\"a Journeyman soldier\\", \\"a pitiful soldier\\", \\"a cruel man\\", \\"a rascal\\" and \\"a coward\\" and criticised him for fleeing to New England. Following the restoration of the crown Jermy returned to the manor of Bayfield from America. He hoped to live quietly for the rest of his days as Lord of Bayfield. In 1663 he asked one of his friends who was close to the crown to recommend him for a baronetcy. Unfortunately this was not forthcoming. It seems people in power had longer memories of his questionable deeds, and his every move to achieve honours was blocked. William Jermy lived to a good age and he died in 1677. The land, house and manor of Bayfield remained within the Jermy family until the death of William Jermy on 21 January 1752. He passed away without issue. Following a court battle over William's will and dubious financial deals between William's wife and his brother in law, Bayfield Hall, and were sold to a Mr Buxton for the sum of ¬£7,600 in 1766. = Jodrell residency = Francis Buxton had purchased Bayfield Hall in trust for Elizabeth Jodrell, the wife of Paul Jodrell. The estate eventually fell into the possession of Henry Jodrell who was Paul and Elizabeth Jodrell's third and youngest son. Henry Jodrell was a barrister and he became the member of parliament for Great Yarmouth in 1796, a position he held until 1802. He then became the member for Bramber, Sussex from 1802 to 1812. In the parliamentary vote of 1807 to abolish slavery Jodrell voted against the act. Following the death of Henry in 1814, an attempt was made through the courts by Jonathan Jermy, a weaver from Norwich, to claim the Bayfield estate stating that he was entitled due to being the great great grandson of William Jermy. The claim was rejected by the courts under the statute of Limitations in 1819. The estate at this time was owned by another Edward Jodrell (b. 1785 d. 1852) who was Henry's nephew. Edward Jodrell in turn passed the estate on to his son who was also Edward Jodrell who was a captain in the 16th Regiment of Foot in 1843. Edward's military career included being placed on garrison duties in Ireland in 1843, remaining there until 1846 when he then moved to Gibraltar. In the following year he was posted to Corfu, forming part of the garrison of the United States of the Ionian Islands, a British protectorate.  Sir Alfred Jodrell  In 1882 the Hall and its estate was inherited by Sir Alfred Jodrell. Alfred was the youngest son of Captain Edward Jodrell. He gained the title of 4th Baronet Jodrell. He was married to Lady Jane Grimston, daughter of James Walter Grimston, 2nd Earl of Verulam. Alfred Jodrell is best remembered for his desire to benefit the local community after his good fortune in his inheritance of Bayfield Hall. He is quoted as saying I intend to leave the estate in better condition than when I inherited it. This philosophy he fulfilled in his tenure of the estate. The nearby hamlet of Glanford village with its decaying cottages, he completely rebuilt, giving his estate workers a very comfortable and healthier living standard. He spent a great deal of money on the village, especially on his project to rebuild the decrepit Saint Martin's church which he began in 1899. The church stands on the crest of a knoll within the village and he dedicated the renovations to his mother Adel Monckton Jodrell. The church took seven years to complete employing a team of workers headed by two wood carvers from Great Yarmouth. He had new stained glass windows installed by Kempe and Bryans the renowned glass makers. Other work on the church included a new hammer-beam roof with carved ends displaying shields, rood screen, choir stalls and marble floors with the stone imported from Italy. The greater community also benefited from Jodrell's philanthropy. He carried out restoration work on the parish churches of Salle, Letheringsett, Blakeney and Wiveton. Jodrell was also noted for his generosity to people. He would send basket of fresh fruit and vegetables every week to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital in Norwich. At Christmas time he sent the hospital 40 chickens and 40 turkeys plucked and oven ready. He gave generously to many charities and good causes especially to his locality. His generosity extended to his friends as well. He was known for his hosted dinners where he served the finest food and wine to his guest, although he himself abstained from alcohol. He once hosted King George V who visited from his Norfolk home at Sandringham to attend a pheasant shoot on the estate organised by Jodrell. Jodrell was also a keen collector and had collections of teapots and ceramic birds although he is best known for his collection of seashells. He had a museum built next to St Martine's church to house the collection. The museum can still be visited to this day.

It was published in 1908. It is regarded as Gardiner's best-known work and a classic of the English choral tradition.  History  Gardiner had studied at Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium in Frankfurt, composition with Iwan Knorr and piano with Lazzaro Uzielli, at the same time as Percy Grainger, Roger Quilter, Norman O'Neill and Cyril Scott. He composed the anthem in 1907 when he worked on the staff of Winchester College for one term where Edward Thomas Sweeting (1863‚Äì1930) was Music Master and College Organist. ‚ÄúThe Succession of Organists of the Chapel Royal and the Cathedrals of England and Wales, (etc)‚Äù, G Watkins Shaw, Clarendon Press, , 9780198161752, 1991 Gardiner's biographer Stephen Lloyd notes that the anthem had been on his mind for years although he was no longer religious. The possibility to have it performed probably spurred the completion of the composition. Gardiner set the anthem in D major for four voices, sometimes divided, and organ, writing the same music for both an English text and the Latin version by Pope Urban VIII. Gardiner, a self- critical composer, destroyed many of his works, including symphonies, but not this anthem. The anthem is the only work that reflects his organ studies, providing a substantial organ part. He dedicated it to Sweeting. It was published in 1908 by Novello, while Carus-Verlag published it in 2004.  Text and music  The Latin text is the compline hymn \\"\\" from the Roman Breviary. Gardiner set the three stanzas differently, with long organ prelude and interludes, following the mood of the text. The second stanza is written for unaccompanied voices. An introduction by the organ builds to a powerful entry of the choir, marked \\"full voice, even tone\\". The second stanza, reflecting the night's frightening fantasies, has been described as \\"hushed\\". The third stanza returns to the melody of the first, but in slightly different harmonies. The concluding Amen begins with a powerful entry of the alto, followed by imitation in the other voices, leading to a restful ending in low register and very softly. Evening Hymn, called a \\"noble\\" anthem, is regarded as Gardiner's best-known work and a classic of the English choral tradition, often sung at evensong. William McVicker summarizes: \\"The long, seamless phrases, carefully written dynamic changes and effective use of harmonies, have made this piece a favourite in any parish choir's repertory.\\"  References   External links  Evening Hymn / H.

It is open seven days a week, with free admission.. History The temple in 1933 The Grand Matsu Temple was originally the palace of the Southern Ming prince Zhu Shugui, constructed for him near Chikan Tower by the Tungning king Zheng Jing in 1664.. Zhu, known as Prince Ningjing, helped Koxinga's dynasty colonize and clear farmland in the surrounding Chengtian Prefecture but, after Shi Lang's 1683 victory at Penghu, Zheng Keshuang was obliged to surrender to the Qing Empire. Zhu's five concubines then hanged themselves one by one from the beams of his palace's bedroom and the next day he joined them in suicide. His ladies continue to be honored at Tainan's Five Concubines Temple. Shi Lang initially took up residence at the palace, rebuilding some areas to his liking, but then memorialized the Kangxi Emperor to convert it into a temple to Mazu,. the deified form of the medieval Fujianese shamaness Lin Moniang. This was done the next year in 1684. under Mazu's newly-granted title of \\"Empress of Heaven\\". It was the first temple to be so named, giving it some precedence over her earlier temples, which honored her as a \\"Princess of Heaven\\". The move served a propaganda function, with the Qing claiming to honor Mazu's \\"support\\" for their conquest of Taiwan from Tungning. The temple was renovated in 1765 and again in 1775, when it assumed its current appearance. A fire occasioned another rebuilding in 1818 and it fell into disrepair in the late Qing. Following the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, it was almost auctioned to private interests but this was cancelled at the last minute. It was partially rebuilt after damage from an earthquake in 1946. The temple was declared a protected monument in 1985. Architecture The Main Hall is dedicated to Mazu, flanked by her two guardian demons Qianliyan and Shunfeng'er. It includes a stele erected by Shi Lang in 1685. The Rear Hall is also known as the Sacred Parents Hall, as it honors Mazu's parents, along with her brother, sisters, and the Prince of Ningjing. It is the site of the prince's former bedroom, where his five concubines preceded him in suicide during the Qing conquest of Taiwan. Services The altar of Yue Lao, the old man under the moon, is frequented by singles in search of a husband or wife.

It is magnitude 7.5, diameter 1 arc minute. It is less than 1 degree southeast of Messier 8, the lagoon nebula. Observation Map to find NGC 6544 NGC 6544 is located in the western part of the constellation, on the edge of a rich star field; its location is easily recoverable as it is located just 50' towards the southeast compared to the famous Lagoon Nebula. It can also be noted with a binoculars 10√ó50mm as a small white spot like a misty star; with a telescope 120mm and 100√ó magnification around you may notice a few tiny little star, but overall the clutter is almost unsolvable. Telescopes from 200mm up and high magnification allow resolving of dozens of dim stars. Because of its declination is rather south, this cluster can be mainly observed by observers located in southern hemisphere, although it is still observable fairly even up to medium temperate latitudes. The best time for observation in the evening sky is the one included between June and October. History of observations NGC 6544 was observed for the first time by William Herschel in 1784, who watched through his 18.4 inch reflector; he described it as a fairly bright and large object, circular and resolvable into stars; in New General Catalogue provides a similar description. Characteristics NGC 6544 is a globular cluster of medium density, estimated value of 5 on a scale between 1 and 12; its distance is estimated at 2900 parsecs (9450 light years) from the Sun, which in its position corresponds to a distance of 6100 parsecs from the center of the Milky Way and only 100 parsecs from the galactic plane, to the point of being one of the closest globular clusters to known galactic plane. Its small angular size, equal to just under 4' for the main body storage and corresponding to just 3.2 parsecs, making it also one of the smaller globular clusters known. In 1999 she was discovered within the cluster a pulsar in a binary system of type millisecond, cataloged as PSR J1807-2459; There are few notes variable stars part of this cluster; a 1993 study focused on the region around NGC 6544 has identified some variable stars, of which only one is found to belong in storage: it is a RR Lyrae variable with a period of 0.57 days.

He made his debut in July 2009 and reached the top makuuchi division in September 2016. He wrestles for Kokonoe stable. His highest rank is maegashira 2. Early life and sumo experience As a child, Munkhsaihan's father was the equivalent of ≈çzeki in Mongolian wrestling. He was at his father's side most everywhere he went, and his father would take him to judo and wrestling practice often. In addition his father and Asash≈çry≈´'s father were acquaintances. These circumstances naturally led to an interest in the sumo world. Sumo Journal 2014 September pg 97 He met former yokozuna Chiyonofuji when the elder came to Munkhsaihan's region on a sumo tour and through Chiyonofuji's invitation, he transferred to Meitoku Gijuku High School, a school well-known for its sumo program. He left the school in his second year and joined Chiyonofuji's Kokonoe stable. Career He joined at the same time as Aoiyama and the two attended sumo school at the same time and also graduated together. He weighed only a light 87 kilograms when he first stepped into the ring, and there was concern whether or not he could make it on the dohy≈ç. However, thinking of his father, a popular figure of high rank in Mongolian sumo, made him ashamed at the prospect of quitting early and he resolved to stick it out. From his entry into sumo until he reached the sandanme division, he took the shikona . Upon reaching sandanme in July 2010, as is the custom at his stable, he took the 'Chiyo' part of legendary wrestlers from the stable such as Chiyonofuji and Chiyonoyama, and became Chiyosh≈çma Fujio. After a little more than a year, in September 2011, he received promotion to the 3rd division known as makushita. Though he bounced back and forth between sandanme and makushita for a period after this, from November 2012 he was re-promoted to makushita with good enough results to become a makushita regular. Up until this point he had to serve stablemates Chiyomaru and Chiyo'≈ç who were the same age as him, so this was incentive for him to train hard and work his way up the ranks. For the next three years he would soldier on in the third division, moving slowly upward. In September 2015 he had a commanding 6‚Äì1 record and took the y≈´sh≈ç for the 3rd division. This put him at makushita 3 for the next tournament where he achieved another 6‚Äì1, guaranteeing his promotion to the salaried ranks of j≈´ry≈ç. At the press conference for his promotion, he stated that six and a half years had been a long time, and he had hoped to reach the professional ranks in four years. He also said that he still had further to rise and he would do his best.Kenosh≈ç and Chiyonosh≈çma go to J≈´ry≈ç SANSPO.COM 2015Âπ¥11Êúà25Êó•Ôºà2015 November 25) A party to celebrate his promotion was held at a hotel in Tokyo at which his parents brought traditional Mongolian outfits for Chiyonofuji and his wife to try out. In his first two tournaments in j≈´ry≈ç starting in January 2016, he attained two winning tournaments. In the following May tournament he only managed a 7‚Äì8, but bounced back to a 9‚Äì6 record for the July tournament at j≈´ry≈ç 3, earning him promotion to the top flight makuuchi division. He made his top division debut in the Aki basho of September 2016, the first new makuuchi wrestler from Kokonoe stable since the death of his stablemaster Chiyonofuji on July 31 of that year. Following his entry into makuuchi Chiyosh≈çma had two consecutive winning tournaments and he is working his way towards the possibility of being a regular makuuchi wrestler. His first tournament fighting all the ≈çzeki and yokozuna was in May 2017 from the rank of maegashira 2 where he fell short with a 5‚Äì10 record. He was reprimanded during the November 2017 tournament for causing three matta or false starts in his Day 9 match against Hokutofuji by not putting both fists to the ground, and for thrusting at Hokutofuji after the first matta was called. His string of 498 consecutive matches from sumo entry was broken on the final day of the July 2018 tournament when he pulled out due to an injury. Fighting style Chiyosh≈çma's preferred grip on his opponent's mawashi or belt is hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. He uses both pushing and grappling techniques. His most common winning kimarite are hatakikomi (slap down), yorikiri (force out) and uwatenage (overarm throw). Personal life On 25th of December 2018 Chiyosh≈çma married a fellow Mongolian at the Mongolian embassy, a graduate of Mongolian State University she came to Japan for foreign language studies. They first met in August 2014 and have been in a relationship since January 2016.

In the 1970s, conflict began over the relocation efforts by the government of Botswana (GOB), which ultimately led to some resettlement outside of the reserve in the 1990s. Due to the ongoing struggle between the San people and the GOB over land rights, the \\"First People of the Kalahari,\\" an organization advocating for the rights of the San people was founded. Debates revolve around whether diamond discovery in reserve, could be the motivation for relocation efforts taken by the government of Botswana. In 2002, the government cut off all services to CKGR residents. A legal battle began, and in 2006 the High Court of Botswana ruled that the residents had been forcibly and unconstitutionally removed. The policy of relocation continued, however, and in 2012 the San people appealed to the United Nations to compel the government to recognize their land and resource rights. Background = The San People = Wandering hunters (Basarwa Bushmen), North Kalahari desert, c. 1892, from a photograph by Henry Anderson Bryden The San people (or Basarwa,, formerly known as \\"Bushmen\\"), are one of the oldest cultures on Earth; they have lived in the area around the Kalahari Desert much longer than neighboring tribal groups. Much tribal land in Botswana, including land occupied by the San, was lost during European colonization, and the pattern of loss of land and access to natural resources continued after Botswana's independence. The San have been particularly affected over time by encroachment on the part of majority tribes and non-indigenous farmers onto lands traditionally used by the San. Government policies beginning in the 1970s transferred a significant area of traditionally San land to White settlers and majority agro-pastoralist tribes. Much of the government's policy regarding land tended to favor the dominant Tswana tribe over the minority San and Bakgalagadi peoples. James Anaya, as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people for the United Nations, describes loss of land as a major contributor to many of the problems facing Botswana's indigenous people, citing the San's eviction from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) as an especial example. = The Central Kalahari Game Reserve = Bushmen in the Kalahari In the 1950s, there was an increased concern on minority populations in Africa by the United States, South Africa, and Great Britain. They launched investigations and research campaigns to have a more extensive understanding of the problems faced by minority populations in Africa. In Botswana, \\"there was pressure from some sources for changes in the way the San were treated, with some academics suggesting that the San be given a place of their own.\\" In 1958, the Bechuanaland Protectorate government designated George Silberbauer to perform research and find resolutions to the issues facing the San people. As a result of his investigation, in 1961, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) was established to give the San a place of their own and to protect the surrounding flora and fauna. Although Silberbauer wanted the establishment of a \\"people reserve\\", at the time, no law permitted it. However, the CKGR is \\"unique in that it was created not only as a nature reserve but also to protect the rights of around 5000 people, mostly San, living within its borders, who wanted to maintain their hunter-gatherer lifestyles.\\"  First People of the Kalahari  As an organization to represent and advocate for the San people during its early conflicts, the \\"First People of the Kalahari,\\" also known as \\"Kgeikani Kweni,\\" was founded in October 1993 by John Hardbattle, Roy Sesana, and Aron Johannes. The creation of this advocacy organization was the result of the ongoing struggle for minorities' land and resource rights. The San people felt like they needed a representative to voice out their needs and assist with their fight for equal rights in Botswana. Between 1986 and 1989, the San and other minority groups in the CKGR were politically active and founded the Kuru Development Fund, a multipurpose organization with the goal of community development.The Kuru Development Fund critical in the founding of the \\"First People of the Kalahari,\\" because it provided funding and because it encouraged its founder, John Hardbattle, to represent and advocate for the San. The \\"First People of the Kalahari\\" represented the San people in the First International San Conference in Windhoek and in the Second International San Conference in Gaborone on October 1993. At these conferences, the San spokespersons identified the problems faced by the San, such as \\"poverty, alienation from land and resources, lack of political representation at the national level, labour exploitation, discrimination, lack of attention paid specifically to San but rather a focus on a bureaucratically defined group known as Remote Area Dwellers, and the Botswana government failure to support land rights, cultural rights and development rights of San peoples.\\" Ultimately, these conferences led to the registration of the \\"First People of the Kalahari\\" as a recognized organization with the government of Botswana and the inauguration of their own office in Gaborone in 1994. \\"The First People of Kalahari.\\" would ultimately lead the San people to \\"the largest historical and active resistance\\" against the government's efforts to relocate them. In 2002, the San People, alongside their representatives, took the government of Botswana to court to fight for their right to remain in the CKGR and access the natural resources within it. Ultimately in 2006, the Botswana High court acknowledged the right of the San people to reside in the reserve.  Diamonds and Land Conflict  Today, the economy of Botswana is heavily reliant on diamond exports. With the discovery of diamonds in 1967, they came to account for fifty percent of Botswana's GDP. However, before the discovery of diamonds, Botswana was heavily dependent on agriculture. Botswana was one of the poorest countries in the world, with a GDP per capita of 80 dollars per year. There are claims that the GOB attempts to relocate the San people are motivated by the discovery of diamonds in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in the late 1980s. Survival International explains that \\"The reserve's rich diamond deposits have been widely blamed for the government's expulsion of the Bushmen.\\" Others emphasize that GOB arguments for relocating the San people, like development and animal conservation, are contradicted by the government's actions like cutting off the water supply, which prevents their development. In 2002, the president of Botswana, Festus Mogae, argued that the efforts to relocate people from the CKGR had nothing to do with any future mining plans or mining inside the reserve. However, others explain that \\"diamond mining is now the core of Botswana‚Äôs economy...nearly all of Botswana‚Äôs advancements in infrastructure, healthcare, and education are the result of diamond revenues.‚Äù Additionally, the CKGR is considered to be ‚Äúthe richest diamond-producing area in the world.‚Äù Although the government of Botswana denies the relocation policy to be influenced by the discovery of diamonds in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, they have also publicly mentioned that \\"mining rights in Botswana, according to the Constitution, belong to the State regardless of who owns the land.\\" While some believe that diamond discovery could be the reason why the GOB has placed so much efforts for relocating the San people, some argue that discovery of diamonds are not to blame. The claim is that if diamonds were discovered and a mine would have to be established, the amount of land it would need would be minimal, and would not interfere with the lives of the San people.  Early Conflict  Although the establishment of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) was intended to protect the rights of minorities, between the 1970s and 1980s, an urge to relocate the San people started. The government of Botswana (GOB) claimed that there was a decline of animals due to overhunting by the San people for their subsistence. There was also the argument that the status of \\"game reserve\\" blocked the possibilities of an expansion of services, such as hospitals, schools, and police, available to the populations within the reserve. Although calls for relocation began, no concrete actions were taken. By the late 1980s, debates on what to do with the San people continued, and tensions rose between the San people and the government, bringing international attention over the rights of the San people. In August 1985, Minister of Commerce and Industry, M.P.K. Nwako, was sent by the GOB to the CKGR to provide a report on the situation and present a solution. With his statement, on July 15, 1986, a White paper was issued stating that the new GOB policy noted that those living within the reserve were to be relocated somewhere else. On October 12, 1986, \\"the GOB announced that the settlements of its ‚ÄúRemote Area Dweller‚Äù (RAD) program, which provided services to the San, among others, would from that point forward be established only outside of the CKGR.\\" The GOB claimed that the relocations would be beneficial for the San because services could be better distributed outside of the reserve since it is difficult to do so inside the reserve. Additionally, the government stated that the San people had to be relocated because they posed a threat to wildlife. However, occupants of the reserve attended what are known as \\"Kgotla,\\" local council meetings at the Ghazni township, where they expressed their concerns and, ultimately, were saved from relocating.Bushmen (San)As the GOB continued to find ways to remove the residents of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, the residents and its foreign supporters, like Survival International and anti-apartheid leaders, found ways to evade the government's relocation efforts. In April 1989, the human rights group, Survival International, took action on behalf of the San people and released an \\"Urgent Action Bulletin on the issue of the forced relocation of people out of the reserve.\\"Additionally, Survival International and other human rights organizations wrote letters to the GOB, particularly the President's Office and the Ministry of Local Government, Lands and Housing, over their efforts for the San people's resettlement. In the early 1990s, relocation efforts intensified. The government slowed down the delivery of services to people inside the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, in efforts to push people out on their own. The government would claim that these services would once again be available when they resettled outside the reserve. However, the San were concerned that they would be pushed to resettle in crowded areas where they would continue to struggle over access to services.Some residents did eventually relocate on their own; however, after some time, they returned to the reserve because they claimed that there was not enough land in the new settlement and that there was ongoing competition for the limited resources. In 1992, a meeting and a workshop, where the San, alongside their representatives, expressed their concerns and the problems they faced over relocation, led to world attention on the issue. The workshop \\"Sustainable Rural Development hosted on April 13, 1992, in Gaborone, allowed the San to express the problems they faced in Botswana. Additionally, a meeting was organized between the San and the Office and the Ministry of Local Government, Lands and Housing on May 18, 1992, where the San demanded the creation of political structures where they would be represented and have a vote over decisions that would impact them. In response to San demands, the government of Botswana claimed that the San, with foreign support, wished to secede from Botswana. Central Kalahari Game Reserve relocations The lifestyles of the San and Bakgalagadi residents of the CKGR changed as wells were drilled and a school and health post were established there, which encouraged an agro-pastoralist lifestyle and led to the keeping of some livestock within the reserve. The government determined that the lifestyles of communities within the CKGR were no longer consistent with the aims of the reserve and that providing services within the reserve was too costly to continue. The government therefore decided to relocate all of those living within the CKGR to settlements outside the reserve. While the government maintains that the relocations were voluntary, Anaya describes the consultation process as \\"inadequate\\" and notes \\"serious concerns\\" about whether consent to relocate was freely given. In particular, harassment of residents, dismantling of infrastructure, and bans on hunting appear to have been used to induce residents to leave the reserve. A countrywide ban on hunting, announced in January 2014, \\"effectively ends thousands of years of San culture\\", according to The Guardian. The government's hunting ban does not apply to private game ranches catering to tourists. In 2002, the government ceased all services to residents of the CKGR, and capped the borehole that had provided water to inhabitants of the reserve. Since the mid-1990s, the central government of Botswana has implemented a relocation policy aimed at moving the San out of XamKhomani Heartland, their ancestral land on and near the CKGR into newly created settlements such as New Xade. The government's official reason for adopting the policy states: Anaya writes that while some former residents of the CKGR chose not return to the reserve due to a lack of services, including water, those living in the reserve have stated a desire to be able to hunt and gather, since these activities are an important part of their culture. A sense of a deep personal connection to the land in the reserve was evident among both those San living in the CKGR as well as those San and Bakgalagadi who had been resettled outside the CKGR. These latter groups expressed a desire to return to the reserve despite the challenges of living there. Jumanda Gakelebone, a spokesman for the San in Botswana, told The Guardian: The human-rights group Survival International quotes Gakelebone as saying: The government has denied that any of the relocation was forced. A 2006 ruling by the High Court of Botswana confirmed, however, that residents had been forcibly and unconstitutionally removed. The court held in Roy Sesana and Others v. The Attorney General that the San plaintiffs were, \\"forcibly or wrongly and without their consent\\", deprived of possession of land that they lawfully occupied. The judgement noted conflicting and confusing statements and actions by the government. According to Anaya, the case \\"highlights the failure of the government to adequately consult with indigenous peoples in significant decisions affecting them and to respect their rights to traditional lands and resources\\". Opponents of the relocation policy claim that the government's intent is to clear the area‚Äîan area the size of Denmark‚Äîfor the lucrative tourist trade and diamond mining. Government representatives have stated that allowing even small communities to live within the game reserve is incompatible with the reserve's aims of wildlife conservation. Anaya, however, writes that the government's position on this issue appears to conflict with its decision to permit diamond mining by Gem Diamonds within the reserve. The mining operation is planned to last several decades and could involve an influx of 500 to 1200 workers into the reserve, according to the mining company. The government stated that although exploration had taken place, it concluded that diamond mining would not be viable and that the relocation policy had nothing to do with mining. However, in 2014 the Ghaghoo mine, operated by Gem Diamonds, began extracting ore in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. As stated by the news division of the Rapaport Diamond Report, a diamond-industry pricing guide, \\"Ghaghoo's launch was not without controversy [...] given its location on the ancestral land of the Bushmen\\". Survival International director Stephen Corry said that with the mine's opening: In 2005, John Simpson of BBC News described the people of New Xade as suffering from drunkenness and sexually transmitted diseases, saying, \\"When the Botswana government takes foreign guests to New Xade on fact-finding trips, it shows them the showcase schools and clinics which have been built for the Bushmen. The VIP buses take a detour in order to miss the shebeens [bars].\\" Simpson said he suspected the relocations were partly motivated by plans for diamond mining. In a 2005 embassy communication released in 2011, United States Ambassador to Botswana Joseph Huggins condemned the forced evictions, saying: \\"While it is probably the case that two-three years on since the move, the greatest trauma is past, it is also clear that people have been dumped in economically absolutely unviable situations without forethought, and without follow-up support. The lack of imagination displayed on the part of the GOB [Government of Botswana] is breathtaking. The GOB views New Xade as similar to many sites of rural poverty, deserving no special treatment. But the special tragedy of New Xade's dependent population is that it could have been avoided.\\" 2006 High Court decision On 13 December 2006, the San won a historic ruling in their long-running court case against the government. According to the San's lawyer Gordon Bennett, \\"Nobody thought the Bushmen had any rights\\" before their court victory. \\"Nobody even cared.\\" The case was decided shortly before the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted. Legal scholars Donald K. Anton and Dinah L. Shelton write that the case \\"exemplfies what some consider a potential conflict between environmental protection and human rights\\". By a 2‚Äì1 majority, the court ruled the refusal to allow the Basarwa into the CKGR without a permit, and the refusal to issue special game licences to allow the San to hunt, was \\"unlawful and unconstitutional\\". It also found that the San were \\"forcibly and wrongly deprived of their possessions\\" by the government. Two of the three justices referred to the relative powerlessness of the San, partly as a result of discrimination, that had resulted in low literacy and little to no political or economic clout relative to majority tribes. The justices concluded that even voluntary decisions to relocate on the part of the San were not based on informed consent, in light of evidence that the government had not adequately informed the San about compensation or their right to return to the reserve after relocation. The court did not compel the government to provide services, such as water, to any San who returned to the reserve. As of 2006, more than 1,000 San intended to return to the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, one of Africa's largest protected nature reserves. The government interpreted the ruling narrowly, however, and only limited numbers of San have been allowed to return to this land. The government further required the children and other relatives of the original applicants in the case to obtain permits in order to return to their ancestral land. In April 2008, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) criticised Botswana's government for not allowing certain San to return, as well as for denying Bushmen the right to hunt in the reserve, despite their having used the land for hunting for thousands of years. High Court appeal A number of San brought a new legal action to reopen the water borehole in the reserve, which was capped in 2002. In 2011 the Court of Appeals awarded the Basarwa (San) the right to reopen or drill new boreholes to gain access to water for domestic use. Prior to the ruling, the government banned the Basarwa from accessing wells, which prevented them from returning home to the CKGR. Following the ruling, the government granted the appropriate permits for workers and machinery to enter the CKGR to drill boreholes. Barrister Gordon Bennett represented the San in court as the judges declared the Botswana government guilty of ‚Äòdegrading treatment‚Äô and described the case as ‚Äòa harrowing story of human suffering and despair‚Äô. Furthermore, the Government was ordered to pay the costs of the San's appeal.Victory for Kalahari Bushmen as court grants right to water. Survival International. Retrieved 2012-01-29. As of 2013, however, the government was still blocking San people's access to water in the CKGR. According to a case study published in June 2012 by Minority Rights Group International, Gope mine owner Gem Diamonds was to work with CKGR residents in order that they would benefit from the mine: the company was to drill four new boreholes, hire residents, and establish a community trust, but only one waterhole had been drilled by year's end. 2012-2013 conflict In May 2012 the Basarwa appealed to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, asking the United Nations to force the government to recognize their land and resource rights. The forum approved a set of nine draft recommendations addressing the impact of land seizures and government disenfranchisement of indigenous people. Government relocations continued during the year in the western settlement of Ranyane. In May 2013, the High Court ruled the government must stop the relocation of families from the Ranyane settlement. NGOs reported that the government relocated several families from Ranyane after the High Court ruling and alleged that government officials installed themselves in Ranyane in order to conduct a campaign to induce residents to move from their village, in part by blocking access to the settlement‚Äôs only water supply. Survival International reported that some San in Ranyane were slated to be evicted from their ancestral land in order to create a wildlife corridor,Bushmen face imminent eviction for ‚Äòwildlife corridor‚Äô. Survival International. Retrieved 27 May 2013. known as the Western Kgalagadi Conservation Corridor. Botswana government representative Jeff Ramsay denied any forced eviction plans. A Survival International campaigner said, \\"I don‚Äôt know how the government can say [...] that they are not planning to evict them when the Ranyane Bushmen are taking the government to court to stop from being removed.\\" A new case was filed on behalf of the residents. In response to a complaint filed on behalf of residents, the court issued a restraining order in June 2013 prohibiting the government from relocating residents from Ranyane and from blocking access to the water pipe, entering any household without occupants‚Äô permission, and removing residents without first notifying the community‚Äôs lawyers. In August 2013 attorneys for the Basarwa people filed a High Court case in which the original complainants from the 2006 CKGR case appealed to government for unrestricted access to the CKGR for their children and relatives (i.e. without permits). The case was dismissed for technical reasons, with permission given by the court to refile with a new application. In a move criticized by civil society and local media, the government added the Basarwa applicants‚Äô lawyer, a United Kingdom citizen affiliated with Survival International, to a list of individuals who must apply for visas to enter the country. While the government denied allegations that it planned to bar the lawyer from the country, it did not grant his visa in time for him to participate in the August High Court hearing. The lawyer, Gordon Bennett, said, \\"The right to a fair trial normally includes the right to be represented by counsel of your choice. Not in Botswana, apparently ‚Äì or at least not if you sue the Government.\\" A Botswana government Facebook post stated that the Department of Immigration had turned down Bennett's request for a visa, describing it as \\"submitted on short notice[.]\\" A follow-up Facebook post said that the Minister of Labour and Home Affairs, the Honourable Edwin Batshu, defended this move as being \\"in the interest of national security.\\" The trial began on 29 July.

It was distributed from the 1880s by the Baudriller nursery, Angers, and by the Sp√§th nursery, Berlin, as U. campestris monumentalis Rinz., appearing separately in their catalogues from U. minor 'Sarniensis', the Guernsey or Wheatley Elm,Sp√§th, L., Catalogue 143 (1910-11; Berlin), p.134-135 with which, according to Henry, it was confused on the continent. Kr√ºssmann, for example, gives 'Monumentalis' as a synonym of 'Sarniensis'.Kr√ºssmann, Gerd, Manual of Cultivated Broad-Leaved Trees & Shrubs (1984 vol. 3), p.404 'Sarniensis' is known as monumentaaliep [:monumental elm] in The Netherlands.Amsterdamse Iepen, bomeninfo.nl Springer noted that the Dutch monumentaaliep was \\"not the actual monumentaaliep (U. glabra Mill var. monumentalis Rinz) but U. glabra Mill. var. Wheatleyi Sim. Louis\\", and that it \\"should be renamed U. glabra Mill. var. monumentalis Hort. (non Rinz)\\". In England, Smith's of Worcester listed Ulmus monumentalis separately from Ulmus 'Wheatley' in the 1880s.'Standard Ornamental Trees' in Forest, hardy ornamental trees, conifers, etc., Richard Smith & Co., Worcester, catalogue 1887‚Äì88, p.27 Rinz gave his tree the name 'Monumentalis' for its columnar form,K. Koch, Wochenschrift des Vereines zur Bef√∂rderung des Gartenbaues, Vol.15, Berlin, 4 May 1872 p.140 and (according to Beissner) because the parent tree stood near the Monument of the Landgrave of Hesse (Hessenmonument) on the former glacis, which is now (1889) located in the city at Frankfurt.H. J√§ger, L. Beissner, Die Ziergeh√∂lze der G√§rten und Parkanlagen (Weimar 1889), p.400n. The German name 'Tomb Elm' may have arisen from the tree's similarity in form to cypress, a burial-ground tree in parts of Europe. Description Kirchner (1864) described 'Monumentalis' as a pyramidal field elm with a few upright main branches and numerous weak, short side-branches. The small, very rough leaves form a dark green foliage \\"that appears to hug the trunk\\". 'Monumentalis' was described by Beissner (1904) as a columnar form of suberose field elm with short, crowded, contorted branches and dense, often twisted black-green leaves, a tree of \\"a very peculiar monstrous appearance\\".Beissner, L., Mitteilungen der Deutschen dendrologischen gesellschaft (Bonn, 1904), p.140 Rinz reported that tree did not grow tall. Some nurseries referred to it as a \\"dwarf\\" elm.Ellwanger & Barry's general catalogue; Mount Hope nurseries, 1890; p.49Illustrated and descriptive catalogue of fruit and ornamental trees, Perry Nursery Co., Rochester, N.Y., 1912, p.90 Henry described it as \\"a columnar tree with a few upright main branches and numerous short twigs bearing dense crowded dark green leaves\\". Sp√§th's catalogue likewise described the tree as having a dense upright shape. Heike in Die Gartenkunst (1908) described 'Monumentalis' as \\"strictly pyramidal\\", and 'Wheatleyi' ('Sarniensis') as \\"similar, but [with] a wider, loose crown.\\" Die Gartenkunst, X,3, p.51 File:Edinburgh RBG- Ulmus No.2B.jpgBark of C2713, RBGE (1989) (see 'Cultivation') File:Putative Ulmus minor 'Monumentalis' Rinz.jpgC2713, seen from south-east (1990s) Pests and diseases Field Elm cultivars are susceptible to Dutch elm disease, but, if not grafted, often survive through root-sucker regrowth. Chevalier noted (1942) that 'Monumentalis' Rinz was one of four European cultivars found by researchers in The Netherlands to have significant resistance to the earlier strain of Dutch elm disease prevalent in the 1920s and '30s, the others being 'Exoniensis', 'Berardii' and 'Vegeta'. The four were rated less resistant than U. foliacea clone 23, from Spain, later cultivated as 'Christine Buisman'. Cultivation No examples are known, but a non-grafted field elm cultivar would be expected to survive through root-suckering. One tree was planted in 1893 as U. campestris monumentalis at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, Canada. Three specimens were supplied by Sp√§th to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) in 1902 as U. campestris monumentalis. One was planted in the garden proper (see 'Putative specimens'); the other two, or regrowth from them, may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm); Accession numbers E00824706, E00824707, E00824708. the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant. U. campestris monumentalis appeared separately from U. campestris sarniensis in the early 20th-century catalogue of the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk. Introduced to the USA, it appeared in the 1904 catalogue of Kelsey's, New York, and in the 1909 catalogue of the Bobbink and Atkins nursery, Rutherford, New Jersey, in separate entries from Wheatley Elm, as U. monumentalis, 'Monumental Elm', \\"a small variety, slow and dense of growth\\".Bobbink and Atkins nursery, Rutherford, New Jersey, 1909 catalogue, p.51 An U. campestris monumentalis had appeared in the catalogues of the Mount Hope Nursery (also known as Ellwanger and Barry) of Rochester, New York, as early as 1871.'Descriptive Catalogue of Ornamental Trees & Shrubs', no.2, Mount Hope Nursery, Rochester, 1871; p.6 In 1898 the nursery described their 'Monumentalis' as \\"a dwarf\\" and \\"conical in habit\\".Ellwanger & Barry, Mount Hope Nurseries, Rochester, 1898 catalogue; p.61 A suckering, narrow-pyramidal or columnar elm resembling a wild cypress (about 11 m), with dense upright branching and small dark-green leaves, that stood on the azalea lawn in RBGE till the 1990s (tree C2713),Distant photograph in Deni Bown, Four Gardens in One: The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (Edinburgh 1992), p.73 was probably one of Sp√§th's three 1902 'Monumentalis'.

Production =Development= A police sketch that featured in the episode was drawn by comic book artist Neal Adams. According to Marc Gruggenheim shooting for this episode started on 5 July 2016 until the fifteenth of that month while preparation for the episode was between June 23 and July 4. According to Collider, fans were to expect \\"the most violent, vicious\\" fight scene in this episode. It was said that Amell revealed, \\"one particular fight scene ‚Äúhas the opportunity for us to have the most vicious, violent one-shot in the history of network television.\\" =Casting= Rick Gonzalez who joins the recurring cast as new vigilante \\"Wild Dog\\" On June 15, 2016, Rick Gonzalez was cast as Wild Dog, a new vigilante in Star City whose reckless and cocksure nature prompts Green Arrow to take him under his wing. Chad L. Coleman was cast as Tobias Church, who serves as one of this season's villains, and made his first appearance in the season premiere. On June 28, 2016, Tyler Ritter was announced to play Detective Billy Malone, that character also made his debut in this episode. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.87 million viewers with a 0.7/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was down 20% and 36% in viewership and the 18-49 rating, respectively, from the fourth-season premiere, \\"Green Arrow\\". It was also down from the previous episode, \\"Schism\\", which was watched by 2.19 million viewers with a 0.8/3 in the demographics. The episode ranked as the 77th most watched show on the week. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 3.07 million viewers, and a 1.3 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= Caroline Preece of Den of Geek wrote \\"The Arrow season 5 premiere is action-packed and feels like a return to the heights of season one in all the best ways...\\" she also praised villain Tobias Church by stating \\"The villain ‚Äì Tobias Church - also ties into this nicely. He has a presence and a physicality that we haven't really seen since Slade, and that‚Äôs really evident in his showdown with Oliver in the episode. He's all knuckle-dusters and confidence, rather than vague magic or rituals. He‚Äôs also a black man, which does and doesn't matter at the same time.\\" Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, he said \\"I want to feel more optimistic than I do by the end of ‚ÄúLegacy,‚Äù but damn it, Arrow, we‚Äôve been down this road before. There are about three fundamental problems Arrow needs to reckon with coming out of its fourth season, and only one of them‚Äîthe tediousness of the flashbacks‚Äîlooks like something the show is actively course-correcting.\\" Ed Gross for Empire gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He commented, \\"‚ÄúLegacy‚Äù works on a number of levels. In terms of action, a hand-held and more urgent editing approach makes the fight sequences visceral, serving as an effective contrast to obviously choreographed fights of the past couple of years. Additionally, across the board the performances are strong, showing characters painfully grappling with their pasts while trying to chart new paths as they go forward. Inevitably, though, they find themselves drawn back into the world that they know best. What works particularly well is a tribute to Laurel Lance/Black Canary with the unveiling of a statue constructed in her memory. Her legacy, and what she sacrificed her life for, is extremely impactful on the characters, reminding them why they fight and what they aspire towards.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a 7.4 out of 10 with his verdict stating \\"Arrow faces a long, uphill battle this year as it tries to move forward from the incredibly disappointing Season 4 finale. With that in mind, it's disappointing that Season 5 couldn't open on a more exciting note. There was certainly plenty to enjoy this week, from the stylish fight scenes to the dramatic performances from Stephen Amell and Paul Blackthorne. But this wasn't the fast-paced, exciting kickoff the season needed, and too much remains unclear about the show's ongoing direction right now.\\" References External links 2016 American television episodes Arrow (TV series) episodes Television episodes about murder Television episodes about organized crime Law enforcement in fiction Television episodes set in Russia ","title":"Legacy (Arrow)"},{"id":"52452678","text":"King Gordy Sings the Blues is the sixth studio album by American rapper King Gordy and his first blues album as a result of decision to take a break from his regular horrorcore music style.

Built about 1820, it is one of the state's oldest surviving two-room two-story schoolhouses. It was used as a school until 1970. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The West Berkshire School is near the southeastern fringe of the crossroads village of West Berkshire, at the western corner of Berkshire Center Road (Vermont Route 118) and Mineral Brook Road. It is a vernacular two-story wood frame building with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A small square belltower rises from the roof ridge, with an open belfry covered by a gabled roof. The front facade is symmetrical, with a center entrance sheltered by an open gable-roofed vestibule. The vestibule is flanked by narrow windows, and there are sash windows on the second level. Fenestration on the side walls is irregular, the most significant arrangement being a bank of seven sash windows on the lower level of the east side, a likely early 20th-century alteration made to satisfy new state regulations regarding natural lighting. The interior consists of single chambers on each floor, with a staircase in a corner near the entrance. The building has been fitted with electricity, but has never had plumbing or heat other than a wood stove. An enclosed wood-frame fire escape was added to the west side in the 20th century, which also served to shelter the privy area. with The school was probably built about 1820, based on stylistic analysis of its architecture. It is extremely unusual as a two-story two-room district schoolhouse, since most of Vermont's district schools (surviving and otherwise) were single-story single-room buildings. At the time of its National Register listing in 1993, there were six known examples of such schools in the state.

Liquidambar changii is known from Middle Miocene fossils found in Central Washington. History and classification The species was first described from specimens of silicified infructescences in blocks of chert. The chert was recovered from the \\"Hi hole\\" site, one of the \\"county line hole\\" fossil localities north of Interstate 82 in Yakima County, Washington. The \\"Hi hole\\" site works strata which was thought to be part of the Museum Flow Package within the interbeds of the Sentinel Bluffs Unit of the central Columbia Plateau N2 Grande Ronde Basalt, Columbia River Basalt Group. The Museum Flow Package interbeds, designated the type locality, are dated to the middle Miocene and are approximately 15.6 million years old. Later re-evaluation of the \\"hi hole\\" site indicated that the site is included into a basalt flow, rather than part of the interbedded Museum flow package. The evaluation suggested the basalt is part of the Wanapum Basalt and that the fossils are possibly a little younger than formerly reported. Dating reported in 2007 of a related site near Ellensburg, Washington confirmed that the deposits worked are pockets within the basalt flows, and the 15.6 million year old date was accurate. At the time of study, the holotype infructescence, specimen UWBM 94723, and a series of paratype specimens are preserved in chert blocks housed in the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture while an additional seven of the paratypes were part of the paleobotanical collections at Arizona State University. The specimens represent a range of preservation conditions, ranging from exposed on weathered surfaces of the chert, totally weathered out of the chert, and as hollow chert casts of the infructescences. A total of 42 specimens in chert were studied by paleobotanists Kathleen Pigg, Stefanie Ickert-Bond, and Jun Wen, with their 2004 type description being published in the American Journal of Botany. Pigg and team chose the specific epithet changii as a patronym honoring the Chinese botanist and ecologist Hung-ta Chang, for his work with the family Altingiaceae and for describing the living species Liquidambar acalycina. Based on the infructescence morphology, Pigg et al noted the close similarity between L. changii and L. acalycina, suggesting they are possibly closely related. Due to the lack of some details used for the delimitation of L. acalycina, they chose to place the fossils into a new species rather than describe them as fossils belonging to the living species. The authors also noted that a number of Liquidambar compression/impression fossils of very similar age have been reported from the region, and may be also closely related, but lack the needed detail for examination. Description Liquidambar changii infructescences are round in shape, with diameters reaching , consisting of as many as 30 individual capsules in a helical arrangement. The infructescences are born on woody stems of up to and several specimens have stems containing secondary xylem. The woody structuring of the stems occasionally extends into the infructescence and all of the specimens have ducts for resin or gum, a character seen in living Liquidambar. The individual capsules are bi-locular with elongated outlines that are open at the top, and closed at the base which attaches to the central axis of the fruit. In each capsule there are between 5 and 9 aborted seeds and between one and two mature seeds, attached to the interior of the capsule along the side that is fused to the adjoining capsule. The mature seeds are attached to the capsule near the fruit interior while the aborted seeds are found both near the interior and to the sides of the ventral margin. The mature fruits have a triangular outline and have a raised ridge that runs around the outside of the seed.

History =M1= Early designs for the M1 show the extension to Sheffield and Leeds at what is now the Aston Interchange (A57). The draft scheme for the 87 miles from Crick to Doncaster was first published on 8 January 1960, where the extension to Leeds was now north of the Aston Interchange; all the junctions shown are those that would be built. The route was fixed on 7 October 1960. The M1 north of Crick began construction in early August 1962. On 3 September 1962, the draft scheme for the 34-mile extension to Leeds was published; the section was known as the Sheffield-Leeds Motorway. The contract for junction 31 to 34 for ¬£5,979,680 was awarded to Dowsett Engineering (Construction) Ltd (Dow-Mac) on 16 June 1965. South of the interchange, the Barlborough to Thurcroft 7.2-mile ¬£4.56m contract was awarded to Tarmac Civil Engineering Ltd in October 1965. The M1 section west of the junction and the M1 section south of the junction to Barlborough opened on 21 December 1967. =M18= On 26 January 1966, the ¬£5,080,309 contract for 8.5-mile section of the M18 was given to W. & C. French. At this time, 37 miles of the M1, north of Crick, were open to Kegworth Interchange (junction 24) from December 1965, and the M18 was expected to be built in two years. The northern part of the interchange was known as the Thurcroft Link or the Thurcroft Motorway Link. The M18 section opened on 21 December 1967. The new section of the M1 from Barlborough to Thurcroft, and the M18, was 15.5 miles long. Construction Work began in mid-June 1965 for the 6.5-mile section between junction 31 at Aston and junction 34; it was the second section of the M1 in Yorkshire to be constructed, after the section from junctions 42-44 began in May 1965. It was planned to complete this section by the autumn of 1967. At this time, the main M1 was known as the Crick-Doncaster Motorway. Two hundred and seventy houses would be demolished near junction 34 of the M1. The design of the Sheffield- Leeds M1 extension, including the Thurcroft Interchange, was done by West Riding County Council; it did not design the M18. The prestressed concrete beams for the section of the M1 from junctions 31-34 were made by Dow-Mac at Tallington in Lincolnshire. Work began in October 1965 for the section of the M1 from Barlborough to Thurcroft. Work began in January 1966 for the M18 section north of the Thurcroft Interchange. Structure The eastern part (M18) of the interchange is in Thurcroft, the western side (M1) is in Ulley, and the northern part (the main interconnecting slip roads) is in Whiston, South Yorkshire.

His interests embrace linguistic typology and endangered languages. Career Tsunoda was born in Akagi, Gumma Prefecture (now incorporated with other villages and renamed Shibukawa) in 1946. On graduating from Tokyo University, Tsunoda moved to Monash University in Melbourne where he completed a master's and then a doctoral degree in linguistics. His choice of Melbourne for postgraduate work was partially influenced by the fact that the Monash campus was close to an athletic training camp run by the former world middle distance champion Herb Elliott, His supervisor for both his M.A. and PhD was Barry Blake. Beginning in 1972, he undertook fieldwork on Palm Island in Queensland for his master's thesis (1974), where he undertook extensive interviews with a native informant, Alf Palmer(1891‚Äì1981), who happened to be the last fluent speaker of Warrungu, an Aboriginal language originally spoken in the upper reaches of the Herbert River, west of Tully He later wrote up his research to produce the standard grammar of the language, published in 2012. The language is important also for being one of less than 10 languages in the world, uniquely found in Northern Queensland, that embody the phenomenon of syntactic ergativity. On Palmer's death, Tsunoda, a Japanese, became the last speaker of the all but extinct Australian language, Warrungu. Subsequently, Tsunoda pursued field work in the southern Kimberley region of Western Australia, where he mastered and wrote a grammar of Djaru. On retirement from Tokyo University, he joined the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics. He has returned on occasion to Palm Island as a guest of the Australian Literacy & Numeracy Foundation in order to help children learn some Warrungu and assist in attempts to revive the language. He has provided the community with translations of classic children's books such as The Very Hungry Caterpillar, and Worrongo tales.

It was proclaimed on 23 August 1877, comprising the cadastral Hundred of Finniss, \\"situated between the eastern fringe of the Mount Lofty Ranges and the Murray River.\\" The first meeting of the council was held on 1 September 1877 at the Bogan Hotel (now the Mannum Hotel). It had 120 ratepayers in its first year, with a ratable property value of ¬£2,910. In the early 1880s, the council area had a population of 773. It expanded in January 1888 under the District Councils Act 1887, gaining the Hundred of Younghusband on the eastern bank of the Murray River; it also gained the northern section of the adjacent Hundred of Burdett in the same year. The council was unsubdivided until 1888, when it was divided into wards for the first time: the West, North and Central Wards (for Finniss) had two councillors each, while the South and East (for Younghusband and Burdett) had one each. A council chamber was built in 1896. There were two subsequent changes to the ward system: in 1900, when Central Ward was narrowed to only the township of Mannum, and again in 1956, when it gained an extra councillor, taking the council to a total of nine members. In 1923, it covered an area of 176 square miles, with a capital value of over ¬£24,000. The council lost two areas in 1935: one which amalgamated with the District Council of Springton to form the District Council of Mount Pleasant, and another which was severed to join the District Council of Mobilong. The council operated the Mannum ferry from March 1888 to June 1976. It was heavily involved in measures to deal with flooding on a number of occasions, and operated special boat services during the 1956 Murray River flood while the ferries were out of operation. In the second half of the twentieth century, it also developed a caravan park, recreation reserve, community centre and dental clinic at Mannum. In 1986, it covered an area of 681 square kilometres. The main primary industries were described as cereal growing (wheat and barley) and sheep farming for both meat and wool, with piggeries and cattle farming also of note. Agricultural machinery manufacturer Horwood Bagshaw (formerly David Shearer Limited) was the largest employer in the district. It was \\"one of the most popular places in the state\\" for tourist visits in that year due to the Murray River, with $2.7 million having been spent by tourists in 1981-1982. It ceased to exist on 1 July 1997, when it amalgamated with the District Council of Morgan, the District Council of Ridley-Truro, and part of the District Council of Mount Pleasant to form the Mid Murray Council.

The New Orleans-born Dorsey began boxing at 16 and retired from the sport at age 31. Career Boxing in New Orleans, a hotbed of enthusiasm for the sport, was segregated as early as 1892 when a black boxer named George Dixon beat his Irish challenger, Jack Skelly. By contrast, Louisiana state boxing officials didn't officially segregate the sport until 1950. In 1950, Governor Earl Long entrenched and widened the segregation policy, signing a law banning \\"dancing, social functions, entertainments, athletic training, games, sports or contests and other such activities involving personal and social contacts in which the participants or contestants are members of the White and Negro races.\\" Dorsey, a 7th Ward resident who was a light-skinned black man but would not pass for white, sued the state and its Louisiana State Athletic Commission for the right to box with white fighters on July 28, 1955. The New Orleans' major newspaper, The Times-Picayune, buried the story. In November 1958, a three- judge federal court in New Orleans found both the Louisiana law and the athletic commission's own rule against interracial bouts unconstitutional. Writing the opinion, Judge John Minor Wisdom of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the Louisiana law was \\"unconstitutional on its face in that separation of Negroes and whites based solely on their being Negroes and whites is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\\" and that segregated boxing matches were no exception. Louisiana appealed the ruling but the ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court in May 1959. The decision officially ended segregated athletic competition in the state, although it did not extend to the seating at sporting events, which remained segregated after the decision. Dorsey retired from boxing not long after filing the lawsuit, partly because it was difficult for him to be allowed in boxing matches because he had been blacklisted, thanks to his part in boxing's desegregation. Dorsey worked nearly four decades as a longshoreman, retiring in 1997, after leaving boxing. Dorsey died October 20, 2004, from cancer. Dorsey's family survivors as of 2004 include his wife, Evelyn, and four sons and a daughter.

New satellite technologies are covering the globe in layers of high-powered, ubiquitous bandwidth, capable of connecting both planes in the sky and ships at sea. As global IP traffic will nearly triple over the next five years, and by 2020 smartphones are expected to generate 30% of the total IP traffic, global satellite ubiquity is on the verge of exploding into a new realm of possibilities. *While forecasting the future is a task for the foolish, it is true that SES will remain a pioneer in using the best of these emerging technologies to rewrite space and satellite history and renew mankind‚Äôs access to space. *Access to data that powers education, health services, security and opportunity is a vital capability for everyone, not simply those with greater means. Satellite communications is a key enabler toward connecting those who are unconnected, bridging the digital divide and most importantly, enabling security and protection for those who need it most. *With up to 1.6 Gbps of throughput per beam and very low latency of less than 150 ms, O3b is delivering a unique and extremely elastic combination of satellite capacity, performance and scalability. *The fundamental shifts in the video ecosystem demand a holistic view of the service chain and the related necessary capabilities to serve customers. *Within this context [increasing demand for internet connectivity], satellite services are growing in relevance to address the global IP traffic explosion, as they provide a reach that can truly reduce the connectivity gap. *Satellites play a spectacular role as vehicles and probes of progress, as key agents to go beyond accustomed frontiers and set the vanishing points for future science and technology.

Paul Julian Smith describes the film as a \\"post-homophobic comedy\\"; it is an example of the new wave of Mexican LGBT+ cinema.  Release  It was released to cinemas on November 11, 2016. In the first three weeks of its release, up to November 27, it grossed 32 million Mexican pesos (ca. 1.6 million US dollars) and was seen by 740,000 viewers. Renato L√≥pez was murdered less than two weeks after the box-office debut.  Response  Response to the film, from critics and viewers, has been negative. Smith notes that all critics have compared the film to the 1969 Ren√© Cardona Jr. and Mauricio Garc√©s film Modisto de se√±oras when reviewing it, and that these comparisons are not kind to the social representations in Macho, especially considering it was made over 40 years after Modisto; Serrano denied taking inspiration from the film. Reviewers also view the film negatively in comparison to Serrano's own earlier gay-themed film, Sex, Shame and Tears (which also starred Su√°rez), and condemn its vision of women as being \\"objectified for the straight male viewer or vilified\\". Smith says that the film's genre is \\"confused\\" and that it veers between \\"social critique, farce, and romantic comedy\\". He concludes that while it is relatively modern in theme, the handling of the gay narrative is no more advanced than the 1970s sex comedies.

Background =Amanda Mellet= Amanda Mellet became pregnant in 2011. In November 2011, in the 21st week of pregnancy, a routine scans in the Rotunda Hospital showed the foetus was suffering Edwards syndrome, a fatal condition. Staff at the hospital told her that she could not have an abortion in this juristicion and would have to \\"travel\\". With the help of a family planning clinic, she, and her husband, travelled to Liverpool Women's Hospital for a termination. They had to return to Ireland only 12 hours after the termination because they couldn't afford to stay later. The procedure cost ‚Ç¨2,000, as there is no financial assistance from the State or private health insurers for women who terminate pregnancies abroad. The Rotunda did not provide bereavement counselling to parents who terminate the pregnancy due to fatal foetal abnormalities, but it will provide such counselling to women who do not terminate. The hospital did not provide any options regarding the foetus's remains, so they left them behind. The ashes were unexpectedly delivered three weeks later by courier. In February 2012, Ms Mellet and her husband spoke about their case to The Irish Times using the pseudonyms \\"Rachel and Tim\\". After the case she was involved with Termination for Medical Reasons. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed the complaint on Ms Mellet's behalf. This was the first time that an international body found that criminalising abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality violated the right to be free from torture, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.Fiona de Londras, ‚ÄúFatal Foetal Abnormality, Irish Constitutional Law, and Mellet v Ireland‚Äù (2016) 24(4) Medical Law Review 591-607 =Abortion law in Ireland= Abortion was banned in nearly all cases in the Republic of Ireland until 2018. There was a constitutional protection for the unborn after the 1983 Eighth Amendment. The 2013 law, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 allowed for abortion in case of danger to the life of the mother. In June 2017 the Citizens Assembly recommended holding a referendum to repeal the 8th Amendment. A referendum was held on May 25, 2018, to repeal the 8th Amendment, which passed with a large majority (66.4%) of the vote. Ruling In 2016 the United Nations Human Rights Committee found that Ireland's abortion law violated the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and called for the Government offer her compensation, counselling and also change its laws to allow for abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. The committee found that she was subjected to discrimination and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as a result of Ireland's legal prohibition of abortion. The committee said that, in addition to the shame and stigma associated with the criminalization of abortion of a fatally ill foetus, Mellet's suffering was aggravated by the obstacles she faced in getting information about the appropriate medical options. Reaction =Amanda Mellet= Ms Mellet welcomed the ruling, and called on abortion to be decriminalised. =Irish Government response= The formal response to the finding from the Irish Government (delivered on 1 December 2016) was to explain the Citizens' Assembly process, which would report to the Oireachtas by mid 2017. =Abortion rights campaigners= The Abortion Rights Campaign welcomed the ruling, and called it a milestone. Terminations for Medical Reasons welcomed the decision of the committee saying \\"The Committee has determined that Ireland, by refusing access to safe and legal abortion services, is abusing women by treating them in a cruel, inhuman and degrading manner.\\" The Irish Council for Civil Liberties said the report \\"cranks up the pressure\\" on the Government to reform Ireland's \\"antediluvian\\" abortion laws. Amnesty International in Ireland welcomed the ruling, calling it \\"ground breaking\\". =Anti-abortion campaigners= Youth Defence strongly condemned the ruling, calling it \\"deplorable\\". The Pro Life Campaign condemned the judgement, and accused the UN of being a \\"de facto lobby group for abortion\\", and criticised the offer of compensation. The Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin opposed the finding, saying abortion was a matter for the Irish people, and reaffirmed the Catholic view that abortion should not be allowed in this case. Compensation In November 2016, the government paid her ‚Ç¨30,000 for the suffering caused by having to travel to another country. Minister for Health Simon Harris (from Fine Gael), Labour's Alan Kelly and Fianna F√°il's Billy Kelleher met Ms Mellet and her family to offer the compensation and counselling just one week before the deadline to reply from the UN. This was the first time the Irish government had agreed to compensate someone like this. Some legal sources do not think this will set a precedent for the Irish courts, whereas a member of the UN committee said that if another woman took a similar case before the committee, Ireland would have to pay compensation. Further Cases In 2017, there was a similar case, Whelan v Ireland. The Government paid her ‚Ç¨30,000 compensation.

Family He was part of the gens Antonia. It is possible that he was a plebeian, since the nomen Antonius is found among the plebeians more often than the patricians in this era. He was the father of Quintus Antonius Merenda, military tribune in 422 BC. Biography Titus Antonius Merenda was one of the ten members of the Second Decemvirate, presided over by Appius Claudius Crassus and elected to draft the Law of the Twelve Tables, the first body of Roman law ever written. The Second Decemvirate seemed to be constituted equally by patricians and by plebeians, like Merenda. At the instigation of Crassus, the decemvirs maintained their power illegally for another year, refusing to proceed in the election of consuls.Cicero, De Republica, II. 61 In 449 BC, the Sabines occupied Eretum and the Aequi invaded and set up camp under Mount Algidus. The Roman troops were divided into two armies in order to fight on two fronts. Merenda received command of the army that fought the Aequi, with three other decemvirs: Lucius Minucius, Marcus Cornelius and Lucius Sergius. At the time, Crassus and Spurius Oppius Cornicen stayed in Rome to assist in the defense of the city, while the four other decemvirs fought the Sabines.Livy, III. 38-42Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities XI. 2 The two Roman armies were held in check on each front. The army commanded by Merenda withdrew to Tusculum before he was moved in reply to Lucius Verginius whose daughter had been made a slave by Crassus during a scandalous trial. In light of this, Lucius Verginius had been forced to kill his own daughter. His story provoked a mutiny among the soldiery who then chose ten military tribunes. Under their command, they returned to Rome and occupied the foot of the Aventine before joining with the other army by Monte Sacro. Under pressure by the soldiers and the plebeians, the decemvirs conceded. Crassus and Spurius Oppius Cornicen remained in Rome, and were imprisoned, but committed suicide during the process. The eight other decemvirs, including Merenda, were sent into exile.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 43-54Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, XI. 24-43 References  Bibliography  =Ancient bibliography= * Livy, Ab urbe condita * Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities =Modern bibliography= 5th-century BC Romans Ancient Roman decemvirs Ancient Roman exiles Merenda, Titus ","title":"Titus Antonius Merenda"},{"id":"52453493","text":"At Blue Lake, Mount Gede Pangrango National Park, Java Milionia fulgida is a species of day-flying moth in the family Geometridae.

Early life His father was Philip Walsh, a Waterford merchant, who settled in Saint Malo about 1685, and who would die at sea on an African voyage. It was Philip who had conveyed the defeated James II of England from Kinsale, Ireland to Saint Malo, France in 1690 after the Battle of the Boyne thus starting the family connections to the House of Stuart. Antoine was born 22 Jan in Saint Malo. After serving in the French Navy, he settled in Nantes, which had emerged as the France's chief slaving port; where he found advantage in its close-knit Irish community. Career He became a merchant was a major figure in and made a fortune from the Atlantic slave trade of Nantes. slave- trading and plantation-owning had made him the friend of kings. Antoine became wealthy on the back of the slave trade. The trade operated in a triangular fashion, supplying Africa with textiles, brandy, and firearms; slaves for the French West Indies in Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Saint-Domingue; sugar and tobacco for Europe. Marriage In 1741 he married Mary O'Shiell, a French- Irish businesswoman in Nantes in France, where she is a known figure in the history of Nantes, alongside her sisters Agn√©s O'Shiell and Anne O'Shiell. She was the daughter of the Irish Jacobite Luke O'Shiell (1677-1745), who was born in Dublin but emigrated to Nantes after the Irish defeat, and Agn√®s Vanasse (1690-1724). The family manor of the O'Shiell, Manoir de la Placeli√®re, became the gathering place of the large Irish colony in Nantes. 1745 Loch nan Uamh, Scotland In 1744 he commissioned a new French privateer the Du Teillay (18 guns), in Nantes. She played a central role in the Jacobite rising of 1745, ferrying Charles Edward Stuart to Ardmolich with supplies and funds to support his cause. He took a leading role in the French Irish community's financing and planning and of Charles's expedition to Scotland, the 1745 Jacobite rising, and was a key figure in all aspects of the naval side of the rebellion. In his correspondence with the Prince, Walsh adopted the pseudonym Monsieur Le Grand and the young prince was called Mr Douglas; they also had face-to-face planning meetings at Navarre in April 1745. Antoine accompanied the Prince on the journey on board the Du Teillay (Captain Claude Durb√©) on 7 July at Saint-Nazaire and they were joined by French escort warship the L'Elisabeth, bound for Ardmolich in Scotland. Two days later on the 9 July 1745 they were intercepted off the Lizard by HMS Lion, and were severely impeded in their mission when they exchanged fire, the Elisabeth was so badly damaged she had to return to port taking the arms and Irish volunteers with her. The Du Teillay and was obliged to continued alone eventually arriving at Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides on 2 August, they then sailed onto Loch nan Uamh and two days later Antoine had to take his leave for France, leaving Charles with his eight companions to proceed to Glenfinnan where on 19 August 1745 he raised his Standard, despite having no money and no supplies. In the same year Antoine's second son, Antoine Jean Baptiste Walsh (1745-1789) was born. James III (James Francis Edward Stuart) the Prince's father created him an Irish Earl Walsh in October 1745. After Culloden, on 16 April 1746 Walsh sent detailed proposals to Maurepas the French minister of marine for rescuing the prince, some of which was acted upon, however following risings failure he had fallen out of grace with the French court. Coincidentally Charles was to return to Loch nan Uamh by the 20 September 1746 to the nearby Prince's Cairn, which marks the spot where he finally left Scotland forever on a French ship after the unsuccessful Rebellion He sufficiently had recovered favour at court to be ennobled by Louis XV in December 1753. Ch√¢teau de Serrant The Walsh RegimentIn 1749, Antoine assisted his brother Fran√ßois Jacques Walsh (1704-1782) in buying from the last surviving descendant of the de Bautru family, the lordship of Serrant in Anjou; coming with the Ch√¢teau de Serrant and its estate. The Walsh family set about redecorating the interior of the castle, they built an English style park, pavilions, and a monumental gate complete with the family crest. Francois Jacques (a wealthy Nantes shipowner in his own right) became Count de Serrant in 1754. The ch√¢teau eventually passed out of the hands of the Walsh family in 1830 when Valentine Eug√©nie Jos√©phine Walsh de Serrant married the Duc de La Tr√©mo√Ølle (1764‚Äì1839). La Tr√©mo√Ølle set to the task of restoring the castle and added several features, including parapets and cornices. The La Tr√©mo√Ølle family still own the ch√¢teau. Later life In 1755, the O'Shiell family became ennobled. Antoine remained a trusted friend of the Prince, acting as an intermediary with Frederick II of Prussia's ambassador to Paris the Earl Marischal in their dispute in 1754. He died at Cap Fran√ßais, San Domingo (Haiti), on 2 March 1763. On his death his Jacobite peerage passed to his second and only surviving son, Antoine Jean Baptiste. Irish Brigade (France) The Walsh family are connected with the Irish Brigade. After the Glorious Revolution, Louis XIV founded the brigade in May 1690, it consisted of three regiments; one of which will be renamed the Walsh regiment in 1770; when it was led by a nephew of Antoines, born in Cadiz, home to another colony of officers and shipowners, who were Jacobites.

They have a reputation for slapstick spoken, physical and musical comedy as well as fine musicianship.  Origins  Sartin and Hutchinson met in the mid-1990s when they were both members of the folk-rock band Life Of Reilly, which existed to write music to satirise the construction of the Newbury bypass. After a few performances they left the band to form a duo. They began working for ceilidhs and social dances, working with caller Andrew Shaw on a project exploring the work of the 18th century composer Nathaniel Kynaston, which led to two albums, Mr Kynaston‚Äôs Famous Dance volume 1 (2000) and volume 2 (2002). Another album drawn from the social dance repertoire, John Playford‚Äôs Secret Ball, followed in 2001. During 1996 and 199,7 Sartin and Hutchinson formed the core of the Breeze Band, backing the Scottish singer Ian Bruce. Two recordings were released, A Kind and Gentle Nature (WildGoose 277) and Annie Laurie (Ruglen 103), while the band played some UK dates and undertook a tour of Germany. \\\\- \\\\- As Belshazzar's Feast their other early recordings were song and tune sets, showcasing a developing concert repertoire, One Too Many in 1996, Drop The Reed in 1998, albeit displaying the same irreverent twist that distinguished them from the social dance norm. They toured America and Belgium during this time, mostly playing for social dances. \\\\- \\\\- The duo formed the basis of ceilidh outfits Belshazzar's Dance Band (Sartin, Hutchinson plus Mark Powell) and, briefly, Bazza's Dog, an amalgamation of Belshazzar's Feast, Hoover the Dog and Mark Powell.  Career After a hiatus where other work took precedence, they relaunched Belshazzar's Feast in 2008 with the album Food of Love. Their first winter/Christmas-themed album, Frost Bites, followed in 2009, which earned them a nomination for Best Duo at the 2010 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. A second winter-themed album, Stocking Fillers, was released in 2012. Another album of concert material, Find The Lady, was released in 2011. This album had elements of the pair's spoken comedy included in some, but not all, of the tracks. Belshazzar's Feast generally undertake two tours per year, one in the spring and one in the run up to Christmas. In addition, when not touring, they work together for charity organisation Superact, putting music into places where a formal concert would not work ‚Äì for example in hospitals or care homes. They were the support band for Bellowhead's tour of the UK in 2009. They celebrated twenty years of working together in 2014 with a live album, The Whiting‚Äôs On The Wall. This had between-song patter in separate tracks from the music. The cover art for this album was produced by Simon Drew.  Humour  The duo performs three distinct types of humour as part of their act. Their spoken between-song patter often includes word-based puns based on song titles or the text of the lyrics. They also have an element of physical comedy, either indicated with their instruments, facial expressions or body language, or by inviting audience members up to the stage. In addition, humour appears in their music, for example by slipping pieces of well-known tunes such as the Postman Pat theme or the Christmas carol \\"Silent Night\\" into the middle of their material without warning.  Associated acts  In addition to having played together in Life of Reilly, both Sartin and Hutchinson have been active in many other projects and groups. Sartin has been part of Dr Faustus, Bellowhead and Faustus in addition to his work as a composer, arranger and conductor. Hutchinson has played with Pagoda Project, Hoover The Dog and the Playford Liberation Front. In addition, Hutchinson is a composer, arranger and workshop leader (Marlborough College, Cecil Sharp House, Dartington and Benslow Music Centre). \\\\-  Partial discography  1996: One Too Many (Terra Nova TERRCD022) 1998: Drop The Reed (WildGoose WGS293CD) 2000: Mr Kynaston‚Äôs Famous Dance (vol 1) (WildGoose WGS298CD) 2001: John Playford‚Äôs Secret Ball (WildGoose WGS304CD) 2002: Mr Kynaston‚Äôs Famous Dance (vol 2) (WildGoose WGS314CD) 2008: The Food of Love (WildGoose 353CD) 2009: Frost Bites (WildGoose 366 CD) 2011: Find The Lady (Unearthed TPLP1080CD) 2012: Stocking Fillers (Unearthed B008YBADAO) 2014: The Whiting‚Äôs On The Wall (Unearthed B00ISKT5NM)  References   External links  *Official Belshazzar's Feast website *Paul Hutchinson's website *Paul Sartin's website English folk musicians ","title":"Belshazzar's Feast (band)"},{"id":"52453644","text":"Kamyabi (Urdu: ) is a 1984 Pakistani, family drama and a musical film - directed, screenplay, produced by Pervez Malik.

It was founded in 1954 during the mambo and cha-cha-ch√° explosion. Many of its recordings, produced by its founder Jes√∫s Gor√≠s, became instant hits.  History  = Early career of Puchito's founder = The founder, Jes√∫s Gor√≠s (n√© Jes√∫s Ramon Francisco Gor√≠s Ballas; 12 April 1921 Havana, Cuba ‚Äì 16 Aug 2006 Miami, Florida) had been a representative of RCA Victor, selling records from a separate counter at his father's hardware store, La Estrella. Eventually, the store became known as Gor√≠s Shop. In 1952, Gor√≠s invested in a single, \\"Guantanamera\\", composed by Jose√≠to Fern√°ndez, which did well in jukeboxes. Gor√≠s and two partners, Messrs. Alfredo Beltr√°n and Oliva, originally wanted to launch a series of children's records, so they chose the name Puchito, which, in this context, means \\"youngest child.\\" In 1954, Gor√≠s and his two partners produced an LP of Olga Guillot singing with The Castro Brothers Orchestra, one of Cuba's first jazz bands (no relation to Fidel Castro). Although Guillot. \\"Mienteme\\" (\\"Lie to Me\\"), a bolero composed by Chamaco Dom√≠nguez (es) (1921‚Äì1985), was one of the album's great successes. Puchito went on to produce Guillot on nine more albums, and a few singles, up until 1960. In 1958, Gor√≠s hired pianist Ren√© Touzet (1916‚Äì2003) as musical director and orchestrator of Guillot's album, Intemidades (MLP-526), which gained reputation as having the most important works of her career, and several that cemented Touzet's reputation as an original composer: \\"La Noche de Anoche\\" (\\"The Night Last Night\\"), \\"Ser√° Cuando T√∫ Quieras,\\" \\"Estuve Pensando,\\" and \\"No Te Importe Saber\\" (\\"Let Me Love You Tonight\\"). Guillot and Touzet, though never married, had a daughter together: Olga Mar√≠a Touzet-Guillot (born 1960). With the support of Benny Mor√©, Gor√≠s spearheaded the rediscovery of a major sonero artist from the 1920s, Abelardo Barroso, who, back then, had sung with Sexteto Habanero. Gor√≠s curated and, through Puchito, republished old photographs and produced Barroso with the Orquesta Sensaci√≥n. In early July 1955, Barroso recorded a single, \\"La hija de Juan Sim√≥n\\" and \\"En Guant√°namo\\" (Puchito 224, 78 rpm & 45 rpm), his first recording in over fifteen years, and apart from his solitary single in 1939, his first in over a quarter century. Rolando Vald√©s, founder of Orquesta Sensaci√≥n, selected the songs for the session, both from Barroso's radio hits of the 1930s. The release became one of the greatest double-sided hits in the history of popular music. It became a Gold Record in 1956. In 1956, Puchito released 5 more singles featuring Barroso and Orquesta Sensaci√≥n. ; Selected 1956 releases :* Puchito 262 (1956); :*: Side A: \\"El Manisero\\" (\\"The Peanut Ventor\\") :*: Mois√©s Simons (w&m;) :*: :*: Side B: \\"Resabroso Cha-Cha-Cha\\" :*: :* Puchito 496 :*: Side A: \\"Coctel Para Dos\\" :*: Arthur Johnston (w&m;) :*: Sam Coslow (w&m;) :*: Side B: \\"Vuelve Navidad\\" ; Other Puchito hits by Barroso :* \\"El Panquelero\\" :* \\"Tiene sabor\\" :* \\"El Guajiro de Cunagua\\" :* \\"La Macorina\\" :* \\"Con sabor a bomb√≥n\\" :* \\"Bruca Manigu√°\\" For the rest of the 1950s, Gor√≠s produced several other highly successful records on the Puchito label. He produced Chapottin y sus Estrellas on with singer Miguelito Cun√≠ (es) (1917‚Äì1984), the Orquesta Riverside with singer Tito Gomez (1920‚Äì2000) and Roberto Faz (1914‚Äì1966) and his conjunto for the label.

And for many years, Puchito recorded at Cuban Plastics & Record Corporation at San Miguel 410, between Campanario and Lealtad in Havana, with the factory outside of the city. San Miguel 410 was the home of Panart, founded and owned by Ram√≥n S. Sabat and his wife, Julia, both also founders of Cuban Plastics and Record Corporation. = 1961 Cuban nationalization ‚Äî National Press of Cuba = On May 29, 1961, during the process of enterprise nationalization started by the Revolutionary Government, the assets and management of several record companies were assumed by the Imprenta Nacional de Cuba (INC) (National Press of Cuba), an arts overseer created March 31, 1961. Companies included in the seizure included Puchito and Panart. Imprenta Nacional de Cuba acted as the only legal Cuban label until 1964. In 1964, EGREM (Empresa de Grabaciones y Ediciones Musicales) became Cuba's national label. EGREM operated several imprints including Areito (for recordings made in the former Panart studios in Havana), Palma (for international distribution) and Siboney (for recordings made in Santiago de Cuba). = Puchito Record Mfg. Co. Inc. in Florida = In 1961, years after the end of the Cuban Revolution, Gor√≠s went into exile, immigrating to Miami, Florida, and was lawfully admitted in the United States for permanent residence on October 20, 1962. He began working at a 7-Eleven, then became a top salesman for Equitable Life Insurance in Miami. While working in insurance, Gor√≠s, with a partner, Giuseppe Pucci Storniolo (1929‚Äì1993), launched Puchito Record Mfg. Co. Inc. in 1963 as a Florida entity, initially located at 480 East 28 Street, Hialeah. Puchito Record Mfg. Co. produced the recordings that Gor√≠s brought with him from Cuba. After a period of time, the new Puchito released those recordings on its newly created budget label, Adria. The new Puchito also started to distribute its newly created Krystal label. Gor√≠s and his wife, Georgina Rita Gor√≠s (1927‚Äì2012), became naturalized United States citizens on April 12, 1968. Jes√∫s Gor√≠s married Georgina around 1945, and remained married to her for the rest of his life. The company remained active until 1971. It somehow operated afterwards from the US, but seemed to have continued also in Cuba for a while after the revolution. Puchito Mfg. Co. Inc.

Recordings was a United States trademark of Puchito Record Mfg. Co. Inc., based in Hialeah, Florida. The trademark was active ten years, from April 25, 1967, to April 25, 1977. = Armada and Rodriguez of Miami, Inc. = Jos√© Armada Sr. and Vicente Rodr√≠guez, who had been in the record business together in Cuba, remain together when they arrived in New York in 1964. They recorded and distributed Puchito Records and set up racks in New York and New Jersey. Fellow Cubans brought them to Miami in 1968, where they purchased the bankrupt Puchito label at an auction, picked up some other labels, and started a distributing business. In 1972 they opened a manufacturing plant ‚ÄîArmada and Rodriguez of Florida, Inc.‚Äî where they pressed LP's and 45's for their own labels: Gema Records, Velvet Records Inc., Continental Records, Aro Records, Funny Records, Regio Records, and Suave Records, and a number of custom labels. Their labels, Aro, Funny, Regio, and Suave are distributed all over the U.S. and Puerto Rico and for the most part are licensed works from Latin America. But, they also produced and recorded local artists, including The Antiques, Alexis Fari, Miriam (aka Myriam) and the Sons of Paraguay. Armada & Rodriquez distributed Gema throughout the U.S., and they owned their own distributing organization in New York and Antilla. They sold only to distributors, not to retail stores, but also owned a distributing company that sold to retail stores and serviced their racks.

The last glacial period and its associated glaciation is known in southern Chile as the Llanquihue glaciation (). Its type area lies west of Llanquihue Lake where various drifts or end moraine systems belonging to the last glacial period have been identified. The glaciation is the last episode of existence of the Patagonian Ice Sheet. The preceding interglacial is known as the Valdivia interglacial after its type locality of Valdivia. General characteristics View of Llanquihue Lake. During much of the Llanquihue glaciations glaciers flowing from the Andes in the east (background) coalesced and entered the lake basin forming a large glacier lobe there. The characteristics of the glaciation differ according to latitude. In Central Chile, south of Atacama Desert, the extent of the Llanquihue glaciation was controlled by precipitation which increases to the south. Maximum glaciers advances were not synchronous across the whole latitudinal gradient as they were triggered by north and southward shifts in the moisture-bringing Westerlies and its storm tracks. Glaciers in Central Chile were particularly sensitive to shifts in the precipitation pattern and those to the south in southern Chile (39‚Äì43¬∞ S) were sensitive to both precipitation and temperature, correlating better with global temperature trends. During large glacier advances the Llanquihue glaciation in Chile showed a marked difference north and south of latitude 41.5¬∞ S. To the south Andean valley glacier lobes coalesced and spread out occupying what is today the sea of Chilo√© and other marine basins. At times the ice reached all the way across to the foot of the Chilean Coast Range in Chilo√©. This meant that the region south of 41.5¬∞ S was subject to a proper ice sheet glaciation during large glacier advances. In contrast during times of glacier advance Andean valley glaciers entering the Chilean Central Valley in the Chilean Lake District (39‚Äì41.5¬∞ S) spread out forming large but separate glacier lobes, meaning that the glaciation remained restricted by topography being a glaciation of valley glaciers, or in other words one of Alpine type. In the Chilean Lake District and Chilo√© large outwash plains formed during the Llanquihue glaciation occupies positions between Llanquihue moraines and moraines of the older Santa Mar√≠a glaciation. At present these outwashs contain a distinctive √±adi type soil and vegetation. In the Atacama Desert high mountains (>5000) have remained ice-free through the whole Quaternary period. Similarly the dry areas east of the Andes in Patagonia were not glaciated but developed periglacial features like ice wedges, patterned ground, pingos, rock glaciers, palsas, soil cryoturbation, solifluction deposits during the Llanquihue glaciation. The coast of Chile north of 42¬∞ S and most of the Chilean Coast Range remained glacier-free and parts of it also free from periglaciation though the glaciation. Yet, small glaciers existed in the highest part of the Chilean Coast Range. Above altitudes of 100 m (Cordillera Piuch√©n) or 600 m (Cordillera de Nahuelbuta) soils in the Chilean Coast Range were disturbed by solifluction (a periglacial process). Between 41 and 37¬∞ S, the coastal region, the lower slopes of the Chilean Coast Range, and the westernmost Chilean Central Valley remained free of disturbance by the glacial, glacifluvial and periglacial meaning these regions (in particular around Cordillera de Nahuelbuta) served as refugia for Valdivian temperate rainforest. Development of the glaciation Palynological analysis in Chilo√© reveal the existence of at least three warm periods, or interstadials, during the Llanquihue glaciation. One interstadial begun 57,000 years before present (yrs BP) and ended no later than 49.000 yrs BP, another that begun 50,000 yrs BP and ended no later than 47,000 yrs BP and a third one from 45,000 to 35,000 yrs BP. During the interstadials of the glaciation the conifers Fitzroya and Pilgerodendron had much greater geographical extent than at present growing during that time in the Chilean Central Valley at latitudes between 41¬∞ and 43¬∞ S. Between 30 and 40¬∞ S glaciers reached their maximum advance about 40 to 35 ka BP, exceeding any extent they had during the global Last Glacial Maximum. Compared to the Llanquihue and Chilo√© area maximum glacier advance was achieved much earlier in Torres del Paine and √öltima Esperanza Sound (51-52¬∞ S) where glaciation peaked about 48,000 years ago. There is evidence for five westward advances of glacier lobes in the southern Chilean Lake District and Chilo√© (40‚Äì42.5¬∞ S). These advances occurred at ~33,600, ~30,800, ~26,900, ~26,000 and 17,700‚Äì18,100 years before present. =Last Glacial Maximum= During the Last Glacial Maximum valley glaciers merged and descended from the Andes occupying lacustrine and marine basins where they spread out forming large piedmont glacier lobes. Glaciers extended about 7 km west of the modern Llanquihue Lake but not more than 2 to 3 km south of it. Nahuel Huapi Lake in Argentina was also glaciated by the same time. Over most Chilo√© glacier advance peaked in 26,000 yrs BP forming a long north‚Äìsouth moraine system along the eastern coast of Chilo√© Island. Even between neighboring glacier lobes maximum glacier extent was not synchronous; as the glacier occupying the Puyhue basin (40¬∞41' S) was retreating calving at a proglacial Puyehue Lake the glacier at Rupanco basin (40¬∞49' S) was at its maximum extent. Despite glacier advances much of the area west of Llanquihue Lake was still ice-free during the Last Glacial Maximum. During the coldest period of the Last Glacial Maximum vegetation at this location was dominated by Alpine herbs in wide open surfaces. The global warming that followed caused a slow change in vegetation towards a sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by Nothofagus species. Within this parkland vegetation Magellanic moorland alternated with Nothofagus forest, and as warming progressed even warm-climate trees begun to grow in the area. It is estimated that the tree line was depressed about 1000 m relative to present day elevations during the coldest period, but it rose gradually until 19,300 yr BP. At that time a cold reversal caused a replacement of much of the arboreal vegetation with Magellanic moorland and Alpine species. Little is known about the extent of glaciers during Last Glacial Maximum north of the Chilean Lake District. To the north, in the dry Andes of Central and the Last Glacial Maximum is associated with increased humidity and the verified advance of at least some mountain glaciers. A study of the cushion grass Oreobolus obtusangulus suggest that this plant survived glaciation in three glacial refugia; these being south-central Chile, the eastern Patagonian Andes and eastern Tierra del Fuego. =Deglaciation= Rapid warming started 17,800 years before present leading to interglacial temperatures within 1000 years accompanied by the retreat of glaciers and the rapid colonization of Nothofagus dombeyi and the subsequent development of Valdivian temperate rainforest in the formerly glaciated area. Magellanic moorland species that had thrived in unglaciated areas during the 19,300‚Äì17,800 ka BP cold interval were largely wiped out as conditions changed from hyper-humid to humid. The deglaciation pulse that begun in 17,800 was paralleled by similar events in New Zealand. After the general Late Glacial Maximum a new pulse of glacier advance occurred about 14,850 ka BP. At this point the Golfo Corcovado lobe (ca. 43¬∞ S) exceeded any extent it had in the last 30,000 ka BP. Other lobes advanced inside the limits of their earlier Late Glacial Maximum extent. Deglaciation was almost complete after ice-lobes collapsed rapidly after 14,000 ka BP. The Magellanic moorland vegetation around Llanquihue Lake was replaced by North Patagonian Rain Forest including Myrtaceae, Nothofagus dombeyi, Fitzroya cupressoides and Lomatia. Further warming is thought to have caused conifer forest, including Fitzroya cupressoides, to lose ground to other vegetation types over much of the lowlands and obtaining its modern discontinuous distribution in the cool heights of the Chilean Coast Range and the Andes. As glaciers retreated the volcanoes of the Southern Volcanic Zone in the Chilean Lake District underwent transition from high production rates of volcanic ash and pyroclasts from explosive eruptions to a period of lower ash and pyroclast production associated with a change in magma type from felsic to mafic. Subsequently, felsic magmatism and explosive eruption resumed. All of this has been thought to be linked to changes in the stress field of the volcanoes and their plumbing system caused by unloading of ice. As deglaciation proceeded faster in the north there is an apparent lag in the onset of this behavior among volcanoes. The period of less explosive volcanism spanned from about 17‚Äì4 ka BP in Villarrica (39¬∞25' S), 10‚Äì2 ka BP in Mocho- Choshuenco (39¬∞55' S), 6‚Äì2 ka BP in Puyehue-Cord√≥n Caulle (40¬∞35' S) and Calbuco (41¬∞20' S). Various ephemeral proglacial lakes existed during the deglaciation including Paleolake Tehuelche in Torres del Paine (51¬∞ S).

Beaver Lake, now drained, was one of the largest lakes in Indiana. It was a shallow lake covering tens of thousands of acres and did not exceed fifteen feet in depth. Beaver Lake was home and/or water supply for scores of species of fish, waterfowl and mammals. Among the animals native to the area was a healthy Bald Eagle population . Before the settlement of Newton County, Indiana it provided food, furs and shelter for Native Americans. During Indiana's frontier days the lake continued to provide food and furs for the early settlers. Thanks to its remoteness, criminals were known to hideout at the infamous Bogus Island located on the Lake. In 1853, a ditch connecting it to the nearby Kankakee River was dug and the process of draining the lake began. Until the lake was drained and the river was dredged, the Kankakee River and Beaver Lake were part of North America's largest inland swamp. It took a little over twenty years to completely drain the lake. Once it was drained the land was converted to farmland. The land was farmed until the late 1990s. At that time the Nature Conservancy purchased 7,200 acres in and around the Beaver Lake basin and began restoring the area to native prairie.

The National Grid is the high-voltage electricity transmission network in mainland India, connecting power stations and major substations and ensuring that electricity generated anywhere in mainland India can be used to satisfy demand elsewhere. The National Grid is owned, and maintained by state-owned Power Grid Corporation of India and operated by state-owned Power System Operation Corporation. It is one of the largest operational synchronous grids in the world with 371.054 GW of installed power generation capacity as of 30 June 2020. India's grid is connected as a wide area synchronous grid nominally running at 50 Hz. The permissible range of the frequency band is 49.95-50.05 Hz, effective 17 September 2012. The Union Government regulates grid frequency by requiring States to pay more when they draw power at low frequencies. There are also synchronous interconnections to Bhutan, and asynchronous links with Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Nepal. An undersea interconnection to Sri Lanka (India‚ÄìSri Lanka HVDC Interconnection) has also been proposed. A proposed interconnection between Myanmar and Thailand would facilitate the creation of a power pool and enable trading among all BIMSTEC nations. History India began utilizing grid management on a regional basis in the 1961. Individual State grids were interconnected to form 5 regional grids covering mainland India. The grids were the Northern, Eastern, Western, North Eastern and Southern Grids. These regional links were established to enable transmission of surplus electricity between States in each region. In the 1990s, the Indian government began planning for a national grid. Regional grids were initially interconnected by asynchronous HVDC back- to-back links facilitating limited exchange of regulated power. The links were subsequently upgraded to high capacity synchronous links. The first interconnection of regional grids was established in October 1991 when the North Eastern and Eastern grids were interconnected. The Western Grid was interconnected with the aforementioned grids in March 2003. The Northern grid was also interconnected in August 2006, forming a Central Grid synchronously connected operating at one frequency. The sole remaining regional grid, the Southern Grid, was synchronously interconnected to the Central Grid on 31 December 2013 with the commissioning of the 765 kV Raichur-Solapur transmission line, thereby establishing the National Grid. Territories outside the grid The union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep are not connected to the National Grid. Both territories are archipelagos located far away from the mainland. Due to the geography and topography of these islands, including separation by sea over great distances, there is no single power grid for all the electrified islands in the archipelago. The power generation and distribution systems of these territories is served by standalone systems, with each electrified island in the archipelago having its own generation and distribution system. Power stations cater independently to the power requirements of an area. The Electricity Department of Andaman and Nicobar (EDA&N;) and the Lakshadweep Electricity Department (LED) are responsible for generation, transmission and distribution systems in these territories. Inter regional transmission capacity The inter regional total transmission capacity (TTC) is 75,050 MW as on 31 March 2017. However the available transmission capacity (ATC) on daily basis is not exceeding 35% of TTC and the actual usage is around 25%. Due to inter regional transmission constraints, the cost of power purchases by every region in IEX is not always equal. MoP has introduced a policy for nationwide single merit order power purchases from IEX to avoid costly power purchases by the Discoms. Cross border transmission links India began cross-border electricity trade in the mid-1980s. India established 33 kV and 132 kV interconnections in radial mode from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to Bhutan and Nepal respectively. The first interconnection with Bangladesh was commissioned in December 2013, connecting Baharampur with Bheramara. As of April 2017, there are 12 cross-border interconnections between India and Nepal. India became a net exporter of electricity for the first time in the 2016-17 fiscal year. Presently, India is importing electricity from Bhutan with synchronous transmission links while exporting power to Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar with asynchronous transmission links between the National Grid, and the electricity grids of these countries.

In February 1944, she became the first person to conceive human life outside of the body. Menkin was born on August 8, 1901, in Riga, Latvia. Her family moved to the United States two years later. Her father worked as a doctor in New York City and was successful enough to let her family live comfortably. In 1922, Menkin graduated from Cornell University with an undergraduate degree in histology and comparative anatomy. She attended Columbia University for her graduate program and earned a master's degree in genetics only one year after graduating from Cornell. She taught biology and physiology for a short period while setting her sights on medical school. However, women were rarely admitted to medical school at the time and she was not accepted. Menkin married Valy Menkin, a Harvard medical student, in 1924. She still intended to earn a Ph.D. in biology, but she needed to provide financial support while her husband finished medical school. Thus, she obtained a second undergraduate degree in secretarial studies from Simmons College. Menkin ended up finishing the Harvard Ph.D. requirements two separate times but did not receive a degree because she could not afford the course fees. Menkin and Valy had two children: a son named Gabriel and a daughter named Lucy.  Early research (1930‚Äì1938)  Following a few years of work as a secretary, Menkin served as a pathology research fellow at Harvard Medical School from 1930 to 1935. She was then offered a job as a laboratory technician for Gregory Pincus at Harvard. While working for Pincus, Menkin was tasked with preparing extracts designed to superovulate rabbits in Pincus' quest to create \\"fatherless\\" rabbits. Pincus lost his tenure at Harvard in 1937, which left her without a job. She worked in the state laboratories of Massachusetts for a year and then applied for a research position with John Rock, a fertility doctor, at the Free Hospital for Women (now part of Brigham and Women's Hospital) in Boston. Pincus' rabbit experiments had been a factor in Rock's decision to start IVF research, and Menkin's role in the experiments caught Rock's eye. Rock soon hired Menkin and they set out to determine the exact time at which ovulation would occur. Rock had come up with the idea but had not made any meaningful progress in laboratory research before hiring Menkin. He did not have an advanced understanding of the technical aspects of egg fertilization and hired Menkin to oversee all of the laboratory work.  IVF research and discovery (1938‚Äì1944)  Menkin began the IVF experiments in March 1938. Rock and Menkin requested that the women participating in the study, who were scheduled to undergo hysterectomies, have unprotected sex prior to the surgery. They elected to carry out the surgical procedures just before the patient would ovulate, which gave them many suitable ova for the study. Over the course of the study, Menkin followed a fairly steady weekly schedule: find eggs on Tuesday, add sperm on Wednesday, pray on Thursday, and observe the outcome using a microscope on Friday. She made variations to the procedure every so often, altering the conditions the eggs were kept in and the length and concentration of the sperm samples. Menkin would find the unfertilized eggs in the ovaries that Rock removed from the patients, put the eggs in the solution, and then culture them before adding sperm. In the first 6 years of the study, Menkin tried many different strategies but did not achieve IVF. On February 3, 1944, she obtained an egg from a woman whose cervix and uterus prolapsed following the birth of four children. Menkin's standard protocol was to wash the sperm sample 3 times in solution and let the egg and sperm interact for 30 minutes. However, she had stayed up with her newborn daughter the night before, and on that day she mistakenly washed the sperm sample only once, used a more concentrated sample, and allowed one hour of interaction. The following Friday morning (February 6, 1944), Menkin found that cell cleavage had begun, which indicated that a fertilized egg had formed. Menkin neglected to take an immediate photograph of the discovery, and she could not find the egg when she finally went to get a picture. She was able to fertilize and photograph three more eggs, involving all three factors that she had altered before the original discovery. Rock and Menkin achieved two and three cell development in their successful fertilizations. After the additional eggs were fertilized successfully, Rock and Menkin elected to publish their work in a brief report. Science magazine published their findings in the article ‚ÄúIn Vitro Fertilization and Cleavage of Human Ovarian Eggs\\" on August 4, 1944. The Associated Press, The New York Times, and Time magazine ran accounts of the discovery in the following days.  Public reaction to discovery  Rock and Menkin's discovery was largely viewed by the public as a positive breakthrough that would help infertile couples have children. However, some critics saw it as playing God and interfering with the laws of nature, and because Rock and Menkin did not create a physical baby, others questioned if they had achieved in vitro fertilization at all. Rock and Menkin did not attempt to transfer their fertilized eggs into a woman's body after their achievement because it was not the goal of their study. The difficult task of transforming a multi-cell fertilized egg, like the one Menkin and Rock had created, into an embryo that could grow inside a woman's uterus was not successful until the birth of Louise Brown in 1978.  Later years  At the time Science ran the article, Valy had recently been fired by Harvard and the Menkins had been forced to relocate to North Carolina. Menkin was able to stay in touch with Rock and work on additional publications. The full report of the discovery, in which Menkin was listed as the lead author, was finally published in 1948 with the same title, \\"In Vitro Fertilization and Cleavage of Human Ovarian Eggs\\", in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. In the years before this, Menkin sought to continue IVF research on her own, but her opportunities were limited and unpaid. Menkin divorced her husband in 1949. Supporting and caring for her daughter, Lucy, who had epilepsy, further limited her opportunities to do laboratory research. In 1950 she returned to Boston to enroll her in a special school and accepted an offer to return to Rock's laboratory. IVF research had ceased in Rock's lab since Menkin had departed, as he had been unable to find another scientist with the technical skill to continue Menkin's work. She attempted to revitalize it when she returned, but by that time Rock had shifted his primary focus to research on the birth control pill and Menkin was only able to work on IVF for a short time. She continued to work in Rock's lab, assisting him with his research and publications on contraception, but never received another opportunity to pursue IVF. Menkin died on June 8, 1992, in Boston, Massachusetts.

W. Bush and (briefly) Bill Clinton. He also served on the President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic. Early life and education Burton James Lee III was born on March 28, 1930, in Manhattan, New York City, New York, to Burton J. Lee II and his wife, the former Rosamond Saltonstall Auchincloss. He and his twin sister, Rosamond Saltonstall Lee, were the eldest of four children born to the couple.; His other siblings were Susannah (born 1932) and Mary Josephine (born 1937). His parents, who wed in New York City on June 20, 1929, were important members of high society. His father was a banker, and his mother a member of one of the most prominent families of New England. His paternal grandfather, Burton James Lee, had been an oncologist and the first clinical director at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center after its relocation. His childhood idol was his maternal grandfather, Charles Auchincloss. As a youth, Lee attended the Buckley School on New York City's Upper East Side, and then graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He entered Yale University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1952. While at Yale, he became close friends with Jonathan Bush, George H. W. Bush's younger brother, and with Nicholas F. Brady, the future Secretary of the Treasury under George H. W. Bush. This led to a close friendship with George H. W. Bush. He received his M.D. from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1956. Lee interned at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. About 1945 or 1946, Rosamond and Burton Lee, Jr. divorced. Rosamond married Thomas Campbell Plowden-Wardlaw, a prominent New York attorney, on July 2, 1954, and died on November 4, 1971. Burton Lee, Jr. married Margaret DeWolf Erskine on January 11, 1947. The couple had four children (Jared E., Timothy M., Marion Rogers, and Cecelia DeWolf), leaving Lee a large, extended family of seven siblings. Burton J. Lee, Jr. died suddenly of a heart attack in July 1962, while step-mother Margaret Erskine Lee died in 2005. Career Lee joined the medical staff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in 1960. In 1961, Lee enlisted in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, and served for two years in West Germany. Leaving the Army in 1963, he volunteered for Medico International, and spent time in Algeria administering to refugees, people injured in the country's civil war, and victims of torture. Returning to the United States, Lee rejoined the staff at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where he worked as an oncologist and chemotherapist. He took a special interest in treating patients suffering from Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, and lymphoma, and oversaw the treatment of more than 1,500 patients. By 1989, he had risen to become senior attending physician at the Hospital for Allied Diseases at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Lee became well known for having unorthodox views on Hodgkin's disease. He argued that while the cancer could be put into remission, the cause of the illness was poorly understood and the damage to the immune system remained untreated. His views were so controversial that Memorial Sloan-Kettering officials barred him from talking to the National Cancer Institute for 10 years. Lee was a prolific author, having contributed to or solely-authored more than 120 articles and medical books by 1989. In the fall of 1988, Lee published an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in which he attacked the medical profession for putting greed ahead of patients by ordering too many tests. He also accused physicians of neglecting patient care while using patients for research, and advocated changes to medical practice laws to allow physician assistants and registered nurses to perform some medical procedures and assessments currently prohibited to them. The article was widely debated within the profession, and generated a back-and-forth discussion in the journal's letters page between Lee and his critics. =1987 AIDS commission= On July 23, 1987, through his connections with then-Vice President Bush, Lee was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the President's Commission on the HIV Epidemic. Lee himself said that, as the panel's only practicing physician, \\"I was going to die before I let that commission fail...\\" Lee personally reviewed much of the medical literature on HIV and AIDS, and insisted that the commission visit AIDS patients in hospitals and hospices. Aware of how cancer patients are often discriminated against, Lee was greatly disturbed by the much greater discrimination AIDS patients faced. He was particularly moved by the plight of Ryan White, a boy who became infected with HIV while receiving treatment for his hemophilia. Dr. Frank Lilly, a geneticist and openly gay member of the commission, described Lee as a \\"receptive learner\\" on HIV and AIDS issues, even though his only experience with AIDS had been the treatment of HIV-infected individuals who had cancer, and commission executive director Polly Gault said Lee played a critical role in overcoming divisions among commission members and in drafting its final report. Lee cast the critical vote in approving the commission's report, which passed 7-to-6. Lee was widely viewed as helping to turn the commission away from being a rubber stamp for anti-gay conservative views and toward championing improved research on HIV/AIDS and treatment of AIDS patients. Lee later credited the militant HIV/AIDS group ACT UP with making many positive contributions to the commission's work. =Physician to the President= Through his friendships with Jonathan Bush and Nicholas F. Brady, Lee became a close friend of George H. W. Bush. Lee's stepdaughter and Bush's daughter, Dorothy, were roommates at Boston College. Elected President of the United States in 1988, George H. W. Bush considered appointing Lee to be Surgeon General of the United States, but Lee's support for abortion rights was incompatible with Bush's position and he was not nominated for the position.; Bush also considered Lee for the role of Special Assistant to the President for Health Policy, but once more Lee's abortion views cost him the job. Lee was also under consideration for the position of Commissioner of Food and Drugs after the Bush administration became dissatisfied with Food and Drug Administrator Dr. Frank Young. But Bush chose Dr. David A. Kessler for the position instead. President Bush appointed Lee to be Physician to the President on March 8, 1989. Colleagues counseled him against taking the position, noting that many previous Physicians to the President had been pressured into keeping presidential illnesses a secret, damaging their reputations as doctors. Lee, however, told Bush that he would resign if told to conceal a serious medical issue. Lee subsequently attended an April 1989 meeting at which Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle discussed the conditions under which Bush might invoke the 25th Amendment. Lee oversaw a staff of 16 (which included four physicians) while director of the White House Medical Unit. Lee was assisted by Colonel Lawrence C. Mohr, Jr., MD (a United States Army expert in emergency care) in providing White House healthcare. Lee had a close doctor-patient relationship with President Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush, and Lee and his wife often spent weekends with the Bushes at Camp David. Beginning in 1989, Lee prescribed the powerful drug Halcion to help President Bush sleep while traveling. Lee said Bush took the drug \\"rarely\\" over the next three years, but even so Lee's prescription of the drug was controversial. Lee's April 1990 report on President Bush's health was overwhelmingly positive. But in 1991, Bush was hospitalized for three days after suffering from shortness of breath while jogging. Lee diagnosed Bush with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid and which had caused Bush to suffer from an irregular heartbeat. Lee was criticized for not diagnosing the disease earlier. Lee also treated Bush for intestinal flu after the president vomited and collapsed during a dinner at the home of the Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in January 1992.; Bush had ignored Lee's advice to skip the dinner. Lee was criticized by a number of American physicians for the treatment Lee administered, with several arguing the president should have been hospitalized. Lee also served as an informal advisor to Bush on a wide range of health policy issues. Lee and Bush spoke on the telephone on an almost daily basis about a wide range of health topics. When Bush solicited Lee's advice about specific policy issues, Lee would reply with a written memorandum. The Washington Post quoted unnamed White House insiders as saying that Lee's policy views were \\"inconsequential\\" and that Lee was \\"out of the loop\\". Lee was active on HIV and AIDS issues throughout the Bush administration. Lee was able to convince Bush to appoint an HIV-infected individual to the National Commission on AIDS. Lee met with a delegation of AIDS activists in the summer of 1989, and agreed to promote journalist Belinda Mason, who had become infected with HIV while receiving blood transfusions during the birth of a child. Mason later said Lee was surprised when Bush appointed her to the commission. The news media said that AIDS activists believe it was Lee who convinced Bush to make a March 29, 1989, speech condemning discrimination against people with HIV and AIDS, and that Lee helped make the HIV/AIDS nondiscrimination provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act palatable to the administration. Lee also helped lobby for an end to immigration laws barring individuals with HIV/AIDS from visiting the United States, and he often accompanied First Lady Barbara Bush when she visited children and young adults with AIDS. Lee had serious disagreements with John H. Sununu, Bush's White House Chief of Staff, over a wide range of health policy issues which news media attributed to Lee's low level of influence on administration policy. In November 1989, Bush appointed Lee to the newly-created Presidential Drug Advisory Council, whose mission was to advise the President of the United States on ways to combat illegal drugs. Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in the U.S. presidential election of 1992. Lee agreed to stay on as Physician to the President, supervising Clinton's medical care, until Clinton appointed a new physician. Lee was abruptly fired on January 28, 1993, before a new physician had been named after he refused to inject the president with an unknown medication. Lee was told the medication was for Clinton's allergies, but no records verifying the contents of the vial could be produced. =Post-White House work= After leaving the White House, Lee moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where he became administrator of the Greenville Health System and established the system's first comprehensive cancer treatment program. In the late 1990s, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where he was a member of the board of directors of the Marine Biological Laboratory. Lee retired and lived briefly on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, before moving to Vero Beach, Florida. He served as chairman of the Indian River County Hospital District, and on the board of directors of the Whole Family Health Center. He also co-founded Alcohope, a nonprofit alcohol recovery center. In 2005, Lee authored an editorial in The Washington Post in which he condemned military medical personnel who participated in the torture of individuals taken prisoner during the War on Terror. Personal life and death Burton Lee III married Pauline Herzog in 1953. Their marriage ended in divorce. The couple had three children: Chip, Jackie, and Roz. Lee then married Ann Kelly, and was step- father to her three children from her first marriage: Debbie, Wendy, and Leigh. Lee died of bladder cancer at his home in Vero Beach on November 25, 2016. He was survived by his wife Ann, and all six children.

Vladimir Petrovsky later analyzed this intense period in his memoirs. =The Helsinki Final Act= Vladimir Petrovsky was strongly involved in researching and drafting all the details of the Soviet delegation's position towards the Helsinki Process followed by the Helsinki Final Act (The Helsinki Accords). It was signed during July and 1 August 1975 and became at the time a declaration of attempt to improve relations between the Communist bloc and the West. The Helsinki Accords served as the groundwork for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE). =Perestroika= Before announcing Perestroika in 1987, the Soviet government had done a multi-level research and analytical work accomplished by both the political and academical elite.

In 1993, Vladimir Petrovsky became the Secretary-General of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva, the organization for which he had helped to develop the rules of conduct earlier in 1978. Under his chairmanship the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva was able to negotiate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, signed in 1996.

His best known over the years as translator is Stalin: An Appraisal of the Man and His Influence by Leon Trotsky (1941) for which Soviet communists attacked him as a Trotskyite in the 1940s and Trotskyites attacked him as an anticommunist in the 2010s. Background Charles Leo Malamuth (or Goodman) was born on November 9, 1899, in Lodz, Poland (then part of the Russian Empire). His father was Leo Goodman and mother Cipa (also Celia) Broder. Career =Linguist= Malamuth was assistant to Eugene Lyons (here, 1940) in Moscow In the 1920s, Malamuth was a professor in the Slavonic Department at the University of California, Berkeley. Malamuth served as assistant to Eugene Lyons during the latter's stay there as Moscow bureau chief for United Press. On November 22, 1930, he accompanied Lyons to their historic interview with Joseph Stalin. =Humanitarian= Malamuth worked for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (1914 telegram that prompted the Joint Distribution Committee's formation) In 1947, he was director of European Public Relations in Paris for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. Around 1950, he left Paris to join Radio Free Europe in Frankfurt, Voice of America, and Radio Liberty. In 1953, the Communist Party of France attacked him in its newspaper :fr:Ce Soir by calling him \\"un fid√©le de Trotsky\\" (\\"a Trotsky loyalist\\") and citing the support from Lyons and him for Victor Kravchenko during the latter's trial in France for his book I Chose Freedom (1949), which exposed the GULAG system in the USSR. Ce Soir \\"accused\\" Malamuth of translating the first 500 pages of Kravchenko's famous book. Further, the newspaper accused Malamuth of close association with the \\"Trotskyite Max Eastman\\" and of Isaac Don Levine. Further, his visitors in Paris included ex-CP members Jay Lovestone and Benjamin Gitlow. Further, he was known to have visited the US Embassy in Paris weekly (i.e., implying that he was an American spy). Lastly, he had worked for the American Joint Distribution Committee (\\"Jewish welfare agency\\"), which the CP USSR had accused of \\"engineering\\" the \\"Doctors Plot.\\" Life Joan London, seen here on the right with her Jack London and sister (circa 1905) On December 20, 1925, in Sacramento, California, Malamuth married Joan London, daughter of American novelist and socialist Jack London. It was her second marriage. They divorced in 1930, moved to Moscow remarried, separated in 1934, and divorced finally in 1935. By 1950, he had married again to Renee Malamuth. He corresponded with Max Eastman, Eugene Lyons, Adolphe Menjou, and Lev Trotsky as well as Ilya Ehrenburg, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Aleksei Tolstoi, and Evgeny Zamyatin. Other friends and acquaintances included Isaac Don Levine. He died in Los Angeles on July 14, 1965. Legacy: Trotsky's Stalin (2016) Malamuth's translation of Leon Trotsky's book on Joseph Stalin received heavy criticism from Trotskyist Alan Woods in the 2010s While Stalinist communist parties called Malamuth a Trotskyist, Trotskyists considered him an Anti- Communist‚Äìand still do to this day. Case in point ‚Äì In 2016, Wellred Books published a new translation of Trotsky's biography Stalin by Alan Woods. For this new translation, Woods consulted not only Harvard University library archives (which holds Trotsky's papers for the book) but also French and Russian translations. It contains 100,000 words more than the 1940 translation. Also, the new translated presents \\"Malamuth's political distortions removed.\\" Robert Sewell of In Defense of Marxism has criticized Malamuth strongly. He has written, \\"Whatever Malamuth's talents, this was a political task for which he was completely unsuited.\\" Trotsky was unhappy with Malamuth because he had shown his unfinished translations to others (specifically Max Shachtman and James Burnham). For this indiscretion, Trotsky was soon blaming him further: \\"He does not know Russian; he does not know English; and he is tremendously pretentious.\\" In video, he explained about Malamuth: > Clearly, he wasn't in the political state in order the carry out his > particular task. He wasn't qualified enough to carry out this particular > task. Therefore, he introduced into this later edited version a lot of > material that he had decided to supplement to Trotsky's work. These > supplements, these additions clearly went against the general thrust of > Trotsky's political thought... Natalia Trotsky... wanted to take out the > material that had been put in by Malamuth, that should be replaced by > Trotsky's own writing... Malamuth had given the excuse that a lot of it was > repetition... The main thing also he said that the transcripts had been > damaged in the assassination attack in 1940, and some of the material was in > disrepair... There wasn't any damage whatsoever... and files deliberately > left out of the book... A vast number of words had been left out... an extra > 100,000 words. Malamuth's text of about 10,000 were taken out. Ultimately, Sewell concedes a simpler explanation: \\"Following Trotsky's death, the American publishers (Harper and Brothers), who owned the rights to the book, placed Malamuth in charge, not only of the translation, but of 'editing' the final book. For them, this was simply a commercial calculation to salvage the book following the author's death.\\" In other words, \\"Trotsky's views did not enter into their calculations.\\" Given Malamuth's career, it seems clear that Sewell's assessment ‚Äì that translation of Trotksy's Stalin was \\"a political task for which he was completely unsuited\\" ‚Äì signal to fellow Trotskyists to Malamuth's career as anti-communist.

Context King discusses his childhood growing up among loving parents but at times an abusive father, and their shared love for fishing. His father was alcoholic, and he also has had to deal with alcoholism in his adult life. King speaks highly of his teacher Robert E. Jones at John Muir High School, who was openly gay. He discusses his descent into addiction and alcoholism and his run-ins with the law, including when he was stopped and beaten by Los Angeles Police officers. This event was videotaped by a bystander, and carried on national news. There was outrage when the officers were acquitted of charges of excessive force. King reflects on his multicultural heritage. He said that he did not want the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the acquittal of the officers at trial. King reflects his reluctance as a civil rights icon, after a federal trial in which two of the officers were convicted. The city of LA made a settlement with him, paying damages.

She has been recognized on a stamp in the 2011 series \\"Pioneers in our History\\" and in 2015 was posthumously honored with the National Heroes Award. Her home has been the focus of a restoration project for the National Trust‚Äôs West Bay Committee. Early life Irksie Leila Yates was born on 19 August 1899 in the West Bay District on Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands to Jacintha (n√©e Morrison) and Arthur Yates. Yates was the youngest of six children and though she enjoyed playing on the beaches as a child, was asthmatic. Hers was the first house on the island to have glass panes installed. Encouraged by her sister, Yates wanted to study nursing, but her mother objected. Determined to become a nurse, she walked daily from West Bay to George Town for her training. Her initial studies began in 1917 with Dr. George Overton, the only doctor on the island. Career By 1919, Yates had completed her training and began as a home care nurse, traveling to her patients' homes to assist with their needs. In 1921, she began studying midwifery and completed her training in 1923, when she delivered her first baby. During the malaria epidemic in 1931, Yates served as head government nurse. Because there was no government hospital, almost all of her care services before 1952 when the Cayman Hospital was built, were provided in her patient's homes. In 1959 Yates opened a private nursing clinic in her home in West Bay and continued to see patients in her home or their own homes. In her later years, she worked as a reporter writing a regular column \\"This Week in West Bay\\" for the newspaper, Caymanian Weekly. Yates retired in 1971, having delivered more than 1,000 babies. Death and legacy Yates died on 12 January 1996. In 2006, her home was purchased by the National Trust of the Cayman Islands to honor her achievements in nursing and preserve the culturally significant building, as the National Trust's only original wattle and daub dwelling. In 2011, Yates was recognized with a stamp depicting her likeness as a part of the series \\"Pioneers in our History\\". In 2015 she was honored at the National Heroes Awards ceremony, recognizing Caymanians who helped to develop health services for the Islands.

The project was announced in July 2008, a prototype first flew on 21 November 2016, although Stratos currently lacks the funding to complete type certification. Predominantly made of carbon composite, the single turbofan aircraft would seat four to six at over up to . Development Chief technology officer Carsten Sundin launched the VLJ project with CEO Michael Lemaire, aiming for higher speed and range than competitors. Sundin joined Lancair in 1993 after graduating and became engineering manager on the Lancair Legacy 2000. In 2003 he joined Epic Aircraft to become engineering manager on its new single turboprop and met the aerodynamicist of the Farnborough F1, Gordon Robinson. Farnborough Aircraft and Epic formed a joint venture to develop the smaller kit Epic LT along the FAR-23 certificated F1, sharing their wing, engine and tail, and Sundin Left Epic in 2005. The project was unveiled on 16 July 2008, touted as an owner- flown Very Light Personal Jet. A cabin mock-up was shown at AirVenture in July 2009. At that time the company predicted the jet would sell for about US$2M. The company was seeking US$12M to build two prototypes and a further US$100M to complete certification and commence production. The company CEO, Michael Lemaire, indicated in 2009 that the aircraft will fill a performance niche, as there is no other four seat aircraft with the 714's speed and range. The company was accepting refundable customer deposits of US$50,000 to be held in interest-bearing escrow in 2009. The first deposit was made by Cascade Air Charter, of Bend, Oregon in October 2009. First flight of a proof of concept aircraft was achieved on 21 November 2016 before a public introduction at AirVenture in July 2017, with no firm schedule for certification. It is registered as N403KT. In February 2017 prototype flight testing continued. The company did not have the funding to complete certification, and was no longer accepting deposits from customers. Stratos CEO Michael Lemaire indicated at that time, \\"we are privately funded for the prototype phase, during which we are planning to explore the full flight envelope and draw conclusions for the certification stage. We are not yet funded for the certification phase. At present, we have no plan to take deposits towards deliveries, which are still many years away.\\" While investment is sufficient for an additional prototype and to finish flight testing, certification would need in the range of at least $200 million. Stratos estimates type certification would need $100-150 million, but this could triple, and considers as an intermediate step selling aircraft kits needing a $200-400 thousand JT15D-5 with a few hundred hours before TBO. Production aircraft with a $900,000 PW535E are targeted for $3-3.5 million, 50% more than a Cirrus SF50 but competitive with $4.5-5 million twin very light jets with its , range, full fuel payload and consuming only cruising at FL410, while used aircraft at this price have lower efficiency, dispatch reliability and inferior technology. By July 2018, the 714 prototype had flown 185 flight hours, reaching 25,000 feet and 370 knots. The proof-of- concept aircraft had logged 250 hours by April 2019, and 330 hours by January 2020. =Stratos 716X= The 716X keeps the 714 general configuration but is stretched by 31 in (77.5 cm) to accommodate six seats In May 2018, after 170 hours of test flying, Stratos decided to stretch the fuselage by 31 in (77.5 cm) to better accommodate six adults with bags. The aircraft was to be named and unveiled in the third quarter of 2018, with a first flight likely in 2019. Powered by a PWC JT15D-5 with single-lever control, The 716X was unveiled at the July 2018 EAA AirVenture, to be available as a kit in the fourth quarter with a stretched and wider fuselage than the 714. Before production of a certified version in four to five years, Stratos intends to sell three kits per year. The kits will each take 2,500 hours to build, in the same manner as an Epic LT single turboprop. By April 2019, Stratos was building the fuselage for the first prototype. A full-scale cabin mock-up will be displayed at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in July. A PW535 will propel the certificated version, featuring Garmin G3000 or G5000 avionics. By January 2020, load testing had been completed, while the first prototype was being assembled. The company intends to conduct high-speed taxi tests in the second quarter, with first flight forecast for the second half of 2020. The company intends to start taking orders once flight testing is under way. Stratos forecasts a production rate of 30 to 50 aircraft per year. On July 2, 2020, the 716X made a 22 minute maiden flight from Redmond, Oregon, climbing to 13,500 ft and launching a flight-test program that will last several months. Design The aircraft design features a cantilever low-wing with winglets, a cruciform tail and retractable tricycle landing gear. The original four seater has an long, cabin, but following aircraft will be larger, with six seats. The airframe is built from Toray pre-preg carbon composites and nomex honeycomb sandwich, except the aft-center section, a fairing-covered moly steel cage supporting the turbofan for damage tolerance, in case of an uncontained engine failure. The wing has a thickness ratio of 14-16.5%, to allow for the main landing gear and of fuel per side ( total), double-slotted flaps and the supercritical airfoil maintains laminar flow on 50-55% of the upper surface. The engine is in-line with the center of mass to avoid thrust-pitch coupling. It employs a fuselage-top mount, its intakes outside the boundary layer. The aircraft is flown by sidesticks like Lancair aircraft or the Cessna TTx. The first prototype has an experimental Electronic International/Garmin flight deck, but production aircraft will have a Garmin G3000 cockpit. The pressurization provides a cabin altitude at its FL410 ceiling. The leading edge deicing boots allow flying in icing conditions. The prototype is powered by a single JT15D-5 taken from a Beechjet, but production versions will use a PW535E for 22-27% more high altitude thrust and 15% better TSFC.

The church is unique in several respects. It is built on a remote location, without any evidence of any artefacts in the surrounding area, apparently in a completely isolated place, with no signs of human habitation. Its architectural design has been described as executed on an \\"exceptionally high artistic level\\". Other unusual features include a double or twin-church design, an all-brick construction with the exception of its foundations, and sloping walls. It has been dated to around the late 10th to 11th centuries. The style of the church is double-nave basilica. It is located in the southern part of Kƒ±r≈üehir Province, near the village of Taburoƒülu, which is approximately six kilometres from the Yerk√∂y- Yozgat highway.  History  The ruins of the √ú√ßayak Byzantine Church as they appeared in 1900. The dome arches were destroyed in an earthquake in 1938. The Byzantine name of the location of the church is unknown. Proposed names include Justinianopolis, Pteria, and Mokissos. Near the church, there is a water spring, but the absence of any human artefacts in the vicinity indicates that the church was built on a completely isolated and uninhabited area. The remnants of the decorations of the facades, its sloping walls, and its architectural style led to its chronology being placed to late 10th or 11th centuries AD. The first report on the church was in 1842 by W. F. Ainsworth. His travel notes on the church were used by John Winter Crowfoot who visited the ruins in 1900, and were eventually published by Josef Strzygowski in 1903. The 1938 Kƒ±r≈üehir earthquake caused the dome arches of the church to collapse.  Architecture  The construction of the church, solely using bricks as the medium, is very unusual in Byzantine architecture. The church foundation was made of stone. In 1900, John Winter Crowfoot reports a pinkish external layer covering the brick walls. In-between the walls, base material, consisting of rubble, stones and other fillers, was used. The filler material was supported by a wooden-beam structure. =Double naves, apses and domes= √ú√ßayak Church in the background The church design is very unusual for Byzantine architecture. The church is constructed as a double-church featuring two naves adjacent to each other and separated by a wall. The naves were quadrangular and each featured a separate dome. The naves have a common narthex of an oblong shape. The twin church design at √ú√ßayak has two naves (naoi) each with a separate semi-circular apse. Each apse includes a rectangular bay in front of it. The double-church design is even more unusual because the two churches were constructed at the same time, as opposed to being built sequentially, which was the construction method employed more often for churches of this type. Scholars speculate that the double church was constructed either in honour of two distinct saints or martyrs, or because a Byzantine emperor and his wife built it; the latter explanation being more probable, since no crypts or other artefacts, attesting to the worship of saints or martyrs, have been found. =Niches= The exterior walls are decorated by arches that recess into the walls forming niches. The same technique had been used for the church of √áanlƒ±kilisse in Cappadocia and the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God in Nicaea (modern-day Iznik). The recessed arches and the all-brick wall construction of the √ú√ßayak church provided an impressive architectural element to its design. =Decorations= In 1900, John Winter Crowfoot reports faint traces of a fresco decorating a pendentive. Even at that time, it was difficult to discern any details of the theme of the fresco other than what appeared to be a series of heads with haloes. Crowfoot also reports that there were traces of two illegible inscriptions when he visited the site in 1900. The inscription may have contained clues as to the reason for building the church at such a completely isolated area. Restoration The church is a rare example of early Byzantine period architecture in Kƒ±r≈üehir Province, which is considered to be located within the area occupied by ancient Cappadocia, or at the border of the Byzantine provinces of Galatia and Cappadocia.

The village belongs to the borough of Ebermannstadt in the county of Forchheim in the south German state of Bavaria. All that survives is the southern part of the hill castle. As well as parts of the outer ward there is a tower house from the post-1632 period.  History  The castle is one of six that the Bishop of Bamberg, Otto I of Mistelbach (1102‚Äì1139), procured for the Bishopric of Bamberg in 1122. Nothing is known of its previous occupants or who built it. The next record of the castle comes from an appendix to the law book of the Bamberg bishop, Frederick of Hohenlohe (1342‚Äì1352). This notes that the Bishop of Bamberg, Leopold III of Bebenburg (1353‚Äì1363), paid 100 pounds of hellers to Conrad of Egloffstein for the maintenance of the castle. Between 1353 and 1359 the castle appears to have been an episcopal fief fully occupied by the lords of Egloffstein, whereby in the course of time, part of the castle became their freehold property. In 1522, Conrad XI of Egloffstein transferred the allodial part of the castle to Bamberg bishop, Georg III of Limpurg (1505‚Äì1522), as a fief. In 1525 the castle was razed during the Peasants' War, but was rebuilt by Conz of Egloffstein. On 8 July 1632, during the Thirty Years' War it was destroyed by Croatian troops. Exactly when it was rebuilt is not known. However, it is possible that only the southern part was rebuilt. In 1638 the lords of Egloffstein relinquished the castle from the episcopal fiefdom through an exchange. The Burggaillenreuther line of the lords of Egloffstein died out in 1682 with John (Hans) Philip II of Egloffstein. In 1684 the lords of Egloffstein sold their allodial part of the castle to Freiherr Karl Friedrich Voit von Rieneck. In 1810 Anton Joseph Freiherr von Horneck purchased the castle. In 1847 it was described as derelict. A renovation of the surviving buildings was carried out at that time by August Horneck von Weinheim. The castles is now in private ownership. The castle has nothing to do with the robber baron, Eppelein von Gailingen, who was hanged in 1381.  Literature  * Hellmut Kunstmann: Die Burgen der s√ºdwestlichen Fr√§nkischen Schweiz 2.

Several opposing parties had formed: first was that of Irene Palaiologina, supported by the Amytzantarantes family and her Byzantine mercenaries provided courtesy of her father, Andronikos III Palaiologos; second was of the opposing archons under the sebastos Tzanichites, the captain-general of the Scholarioi and a part of the imperial bodyguard loyal to the memory of the late Emperor Basil of Trebizond; the third party was that of the megas doux John the Eunuch, who held the fortress of Limnia; and the fourth was Anna Anachoutlou, who was backed by the Lazic nobility.Zehiroglu, Ahmet M. ; \\"Trabzon Imparatorlugu\\" 2016 () ; pp.159-210 History = Death of Basil = On 6 April 1340, after the death of Basil Grand Komnenos, the governance of the empire was assumed by Irene Palaiologina, the illegitimate daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos ( 1328‚Äì1341), and the lawful wife of Basil. Irene was suspected of having had some share in causing his death,Miller, W., Trebizond. The Last Greek Empire (London 1926), p. 46. and was prepared for the event, and had already organized movements of a party which placed her on the throne. After her ascent to the throne, Irene attempted to consolidate her power with the help of the Amytzantarioi and other notable aristocrats. However, the controversy between the Amytzantarioi and the Scholarioi, who at the time formed the two major parties of the local aristocracy, had become very complicated due to personal disputes. In the absence of an heir to the throne, as well as due to the inability of the empress to assert her authority, the two sides conflicted bitterly as they each intended to impose its sociopolitical beliefs.ŒõœÖŒºœÄŒµœÅœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ, B., O BœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩœåœÇ Œ†œåŒΩœÑŒøœÇ.

When the Scholarioi, who were supported by the Meizomates, Doranites, Kabasites and Kamachenos families, turned against the empress, the Amytzantarioi took sides with Irene and helped her gain control over the situation. Fortification plan of Trebizond In the subsequent civil war, Empress Irene was assisted by the Amytzantarioi; by the powerful party among the nobles, the Genoese, and by Byzantine mercenaries. The opposing rebels were the sebastos, megas stratopedarches and Tzanichites an aristocratic family. The captain-general of the Scholarioi, or city militia ‚Äî the imperial guard which remained faithful to the memory of the emperor Basil and a body of the people, who hated Irene as a Constantinopolitan stranger ‚Äî established themselves in possession of the great Monastery of St. Eugenios. This monastery then rose like a fortress over the ravine to the southeast of the capital. On the other hand, the empress managed to maintain control over the harbour and the citadel, helped by the Amytzantarios family. The revolt ended on 2 July 1340, when the megas doux, John the Eunuch, who had murdered the young emperor Manuel II, arrived at Trebizond from Constantinople to assist the empress. John‚Äôs forces joined the imperial troops and they jointly attacked the monastery of St. Eugenios, which was set on fire. The Scholarioi were defeated and their leaders were initially arrested and taken to the fortress of Limnia, while in the following year (July 1341) some of them were executed. It was evident that, without a husband who could wear the imperial crown, Irene could not hope to maintain her position long; Irene consoled herself for the delay by falling in love with the megas domestikos of her own empire. The favour this passion led her to confer on a few individuals divided her own court into factions, and afforded her old enemies, who had escaped the catastrophe at St Eugenia an opportunity of again taking up arms, so that a new storm burst on the head of the thoughtless empress. = Anna Anachoutlou = Another female now appeared to claim the throne, with a better title than Irene: Anna, called Anachoutlou, the eldest daughter of the emperor Alexios II, had taken the veil and until this time had lived in seclusion. The opposition persuaded her to quit her monastic dress and escape to Lazia, where she was crowned empress and gained control over the region, and all the Laz and the Tzan people,Bryer, A., ‚ÄòSome notes on the Laz and the Tzan (1) (2)‚Äô, in People and Settlement in Anatolia and the Caucasus, 800-1900 (VR, London 1988), pp. 161-168, 174-195. recognised her as the legal heir to the throne for being nearest legitimate heir of her brother Basil. So, on July 17, 1341, Anna entered Trebizond triumphantly, followed by Laz warriors of the Georgian King George V (1314-1346) as well as by Trapezuntine Laz of the bandon of Greater Lazia, and ascended to the throne. She was crowned empress, supported, on the one hand, by the Amytzantarios family and, on the other, by the Laz, the TzanOn the historical background of the Laz and the Tzan, see Bryer, A., ‚ÄúSome notes on the Laz and the Tzan (1) (2)‚Äù, in Bryer, A., People and Settlement in Anatolia and the Caucasus, 800-1900 (VR, London 1988), pp. 161-168 (=1), 174-195 (=2). They were native inhabitants of the northeastern Pontos, descending from the Colchians and the Macrones. They used to meddle in the political affairs of the Empire of Trebizond. and, in general, the people of the provinces of the Empire of Trebizond. the prevalence of the indigenous Amytzantarioi after Anna‚Äôs ascension to the throne had provoked continuous attempts by the opposing Scholarioi to overthrow her with the support of other noble families. The conflicts between the aristocratic families of Trebizond marked the reign of Anna, who was continuously under the threat of being deposed by the Scholarios family, as well as other aristocratic circles related to Constantinople. The attempts of the Scholarios family were supported by Constantinople, which was disappointed with the fall of Eirene Palaiologina and the ascent of Anna, the Venetians and the Genoese. On July 30, 1341, Michael Grand Komnenos, the second son of John II, the subsequent emperor (1344-1349), aided by the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (1341/1347-1355), sailed from Constantinople to Trebizond with three battle ships and the company of Niketas Scholares the captain-general of the Scholarioi and Gregory Meizomatis in order to marry the former empress Irene and assume the authority of the empire.In 1341, Michael Grand Komnenos started from Constantinople as the future husband of Eirene Palaiologina, according to the diplomatic plan of John VI Kantakouzenos. Before he reached Trebizond, the revolt instigated by Anna Anachoutlou, which ended in the forced resignation of Eirene and the ascension of Anna to the throne, had already broken out.

At first the dignitaries and the metropolitan Akakios accepted him with all solemnity as an emperor. Michael received the oath of allegiance of the assembled nobles and officers of state, and retired to the palace to prepare for his coronation the following day. At daybreak the scene was changed. The people had been incited during the whole night to resist the invasion of a new swarm of Constantinopolitan adventurers, and they now rose in rebellion. The opposing nobles and government officials facilitated their enterprise. Not wishing to be governed by a forceful man of mature years, they promptly imprisoned Michael in the palace and later was sent to captivity at Oinaion. The Laz soldiers, after several engagements, captured three Byzantine ships and a few days later the dethroned Irene was put on a Frankish ship bound for Constantinople. The nobles of the Laz faction now became the sole possessors of political power, and used the name of the empress Anna to govern the empire by an association of powerful chiefs. = John III Megas Komnenos = Niketas, the captain-general of the Scholarioi and the Greek party, which looked to the Byzantine alliance as the surest guarantee of civil order, resolved to make another attempt to drive their rivals from power. Niketas Scholarios, Constantine Doranites, the brothers Gregory and Michael Meizomatis and others, fled on a Venetian ship to Constantinople, where they met John Grand Komnenos, Michael‚Äôs son, and offered him the throne of the Empire of Trebizond. John, subsequent John III (1342-1344). The expedition was undertaken secretly and without any public support from the Byzantine government. Three Genoese galleys were hired, in addition to two fitted out by the chiefs of Trebizond; and a body of chosen troops was enrolled, for an attack on the government of the empress Anna. They reached Trebizond in early September 1342 and after fierce street battles the invaders forced their way into the fortress. Empress Anna was taken prisoner in the imperial palace and, to guard against the possibility of a counter-coup, she was immediately strangled. John Grand Komnenos arrived at Trebizond on September 4, 1342, and was crowned emperor in the church of Theotokos Chrysokephalos on the same day. The ascension of John III to the throne was followed by persecutions against members of the aristocracy. The Scholarios family, who had supported him from the start, took advantage of the power they held after his ascension to the throne and turned against their rival Amytzantarios family, who had supported the dethroned Anna Anachoutlou. Many nobles of the Laz party, particularly the Amytzantaraoi, and their notable descendants were murdered. The massacres of Anna‚Äôs followers continued in the provinces. = Michael Grand Komnenos = The aristocrats who elevated John III apparently grew dissatisfied with him, for Niketas freed his father Michael from captivity at Limnia and put him on the throne on May 1344, and had John banished to the Monastery of St. Sabas. In return, Michael granted Niketas the title of megas doux, Gregory Meitzomates the title of stratopedarches, while Gregory's son was made epikernes, John Kabazites megas logothetes, Niketas Scholares's son parakoimomenos, Michael Meitzomates amytzantarios, and Stephan Tzanichites received the title of megas konostaulos. Thus the Scholarioi achieved overwhelming control of the government. The emperor Michael seems to have made some attempt to improve the condition of the government, but his talents were unequal to the task. The two great parties of the Laz nobles and Greek leaders of the citizens maintained themselves in a condition to control the imperial administration, by personal combinations and political arrangements, arising out of temporary and local causes. Michael resolved to break the power of both parties. Immediately after his accession, he condemned to death the most eminent of the nobles of the Lazic party ‚Äî a measure that was supported by the Greek party, who inherited all the great offices of state. However, the power of the Scholarioi proved unpopular with the populace of Trebizond. The people of the capital and the Laz rose in rebellion, demanding the restoration of a lawful emperor, and not under the arbitrary rule of a band of nobles. In November 1345 Niketas was arrested and imprisoned, along with his associate Gregory Meitzomates and others of their party. However, the Emperor Michael, old and sick, released Niketas from prison and restored to him his former office of megas doux on 13 December 1349. Nine days later, on 22 December, Niketas led a coup that deposed Michael and installed John, the son of Emperor Basil to the throne, who took the name of Alexios III of Trebizond, thus ending the Trapezuntine Civil War.

Gameplay The game plays as a Japanese role-playing game, but also includes visual novel segments where the player must interview characters to identify a potential traitor among the player's party of characters. Similar to gameplay mechanics found in Ace Attorney and Danganronpa games, the player must review statements from characters and try to identify contradictions in their accounts of events. Story The game takes place in an alternate history version of Japan in 1929 dealing with the repercussions of a fallen meteorite named the \\"Black Garnet\\". The meteorite starts the spread of a disease called \\"Chimera\\", which causes people to turn into dangerous and destructive creatures, leading to the death of 3% of the world's population and the infection of many more. The player takes control of the character of Asahi, a member of the \\"Special Force Valkyrie\\" ordered to eradicate the Chimera-infected people to stop the spread of the virus. Development The game was first announced in February 2016 in an issue of Weekly Famitsu under the name Black Rose Valkyrie. The game was initially scheduled for release on June 30 in Japan, but was later delayed almost a month to July 21, to improve the game's quality. In November, Idea Factory announced they would be releasing the game in English in North America and Europe in the first half of 2017, under the new name Dark Rose Valkyrie. The change in name was largely due to copyright issues in English regions. The game features staff from Namco Bandai's long-running Tales series, including character designer Kosuke Fujishima, and scenario writer Takumi Miyajima, both of which notably worked together on Tales of Symphonia and Tales of the Abyss. On May 2, 2017 Idea Factory International has announced a limited edition for Dark Rose Valkyrie. Reception and sale In the game's debut week in Japan, it was the third best-selling new game, and fourth best-selling overall, selling 12,682 copies at retail.

It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of Immanuvel Devendrar, a freedom fighter and Indian National Congress leader who took part in the Quit India movement during the British Raj era. He worked in the Indian Army in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of Pallar caste. He was a close associate of chief minister K. Kamaraj. Political background Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and Nadars, and opposed by the Forward Block, which was itself favoured by the Maravar community. The two sides clashed during elections. Violence erupted notably in the districts of Ramanathapuram and Madurai which claimed over 40 lives. Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi. Criticism Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence. These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.

Her wide circle included many prominent people in entertainment and the arts, several of whom were introduced to her alternative lifestyle in the Berkshire house where she lived with her lesbian partner. After the Second World War, she was involved in the Women's Voluntary Service, receiving the British Empire Medal for her services. She had two sons, one of whom was Patrick Macnee, the actor. Family  Dorothea Macnee was the great-granddaughter of Hans Francis Hastings, 12th Earl of Huntingdon and granddaughter of Vice Admiral the Honourable George Fowler Hastings. Her parents, Dr Gordon George William Henry and Frances Alice Henry (n√©e Hastings), were married on 4 November 1895. Dorothea was born on 30 October 1896 at Minehead in Somerset.The Peerage.com Life  Dorothea married Daniel Macnee in June 1920. Daniel, eighteen years her senior, was a racehorse trainer Family Tree and a grandson of the Scottish artist Sir Daniel Macnee. The couple initially lived near Marlborough, Wiltshire, where Patrick was born. In 1925 the family moved to College House in Lambourn, Berkshire. Patrick Macnee later confirmed that it was an open marriage, during which Dorothea often spent extended periods in London, attending the theatre and fashionable parties. In December 1927 Dorothea gave birth to a second son, James, who lived for several years with his father, Oswald \\"Ozzie\\" Marmaduke Dalby Bell, who was also a horse trainer in Lambourn. Dorothea frequently visited to see her son. During one of her stays in London, Dorothea met divorcee Mrs Evelyn Spottiswoode, a wealthy heiress of the Dewar's whisky company. A lesbian who preferred to dress in man-style tweed jackets and brogues, her Rooksnest House and estate were close to the Macnee home in Lambourn. In 1929 the Macnees separated when Daniel went to India to take up an appointment at the Bombay racecourse, while Dorothea and her son Patrick moved to live with Evelyn at Rooksnest. Although Daniel returned to live in College House in 1931, the Macnee's never again lived together, although they maintained contact and never divorced. At Rooksnest, Evelyn Spottiswoode and Dorothea Macnee lived with several other lesbians including Evelyn's former lover, a large household staff, and up to 45 dogs. Patrick was encouraged to address her mother's new partner as ‚Äòuncle Evelyn‚Äô, Evelyn paying for his schooling, first at Summer Fields and then at Eton.Patrick Macnee, obituary Daily Telegraph, London, 25 June 2015. During this time, visitors to Rooksnest included The Most Rev.

Methuen Arms Hotel, Corsham, where Macnee lived for twenty years until 1976 Although Dorothea inherited College House, Lambourn, on her husband's death in December 1952, her extravagant lifestyle meant that the property was soon mortgaged. She then lived in an army camp near Corsham, Wiltshire, in modest circumstances. Here, as a member of the Women's Voluntary Service, she worked unpaid for over ten years as a welfare officer for the families of British servicemen stationed overseas, telling one newspaper \\"Many [servicemen's wives] cry on my shoulder, it does them good poor things\\".The People, Sunday 24 November 1957, page: 14.

Biography Killewald holds a BS in mathematics, MA in sociology, MA in statistics, and PhD in sociology from the University of Michigan. After earning her doctorate in 2011, Killewald worked as a researcher for Mathematica Policy Research before becoming an assistant professor at Harvard University in 2012. In 2016 she became full professor (with tenure) at Harvard University. She is currently the director of graduate studies for the PhD program in social policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Work Killewald's major works have been in the sociology of the family, particularly the division of labor between men and women. In a paper co-authored with Margaret Gough that was named the \\"Article of the Year\\" by the Sociology of the Family section of the American Sociological Association in 2014, Killewald found that women experience wage gains when they marry, challenging the theories of specialization in marriage proposed by economists such as Gary Becker. According to Killewald and Gough, women's contribution to their families through unpaid labor is not only determined by tradeoffs with their husbands, but is also shaped by their own commitments to wage earning and household labor. In a 2016 American Sociological Review article, Killewald demonstrated that if men are not employed full-time, this greatly increases their probability of divorce, but low earnings, per se, do not effect the probability of divorce. Killewald interpreted this to show that the failure to fulfill the social expectation of being a breadwinner threatens men's likelihood to stay in a marriage, not financial strain. Killewald is the co- author of the 2012 book Is American Science in Decline? with Yu Xie. This book assesses the state of American science, using systematic data from a large range of sources on science education and occupations in the U.S. over the past 70 years. Killewald also conducts research the influence of parental wealth on adult outcomes, including the role of parental wealth in explaining the racial wage gap in the United States. She has also written (with Kerwin Charles and Erik Hurst) on assortative mating by parental wealth.

Urban Ministries Inc, 2000. p78 Early life Jesse Freeman Boulden was born a free man in Delaware on October 8, 1820 to Andrew and Theresa Boulden. The family were born when the law in Delaware manumitted slaves at the age of 28 and their children at the age of 21. In this way, only one of Jesse's siblings, a brother, was a slave. When his brother approached the age of 21, he fled to Pennsylvania with the help of the white children of his master to avoid being sold further South. Andrew was accused of aiding his son, and himself fled Delaware with the rest of his family to avoid persecution. In Philadelphia, Jesse went to Quaker schools, before returning to Delaware to apprentice and continue schooling. He converted to the Baptist religion in February 1834 and became pastor of Union Baptist Church in Philadelphia in 1853, where he served until 1860.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner.

Lett was pastor at the leading Baptist church, Zoar Church. In March 1860, about 40 parishioners left that church to form Zion Baptist Church led by Boulden, with Rev Tansbury leading the old body. Tansbury returned to his previous home in Canada and on December 22, 1861 the two churches combined under Boulden's efforts to form a new church, Olivet Baptist Church, where Boulden served until 1863.

That year he returned to Philadelphia, but when news reached him that St. Louis pastor and friend of Boulden J. R. Anderson had died, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri and took the pastorship at Anderson's church. In February 1864, Boulden attended the Wood River Baptist Association meeting at Brooklyn, Illinois and advocated for increased Baptist missionary work among slaves freed behind the advance of the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). In 1865, Boulden left his work in St. Louis and moved to Natchez, Mississippi where he organized what was then called Wall Street Baptist Church and later called Pine Street Baptist Church. He also worked for civil rights and made the first petition to Congress in 1865, asking for black franchise. Boulden was followed at Natchez by Henry P. Jacobs.Montgomery, William E.

In 1869, he was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives. He was highly respected in the state party, and worked to establish Blanche Kelso Bruce as sergeant-at-arms to the State Senate. He contested for a seat in the state senate, but lost to Hiram Rhodes Revels. He also sought a seat in the United States Senate. In 1872, Boulden organized a northern Mississippi General Missionary Baptist Association convention, which rivaled Henry Jacobs' Missionary Baptist Association as the organizing body of Baptists in the state. Boulden disputed with Jacobs' group due to the inclusion of a number of congregations Boulden considered \\"disorderly\\". The two groups merged in 1890. Other activities He was pastor of the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, originally called the First Colored Baptist Church in Washington, DC from 1877 to 1881.

This method provides a high- level overview of processes, or workflows, so that any stakeholder can readily read and understand the information. The HPM method involves two levels: # Process diagrams: High-level overviews of specific processes or workflows. # Systems diagrams: Mapping how each process is correlated, as well as various inputs, outputs, goals, feedback loops, and external factors. HPM method purpose The primary purpose of the HPM method is to first elicit process information from all relevant stakeholders and subsequently document existing processes completed within an organization. This method addresses the problem of workplace inefficiency within an organization which can largely be attributed to the majority of processes being undocumented and informally completed. The formal documentation of processes offers to replace ambiguity and uncertainty with clarity and transparency for the work being completed, both for process stakeholders and for upper management. The development of formal documentation also provides the opportunity to reassess process efficacy. Stakeholders will be given the chance to offer their innate insight into process strengths, weaknesses, and redundancies. The culmination of these efforts should result in an evident increase to overall workplace efficiency within the organization. HPM output The final output of the HPM method is the formalized master documentation of an organization's or branch's workflows and processes. This collection is divided into specific process series, each for a specific group or team. Each process series is divided into the team's major workflows which are individually documented into HPM process diagrams. Each process series also includes an HPM systems diagram which shows the relationships and connections between the various processes, inputs, outputs, feedback loops, external environment, and system goals. =HPM process diagram= HPM process diagrams provide a high-level overview of a specific workflow or process completed by a business unit. These diagrams are not meant to provide detailed instructions on procedures or codes, but instead address all major steps, decisions, and evaluations that are included in a process. Once finalized, these documents can be used as a reference for anyone in the organization. For example: * The process owners can utilize the diagrams to train new employees. * Other groups can reference the diagrams for enhanced understanding & communication. * Upper management can reference the diagrams for increased process transparency & decision-making. HPM process diagrams can be customized to fit the specific needs of an organization, however, typically include: * Process title * Process phases * Timeline (if applicable) * Sequential process steps * Legend/key =HPM system diagram= HPM system diagrams provide a holistic view of a set of process diagrams. The system focuses on the connections and relationships between various processes. These diagrams also address the system as a collection of: * Inputs * Transformations * Outputs * Goals * Feedback * External factors Example of a basic HPM System Diagram HPM implementation The HPM method implementation is completed in five main phases. Meetings with stakeholders from organizational teams are conducted to identify major processes, document each process in detail, and develop implementable solutions. Information is elicited from stakeholders and then formally documented into process flowchart diagrams and systems thinking diagrams for use within the organization: # initial elicitation and collaboration, # preliminary documentation, # follow- up elicitation and collaboration, # final documentation, and # project package submission. =Initial elicitation & collaboration= The first phase of the HPM method involves scheduling and meeting with each major team that makes up an organization or branch. Meetings are then conducted in the form of an interview and followed a detailed protocol to establish the meeting purpose, convey expected benefits, and to elicit information about the respective team's processes. Meetings begin with an explanation of the purpose, as well as a list of expected benefits to each team: # increased productivity, # increased worker satisfaction, # increased innovation, # reduced turnover, # reduced uncertainty, and # reduced role ambiguity. Clarification should then be given to all questions posed by stakeholders to ensure buy-in from all members of the respective team. Next, each team should provide a high-level overview of all of the major processes they complete on a regular basis. Each of these processes can then be discussed in detail. The chronological order of tasks for each process is elicited and inputs, outputs, operations, decision points, and evaluations are identified. =Preliminary documentation= The second phase, preliminary documentation, begins after all process information is elicited from all organizational teams. Each process is then organized and formatted into a HPM process diagram. Processes are designed with a title, overview of process phases, timeline (if applicable), and specific steps in sequential order. =Follow-up elicitation & collaboration= After all preliminary HPM process diagrams are drafted, follow-up meetings with each of the teams is conducted. These meetings open with a review of the respective team's HPM process diagrams for accuracy. This review also serves as a means to prime stakeholders for the three stages of brainstorming: (1) prepare the group, (2) present the problem, and (3) guide the discussion. Prepare the group Teams are primed for brainstorming through the review of their HPM process diagrams. This step reminds stakeholders about the content being discussed and allows them to think about each process in detail, reviewing what works well and what may be improved. Additionally, the time between the initial interview and follow-up meeting should have provided each stakeholder with the opportunity to independently think about the processes. Present the problem Once prepared for brainstorming, teams are tasked with problem identification. While the act of formally documenting processes innately addresses existing problems with process efficiency and ambiguity, brainstorming is meant to focus on further solving these problems. This involves a brief independent reflection for each stakeholder of their existing processes' efficacy, strengths, and areas that could be or need to be improved. Guide the discussion To facilitate the brainstorming session, teams are guided through the four stages of AI: (1) discovery, (2) dream, (3) design, and (4) destiny. Each stage consists of a discussion guided with specific AI-based questions crafted to elicit ideas and solutions founded out of positivity. =Discovery= The first stage, discovery, appraises stakeholders and existing workflows, identifying what already works well and \\"appreciating and valuing the best of 'what is'\\". Stakeholders are asked AI- based questions designed to elicit the best of their respective team. For example, stakeholders could identify personal strengths of specific stakeholders, strong points within existing processes, and environmental factors that enabled the team to operate at their best. =Dream= The second stage, dream, asks teams to envision a future based on the positives discovered in the first stage of AI. Questions posed to teams allow them to explore optimistic possibilities of what could be accomplished while intentionally overlooking deficits and struggles that existed in the past. For example, stakeholders could envision what their team would be able to accomplish when operating at their best or what factors would enable the team to operate with an elevated sense of purpose. =Design= The third stage, design, focuses on teams articulating how they could turn what was identified in the dream stage into a reality. indicate that \\"once strategic focus or dream is articulated attention turns to the creation of the ideal organization\\" and the \\"actual design of the system\\" (p. 10). Questions should focus on action planning and identifying where specific improvements could be made within existing processes to make their optimistic futures tangible. Where the dream stage asked stakeholders to overlook deficits and struggles, the design stage asked stakeholders to develop new solutions that fixed or bypassed existing issues by using the teams' strengths. =Destiny= The fourth stage, destiny, concludes the AI process by having teams develop a plan to sustain what was identified in the first three stages. Utilizing the positive momentum built throughout the brainstorming session, stakeholders are likely to agree to perform specific actions. Cognitive dissonance theory postulates that by making a public commitment of behavioral intent, stakeholders will feel a strong need to maintain consistency between their words and their actions. For this reason, questions focus on eliciting self- identified commitments from stakeholders. For example, stakeholders were asked to identify a small action they could each do immediately to help make their envisioned future become a reality. These answers served as public commitments to the rest of their team. =Final documentation= At this point, all relevant information has been elicited from the organizational teams and is ready to be documented. First, HPM process diagrams should be updated to reflect feedback and insights from stakeholders. Second, the collective HPM process diagrams of each team are reviewed and analyzed. Systems thinking is then applied to identify a \\"deeper understanding of the linkages, relationships, interactions and behaviours among the elements that characterize the entire system\\". Business psychology concepts The HPM method utilizes four core concepts derived from business psychology: (a) flowcharts, (b) brainstorming, (c) appreciative inquiry (AI), and (d) systems thinking. =Flowcharts= Flowcharts are \\"easy-to-understand diagrams that show how the steps of a process fit together\\". They provide a visual reference to stakeholders so that steps can clearly be followed in a chronological order. Flowcharts are \\"used commonly with non-technical audiences and are good for gaining both alignment with what the process is and context for a solution\\". This neuroscience tool was incorporated into the HPM method for its numerous applications: (a) defining a process, (b) standardizing a process, (c) communicating a process, (d) identifying bottlenecks or waste in a process, (e) solving a problem, and (f) improving a process. Flowcharts provide a useful and straightforward visual reference for all members of an organization. Utilizing flowcharts offers increased process transparency and decreased ambiguity, often resulting in an increase to overall workplace efficiency. =Brainstorming= Brainstorming is an effective neuroscience tool that can be used with groups to generate ideas that draw on the experience and strengths of all stakeholders. This tool was incorporated into the HPM method for its potential to provide teams with the opportunity to \\"open up possibilities and break down incorrect assumptions about the problem's limits.\\" Additionally, studies have shown that groups that engage in brainstorming \\"can be cognitively stimulated as a result of exposure to the ideas of others\\". This implies there is a synergistic relationship among stakeholders' individual strengths and the ideas generated throughout a brainstorming session. =Appreciative inquiry and the 4-D cycle= Appreciative inquiry (AI) is based on recognizing a \\"positive core\\" by appreciating the qualities and strengths of the people who make up an organization. assert that \\"human systems grow in the direction of what they persistently ask questions about and this propensity is strongest and most sustainable when the means and ends of inquiry are positively correlated\\" (pp. 3‚Äì4). This implies that asking positive and optimistic questions will likely guide a group or organization towards a positive, optimistic future. AI involves four key stages, known as the 4-D cycle: (1) discovery, (2) dream, (3) design, and (4) destiny. Each stage engages stakeholders in appreciating their organization, constructing a holistic appreciation for the people they work with, and creating a \\"positive core\\" that allows the organization to change and grow. AI was incorporated into the HPM method for its promotion of positive perspectives to stakeholders., the creators of AI, assert that AI focuses on the positive philosophy behind the approach rather than viewing AI solely as a problem-solving technique. AI-based questions can be used to elicit constructive ideas and solutions from stakeholders throughout the elicitation portion of the project. =Systems thinking= Systems thinking is a theory that provides stakeholders with an \\"understanding [of] how the people, processes, and technology within an organization interact allow[ing] business analysts to understand the enterprise from a holistic point of view\\". While traditional forms of analysis look at specific parts of a system, systems thinking looks at the \\"big picture,\\" focusing on the interactions between parts including dependencies and synergistic relationships. While there are many approaches and models of systems thinking, provide an open system (systems theory) that analyzes a system by its (a) inputs, (b) throughputs or transformations, (c) outputs, (d) feedback, and (e) environment. This model has been adapted for use in analyzing each of the organizational teams as a system through their (a) inputs, (b) transformations, (c) outputs, (d) feedback loops, (e) goals, and (f) environment.

Family life  Desideria Quintanar was born in 1814 in Nopala, Hidalgo, Mexico. She married Rafael Y√°√±ez and had three children: Jos√© Mar√≠a, Manuel, and Tereza. Her livelihood was that of providing for her family by growing maize and legumes. Between 1840 and 1850, her family prospered financially; they owned several properties in San Sebasti√°n, a town in Nopala and close to Veracruz, where they raised goats, sheep, and other livestock. She lived through the reign of the emperor Maximillian I. Her son, Jos√© Mar√≠a, had fought in the anti-monarchical army as a commander against the French intervention in Mexico in the 1860s in Hidalgo. Desideria was eventually widowed. She died in 1893 at the age of 79.  Baptism into the LDS Church  In February 1880, Desideria claimed to have a dream about a pamphlet called \\"Una Voz de Amonestaci√≥n\\" being published by foreigners in Mexico City. Missionaries from LDS Church were, in fact, in Mexico City in the process of publishing a Spanish translation of Parley P. Pratt's pamphlet, \\"A Voice of Warning,\\" which contained introductory information to the Church. This dream had a great effect on her, and she felt very strongly that this pamphlet would help her spiritually. Because of poor health, she was unable to travel to Mexico City to investigate the veracity of her dream. Her son, Jos√© Mar√≠a, went in her place, and was able to meet the apostle Moses Thatcher and other missionaries that had accompanied him, including a Spaniard, , who had assisted in the translation of Church materials into Spanish, and James Z. Stewart. Jos√© Mar√≠a returned to the village where his mother lived with news of the foreign missionaries and their pamphlet. Since \\"A Voice of Warning\\" was still being translated (in part by Plotino Rhodakanaty, a Greek convert living in Mexico City), the missionaries sent other pamphlets back with Jos√© Mar√≠a. In 1880, Desideria received the translated \\"A Voice of Warning,\\" as well as the newly published Spanish translation of selections from Book of Mormon. Desideria was baptized by Melit√≥n Gonz√°lez Trejo into LDS Church in April 1880 in her village of Nopala. She was the 22nd person to be baptized into the Church in Mexico, as well as the first woman. Her oldest son, Jos√© Mar√≠a and his wife, as well his daughter, Carmen, were also baptized that day. In the following months, various other family members were baptized into the LDS Church and a small congregation, called a branch, was established in Nopala. Jos√© Mar√≠a was ordained as its bishop. However, the LDS Church was facing difficulties regarding plural marriage back in the United States, and as a result, fewer missionaries were sent to Mexico. Because of the lack of contact with American missionaries, the small congregation in Nopala struggled, and its bishop, still Jos√© Mar√≠a, ended up renouncing his priesthood. In 1886, Desideria was severely beaten and robbed in her home. Apostle Erastus Snow gave her a blessing while he visited Mexico on church business. Snow was interested to learn that Desideria was a descendant of Cuauht√©moc, and saw Desideria's conversion as fulfilling the Book of Mormon prophecy to show the \\"great things the Lord hath done for their fathers\\" to the \\"remnant of the House of Israel.\\" In 1886, the entire Book of Mormon was translated into Spanish, and the Mexico mission president at the time, Horace Cummings, mentioned this to Desideria. Desideria was anxious to receive it, so Cummings sent for an unbound volume, which she was \\"much pleased\\" with. When missionaries returned to Nopala in 1903, Jos√© Mar√≠a explained that his mother had died completely faithful in the Mormon Church, even though others had left the church.

He was also a Justice of the Utah Supreme Court from 1946-1951 and one of the three original members of the U.S. Court of Military Appeals from 1951 to 1961. Early life Latimer was born in Draper, Utah to John and Petria Jensen Latimer and attended Salt Lake Public Schools. He graduated from the University of Utah College of Law in 1924 where he was a member of Delta Theta Phi law fraternity. As an undergraduate at the University of Utah he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He practiced law in Salt Lake City from 1924 to 1940. He joined the Utah National Guard in 1925. On October 5, 1929 he married Rhoda Caroll. They had two sons, George Jr. and Ronald G. World War II During World War II he spent three years in the Pacific Theater with the Fortieth Infantry Division. He eventually rose the rank of colonel and was the division‚Äôs chief of staff. He participated in four landings and was awarded the Bronze Star and the Legion of Merit. He continued his work with the National Guard after the war and eventually rose to the rank of Brigadier General. Legal career =As a judge= In 1946 Latimer was elected to the Utah Supreme Court and was sworn in for a ten-year term. Before the end of his term he resigned to accept an appointed by President Harry S. Truman to the newly formed U.S. Court of Military Appeals in 1951. He was instrumental in interpreting the Uniform Code of Military Justice after it was adopted at the end of World War II. He noted in a 1956 address to the military‚Äôs Judge Advocate Generals that civilian courts were beginning to call on the Court of Military Appeals for judicial opinions relating to military judicial subjects. He said that this was a good sign that the Uniform Code of Military Justice had established an acceptable court system. =Law firm= He became a partner in the Salt Lake City firm of Parsons, Behle, and Latimer in 1961. He would later serve as its president until retiring in 1973 but remained as a counsel to the firm until 1985. =Board of pardons= In 1965 he was appointed to the Utah State Board of Pardons. He served on the board until 1979. During that time he presided over the commutation hearings of convicted murderer Gary Gilmore.

These anoxygenic phototrophs use light for energy and sulfide as their electron donor and sulfur source. Discovery of okenane in marine sediments implies a past euxinic environment, where water columns were anoxic and sulfidic. This is potentially tremendously important for reconstructing past oceanic conditions, but so far okenane has only been identified in one Paleoproterozoic (1.6 billion years old) rock sample from Northern Australia.Purple sulfur bacteria produce the pigment molecule okenone, which is then diagenetically altered and preserved as the partially saturated okenane. Discovering okenane in sediments is considered evidence of purple sulfur bacteria, implying an anoxic and sulfidic environment.  Background  In the Paleoproterozoic, the water column possibly became sulfidic and anoxic. Purple and green sulfur bacteria likely thrived in this euxinic environment. Purple sulfur bacteria produce the pigment okenone which, during diagenesis, degrades to okenane. Green sulfur bacteria with green pigments produce chlorobactene, which is altered to chlorobactane during burial. Green sulfur bacteria with brown pigments produce isorenieratene, which is preserved as isorenieratane. Each anoxygenic phototroph occupies a different depth range in the ocean, based on their pigment's light absorption. Biomarkers from these species may teach us about anoxic paleoenvironments. Okenone is a carotenoid, a class of pigments ubiquitous across photosynthetic organisms. These conjugated molecules act as accessories in the light harvesting complex. Over 600 carotenoids are known, each with a variety of functional groups that alter their absorption spectrum. Okenone appears to be best adapted to the yellow-green transition (520 nm) of the visible spectrum, capturing light below marine plankton in the ocean. This depth varies based on the community structure of the water column. A survey of microbial blooms found Chromatiaceae anywhere between 1.5m and 24m depth, but more than 75% occurred above 12 meters. Further planktonic sulfur bacteria occupy other niches: green sulfur bacteria, the Chlorobiaceae, that produce the carotenoid chlorobactene were found in greatest abundance above 6m while green sulfur bacteria that produce isorenieratene were predominantly identified above 17m. Finding any of these carotenoids in ancient rocks could constrain the depth of the oxic to anoxic transition as well as confine past ecology. Okenane and chlorobactane discovered in Australian Paleoproterozoic samples allowed conclusions of a temporarily shallow anoxic transition, likely between 12 and 25m. Okenone is synthesized in 12 species of Chromatiaceae, spanning eight genera. Other purple sulfur bacteria have acyclic carotenoid pigments like lycopene and rhodopin. However, geochemists largely study okenone because it is structurally unique. It is the only pigment with a 2,3,4 trimethylaryl substitution pattern. In contrast, the green sulfur bacteria produce 2,3,6 trimethylaryl isoprenoids. The synthesis of these structures produce biological specificity that can distinguish the ecology of past environments. Okenone, chlorobactene, and isorenieratene are produced by sulfur bacteria through modification of lycopene. In okenone, the end group of lycopene produces a œá-ring, while chlorobactene has a œÜ-ring. The first step in biosynthesis of these two pigments is similar, formation of a Œ≤-ring by a Œ≤-cyclase enzyme. Then the syntheses diverge, with carotene desaturase/methyltransferase enzyme transforming the Œ≤-ring end group into a œá-ring. Other reactions complete the synthesis to okenone: elongating the conjugation, adding a methoxy group, and inserting a ketone. However, only the first synthetic steps are well characterized biologically.  Preservation  One diagenetic pathway proposed to saturate okenone to okenane is reductive desulphurization, where hydrogen sulfide adds to a double bond and is then removed. More research is needed on other reactions that remove functional groups before preservation. Pigments and other biomarkers produced by organisms can evade microbial and chemical degradation and persist in sedimentary rocks. Under conditions of preservation, the environment is often anoxic and reducing, leading to chemical loss of functional groups like double bonds and hydroxyl groups. The exact reactions during diagenesis are poorly understood, although some have proposed reductive desulphurization as a mechanism for saturation of okenone to okenane. There is always the possibility that okenane is created by abiotic reactions, possibly from methyl shifts in Œ≤-carotene. If this reaction was occurring, okenane would have multiple precursors and the biological specificity of the biomarker would be diminished. However, it is unlikely that isomer specific rearrangements of two methyl groups are occurring without enzymatic activity. The majority of studies conclude that okenane is a true biomarker of purple sulfur bacteria. However, other biological arguments against this interpretation hold merit. Past organisms that synthesized okenone may not be modern analogues of purple sulfur bacteria. There may also be other okenone producing photosynthesizers in today's ocean that are uncharacterized. A further complication is horizontal gene transfer. If Chromatiaceae gained the ability to create okenone more recently that the Paleoproterozoic, then the okenane does not track purple sulfur bacteria, but rather the original gene donor. These ambiguities indicate that interpretation of biomarkers in billion-year-old rocks will be limited by understanding of ancient metabolisms.  Measurement techniques  = GC/MS = Prior to analysis, sedimentary rocks are extracted for organic matter. Typically, only less than one percent is extractable due to the thermal maturity of the source rock. The organic content is often separated into saturates, aromatics, and polars. Gas chromatography can be coupled to mass spectrometry to analyze the extracted aromatic fraction. Compounds elute from the column based on their mass-to-charge ratio (M/Z) and are displayed based on relative intensity. Peaks are assigned to compounds based on library searches, standards, and relative retention times. Some molecules have characteristic peaks that allow easy searches at particular mass-to-charge ratios. For the trimethylaryl isoprenoid okenane this characteristic peak occurs at M/Z of 134. = Isotope ratios = Carbon isotope ratios of purple and green sulfur bacteria are significantly different that other photosynthesizing organisms. The biomass of the purple sulfur bacteria, Chromatiaceae is often depleted in Œ¥13C compared to typical oxygenic phototrophs while the green sulfur bacteria, Chlorobiaceae, are often enriched. This offers an additional discrimination to determine ecological communities preserved in sedimentary rocks. For the biomarker okenane, the Œ¥13C could be determined by an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer.  Case study: Northern Australia  In modern environments, purple sulfur bacteria thrive in meromictic (permanently stratified) lakes and silled fjords and are seen in few marine ecosystems. Hypersaline waters like the Black Sea are exceptions. However, billions of years ago, when the oceans were anoxic and sulfidic, phototrophic sulfur bacteria had more habitable space. Researchers at the Australian National University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated 1.6-billion-year-old rocks to examine the chemical conditions of the Paleoproterozoic ocean. Many believe that this time had deeply penetrating oxic water columns because of the disappearance of banded iron formations roughly 1.8 billion years ago. Others, spearheaded by Donald Canfield's 1998 Nature paper, believe that waters were euxinic. Examining rocks from the time uncovered biomarkers of both purple and green sulfur bacteria, adding evidence to support the Canfield Ocean hypothesis. The sedimentary outcrop analyzed was the Barney Creek Formation from the McArthur group in northern Australia. Sample analysis identified both the 2,3,6 trimethylarl isoprenoids (chlorobactane) of Chlorobiaceae and the 2,3,4 trimethylaryl isoprenoids (okenane) of Chromatiaceae.

Better known as Henk Ngantung was an Indonesian painter and politician of Minahasan descent. He was appointed Deputy Governor by President Sukarno and then became Governor of Jakarta briefly between 1964 and 1965, the first Christian of the Catholic faith to hold this important post in predominantly Muslim Indonesia. Henk Ngantung was born in the Minahasa heartland of North Sulawesi province in the capital city of Manado to a poor family. Henk was a self-taught painter without any formal education. Together with Chairil Anwar and Asrul Sani, he co-founded the Indonesian artistic movement Gelanggang (meaning the arena). He was also member of the China-Indonesia Friendship from 1955 to 1958. Henk Ngantung was married to Hetty Evelyn \\"Evie\\" Mamesah and they had four children, Maya Ngantung, Genie Ngantung, Kamang Ngantung and Karno Ngantung. He became Deputy governor of Jakarta during the reign of governor Soemarno Sosroatmodjo. President Sukarno entrusted him of turning Jakarta into a city of culture based on his work as an artist. After holding the post of deputy governor from 1960 to 1964, he succeeded Soemarno Sosroatmodjo as governor of Jakarta but very briefly 1964‚Äì1965 before Soemarno Sosroatmodjo retaking the position in 1965 again briefly until 1966. His appointment was vehemently opposed for his left-wing ideology with some opponents accusing him of being a communist. From 1965 onwards, he consecrated his life to the arts. He lived in poverty, suffered bad health and developed heart disease and glaucoma. He lost eyesight completely in his right eye, and just 30% vision in the left eye, but continued painting with great difficulty. In 1990, the Indonesian businessman and philanthropist Ciputra sponsored Henk Ngantung's one and only official exhibition just a month before his death on 12 December 1991.

Life Johann Heinrich Theodor Br√ºggemann was born in Soest, a small town to the east of Dortmund which at the time of his birth still had not recovered from the devastation of the Thirty Years' War at the start of the century. He was the child of a mixed marriage: his father was a catholic brandy distiller. His mother was a Protestant. Br√ºggemann attended the gymnasium (school) in Soest before moving on to the Academy at M√ºnster. Here one of his philosophy teachers was the theologian Georg Hermes. It was on Hermes' recommendation that in 1814 he became a teacher of ancient languages at the gymnasium (secondary school) in D√ºsseldorf, becoming one of its three administrative directors in 1823 and taking over as the institution's head shortly afterwards. It was a mark of the reputation he acquired in his D√ºsseldorf school that in 1831 the king appointed him to the provincial \\"Schulcollegium\\" and a member of the regional government, based in Coblenz. In 1837 he led a special commission on behalf of the Minister for Culture, Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein to Rome in order to serve in the Prussian diplomatic mission there in the context of the disputes characterised in historical sources as the Cologne questions. After spending several years away from Koblenz, working for the government in Berlin and Rome, he had lost day-to-day involvement with his \\"Schulcollegium\\" responsibilities, and he was accordingly given continuing government employment in Berlin: from 1839 he was a permanent assistant in the Ministry for Culture in the department for teaching. In 1841 he became a privy counsellor and in 1843 he was given responsibilities in respect of catholic schools and colleges. Further privy council promotion followed. Alongside this, between 1849 and 1864 he served as a member of the Disciplinary Tribunal for non-judicial public officials. Between 1859 and 1864 he was a member of the Examination Commission for admission to higher public service. However, he resigned from his senior government posts in 1864, following a stroke. Within the Prussian government's schools administration department, Br√ºggemann was the highest ranking Roman Catholic. Although the Prussian Rhine Province was predominantly Roman Catholic, the greater part of Prussia had been led towards Protestantism during and after the religious turbulence of the sixteenth century. Br√ºggemann tried to prevent the removal of Catholic influences from schools and universities. His influence and effectiveness in this respect were not limitless, however. In 1855 he became an honorary member of the Student League of the Catholic Reading Association (founded in 1853, and now more regularly known as the Askania-Burgundia fraternity). Political As a pupil of Georg Hermes the young Br√ºggemann adhered to his teacher's rationalist theology, heavily permeated by the moral philosophy of Fichte and Kant. However, by the time of the so-called Cologne turmoil of the mid 1830s, Br√ºggemann had become very much more conservative in his strong catholic observance than his former mentor. Around 1846 he tried, without success, to set up a pro-government newspaper in the Rhineland. In 1850 he was a member of the upper house in the short-lived Erfurt Union Parliament, a Prussian led initiative which attempted to build on the pan-German Frankfurt Parliament of 1848/49, but without its dangerously radical aspects and also, as matters turned out, without Austria. Meanwhile, between 1849 and 1854 he also sat as a member in the first chamber of the Prussian Parliament (\\"Landtag\\"), where he was a leading voice for the country's catholic minority. Between 1851 and 1854 he was a vice-president of the chamber. Between 1854 and 1866 the king made him a member for life of the upper house, in which he served as vice-president of the chamber between 1854 and 1855.

Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 Oct, 2016.  Characteristics  It is a melodically indeterminate piece; this means there is no key and no defined melody.\\"Andriessen, Louis.\\" The Oxford Dictionary of Music, 2nd ed. rev. Ed. Michael Kennedy. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 Oct, 2016. The piece is very strict rhythmically, with only a guide to lower or raise pitches. Sections may be repeated as many times as the conductor wishes, resulting in varying performance lengths. Every instrument plays different notes that follow the same rhythm and ascending or descending patterns. This creates an atonal piece with many polyphonic phrases. There are points in the piece where the ensemble splits into two groups. The groups alternate lines before coming back together again. If executed properly, the piece sounds mechanical as the instrumentation operates in perfect unison.  How to Play  Before simply playing the rhythms indicated on the score, one must select a middle pitch. There is a single line through the center of the staff that indicates the aforementioned middle pitch - a pitch line. Each musician chooses their own pitch that will represent the midway point. Notes that are written above the line should be played higher than the preselected pitch and vice versa. It is important for the musician to remember their middle pitch. During long lines or complex rhythms, one must make sure there is adequate room between what he/she is playing and the pitch line.

Wilson had one of the quickest rises of any draft prospect in 2016. Prior to 2016, Wilson played a reserve role behind Vernon Hargreaves III, Brian Poole, and Teez Tabor. After the departure of Hargreaves, Wilson displayed great coverage skills and athleticism. In a single season, Wilson went from a largely unknown prospect to a possible first round pick. After the season, Wilson decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 2017 NFL Draft.https://www.si.com/college- football/2017/01/03/florida-gators-quincy-wilson-nfl-draft Professional career Wilson was one of 60 collegiate defensive backs to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. He completed all the combine drills and finished first among all defensive backs in the short shuttle and 14th in the three-cone drill. On March 28, 2017, Wilson attended Florida's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only run coverage and receiving drills as scouts and team representatives from 28 NFL teams attended, including New England Patriots' head coach Bill Belichick. Wilson attended private workouts and visits with multiple teams, including the Dallas Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, and Cleveland Browns. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Wilson was projected to be a second round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the second best cornerback prospect in the draft by Sports Illustrated, was ranked the sixth best cornerback by ESPN, was ranked the eighth best cornerback by NFLDraftScout.com, and was ranked the ninth best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFL analyst Mike Mayock. =Indianapolis Colts= The Indianapolis Colts selected Wilson in the second round (46th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the eighth cornerback selected and was the first of two cornerbacks the Indianapolis Colts drafted in 2017, ahead of fifth round pick Nate Hairston. On May 11, 2017, the Indianapolis Colts signed Wilson to a four-year, $5.76 million contract that includes $3.06 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.33 million. Throughout training camp, Wilson competed against veteran journeyman Rashaan Melvin for the job as the No. 2 starting cornerback after it was left vacant by the departure of Patrick Robinson in free agency. Head coach Chuck Pagano named Wilson the third cornerback on the depth chart behind Vontae Davis and Rashaan Melvin. He made his professional regular season debut in the Indianapolis Colts' season-opener at the Los Angeles Rams and recorded one tackle in their 46‚Äì9 loss. The following week, he earned his first career start in place of Vontae Davis, who missed the first three games due to a groin injury. Wilson collected two combined tackles and two pass break ups during a 16‚Äì13 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Wilson aggravated a knee injury he suffered during the preseason before the Colts' Week 3 victory over the Cleveland Browns. He missed the following ten games (Weeks 3-12). Wilson recovered from his knee injury prior to Week 6, but remained inactive. Head coach Chuck Pagano stated Wilson was a healthy scratch due to his inability to play special teams, but it was speculated this was a minor contributing factor to his absence and when Wilson was asked why he was inactive he stated, \\"I don't know.\\" Wilson remained a healthy scratch after the Colts released starting cornerback Vontae Davis after Week 9 and finally returned in Week 13 after injuries to Rashaan Melvin and Pierre Desir depleted their options at cornerback. He was named the starting cornerback along with rookie Nate Hairston after Melvin and Desir missed the remaining four games of the regular season. On December 14, 2017, Wilson recorded a season-high eight combined tackles during a 25‚Äì13 loss to the Denver Broncos. In Week 17, he started his fourth consecutive game and recorded two solo tackles, a pass deflection, and made his first career interception on quarterback T. J. Yates in the Colts' 22‚Äì13 victory against the Houston Texans. He finished his rookie season in with 22 combined tackles (19 solo), six pass deflections, and an interception in seven games and five starts. The Indianapolis Colts finished third in the AFC South with a 4-12 record and head coach Chuck Pagano was fired after the season. =New York Jets= On April 25, 2020, Wilson was traded to the New York Jets in exchange for the 211th pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.

Family  J√≥runn Bjarnad√≥ttir is the daughter of Bj√∂rn who settled Bjarnarfj√∂r√∞r in North-Western Iceland. He is described as being both highly-born and very wealthy (st√≥r√¶tta√∞ur ma√∞ur og au√∞igr a√∞ f√©). J√≥runn's mother is a woman named Lj√∫fa, although no further description is given. However, Jana K. Schulman in her article \\"Make Me a Match: Motifs of Betrothal in the Sagas of the Icelanders.\\" suggests that in the sagas, successful relationships are portrayed as being composed of partners of equal status and standing. This would then indicate that Lj√∫fa would have come from a similar background as husband, Bj√∂rn.Schulman, Jana K. ‚ÄúMake Me a Match: Motifs of Betrothal in the Sagas of the Icelanders.‚Äù Scandinavian Studies 69, no. 3 (Summer 1997): 296‚Äì321. She is the mother of two sons, Thorleikr and B√°r√∞r, and two daughters, Hallger√∞r longbr√≥k and √ûur√≠√∞r. She is the grandmother of Bolli Thorleiksson who features prominently throughout the later half of Laxd≈ìla saga.  Characteristics  She is initially described in Laxd≈ìla saga as \\"a good-looking woman, very proud, and no less clever. She was considered the best match in the entire West Fjords.\\"Kunz, Keneva, trans. \\"The Saga of the People of Laxardal.\\" In The Sagas of Icelanders: A Selection, edited by Jane Smiley, 284. New York: Penguin, 2005. Following her marriage to H√∂skuldr, it became apparent that in addition to her cleverness, she was also skillful and experienced, although at times headstrong.  Biography  =Marriage to H√∂skuldr= Upon hearing of J√≥runn as well as learning that her father, Bj√∂rn, was one of the most prominent farmers in all of Strandir, he set off with a group of men to seek her hand in marriage. Although Bj√∂rn received both him and his marriage proposal well, he deferred the question to J√≥runn herself for her opinion. J√≥runn responds that because of his reputation she knows that any woman who marries him will be well cared for. However, she ultimately turns the decision back over to her father and the betrothal is agreed upon with a large dowry. The wedding was held at H√∂skuld's farm H√∂skuldssta√∞ir with many guests from both sides of the families. It was called a very grand wedding feast and all the guests returned home happy with many wonderful gifts. Although she and Hoskuld got along well together, strong affection was seldom shown between them. = J√≥runn and Melkorka = Later when H√∂skuldr returns from another trip to Norway with Melkorka, a concubine whom he purchased from Gilli the Russian, J√≥runn mocks him for not knowing her name or even talking with her before carrying on relations with her. Despite H√∂skuldr's request to treat Melkorka with respect, J√≥runn displays disdain towards her, viewing herself as far-superior to Melkorka who is not only a slave but at this point considered to be both deaf and dumb. Although the saga says that H√∂skuldr from that point on had little to do with Melkorka and slept with J√≥runn every night, tensions did not ease. Eventually, J√≥runn demands that Melkorka move out of their home or else she herself would leave. Although the saga author puts stock in Melkorka's royal Irish heritage, as seen through both H√∂skuldr's reaction to the revelation (\\"Hoskuld said that she had too long concealed such a noble birth.\\"Kunz, Keneva, trans. \\"The Saga of the People of Laxardal.\\" In The Sagas of Icelanders: A Selection, edited by Jane Smiley, 290. New York: Penguin, 2005.) as well as Egill Skallagr√≠msson's when speaking of √ìlafr p√°i who is Melkorka and H√∂skuldr's son (\\"haven‚Äôt you heard that he is the grandson of king Myrkjartan? He‚Äôs of even better family on his mother‚Äôs side that his father‚Äôs, which is more than good enough for us.\\"Kunz, Keneva, trans. \\"The Saga of the People of Laxardal.\\" In The Sagas of Icelanders: A Selection, edited by Jane Smiley, 313. New York: Penguin, 2005.), J√≥runn's attitude towards her is unaffected. In fact, J√≥runn is quite skeptical of Melkorka's claim and she continues to look down on her as a common slave. Tensions come to a head when J√≥runn picks up one of her socks and hits Melkorka with it. In response, Melkorka hits her in the face and causes her nose to bleed. The result of this altercation was that H√∂skuldr had Melkorka moved to a different farm even further up the river.

A smart doorbell is an internet-connected doorbell that notifies the smartphone or other electronic device of the home owner when a visitor arrives at the door. It activates when the visitor presses the button of the doorbell, or alternatively, when the doorbell senses a visitor with its built-in motion sensors. The smart doorbell lets the home owner use a smartphone app to watch and talk with the visitor by using the doorbell's built-in high-definition infrared camera and microphone. Some smart doorbells also allow the user to open the door remotely using a smart lock. History One of the earliest smart doorbells that entered to the market is the Ring Video Doorbell which was created by entrepreneur Jamie Siminoff in 2013. Since then, several smart doorbells have been introduced to the market, another major one is Nest Hello, some of them with additional, unique features. Privacy issues Alarming concerns regarding the security of the smart doorbells have been raised. Researchers at Pen Test Partners in the UK have analyzed the Ring smart doorbell and concluded that it's possible for an attacker to gain access to the homeowner's wireless network by unscrewing the Ring, pressing the setup button and accessing the configuration URL. In another security issue that had been observed, a mix-up of two databases allowed some users of the Ring smart doorbell to view live footage from complete strangers' front porches.

Synopsis In the wilderness north of Rat Portage in Northwestern Ontario, two Scotsmen ‚Äì divinity student Simpson and his uncle, Dr. Cathcart, an author of a book on collective hallucination ‚Äì are on a moose-hunting trip with guides Hank Davis and the wilderness-loving French \\"Canuck\\", Joseph D√©fago.

Simpson and D√©fago make camp, and it soon becomes clear that D√©fago senses ‚Äì or at least thinks he senses ‚Äì some strange and fearful odour on the wind. That night, Simpson wakes to find D√©fago cowering in terror from something outside the tent. Later D√©fago runs off into the night, forcing Simpson to go and look for him. He follows his footprints in the snow for many miles, realising that D√©fago's are not the only set of tracks. The larger set of footprints are not human, and gradually it seems that D√©fago's own tracks have metamorphosed into smaller versions of the larger set. Eventually, both sets of tracks vanish, and Simpson believes he hears D√©fago's distant voice calling out from somewhere in the sky above: Simpson finally manages to make his way back to the main camp, where he is reunited with the others. Dr. Cathcart and Hank go back with him to search for D√©fago, and when camping once more out in the wilderness, D√©fago ‚Äì or some hideous parody of D√©fago ‚Äì appears before them before vanishing once again into the night. Conflicted and disturbed about what they have witnessed, they return to the main camp to find that D√©fago ‚Äì the real D√©fago this time ‚Äì has made his own way back, suffering from delirium, exposure, and frostbite. The poor guide dies soon after, and the three men are left in a state of bafflement and uncertainty about what has occurred. Punk alone could have explained it to them, but he fled home as soon as he caught the terrible odour that D√©fago carried with him. As an Indian, he instantly understood that D√©fago had seen the Wendigo. Reception and influence * Grace Isabel Colbron remarked in her 1915 essay, Algernon Blackwood: An Appreciation that: \\"For sheer naked concentrated horror, unexplained and unexplainable, such tales as \\"The Wendigo\\"... may be said to lead among the stories of the supernatural.Colbron, Grace Isabel. Algernon Blackwood: An Appreciation, The Bookman, 1915. Reprinted in Jason Colavito, ed. A Hideous Bit of Morbidity: An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I, p. 306, McFarland, 2008. . * H.P. Lovecraft said of The Wendigo: \\"Another amazingly potent though less artistically finished tale [than Blackwood's The Willows] is The Wendigo, where we are confronted by horrible evidences of a vast forest daemon about which North Woods lumber men whisper at evening. The manner in which certain footprints tell certain unbelievable things is really a marked triumph in craftsmanship.\\"\\"Price, Robert M. (Editor). The Ithaqua Cycle: The Wind-Walker of the Icy Wastes, p. 1, Chaosium, Inc., 2006. . * August Derleth based his eponymous Cthulhu Mythos entity in the short story Ithaqua on The Wendigo, and in his earlier Wendigo- inspired story, The Thing That Walked on the Wind (Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror, January 1933), he directly namechecks Blackwood and his story of 'air elementals'.Price, Robert M. (Editor). The Ithaqua Cycle: The Wind-Walker of the Icy Wastes, p. xi, 'As Derleth himself would freely admit, Ithaqua is hardly original with him. All he did was coin a Lovecraftian name for Blackwood's Wendigo, and of course the Wendigo is not Blackwood's invention either.' p. xi Chaosium, Inc., 2006. . * A loose adaption of The Wendigo by Alvin Schwartz appears in his horror anthology Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.Schwartz, Alvin (October 1981) Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark Harper & Row p.49. * The 2015 PS4 survival horror game Until Dawn features wendigos as its monsters, and is set on the fictional Blackwood Mountain, Alberta, in reference to both the author and this tale.IMDb.

He has performed on, engineered or produced records for a diverse range of musical artists including the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Alanis Morissette, Dave Navarro, John Frusciante, Rasputina, Johnny Cash, Hole, Three Amoebas, and Rage Against the Machine. His record and album collaborations have sold over 50 million copies worldwide. His work on Alanis Morissette's single, \\"You Oughta Know\\"http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2004/july/text/content8.html went on to win Grammy's for Best Rock Song and Female Rock Vocal Performance. Boyle spent seven years in connection with Producer Rick Rubin, partnering with him for various pre-production, A&R;, engineering, production and mixing tasks. After breaking with Rubin and Def American Records, he joined Columbia Records as staff producer and then Senior VP of A&R; (Artists and Repertoire) for Columbia Records. Early life Boyle was born in Brooklyn, New York and at an early age moved to Casselberry, Florida, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. He is of American and Irish descent. Boyle began playing the guitar at the age of 12 and showed an early talent for music. In an interview with Phil Blankenship, Boyle stated, \\"My life fit into the Punk lifestyle. I learned to do everything on my own. Skateboarding was important to me but I gave it up to start doing music.\\"Jimmy Boyle Interview http://www.amoeba.com/blog/1995/02/index.html In that same interview, Boyle states: Professional career =Early musical projects= Pursuing music, he quit high school and moved to LA. Boyle enrolled at the Guitar Institute of Technology, now the Musicians Institute to hone his skills. In an interview he reminisced about his early days in LA's music scene. \\"The Punk lifestyle kept me going. I went where the music was. The LA music scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s was a golden era.\\" Boyle would hit 3 to 5 LA clubs nightly including Scream, Club with No Name, the Viper Room, Jabberjaw, Club Lingerie and Coconut Teaszer to name a few. Boyle connected with Matt Dike of Delicious Vinyl Records as well as Brendan O'Brien. In 1988, he became friends with and started working with record producer, Rick Rubin, and in 1995 formed the now defunct Sayten Records. =You Oughta Know= As Alanis Morissette states in her biography, Boyle brought in bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and guitarist Dave Navarro (of Jane's Addiction) and reconstructed \\"You Oughta Know\\" that went on to receive a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song 1996. Boyle wanted a much angrier sound than Alanis had originally envisioned and took the song in a new direction. Boyle's version is known as \\"You Oughta Know (Jimmy the Saint Blend)\\". Boyle is credited on the album as Jimmy Boyelle. Boyle thought it was funny to use the last name Boyelle whenever he was around Alanis Morissette because she is French Canadian. =Musical collaborations= Having a cutting edge recording studio in his West Hollywood home allowed Boyle to collaborate with a variety of musicians and artists. With Dave Navarro he worked on his Molecule project. He became close friends with Anthony Kedis, starring in a short film alongside Sophia Coppola and Blondie's Debbie Harry called Changing Fashions In 1994, he helped produce, record and engineer on Johnny Cash's comeback album.name=\\"Jimmy Boyle\\" In 1997, Boyle helped get John Frusciante clean and back into the studio. Frusciante's album Smile, was recorded in producer Boyle's LA Stuido in addition to the tapes of 3 Amoebas (his improv trio with Flea and Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins). One of Boyle's major discoveries as VP of A&R; for Columbia was Rasputina, a cello-driven band based in New York that is renowned for their unconventional and quirky style as well as their fascination with historical allegories and fashion. Boyle saw the group perform at a festival and they were signed to Columbia. He and Melora Creager went on to record and produce Rasputina's first album Thanks for the Ether in 1996. Boyle acquired a Neve 8028 Mixing Console, \\"one of four in the world,\\" from Studio 56, for his personal studio. =Solo projects= In 2011, Boyle adopted the persona Zhj1m as a solo artist. Photographer Patrik Andersson worked with him to create the music video Butterfly - The Ghosts of Jimmy Boyle. He has gone on to create performance art music videos that combine original compositions tied with abstract film clips as an expression of his frustration of the commercialism of popular music.

A single intramuscular injection of an aqueous suspension of 5 or 10 mg LNG-B has a duration of 3 months, whereas an injection of 50 mg has a duration of 6 months. The drug was also previously tested successfully as a combined injectable contraceptive with estradiol hexahydrobenzoate, but this formulation was never marketed. LNG-B has been tested successfully in combination with testosterone buciclate as a long-lasting injectable contraceptive for men as well. LNG-B may have several advantages over depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, including the use of much lower comparative dosages, reduced progestogenic side effects like hypogonadism and amenorrhea, and a more rapid return in fertility following discontinuation.

A work of surrealist art and literature, it is typical of Gorey's avant-garde style of storytelling, with Victorian and Edwardian-esque line drawings and settings, each described with a sentence fragment which adds to a larger continuous narrative. The pictures and text combine to tell a strange and obscure story. Although internally consistent, coherent, and structured, the story has a disjointed and disorienting quality, with melancholic and morbidly humorous effects. The book is collected in Gorey's first compilation, Amphigorey. Title Object lessons were a teaching method popular in the Victorian era, where an example of a physical object is used when teaching facts and speculation about that class of object. Story The story begins with a search for an aristocrat's artificial limb, a search that, implicitly, has endured for days by this point. The aristocrat leaves the house and gives \\"the Throbblefoot Spectre\\" a length of string, before going to the statue of \\"Corrupted Endeavour\\" to wait for autumn. After this, the story stays outside the house, and we see several characters enacting their own obscure dramas (including a woman who throws herself from a parapet, and three people in a dinghy on a lake to whom Echo (not depicted) speaks), in a panoramic and seemingly endless rural landscape. The story ends as three people visit a \\"kiosk\\" (depicted much like a bandstand) for tea and cakes. The tea urn, however, is empty, save for a card on which is written the book's last word: \\"Farewell\\". (In the last picture, the three stand facing a setting sun.)

This team is presumed to be the Drexel Dragons men's basketball team for the 1943‚Äì44 season for record keeping purposes. Following the season, it was expected that most, if not all, of the players from this team, including the head coach, would ever return to the team again due to joining the armed forces in World War II. The schedule for the season was essentially made as the season went on, with few games scheduled before the season began. During the season, a mixed team of civilians and cadets (3318th S.U.) that were stationed on the Drexel University campus formed, called the Drexel ASTU. The team attempted to form the previous season, however had trouble composing a schedule when they learned they would only be allowed to face teams that were also ASTP teams. This team was coached by Maury McMains, who was the director of the physical training program for the cadets. When McMains was unavailable, Gene Carney (A-3) assumed coaching responsibilities as a player-coach. While the team was at a disadvantage due to a lack of practice, members of the team included former college basketball players and other experienced basketball players.

Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization. The game can also be generalized as a nd game. The game can be generalised even further from the above variants by playing on an arbitrary hypergraph where rows are hyperedges and cells are vertices. Many board games share the element of trying to be the first to get n-in-a-row, including three men's morris, nine men's morris, pente, gomoku, Qubic, Connect Four, Quarto, Gobblet, Order and Chaos, Toss Across, and Mojo. Variants of tic-tac-toe date back several millennia.  Historic  An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, according to Claudia Zaslavsky's book Tic Tac Toe: And Other Three-In-A Row Games from Ancient Egypt to the Modern Computer, Tic-tac-toe could be traced back to ancient Egypt. Another closely related ancient game is three men's morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish.Canisius College ‚Äì Morris Games  Variants in higher dimensions  = 3D Tic-tac-toe = 3-dimensional tic-tac-toe on a 3√ó3√ó3 board. In this game, the first player has an easy win by playing in the centre if 2 people are playing. One can play on a board of 4x4 squares, winning in several ways. Winning can include: 4 in a straight line, 4 in a diagonal line, 4 in a diamond, or 4 to make a square. Another variant, Qubic, is played on a 4√ó4√ó4 board; it was solved by Oren Patashnik in 1980 (the first player can force a win).Oren Patashnik, \\"Qubic: 4 x 4 x 4 Tic-Tac-Toe\\", Mathematical Magazine 53 (1980) 202‚Äì216. Higher-dimensional variations are also possible.  Mis√®re games  = Misere Tic-tac-toe = In mis√®re tic-tac-toe, the player wins if the opponent gets n in a row.. This game is also known as avoidance tic tac toe, toe-tac-tic, inverse tic tac toe, or reverse tic tac toe. A 3√ó3 game is a draw. More generally, the first player can draw or win on any board (of any dimension) whose side length is odd, by playing first in the central cell and then mirroring the opponent's moves.. = Notakto = Notakto is a misere and impartial form of tic tac toe. This means unlike in misere tic tac toe, in Notakto, both players play as the same symbol, X. It also can be played on one or multiple boards.  Variants with bigger boards  = Quixo = The game Quixo is played on a 5 by 5 board of cubes with two players or teams. On a player's turn, they select a blank cube or a cube with their symbol on it that is at the edge of the board. If a blank cube was selected, the cube is turned to be the player's symbol (either a X or O). The game ends when one player gets 5 in a row. = Unrestricted n-in-a-row = Unrestricted n-in-a-row is played on an infinite tic-tac-toe board where the goal is for one player to get n in a row.  Isomorphic games  = Number Scrabble = There is a game that is isomorphic to tic-tac-toe, but on the surface appears completely different. It is called Pick15 or Number Scrabble. Two players in turn say a number between one and nine. A particular number may not be repeated. The game is won by the player who has said three numbers whose sum is 15. If all the numbers are used and no one gets three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw. Plotting these numbers on a 3√ó3 magic square shows that the game exactly corresponds with tic-tac-toe, since three numbers will be arranged in a straight line if and only if they total 15. = Word Tic-tac-toe = { class=\\"infobox\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"background:white;font:100% monospace;text-align:center;\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\"  ! ! ! ! ‚Üí - ! r ! ! p ! ‚Üí - ! d ! k ! ! ‚Üí - ! ‚Üô ! ‚Üì ! ‚Üì ! ‚Üì ! ‚Üò } Another isomorphic game uses a list of nine carefully chosen words, for instance \\"eat\\", \\"bee\\", \\"less\\", \\"air\\", \\"bits\\", \\"lip\\", \\"soda\\", \\"book\\", and \\"lot\\". Each player picks one word in turn and to win, a player must select three words with the same letter. The words may be plotted on a tic-tac-toe grid in such a way that a three in a row line wins..  Other variants  = Numerical Tic-tac-toe = Numerical Tic Tac Toe is a variation invented by the mathematician Ronald Graham. The numbers 1 to 9 are used in this game. The first player plays with the odd numbers, the second player plays with the even numbers. All numbers can be used only once. The player who puts down 15 points in a line wins (sum of 3 numbers). This game can be generalized to a n √ó n board. = Check Lines = In the 1970s, there was a two player game made by Tri-ang Toys & Games called Check Lines, in which the board consisted of eleven holes arranged in a geometrical pattern of twelve straight lines each containing three of the holes. Each player had exactly five tokens and played in turn placing one token in any of the holes. The winner was the first player whose tokens were arranged in two lines of three (which by definition were intersecting lines). If neither player had won by the tenth turn, subsequent turns consisted of moving one of one's own tokens to the remaining empty hole, with the constraint that this move could only be from an adjacent hole.Check Lines , BoardGameGeek, retrieved 2013-09-13. = Quantum tic-tac-toe = Quantum tic tac toe allows players to place a quantum superposition of numbers on the board, i.e. the players' moves are \\"superpositions\\" of plays in the original classical game. This variation was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs.A complete game of Wild tic-tac-toe. = Wild tic-tac-toe = In wild tic-tac-toe, players can choose to place either X or O on each move. It can be played as a normal game where the player who makes three in a row wins or a misere game where they would lose. This game is also called your-choice tic- tac-toe or . = SOS = In the game SOS, the players on each turn choose to play a \\"S\\" or an \\"O\\" in an empty square. If a player creates the sequence, SOS vertically, horizontally or diagonally they get a point and also take another turn. The player with the most points (SOSs) is the winner. = Treblecross = A completed game of Treblecross In Treblecross, both players play with the same symbol (a X or black chip). The game is played on a 1 by n board with k equal to 3. The player who creates a three in a row of X's (or black chips) wins the game. = Revenge n-in-a-row = In revenge n-in-a-row, the player who creates a n-in-a-row wins unless the opponent can create a n-in-a-row in the next move where they lose. = Random turn tic-tac-toe = In the game, random turn tic-tac-toe, a coin flip determines whose turn it is. = Quick Tic-tac-toe = In quick-tac-toe, on each turn the players can play their mark in any squares they want provided that all the marks are in the same vertical or horizontal row. The winner is the player who places the last mark. = Ultimate tic-tac-toe = In ultimate tic-tac-toe, the board is composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3-by-3 grid. Players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins in the larger tic- tac-toe board.

They currently play in the Ethiopian Higher League, the second division of football in Ethiopia.  History  Jimma Aba Buna was founded in 1955 in the southwestern Ethiopian city of Jimma. During the 1960s EC the club was one of the most competitive clubs in the top league of Ethiopian Football. In 2013 (2006 E.C.) the club was re-established after initially folding years earlier. After the 2015‚Äì16 season the club was promoted to the Ethiopian Premier League for the first time after being re-established two years earlier. The following year the club released their manager Dereje Belay mid way through the season instead hiring Gebremedhin Haile to replace him. However, later that season the team was relegated from the top league after only one season. The club let go of manager Dereje Belay and hired Anteneh Abera as his replacement mid way through their 2017‚Äì18 Ethiopian Higher League season. They finished second in group B of the 2017‚Äì18 Ethiopian Higher League season by virtue earning a playoff spot against runners up in Group A, Shire Endeselassie (the winner is promoted to the Ethiopian Premier League).

She is of Yakoma heritage. She has written several novels and a book for children, a number of which were penned in collaboration with French writer Yves Pinguilly. Life Yabouza began writing when she was ten years old. As a young woman she fled the civil war in the Central African Republic and traveled to the Republic of the Congo; from there she fled to France, where she demanded political asylum. She never attended any institution of higher education. Although she later returned to her home country, she has continued to speak out against the political violence with which it has been plagued, including the 2013 coup d'√©tat. Yabouza was a hairdresser for many years in Bangui, and has held numerous other jobs throughout her career. She lives in the Lakouanga neighborhood of Bangui. She writes in French, and also speaks Sango and Lingala in addition to her native Yakoma. Her work deals with the difficulties facing women in the Central African Republic, and many of the stories she tells are derived from family stories and from things she has heard in her neighborhood and working in the salon, locations in which women feel free to speak among themselves.

Broster and published in 1924, is an historical romance novel set in England during the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Raoul des Sabli√®res is a French prisoner of war who is unjustly sent to the Plymouth hulks (Prison ship). He escapes and is befriended by a Royal Navy captain, Hervey Barrington, who helps reunite him with the young Englishwoman he loves, and with his repatriation to France. Plot summary Monsieur Raoul des Sabli√®res, or \\"Mr. Rowl\\" as he is known by the 'shop people and such', was wounded and captured at the Battle of Salamanca in 1812. He is on 'parole of honour' in England where he meets and falls in love with the Honourable Miss Juliana Forrest, Lord Fulgrave's daughter. Due to the machinations of Juliana's jealous fianc√©, Raoul is considered to have broken his parole and is sent to the prison camp at Norman's Cross. He is persuaded to attempt to escape from the camp, during which a guard is seriously injured and Raoul is unjustly blamed for it. He is therefore sent to a prison ship in Plymouth, from which he escapes disguised as a woman, with the help of money from Juliana. The road on which Raoul (disguised as a Spanish lady to account for his accent) is travelling, becomes blocked by a fallen tree and a fellow passenger, Captain Hervey Barrington - currently without a ship and on half- pay - offers his assistance and invites Raoul to spend the night at his nearby house. Here, Hervey's sister Lavinia discovers Raoul's secret and Hervey locks Raoul in the spare bedroom for the night, intending to turning him over to the authorities in the morning. During the night, Raoul escapes from the bedroom window. A few days later, when Hervey is out sailing, he rescues a man who has been chased into the sea by some locals. It is Raoul who, half-starved and ill, has also broken his wrist when Hervey's guttering gave way in his escape. Realising Raoul is in no condition to be taken to the local gaol, Hervey lies to the sergeant and declares that Raoul drowned. Raoul recovers from a near- fatal illness and a friendship develops between the effervescent Raoul and the reserved Hervey. To atone for the guilt he feels for Raoul's suffering, Hervey reunites him with Juliana and, learning that Raoul had saved the life of an English officer in Spain, Lord Fulgrave becomes involved in arranging Raoul's repatriation to France. Hervey's stalled career as a naval officer is meanwhile rescued by his official report of Raoul's drowning having attracted the attention of the Admiralty - he had simply been forgotten. As with D. K. Broster's most successful novel The Flight of the Heron (1925), and 'The Wounded Name', published 1922, the focus of the novel, despite the female love interest, is the close friendship which develops between two very different men. In each case, the more reserved of the men finds that their relationship with the other supplies the ability to love and develop a friendship which they lack.

Established in 1960 (Ethiopian Calendar) in the historic city of Gondar, Fasil Kenema served as the first and only sport club for many years. The club is named after the 17th century Ethiopian Emperor Fasilides who ruled Ethiopia from its then capital city Gondar.

Also known as \\"Akahi-a-Kaleiwohi\\", she was named after her great-grandmother Akahi-a-Kuleana.  ªAkahi was also the name of Akahi-a- Kuleana, the mother of 15th-century Hawaiian king  ªUmi-a-Lƒ´loa. A relation of the ruling House of Kamehameha,  ªAkahi was married to Kahekili Ke ªeaumoku II and Kalanimoku, two prominent Hawaiian high chiefs and politicians during the early 19th-century. She lived most of her life on the island of Hawaii where she was allocated vast landholdings after the Great Mahele of 1848. After her death in 1877, these lands were inherited by her relative Bernice Pauahi Bishop and upon the latter's death became part of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, which now funds the Kamehameha Schools.  Life and family  Born in the early 19th-century, her parents were Pauwelua and Kaluai. Both parents were from ali ªi (noble) lines of descent. Her mother Kaluai was descended from the high chiefs of Waimea, Hawaii. From her father's family descent, she was a great-granddaughter of Ke≈çua Kalanikupuapa ªƒ´kalaninui Ahilapalapa, the father of King Kamehameha I who was the progenitor the House of Kamehameha and the unifier of the Hawaiian Islands. Her father Pauwelua descended from Ke≈çua's last wife Akahi-a-Kawalu (her great-grandmother and namesake), who became the mother of Kaleiwohi who married Kailipakalua and had Pauwelua. Through the Ke≈çua line, according to Elizabeth Keka ªaniau, \\"Akahi was the third cousin of Bernice Pauahi Bishop and the second cousin of Keka ªaniau herself.\\" Akahi was also the cousin of Pauahi's mother K≈çnia through their common grandmother Kailipakalua. In her final will, Pauahi called Akahi her aunt and historian George Kanahele also called her Pauahi's aunt. Kalanimoku, drawing by Robert Dampier, c. 1825  ªAkahi's first known marriage was to High Chief Kahekili Ke ªeaumoku II, a brother of the Kuhina Nui, Queen Ka ªahumanu. He was also the Governor of Maui and commonly known by foreigners as \\"Governor Cox\\". After Ke ªeaumoku's death in 1824,  ªAkahi married Prime Minister William Pit Kalanimoku, on June 28, 1825. This date was recorded in the journal of Spanish settler Don Francisco de Paula Mar√≠n while American missionary Reverend Samuel Ruggle claimed the marriage took place the year before. The marriage ceremony was held at the Kawaiaha ªo Church and attended by the a number of chiefs and foreign residents. Kalanimoku, who chose his Western name in honor of his English contemporary William Pitt the Younger, was known for his political savvy and military prowess and had served as Prime Minister under the reigns of three Hawaiian kings and the regency of Ka ªahumanu.  ªAkahi became a widow for the second time when he died February 7, 1827. Her final husband was J. W. Kapaa, who outlived her and died in Honolulu on March 3, 1890. Very few details survived about  ªAkahi's life. On September 28, 1840, American Protestant missionary Reverend Cochran Forbes complained about her adherence to the Roman Catholic faith. Forbes wrote in his journal, \\"Akahi the head woman of Kealia with her husband is pleased with popery, because they do not require holiness of life as a test of communion. She will probably become a papist as she is unwilling to abandon her lusts.\\" Her former husband Kalanimoku had also been baptized a Roman Catholic but later joined the Protestant church. In 1841, she was noted as the \\"chief woman\\" in Kealakekua, Hawaii and in 1845, she made a deposition in the case of Richard Charlton. She seemed to have resided exclusively on the island of Hawaii with occasional trips to Honolulu.  Landholdings  Bernice Pauahi Bishop Reflective of her status as an ali ªi and her origin and upbringing in the districts of Kona and Kohala, she inherited and held vast landholdings principally on the islands of Hawaii and Oahu. Prior the Great MƒÅhele, the great Hawaiian land redistribution enacted by King Kamehameha III in 1848,  ªAkahi held ten 'ƒÅina (land divisions) on both islands. After the land reform, she had to relinquish 46 percent of her former properties including Kahei, Kohala; Kaha, Niulii, Kohala; Haukoi, Hamakua; Kawainui, Hilo; Manana-uka Nui., Ewa; and Weloka, Manana, Ewa. Her remaining landholdings totaled at 9,557 acres at the time of her death and included 7,300 acres in Kealia, South Kona; 656 acres in Makalawena, North Kona; 1,106 acres in Ke ªeiiki, North Kona; 466 acres in Pu ªuwepa, Kohala; 19.49 acres in Ulupa ªalua, Kohala and 10.25 acres in Ka ªaipu, MƒÅnoa, on Oahu.  ªAkahi became ill in 1875 and died two years later on October 8, 1877, at Hale ªƒÅkala, the home of Bernice Pauahi Bishop and her husband Charles Reed Bishop, in Honolulu. In her will created during her final illness in May 1875, she gave her lands to her surviving husband Kapaa and to Pauahi. The Bishops were named as the executors of her will. Another cousin Keawehaku claimed that the will was forged and she had died intestate, but his case was dismissed by Judge William Austin Whiting of the first circuit court of Honolulu in 1894.; ; ; By the time of Bernice Pauahi Bishop's death in 1884, her estate consisted of 485,563 acres of land across the Hawaiian Islands which she had either purchased or inherited from her parents PƒÅkƒ´ and K≈çnia, from  ªAkahi, from her cousin Ke ªelik≈çlani and other relatives. These lands were incorporated after Pauahi's death into the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estates, a trust which funds the Kamehameha Schools to the present day. In her will, Pauahi also temporarily gave the ahupua ªa of Kealia, on the island of Hawaii, formerly belonging to Akahi, and Lumahai, on the island of Kauai, to Queen Liliuokalani \\"to have and to hold for and during the term of her natural life\\". Liliuokalani died in 1917 and these lands reverted to the Trustees of the Bishop Estate.

October 1896 The Sunbury and Lewistown Railroad was a Class I Railroad connecting Lewistown, Pennsylvania with Sunbury, Pennsylvania. Completed in December 1871, the line was placed under an immediate lease by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), upon its completion. Although retaining its own board of directors and track maintenance, all locomotive traffic was owned by the PRR. For over eighty years, the line operated between Sunbury and Lewistown, serving as a relief line for both the Pennsylvania Main Line and Bald Eagle Valley Railroad through Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The line was noteworthy as a proving ground for new railroad technology in the United States, such as the \\"X\\"-shaped railroad crossing signs in 1917 (now nearly ubiquitous in the United States) and Pulse Code Cab Signaling technology in 1925. It is now a fallen flag railway, the name \\"Sunbury and Lewistown\\" having been phased out in 1901 when the line became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad's Sunbury Division. History In the mid-1860s, residents of Snyder County wanted to capitalize on the transportation and commerce possibilities of the recently constructed Northern Central Railway, which was located across the Susquehanna River in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The Northern Central, completed in the 1850s, connected Sunbury to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, York, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore, Maryland, thus giving Snyder County a better connection to the surrounding region and beyond. To this end, the Middle Creek Railroad was formed in Selinsgrove in 1868, with the intention of planning, grading, and constructing a route. Without any ties to a major railroad, the Middle Creek Railroad only got as far as choosing the route and the completion of some grading before the company ran out of money and folded. The assets of the company were bought up and reorganized as the \\"Sunbury and Lewistown Railroad\\" in 1871. With minimal financial backing (initially) from the Pennsylvania Railroad and Northern Central Railway, construction of the nearly 50-mile line continued at a slow pace for the next three years, with work progressing inward from both the eastern and western termini. The western group covered more territory, as the completion of the line's eastern end was contingent on the construction of the half-mile-long Selinsgrove Bridge spanning the Susquehanna River. The PRR signed a 99-year lease on the line in October 1871 and purchased half the outstanding stock of the line, and the entire line was completed in December 1871. Almost immediately, it became clear that the demand for such a line was not as high as its proprietors had anticipated, and the railroad ceased to operate. The line was sold at sheriff's sale in May 1874, and reorganized as the Sunbury & Lewistown Railway on Feb. 1, 1876. The Pennsylvania Railroad, a lessor and major shareholder, assumed operation of the route. Thus, \\"Sunbury and Lewistown\\" functioned only in name for the most part - the rolling stock and motive power came from the Pennsylvania Railroad. Effective October 1, 1896, the shareholders of the Mifflin & Centre County Railroad Company and the Sunbury & Lewistown Railway Company approved the consolidation of the two companies into the Sunbury & Lewistown Railway Company. The Pennsylvania Railroad then executed a new 79-year operating lease. Effective June 1, 1900, the Sunbury & Lewistown Railway Company and four other PRR-affiliated railroads merged into a new entity, the Schuylkill & Juniata Railroad Company. It was immediately leased to the Pennsy under a 20-year operating agreement. Effective April 1, 1902, the Schuylkill & Juniata Railroad Company was merged into the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Under PRR control, the line served as an important shortcut for moving Wilkes-Barre anthracite westward to Pittsburgh steel mills, avoiding Harrisburg, and for moving perishables to New York markets via an interchange with the Lehigh Valley Railroad at Mt. Carmel, avoiding both Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Freight traffic peaked on the line between 1900 and 1908, possibly in preparation for a planned (but canceled) PRR yard north of Selinsgrove in Shamokin Dam. Although the PRR bought a large tract of land planning for a yard or car shop, the proposed trunk yard was instead constructed at Northumberland, Pennsylvania in 1912, resulting in a loss of significance to the older route through Snyder County. Declining passenger numbers after the First World War led to a cancellation of all passenger traffic in January 1932, followed by a cessation of through traffic in the 1950s. The PRR sold its large tract to Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. for a new coal-fired power plant in 1945, to be served by both a PRR spur north from the S&L; at a wye on the west end of the Susquehanna River Bridge and a spur south from the Reading Railroad at Clement Station, opposite Sunbury. Track between Maitland, Mifflin County, and Paxtonville, west of Middleburg, was removed in stages between 1958 and 1965. The remaining eastern segment, running west from Selinsgrove Junction (south of Sunbury) and then across the Susquehanna River to Paxtonville via Selinsgrove, was operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad until 1968, then came under the control of Penn Central (merger of the PRR and the New York Central), Conrail. The segment between Paxtonville and Kreamer, Pennsylvania was abandoned with the beginning of Conrail in April 1976. The remaining segment is operated today under the ownership of the Norfolk Southern Railway,which took over portions of Conrail in 1999. Conrail also operated the segment between Lewistown Junction and Maitland until the line, along with spurs to Milroy and an industrial parkm, were sold to the SEDA-COG Joint Rail Authority, and operation transferred to the Juniata Valley Railroad on August 19, 1996. Today, parts of the railroad grade between Kreamer and Maitland are still visible, though sixty years of development in the area have erased some segments. Route Leaving south from the station at Sunbury, S&L; traffic shared track with the Northern Central, which had been constructed a decade earlier. At Selinsgrove Junction station, on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, the line split, with the NCRR continuing south towards Harrisburg and the S&L; crossing the River on the Selinsgrove Bridge. The original bridge over the river was wooden, but has been replaced several times since the opening of the line. The oldest segments of the current bridge date from 1888. The line enters the borough of Selinsgrove on the Isle of Que, then crosses Penn's Creek on a smaller bridge into Selinsgrove proper, where the station still stands today, although it has not seen passenger traffic since the 1930s. Passing through what was once the industrial center of Selinsgrove, the line turns south, skirting around the edge of the campus Susquehanna University, where it turns west. West of Selinsgrove, several minor stations once existed that were closed in the late 1800s as they were not used enough to be financially viable. Winding its way through the Middle Creek (Penns Creek) valley, the route passed through the villages or towns of Clifford, Kreamer, Middleburg, Pennsylvania, Paxtonville (known to the railroad for a brief period as \\"Benfer\\"), Beavertown, Beaver Springs, Pennsylvania and McClure, before arcing to the southwest to follow Jacks Creek into Mifflin County, Pennsylvania. In Mifflin County, the railroad passed through Wagner, Shindle and Maitland before entering Lewistown from the east. The S&L; track was laid directly onto Chestnut Street, connecting with the Pennsylvania Railroad for the final leg to Lewistown. One average the route took a little over an hour to complete, but a special train run shortly after the line's opening in 1871 made it from Sunbury to Lewistown in under forty five minutes.

Since the latest modernization in 2014, it has 2 long quays, 3 shorter quays, a quay for fishing boats with fish processing installations, 2 container parks, 2 roll-on/roll-off ramps and a passenger terminal. The total length of the quays is 863 m, and the maximum depth is 13.5 m. The port of Praia played an important role in the colonization of Africa and South America by the Portuguese. With 817,845 metric tonnes of cargo and 85,518 passengers handled (2017), it is the second busiest port of Cape Verde, after Porto Grande (Mindelo). The bay of Praia lies between the headlands Ponta Temerosa and Ponta das Bicudas. The islet Ilh√©u de Santa Maria lies in the bay, west of the port. The river Ribeira da Trindade empties into the bay, between the city centre (Plateau) and the port. Directly north of the port is the city subdivision Achada Grande Frente.

In the 16th century the port developed into an important port of call for ships towards S√£o Tom√© and Brazil, in rivalry with the nearby older port city Ribeira Grande (now Cidade Velha). Between the end of the 16th century and the end of the 18th century, both Ribeira Grande and Praia suffered many pirate attacks, including those by Francis Drake (1585) and Jacques Cassard (1712). The harbour was mentioned as \\"P. Praya\\" in the 1747 map by Jacques-Nicolas Bellin. Praia gradually superseded Cidade Velha to become the most important port of Cape Verde, and became the capital of Cape Verde in 1770.Centre historique de Praia, UNESCO The naval battle of Porto Praya, part of the Anglo-French War of 1778-83, took place on April 16, 1781 inside the harbor.Theal, George McCall (1897) History of South Africa under the administration of the Dutch East India Company, 1652 to 1795.

This pier was replaced with a concrete pier in the late 1920s. In 1881 the Farol de D. Maria Pia was built at the harbor entrance. In the beginning of the 1960s new port facilities were constructed on the east side of the bay, 1 km southeast of the city centre.

The family belonged to the Banu Nakha', hence their epithet al-Nakha'i.Al-Tabari, ed. Hawting, p. 197. The Banu Nakha' was part of the larger tribe of Madh'hij. Ibrahim had a brother from the same mother but different father named Abd al-Rahman ibn Abdallah al-Nakha'i, who also was a warrior. Like his father, Ibrahim is also said to have fought alongside Ali against the Banu Umayya at the Battle of Siffin in 657. Career Ibn al-Ashtar's prominence rose after he entered the service of the pro-Alid and anti-Umayyad leader al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi. The latter took over Kufa in 685/86 and was soon after confronted by an invading Umayyad army from Syria under the command of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. Al-Mukhtar charged Ibn al-Ashtar with command over his mostly Persian mawali troops from Kufa to prevent the Umayyad advance into Iraq. Ibn al-Ashtar marched northward with his forces and fought the Umayyads at the Battle of Khazir east of Mosul. He inflicted a disastrous defeat on the Umayyads, personally slaying Ubayd Allah, while other senior Umayyad commanders, such as Husayn ibn Numayr al- Sakuni, were also slain. He had their heads sent to al-Mukhtar, who in turn sent them to the anti-Umayyad caliph of Medina and Iraq, Abd Allah ibn al- Zubayr. By 687, al-Mukhtar had appointed Ibn al-Ashtar governor of Mosul, which came under al-Mukhtar's control following the Umayyad rout at Khazir. That same year, al-Mukhtar and his retinue were besieged in Kufa by Ibn al- Zubayr's brother Mus'ab, and al-Mukhtar was killed in the ensuing clashes. Afterward, Ibn al-Ashtar defected to the Zubayrids, despite the efforts of Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik to woo him to the Umayyad side. Ibn al-Ashtar was ultimately killed fighting alongside Mus'ab at the Battle of Maskin in October 691, during which the Umayyads defeated the Zubayrids and subsequently conquered Iraq. After the battle's conclusion, Ibn al-Ashtar's body was confiscated and burned by the Umayyad forces. His son Nu'man served as a commander of the Madh'hij and Banu Asad contingent of the Kufan troops of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab during the latter's rebellion against the Umayyads in 720.Powers 1989, pp. 129‚Äì130 Assessment Ibn al-Ashtar is described as the \\"most talented commander Kufa produced during the Marwanid period\\" (684‚Äì750) by historian Hugh N.

A Bouligand structure is a layered and rotated microstructure resembling plywood, which is frequently found in naturally designed materials. It consists of multiple lamellae, or layers, each one composed of aligned fibers. Adjacent lamellae are progressively rotated with respect to their neighbors. This structure enhances the mechanical properties of materials, especially its fracture resistance, and enables strength and in plane isotropy. It is found in various natural structures including the cosmoid scale of the coelacanth, and the dactyl club of the mantis shrimp and many other stomatopods. Due to its desirable mechanical properties, there are ongoing attempts to replicate Bouligand arrangements in the creation of failure resistant bioinspired materials. For example, it has been shown that layered composites (such as CFRP) utilizing this structure have enhanced impact properties. However, replicating the structure on small length scales is challenging, and the development and advancement of manufacturing techniques continually improves the ability to replicate this desirable structure.  Mechanical Properties  = Toughening Mechanisms = Picoindentation of Bouligand Structure in Dactyl Club The Bouligand structure found in many natural materials is credited with imparting a very high toughness and fracture resistance to the overall material it is a part of. The mechanisms by which this toughening occurs are many, and no one mechanism has yet to be identified as the main source of the structure's toughness. Both computational work and physical experiments have been done to determine these pathways by which the structure resists fracture so that synthetic tough Bouligand structures can be taken advantage of. Crack deflection of one form or another is considered the main toughening mechanism in the bouligand structure. Deflection can take the form of crack tilting, and crack bridging. In the former, the crack propagates along the direction of the fiber plane; at the interface with the matrix material. Once the energy release rate at the tip is sufficiently low, the crack can no longer propagate along the fiber direction and must switch to crack bridging. This mode involves the crack changing direction drastically and cutting through fibers to reach a new plane to propagate along. A combination of crack tilting and crack bridging in the bouligand structure results in a highly distorted and enlarged crack. This causes the new surface area created by the propagating crack to increase dramatically relative to a straight crack; making further propagation less and less favorable and in turn toughening the material. In addition to crack deflection which simply causes a single crack to change direction and follow a more tortuous path, the bouligand structure can also tolerate multiple cracks to form and keep them from coalescing. This is sometimes termed crack twisting. Inherently accompanying crack deflection, tilting, bridging and twisting is the mixing of fracture modes. Fracture modes include opening, in-plane shear, and out-of-plane shear. The mixing of these modes via crack bridging, tilting and twisting all greatly complicate the stress fields experienced by the material; helping to dissipate the force on any one laminate plane.  Impact Resistance  Ballistic Limit Velocity, and Specific Energy Absorption as a Function of Pitch in Bouligand Structured Nanocellulose Film Impact resistance in materials is differentiated from toughening in general by the rate at which stress is applied. In impact testing, the rate at which either stress or strain is applied to the sample is much higher than so-called static testing. In synthetic nano-cellulose films formed into bouligand structures, it was shown that as the pitch angle was increased, the density quickly drops to a roughly constant value as the films are not able to neatly stack onto each other. This value rises again between 42 and 60 degrees and re-stabilizes at higher angles. This reduction in density is accompanied by a sharp increase in both specific ballistic limit velocity, and specific energy absorption. The relatively small angles of 18 to 42 degrees that correlate to the lowest density for the bouligand structure also are shown to have better impact resistance, and better energy adsorption than traditional synthetic quasi-isotropic structures made for impact resistance. This experimentally optimized range of angles for impact resistance is consistent with the range of angles between fiber layers found in natural examples of the bouligand structure. Another means of toughening the bouligand structure is by shear wave filtering. The periodic and hierarchical nature of the Bouligand structure, creates a shear wave filtering effect that is especially effective during high intensity dynamic loads. As the force is applied, specific frequencies that are in shear are not permitted to transmit through the layered structure, creating a band gap in the transmitted energies and decreasing the effective energy felt by the system. The pitch angle of the layers, thickness of the layers, and number of layers present in the material all effect which frequencies are filtered out.  Adaptability  a) Interfibullar sliding causes fibrils to rotate towards the tensile axis. b) Lamellae elastically stretch, causing fibrils to rotate towards the tensile axis. c) Tensile separation of fibrils. d) 'Sympathetic' rotation of lamellae causes lamellae to rotate away from the tensile direction when forced by other lamellae oriented towards tension. Adjustment of the Bouligand structure during loading has been measured using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The two adjustment effects are the change in angle between the collagen fibrils and tensile axis, and the stretching of collagen fibrils. There are four mechanisms through which these adjustments occur. # Fibrils rotate because of interfibrillar shear: As a tensile force is applied, fibrils rotate to align with the tensile direction. During deformation, the shear component of the applied stress causes the hydrogen bonds between fibrils to break and then reform after fibril adjustment. # Collagen fibrils stretch: Collagen fibrils can elastically stretch, resulting in fibrils re-orientating to align with the tensile direction. # Tensile opening of interfibillar gaps: Fibrils highly misoriented with the tensile direction can separate, creating an opening. # \\"Sympathetic\\" lamella rotation: A lamella is able to rotate away from the tensile direction if it is sandwiched between two lamellae that are reorienting themselves towards the tensile direction. This can happen if the bonding between these lamellae is high. Œ® refers to the angle between the tensile axis and the collagen fibril. Mechanisms 1 and 2 both decrease Œ®. Mechanisms 3 and 4 can increase Œ®, as in, the fibril moves away from the tensile axis. Fibrils with a small Œ® stretch elastically. Fibrils with a large Œ® are compressed, since adjacent lamellae contract in accordance with Poisson's ratio, which is a function of strain anisotropy. = Single vs. Double Bouligand Structure = The most common Bouligand structure found in nature is the twisted plywood structure where there is a constant angle of misalignment between layers. A rare variation of this structure is the so- called \\"double twisted\\" Bouligand structure seen in Coelacanth. This structure uses stacks of two as units to be twisted with respect to each other at some constant misalignment angle. The two fibril layers in each of these units in this case lay such that their fibril orientation is perpendicular to each other. The mechanical differences between the single and double twisted bouligand structure has been observed. It was shown that the double bouligand structure is stiffer and tougher than the more common single bouligand structure. The increase in stiffness is also accompanied by a reduction of flexibility. The increased strength is attributed in part to an addition to the structure of \\"inter-bundle fibrils\\" that run up and down the stack of layers, perpendicular to the twisted fiber planes. These fiber bundles help keep the structure together by greatly increasing the energy needed for inter- fibril sliding. These bundles are coupled with the double twisted nature of the plywood arraignment, which shifts the direction a crack would like to grow drastically with each layer. It has also been observed that a structure can form mostly similar to the single twisted bouligand structure, but with a non- constant angle of misalignment. It is still unclear how this particular structural difference affects mechanical properties.  Examples in Nature  = Arthropods = The anthropod exoskeleton is highly hierarchical. Polysaccharide chitin fibrils arrange with proteins to form fibers, the fibers coalesce into bundles, and then the bundles arrange into horizontal planes which are stacked helicoidally, forming the twisted plywood Bouligand structure. Repeating Bouligand structures form the exocuticle and endocuticle. Differences in the Bouligand structure of the exocuticle and endocuticle have been found to be critical for analyzing the mechanical properties of both regions. Arthropods have exoskeletons that provide protection from the environment, mechanical load support, and body structure. The outer layer, called the epicuticle, is thin and waxy and is the main waterproofing barrier. Below is the procuticle, which is designed as the main structural element to the body. The procuticle is made of two sections, the exocuticle on the outer part, and the endocuticle on the inner part. The exocuticle is denser than the endocuticle; the endocuticle makes up about 90 volume % of the exoskeleton. Both the exocuticle and endocuticle are made with a Bouligand structure.  Crabs  In crab exoskeletons, calcite and amorphous calcium carbonate are the minerals deposited in the chitin-protein hierarchical matrix. The sheep crab (Loxorhynchun grandis), like other crabs, has a highly anisotropic exoskeleton. The spacing between the (x-y) plane Bouligand lamellae in the crab exocuticle is ~3-5Œºm, whereas the interlamellar spacing in the endocuticle is much greater, about 10-15Œºm. The smaller spacing of the exocuticle results in a higher lamellae density in the exocuticle. There is a higher hardness measurement in the exocuticle than the endocuticle, which is attributed to a higher mineral content in the exocuticle. This gives a higher wear resistance and hardness on the surface of the exoskeleton, thus giving the crab a greater degree of protection. Under stress, the Bouligand planes fail via normal bundle fracture or bundle separation mechanisms. The exocuticle-endocuticle interface is the most critical region and typically where failure first occurs, due to the anisotropic structure and discontinuity of Bouligand planes and spacing at this interface. In the z-direction, porous tubules exist normal to the Bouligand planes that penetrate the exoskeleton. The function of these tubules is to transport ions and nutrients to the new exoskeleton during the molting process. The presence of these tubules, which have a helical structure, results in a ductile necking region during tension. An increased degree of ductility increases the toughness of the crab exoskeleton.  Lobster  The Homarus americanus (American lobster) is an arthropod with an exoskeleton structure similar to the crabs above, and with similar trends comparing the endo- and exo- cuticles. An important note for the lobster exoskeleton structural/mechanical properties is the impact of the honeycomb structure formed by the Bouligand planes. The stiffness values for the exocuticle in lobster range from 8.5-9.5 GPa, while the endocuticle ranges from 3‚Äì4.5 GPa. Gradients in the honeycomb network, especially at the interface between the endo- and exo- cuticle are believed to be the reason for this discrepancy between the structures.  Mantis Shrimp  Stomatopods have thoracic appendages that are used to hunt prey. The appendages can either be spear-like or club-like, depending on the species. Mantis shrimp with a club-like appendage, or \\"dactyl club\\", uses it to smash the shell of prey such as mollusks or crabs. The peacock mantis shrimp is a species of mantis shrimp that has a dactyl club. The clubs are able to withstand fracture under the high stress waves associated with blows against prey. This is possible due to the multi-regional structure of the clubs, which includes a region incorporating a Bouligand structure. The outer, top region of the club is called the impact region. The impact region is supported periodic zones and a striated region. The periodic regions are below the impact region, on the inside of the club. The striated region is present on the sides of the club, surrounding the edges of the periodic region. The impact region is about 50 to 70 Œºm thick, and is made with highly crystallized hydroxyapatite. The periodic region is dominated by an amorphous calcium carbonate phase. Surrounded by the amorphous mineral phase are chitin fibrils, which make up a Bouligand structure. The layered arrangement of the periodic region corresponds to a compete 180¬∞ rotation of the fibers. The impact region has a similar structure, but with a larger pitch distance (length between compete 180¬∞ rotation). The striated region is made of highly aligned parallel chitin fiber bundles. The club appendage can sustain high intensity load by shear wave filtering because of the periodicity and chirality of its Bouligand structure. Catastrophic crack growth is hindered in two ways. When crack growth follows the helicoidial structure between layers of chitin fibers, a large surface area per crack length is produced. Therefore, there is high total energy dissipated during club impact and crack propagation. When cracks propagate through neighboring layers, growth is hampered because of modulus oscillation. The Bouligand structure has anisotropic stiffness, resulting in an elastic modulus oscillation through the layers. Overall damage tolerance is improved, with crack propagation depending on growth direction in relation to chitin fiber orientation. = Fish =  Arapaima  Arapaima's hierarchical structure. The Arapaima fish's outer scales are designed to resist piranha bites. This is achieved through the scales' hierarchical architecture. The thinness of the scales and their overlapping arrangement allow for flexibility during movement. This also influences how much a single scale will bend when a predator attacks. In the species Arapaima gigas, each scale has two distinct structural regions which results in a scale that is resistant to puncture and bending. The outer layer is about 0.5 mm thick and is highly mineralized, which makes it hard, promoting predator tooth fracture. The inner layer is about 1 mm thick and is made of mineralized collagen fibrils arranged in a Bouligand structure. In the fibrils, collagen molecules are embedded with hydroxyapatite mineral nanocrystals. Collagen fibrils align in the same direction to make a layer of collagen lamella, of about 50 Œºm in thickness. Lamellae are stacked with a misalignment in orientation, creating a Bouligand structure. When the scales bend during an attack, stress is distributed due to the corrugated morphology. The largest deformation is designed to occur in the inner core layer. The inner layer can support more plastic deformation than the brittle outer layer. This is because the Bouligand structure can adjust its lamellar layers to adapt to applied forces. Adjustment of the Bouligand structure during loading has been measured using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The four mechanisms through which adjustments occur are fibril rotation, collagen fibril stretching, tensile opening between fibrils, and sympathetic lamella rotation. Fibrils adapting to the loading environment enhance the flexibility of the lamellae. This contributes resistance to scale bending, and therefore increases fracture resistance. As a whole, the outer scale layer is hard and brittle, while the inner layer is ductile and tough.  Carp  A similar Bouligand structure was found in the scales of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Compared to the arapaima, the mineral content in carp scales is lower, while exhibiting higher total energy dissipation in tensile testing as well as higher fibril extensibility.  Biomimicry  = Additive Manufacturing = Additive manufacturing is a popular upcoming form of industry which allows for complex geometries and unique performance characteristics for AM parts. The main issue with mechanical properties of AM parts is the introduction of microstructural heterogeneities within layers of deposited material. These defects, including porosity and unique interfaces, result in anisotropy of the mechanical response of the workpiece, which is undesirable. To combat this anisotropic mechanical response, a Bouligand- inspired tool path is used to deposit the material in a twisted Bouligand structure. This results in a stress transfer mechanism which uses interlayer heterogeneities as stress deflection points, thus strengthening the workpiece at these points. Bouligand tool paths are used specifically in cement/ceramic deposition AM. Bouligand-inspired AM parts have been observed to behave better than cast elements under mechanical stress.  Pitch Angle  A critical parameter in the development of the Bouligand-inspired tool path is the pitch angle. The pitch angle Œ≥ is the angle at which the helicoidal structure is formed. The relative size of the pitch angle is critical for the mechanical response of a Bouligand-inspired AM toolpiece. For Œ≥ < 45¬∞ (small angle), interfacial crack growth and interfacial microcracking is observed. For 45¬∞ < Œ≥ < 90¬∞ (large pitch angle), dominant crack growth through the solid is observed. = Battery Electrodes = Crab shells which already have the Bouligand structure can be used as templates for nanostructured battery electrodes. Crab shells are a low-cost, sustainable alternative to otherwise expensive starting materials and processing methods for nanostructures batteries. The crab shells have a Bouligand structure composed of highly mineralized chitin fibers. The structure can be used as a bio-template to make hollow carbon nanofibers. The desired battery materials, often sulfur and silicon, can be contained in these hollow fibers to create the cathodes and anodes. = Nanocellulose Films = Cellulose nanocrystals self assemble into helicoldical thin films, the pitch angle between the layers can then be modified via solvent processing. The resulting nanocellulose films, which have a Bouligand structure, can be manipulated to achieve various effects on the material properties. These nanocellulose films are impact-resistant, sustainable, and multi-functional and can be used in various applications such as stretchable electronics, protective coatings, eyewear, and body armor.

Early life and India  The coffin lid of Iufenamun, Egyptian high priest, presented by Colin Scott-Moncrieff to the Royal Scottish Museum Scott- Moncrieff was born in 1836, the son of Robert Scott Moncrieff. After training at the East India Company's establishment in Addiscombe, he was commissioned into the Bengal Engineers, party of the Company's private army which was soon integrated into the British army. He arrived in India in 1858, and was involved in clearing-up operations after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but was soon employed in the Indian irrigation system, becoming Chief Engineer of the Jumna Canal, then Superintending Engineer of the Ganges Canal from 1869‚Äì77, and Chief Engineer of Burma until 1883. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1878.  Egypt  Retiring with the honorary rank of Colonel, on his way home he was summoned to Cairo to meet Lord Dufferin who offered him \\"the keys of the Nile\\" ‚Äì the position of Director of Irrigation for Egypt, then still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, but in practice controlled by the British. His first priority was the Nile Barrage, designed to retain water to irrigate the Delta, which had been built at great expense between 1843 and 1862 but soon abandoned when cracks appeared in its structure. Scott Moncrieff arranged for a trial closing of the gates allowing a limited operation, while carefully monitoring the cracks. The results were so successful in terms of improved agricultural yield that he was able to ask for, and get, a million pounds for a complete repair and strengthening of the Barrage, which was carried out between 1885 and 90. Over a period of nine years he reorganised the whole irrigation system and \\"was so successful in improving the whole irrigation system that Egypt, from being a bankrupt country, became comparatively flourishing\\". For his work in Egypt he was appointed KCMG.  After Egypt  Scott-Moncrieff returned to Britain in 1892 and served as Under-Secretary for Scotland from 1892 to 1902. From 1901 to 1903, at the invitation of Lord Curzon, the Viceroy, Scott-Moncrieff served as President of a Commission to investigate and report on the prospects for further developing the Indian irrigation system.

She has released two critically acclaimed albums: No Burden (2016) and Historian (2018). In 2018, she formed Boygenius with Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker. Early life Dacus grew up in the suburbs of Richmond, Virginia. She graduated from Maggie L. Walker Governor's School and began studying film at Virginia Commonwealth University but left to pursue her music career. Career Dacus first performed in New York City in March 2015. Her first single, \\"I Don't Wanna Be Funny Anymore\\", premiered in November 2015. Her debut album, No Burden, was produced in Nashville by her hometown friends, Berklee College of Music graduate Collin Pastore and Oberlin Conservatory of Music graduate Jacob Blizard, and was originally released digitally on CD, and on vinyl via Richmond's EggHunt Records on February 26, 2016. No Burden was engineered and mixed by Collin Pastore. Dacus was then signed to Matador Records, who re-released the album on September 9, 2016. In the same year she performed at Lollapalooza, in Chicago's Grant Park and made her national television debut on CBS This Morning. She recorded a Tiny Desk Concert for NPR the same weekend. In October 2016 she played the London Calling festival in Amsterdam, as a replacement for The Duke Spirit, who were forced to cancel. Dacus's second album, entitled Historian, was released on March 2, 2018. Like its predecessor, it was met with widespread critical acclaim. Writing for Pitchfork, Sasha Gessen praised its nuance and sensitivity: \\" It‚Äôs not an easy album to wear out. It lasts, and it should, given that so many of its lyrics pick at time, and the way time condenses around deep emotional attachments to other people.\\" Rolling Stone rated the album 4/5 stars, as did NME. Historian, like No Burden, was recorded in Nashville, at Trace Horse Studio, in a similar collaborative effort by Lucy Dacus, Jacob Blizard, and Collin Pastore. In September 2016, Democratic vice- presidential candidate Tim Kaine stated in an interview that Dacus was a \\"new favorite\\". In a 2019 interview, Dacus revealed that she had attended kindergarten with Kaine's daughter and that she considers him to be an old family friend. In 2018, Dacus, along with Phoebe Bridgers and Julien Baker, formed the group Boygenius. They released three songs in August 2018 and subsequently announced an EP and tour. The EP, titled boygenius, came out on October 26, 2018. To coincide with Valentine's Day 2019, Dacus released a cover of La Vie en rose, the first in a planned series of songs commemorating major holidays.

Auchincloss, and Robert Olds, as well as her children, authors Gore Vidal and Nina Auchincloss. Early life Nina's father, U.S. Senator Thomas Gore Nina S. Gore was born on July 25, 1903 to U.S. Senator Thomas Gore and his wife Nina Belle Kay (1877‚Äì1963), a Texas plantation owner's daughter.Kauffman, Bill (2006-11-20) The Populist Patriotism of Gore Vidal , The American Conservative She had a younger brother, Thomas Notley Gore (1910‚Äì1964). Her father, who lost his eyesight during his youth, was said to have been an atheist and had a strong misanthropic streak. Nina's son would later write that \\"he was a genuine populist; but he did not like people very much. He always said no to anyone who wanted government aid.\\" He was claimed to have said that \\"If there was any race other than the human race, I'd go join it.\\"Vidal, Gore, Point to Point Navigation: A Memoir, 1964 to 2006 (New York: Doubleday, 2006), 19 Thomas Gore died in 1949. Life and personality In 1928, Gore made her Broadway debut in Sign of the Leopard, which opened at the National Theatre. In 1940, Nina, an alternate delegate from Virginia to the Democratic convention announced her support of Wendell Willkie over Roosevelt. From 1925 until 1950, she lived in Washington, D.C.. She later split her time between Cuernavaca, Mexico, and Southampton, New York. In the seven years preceding her death, she lived in San Antonio, Texas. Nina was known as a vivacious, quixotic, and unpredictable person. Her son Gore referred to her as an alcoholic and \\"certifiably insane,\\" as she likely suffered from bipolar disorder. She was candid about her sexual exploits and was said to have had an affair with John Hay Whitney in the early 1930s while he was married to Liz Whitney Tippett, at the same time Liz had an affair with Nina Vidal's husband, Eugene Vidal. She was also described thus: > \\"When she enters a room you feel here comes everything that is fresh, > healthy and beautiful. Her skin glows warmly and her huge brown eyes are > bright. An outdoor woman, she is full of indoor charm. Rides every day of > her life.\\" Gore was glamorous and has been described as a flighty mother with an apparent lack of maternal interest in her children. Her son, Gore Vidal, would later say about his mother, \\"we rarely got into a conversation. It was pointless. She didn‚Äôt see me. I wished I didn‚Äôt see her.\\" In 1969, she loaned Gore $3,000 toward the purchase of Edgewater, his estate on the Hudson River. Personal life In 1922, Gore married Eugene Luther Vidal, an American commercial aviation pioneer. Because her father was ill and couldn't attend, U.S. Representative William A. Rodenberg walked her down the aisle. They divorced in 1935. Together, they had one child: *Gore Vidal (1925-2012), the writer. In 1935, Nina married Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Jr. (1897-1976), the son of Hugh Dudley Auchincloss, Sr. (1858‚Äì1913), a merchant and financier, and Emma Brewster Jennings. Hugh had previously been married to Maya Auchincloss (1899-1990), a Russian noblewoman, from 1925 to 1932. Hugh and Maya had one child, Hugh Dudley Auchincloss III (1927‚Äì2015). Together, Nina and Hugh had two children: *Nina Auchincloss (born 1937), who married Newton Steers (1917‚Äì1993) in 1957, after having briefly dated Ted Kennedy. They divorced in 1974 when she married Michael Whitney Straight (1916‚Äì2004), a member of the Whitney family who was a publisher and novelist. Straight was the son of Willard Dickerman Straight (1880‚Äì1918), an investment banker who died in Michael's infancy, and Dorothy Payne Whitney (1887‚Äì1968), a philanthropist. They divorced in 1998. *Thomas Gore Auchincloss (born 1939), who married Diana Lippert (b. 1940) in 1960. She was the daughter of Bernhard G.

He was best known as the original drummer of Widespread Panic, a band he was a member of until his departure in 2016. He struggled with chronic illness for the remainder of his life, ultimately leading up to his death in 2020.  Early life  Todd Nance was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. As a child, he began playing the guitar; subsequently he was given his first drum kit on Christmas Day, 1975. It was around this time that he attended his first concert, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and was inspired to pursue music more seriously. He first met his future Widespread Panic bandmate Michael Houser in high school in either 1977 or 1978 and they formed the band Just Us. After graduating from high school in 1981, Nance moved to Atlanta.  Widespread Panic  Nance reconnected with Michael Houser in 1986 and joined the band that Houser had formed with John Bell and Dave Schools. The quartet performed their first show as Widespread Panic in February that same year. They developed a local following around Athens, Georgia before developing into a nationally known act. Nance played drums on the band's first eleven studio albums (he did not perform on their 2015 album, Street Dogs, but he did receive co-writing credit on all of the album's tracks). Along with all the other members of Widespread Panic, Nance was a member of the band brute. between 1995 and 2002. This band consisted of everyone in Widespread Panic at the time (except for Domingo Ortiz, although he did perform on the band's second album) and Vic Chesnutt. They released two albums, Nine High a Pallet and Co-Balt. He took a hiatus from Widespread Panic beginning in late 2014 to deal with personal matters. He was replaced for all live dates by Duane Trucks. He rejoined the band for four shows in February 2016 at their \\"Panic en La Playa\\" destination event. Following this, Widespread Panic announced that Nance had officially left the band and would be replaced by Trucks permanently.  Other projects  Nance co-founded the supergroup Barbara Cue in 1997 with William Tonks, John Neff, Jon Mills, and Crumpy Edwards. The project was originally formed as an NRBQ cover band, but they soon developed their own material and began recording; they released three studio albums. During his hiatus from Widespread Panic, Nance performed sporadically with a band billed as Todd Nance & Friends. Some musicians who performed with him in this group included Luther Dickinson, Jerry Joseph, and David Barbe. In addition to these bands, Nance sat in with a number of bands following his hiatus and departure from Widespread Panic including Bloodkin and the Dyrty Byrds.  Death  Nance died on August 19, 2020, in Athens, Georgia. He was 57; his death was first announced on Facebook by collaborator Cody Dickinson and was later confirmed by Relix. Details on the chronic illness that led to his death have not been disclosed.

The battle finished with the defeat of the Caribbean power in the Caracas Valley, Venezuela where Spanish intentions for colonization had been held at bay for 7 years. Battle In 1568, while Diego de Losada had been camping out in Santiago de Le√≥n of Caracas‚Äôs recently established villa, Guaicaipuro worked to convince all the surrounding chiefs to join, with a large quantity of soldiers, in the Maracapana Savannah (place of the Maracas). The Maracapana Savannah is a plain close to the Catia Laguna with groupings of palm trees and gourd trees that were very valuable to the native people, where they would take gourds to make maracas. The Savannah is in the vicinity of what is now the West Park and Sucre Plaza (Parque del Oeste y Plaza Sucre) in the City of Caracas. From this elevated site of the Caracas Valley, a general attack would be fought against the conquistadors with the leverage to accomplish a definite victory because of the surprise factor. As the day arrived, the Caribbean coalition armies gathered in the indicated place. There were 16 chiefs, in total, who originated from the coast and interim mountain ranges. Many of the chiefs did not come due to the bad timing and lack of coordination. Tiuna brought 4,000 soldiers together and marched towards the battle camp where they were united with Guaicamacuto and Aricabuto. Shortly after they were also united with Naiguat√°, Uripat√°, Anarigua, Mamacuri, Querequemare, Prepocunate, Baruta, Chacao, Araguaire and Guarauguta with 7, 000 soldiers; in representation of the mariches (a Venezuelan tribe) they came with 3,000 men commanded by Aricabuto and Aramaipuro.

The archives serves as the repository for historical records generated by the City of Vancouver, including the Mayor's Office, the Parks Board, the Board of Police Commissioners, the Vancouver Police Department, and the Office of the City Clerk. It also contains numerous collections from private donors, businesses, and community groups. The archives are part of the City Clerk's Department. History The archives began as the personal collection of J. S. Matthews, who was born in Wales, and settled in Vancouver in 1898. For decades he collected and catalogued artifacts, solicited donations, interviewed early inhabitants of the young city, and wrote historical narratives. The archives began in Major Matthews' home until he was eventually given space by the City in various locations and was officially made the City's archivist in 1933. He moved the collection back into his home for a period following a dispute with Mayor Gerry McGeer over ownership of the collection. The archives did not find a permanent home in his lifetime, but were given to the city with the condition of a dedicated building in his will within one year after his death in 1970. Facilities The first space provided for the archives by the city was in the attic of the old City Hall on Main Street, in 1931. In 1933, the archives moved to the temporary City Hall in the Holden Building on East Hastings Street. In 1936, the archives moved again to the new City Hall at Cambie Street and West 12th Avenue. In 1959, the archives moved again to space in the Main Library on Burrard Street. The current archives building, located at 1150 Chestnut Street, is a semi-underground modern structure in Vanier Park, designed by Bill Leithead. When the building was opened in 1972, it was the first building in Canada built specifically as a city archive. City Archivists *1933‚Äì1970 J. S.

Sikic Branimir Ivan Sikic is an American medical doctor and scientist at Stanford University School of Medicine. He is an oncologist and cancer pharmacologist, and has served as a faculty member at Stanford University since 1979. His research spans basic, translational, and clinical research and investigates the mechanisms of drug resistance and the development of new anticancer therapies. Early life Sikic was born in Graz, Austria, on October 18, 1947. His parents were refugees from Croatia, his father a mathematician and his mother a linguist. The family emigrated to Adelaide, Australia in 1949, and to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1956.\\"Goodbye Dear Old Homeland\\" by Yasna Sikic Hood Sikic graduated from St. Xavier High School as president of his class in 1964 at age 16, and attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he obtained a B.S. degree in Biology in 1968. Education and training Sikic attended the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, graduating with an M.D. in 1972. He returned to Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. for an internship and residency in internal medicine (1972-5). From 1975-8 he was a postdoctoral laboratory research fellow at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), working on the regulation of drug metabolism and the pharmacology and pulmonary toxicology of the anticancer drug bleomycin. He returned to Georgetown in 1978-9 to complete a clinical fellowship in medical oncology, prior to joining the faculty at Stanford University.Stanford Faculty Profile Honors and awards In 1992 Sikic began directing the General Clinical Research Center and then the Center for Clinical and Translational ResearchNew Freidenrich Center Will Help Streamline Clinical Research in 2008. He is the founder and director of the Central European Oncology Congress held in Opatija, Croatia since 1998. In 2010 he was awarded the Katarina Zrinska Medal for Science and Medicine by the President of Croatia.President of Croatia Honors Work of Stanford Oncologist Contributions to science =Mechanisms and regulation of multidrug resistance= Sikic has made significant contributions to understanding the biology and clinical significance of multidrug resistance (MDR), particularly the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) multidrug transporter and regulation of the ABCB1 gene. He discovered that deletion of aa335 changes the drug-binding spectrum and is integral to the pharmacophore of P-gp. He also defined specific sites of transactivation of ABCB1, and mechanisms of amplification of the gene. =Clinical trials of modulation of multidrug resistance= The laboratory work on drug resistance mechanisms led to a series of clinical Phase I-III trials that defined this field. Early on, Sikic's group found that P-gp inhibition resulted in significant pharmacokinetic alterations of several anticancer drugs, with the potential for markedly increased toxicities unless doses were adjusted. These findings, and the co-existence of other resistance mechanisms in human cancers, redefined the field and demonstrated the limited clinical utility of MDR modulation. =Cancer genomics= The Sikic group utilized gene expression profiling and systems biology to yield insight into cancer taxonomy and prognostic and predictive signatures for cancer therapies. With their colleagues Olivier Gevaert and Sylvia Plevritis, they have identified driver genes for ovarian cancers.

Many countries in the Pacific region take part in these exercises, which usually focus on delivering humanitarian aid, evacuating civilians, and reestablishing security in the wake of a simulated disaster. Overview Croix du Sud is the French term for Southern Cross. It is the largest humanitarian assistance and disaster relief training exercise in the South Pacific. France hosts and organises the exercises through its New Caledonian Armed Forces, headquartered in Noumea. In alternate years, the concept for the next Croix du Sud is developed through a desktop exercise called Equateur. A typical scenario would be a category-four cyclone disaster, resulting in poor sanitation, hunger, disease, and an outbreak of looting and rape which targets foreigners. Other scenarios have included extremists disrupting government control and inciting riots. The Australian Department of Defence says Croix du Sud aims to maintain interoperability among regional defence and police forces. The exercise is also an opportunity to practise maritime surveillance, along with stability and security operations. The exercise takes place in accordance with a 1992 agreement between France, Australia and New Zealand. In recent years, Australia has increased its military ties with France, buying submarines and acknowledging in white papers that France has interests in the region. Participants Many countries whose militaries are active in the Pacific Ocean have committed personnel and equipment to the exercise. NGOs have also taken part. Participants in past exercises have included: * Australia: heavy landing craft and , amphibious landing platform , landing ship , minehunters and , Sea King helicopters, infantry from the 2nd Royal Australian Regiment, Hercules transport aircraft, and Super King Air utility aircraft. * Canada: Hercules transport aircraft. * Chile: observers * Fiji: observers an infantry platoon, patrol boat , * France: patrol ship D'Entrecasteaux. ** New Caledonia: Troupes de marine, vessels and troops of the Maritime Gendarmerie, National Gendarmerie, the frigate Vend√©miaire, transport aircraft including CN-235, and local civilians. ** French Polynesia * Japan * New Zealand: multi- role/strategic sealift vessel,, patrol boat , helicopters, special forces and an infantry platoon from the 1st Battalion of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment. * Papua New Guinea * International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement * Singapore * Solomon Islands * Tonga: patrol boat. * United Kingdom: forces stationed in Brunei * United States: Marine Rotational Force ‚Äì Darwin, troops from Hawaii including US Marines and infantry and civil affairs soldiers from the 9th Mission Support Command. * Vanuatu: patrol boat.

Vulvodynia is a chronic pain syndrome. It refers to the severe pain caused in the vulvar area and the causes are usually difficult to diagnose. The symptoms also include burning sensations and feelings of irritation. Buttocks and inner thighs are also affected by vulvodynia. Vestibulodynia is similar to vulvodynia, except that the chronic pain and irritation is present in the vestibule, which is near the entrance of the vagina, while in case of vulvodynia, the pain is localised near the vulva. Vestibulectomy may be partial or complete. Vulvar vestibulectomy is also used to help people who suffer from provoked vestibulodynia, which causes sexual pain to women. It is considered as an effective treatment for the long-run and has recorded high levels of satisfaction from the patients. In spite of the high successful rates, vestibulectomy is often only regarded as a last resort.  Procedure  The surgery takes place below the urinary meatus, down to the border of the perineal area and includes the fourchette. Incisions are made on each side adjacent and parallel to the labia minora. The structures removed are the hymen, mucous membrane, Bartholin glands ducts and minor vestibular glands. In some surgeries, the amount of tissue removed is not so extensive. Vaginal mucosa tissue remains attached and then is pulled downward to cover the area where tissue was removed. This surgery is also used to treat lichen sclerosus. \\"The complete surgery removes the entire lateral hymenal tissues to the lateral vestibular walls at Hart‚Äôs line, and involves removal of the entire posterior fourchette from the posterior hymenal remnants down to the perineum\\" which barring complications, enables the entire procedure to be over within an hour. The procedure involves minimal bleeding and is usually done using local anesthesia. The amount of tissue removed during the surgery can vary with respect to the pain.  Complications  Complications related to vestibulectomy include bleeding, infection. Long-term complications can be weakness of the anal muscles, cosmetic changes, development of a Bartholin's cyst, a decline in vaginal lubrication. Reports of satisfaction with the outcome of the surgical procedure can be as high as 90%. The procedure has been known to be unsuccessful in rare cases, where the pain remained constant even after surgery. In such cases, alternative treatments like oral medicines or more surgeries may be considered, depending on the severity of the persisting pain.  Recovery  The recovery period is about 6‚Äì12 weeks, depending on the amount of vulvar tissues removed. Post-surgery, the patient might need further physical and possible mental therapy to avoid scarring and lead a regular sexual life.  Epidemiology  In a study done in 2006, it was discovered that 93% of patients who had undergone the surgery recommended it for vulvar pain. Only 11% of women continued to have issues in their sex lives post-surgery. https://hymenshop.com/  References  Bibliography * Hoffman, Barbara (2012). Williams gynecology.

Life Originally from Dendermonde in the County of Flanders, Vrancx studied Theology at Leuven University, graduating in 1560, and in 1569 was appointed to a canonry of St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent.Philip Marie Blommaert, De Nederduitsche schryvers van Gent (Ghent, 1861), pp. 186-190. After the Calvinist takeover of the city in 1578, Vrancx remained in Ghent despite the clergy of the cathedral being declared banished. He was caught and expelled in 1579, and his books and devotional objects were burnt on the market square.J. Winnepenninckx, \\"Vrancx, Cornelius Columbanus\\", Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek, vol. 1 (Brussels, 1964), 960-966.

The community returned to Ghent in 1584, and Vrancx was professed as a monk in the abbey of St Peter. He was appointed prior in 1590, and elected abbot in 1597. He died in Ghent on 15 August 1615.

He also refined the practice of experiential training for activists which he calls \\"Direct Education\\". A Quaker, he has co-founded and led numerous organizations and campaigns for justice and peace.  Early life  He was born to Dora M. and Russell George Lakey (a slate miner) in Bangor, Pennsylvania. He was identified as a prospective child preacher for his church, and at age 12, he gave a sermon promoting racial equality as the will of God, although his sermon was not well-received at the time. He graduated from Cheyney University in southeastern Pennsylvania, and also studied at the University of Oslo, Norway, where he married Berit Mathiesen in 1960, and taught at an Oslo high school. He continued his sociology studies at the University of Pennsylvania.  Activist career  In the late 1950s, Lakey was active in the ban-the-bomb movement, then participated in the civil rights movement, in 1963 being arrested in a sit-in. The following year he was a trainer for Mississippi Freedom Summer and co-authored his first book, A Manual for Direct Action, which was widely used in the South by the civil rights movement. In 1966 he co-founded the national body A Quaker Action Group (AQAG), whose activities took him in 1967 to Vietnam to participate in the sailing ship Phoenix's protest action in South Vietnam seeking to give medical supplies to the anti-war Buddhist movement there. In 1970, Lakey was active within AQAG in the successful direct action in the Puerto Rican struggle to stop the U.S. Navy from using the island of Culebra for target practice. In 1971 he helped found Movement for a New Society (MNS), a network of autonomous groups working for a nonviolent revolution. The network featured living collectives and co-ops as well as participation in national movements of the 1970s and '80s. The network's training program at the Philadelphia Life Center Association became highly influential in the US and abroad in spreading Paulo Freire's Popular education and other participatory training methods. During the 1970s, he also gave national leadership to the Campaign to Stop the B-1 Bomber and Promote Peace Conversion, which succeeded in persuading Congress and President Carter to de-fund this Air Force program. In 1976 he co- organized Men Against Patriarchy, a pioneering anti-sexism movement for men. In 1982 he organized the Pennsylvania section of a national labor/community coalition named \\"Jobs with Peace\\" and directed that effort for seven years.Spirituality, Religion, and Peace Education, By Edward J. Brantmeier, Jing Lin, INFORMATION AGE PUBLISHING, John P. Miller, pg 90 In 1991, he co- founded with Philadelphia activist Barbara Smith, Training for Change (TfC). Building on previous training at the Martin Luther King Jr. School for Social Change and Movement for a New Society, Training for Change developed a new pedagogy called \\"Direct Education\\". Training for Change did trainings and consultations for activists and nongovernmental organizations in 20 countries. In 2009, Lakey co-founded Earth Quaker Action Team (EQAT), to build a just and sustainable economy through nonviolent direct action campaigns. The group won its first campaign, forcing PNC Bank to stop financing mountaintop removal coal mining in Appalachia. In that campaign, while in his seventies, Lakey was arrested and also led a 200-mile march.  Academic career  Lakey's first teaching post in higher education was in the Martin Luther King Jr. School of Social Change, a division of Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. Lakey helped formulate the curriculum and then taught there for its first four years, 1965‚Äì69. In this period he systematized the field of \\"Experiential Nonviolence Training\\" and the students were supported in efforts to connect field training with theory in direct actions. Later Lakey joined the Peace Studies program at the University of Pennsylvania, successfully expanding its undergraduate offerings and the participation of minority students. In addition, he helped lead a University of Pennsylvania group dynamics lab promoting innovative feminist leadership. He also taught peace studies at Haverford College. He later taught at Temple University and much later he accepted the endowed Eugene M. Lang Visiting Professorship in Issues of Social Change at Swarthmore College. He continued at Swarthmore as a Lang Professor and then as a research professor until his retirement. In 2010, Lakey was named by the National Peace and Justice Studies Association as \\"Peace Educator of the Year\\".  LGBT activism  In 1973, Lakey came out in public as a gay man, and joined the LGBT movement, becoming part of what he later would call \\"Gay Liberation's early visionary days.\\"  Works  *A Manual for Direct Action: Strategy and Tactics for Civil Rights and All Other Nonviolent Protest Movements, co-author with Martin Oppenheimer; Chicago IL: Quadrangle Books, 1965 *In Place of War: Moving toward a New Society, co- author with the American Friends Service Committee working party; lead author: James E.

Originally 87 F, a 250t-class torpedo boat of the Austro-Hungarian Navy built in 1914‚Äì1915, she was armed with two guns and four torpedo tubes, and could carry 10‚Äì12 naval mines. She saw active service during World War I, performing convoy, patrol, escort and minesweeping tasks, anti-submarine operations and shore bombardment missions. Following Austria-Hungary's defeat in 1918, 87 F was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed T5. At the time, she and the seven other 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels of the fledgling maritime force. During the interwar period, T5 and the rest of the navy were involved in exercises of training and cruises to friendly ports, but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets. The ship was captured by the Italians during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the Royal Italian Navy under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic Sea. Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, she was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile and served as T5. At the end of the war, she was transferred to the new Yugoslav Navy and served as Cer until she was broken up in 1962. Background In 1910, the Austria- Hungary Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a coastal torpedo boat, specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours. This specification was based on an expectation that the Strait of Otranto, where the Adriatic Sea meets the Ionian Sea, would be blockaded by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the Austro-Hungarian Navy () base at the Bay of Kotor to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. Steam turbine power was selected for propulsion, because diesels with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run turbo-electric boats. Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when a competing boatbuilder, Ganz-Danubius, reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated the F-group. The F-group designation signified the location of Ganz-Danubius' main shipyard at Fiume. Description and construction The 250t-class F-group boats had a waterline length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . While their designed displacement was , they displaced about fully loaded. The crew consisted of 38‚Äì41 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by two AEG-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal. The turbines were rated at with a maximum output of and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of . They carried of coal and of fuel oil, which gave them a range of at . The F-group had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Due to inadequate funding, 87 F and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for \\"high seas\\" operations. They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems. The boats were armed with two ≈†koda L/30 guns, and four torpedo tubes. They could also carry 10‚Äì12 naval mines. 87 F was laid down on 5 March 1914, launched on 20 March 1915 and completed on 25 October of that year. Career =World War I= During World War I, 87 F was used for convoy, patrol, escort and minesweeping tasks, anti-submarine operations, and shore bombardment missions. On 3 February 1916, 87 F and two other 250t-class boats were involved in a shore bombardment operation against Ortona and San Vito Chietino, led by the armoured cruiser . Three days later, the scout cruiser , 87 F and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser and French destroyer north of Durazzo in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. On 9 July, the scout cruiser led a force which included 87 F and two s in a raid on the Otranto Barrage, the Allied naval blockade of the Strait of Otranto, which resulted in the sinking of two drifters. On 4 November, three Italian destroyers and three torpedo boats were involved in a brief encounter in the northern Adriatic with two Austro-Hungarian destroyers accompanied by 87 F and two other 250t-class boats. The following day, the same three torpedo boats conducted a shore bombardment of Sant'Elpidio a Mare. In 1917, one of her 66 mm guns was placed on an anti-aircraft mount. On 28 November 1917, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, 87 F joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of Porto Corsini, Marotta and Cesenatico. By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats to get through the strait and into the Mediterranean Sea. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Konteradmiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with battleships, scout cruisers, and destroyers. During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the dreadnought battleships and . At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the harbour defence barrage opened, the dreadnoughts and , escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including 87 F, also departed Pola and set course for Slano, north of Ragusa, to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June, while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast, two Royal Italian Navy () MAS boats, MAS 15 and MAS 21, spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes missed. Under the command of Luigi Rizzo, MAS 15 fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit Szent Istv√°n. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on Szent Istv√°n were abreast her boiler rooms, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. Szent Istv√°n capsized less than three hours after being torpedoed. In October 1918, 87 F was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force. She escaped with minor damage, in what was the last major action involving the Austro-Hungarian Navy. =Interwar period= 87 F survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye by which rump Austria officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, 93 F, 96 F and 97 F, and four 250t-class T-group boats, she served with the Royal Yugoslav Navy (, KJRM; –ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞ –à—É–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –†–∞—Ç–Ω–∞ –ú–æ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ä–∏—Ü–∞). Transferred in March 1921, in KJRM service, 87 F was renamed T5. In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy. In May‚ÄìJune 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija, the submarine tender Hvar and the submarines and , on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. It is not clear if T5 was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval attach√© reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. =World War II and post-war service= In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered World War II when it was invaded by the German-led Axis powers. At the time of the invasion, T5 was assigned to the 3rd Torpedo Division located at ≈†ibenik, which included her three former F-group sisters. On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of Zara on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of Zaton into Lake Prokljan, where they remained until 11 April. On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at Milna on the island of Braƒç, and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor. All four former F-group boats were then captured by the Italians. T5 was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two L/40 anti-aircraft guns, but no other significant alterations were made to her. After the Italians capitulated in September 1943, she was returned to the KJRM-in-exile in December of that year. T5 was commissioned by the Yugoslav Navy after the war, and renamed Cer. She was fitted with two guns on single mounts and one gun, and her torpedo tubes were also removed. She served until 1962, when she was broken up.

Employing Mirage F1 fighters loaded with incendiary bombs, and two MiG-23s as fighter cover, Iraq intended to demonstrate to the coalition that it was capable of offensive air actions. Although the aircraft penetrated well into Saudi airspace due to skilled flying and luck, both bombers were shot down before they could reach their target by a Royal Saudi Air Force F-15C after their fighter cover fled. This was the only major instance during the war that Iraq attempted an offensive air operation outside of Iraq. Offensive air operations by the Iraqi Air Force would cease nearly entirely six days later after a last ditch operation to shoot down coalition F-15s. Prelude Between September and November 1990, Iraqi Air Force planners realised that they had a severe disadvantage against the growing Coalition air forces that they would be facing. As a result, they planned several daring mission plans to possibly attempt against Coalition forces. Among them was a plan to sink an aircraft carrier, a plan to bomb the anticipated amphibious assault by US Marines in Kuwait, and a plan for a deep strike into Saudi Arabia in order to take out Coalition military leaders. Almost all of these missions had extremely high attrition rates for Iraqi pilots (sinking an aircraft carrier was planned to take 34 aircraft, of which only 12 would reach the carrier, and none would return) Among them was a plan to bomb the Ras Tanura Oil Production facility, which was responsible for approximately 7 million barrels of oil daily. For comparison, the entire country of Kuwait produced around 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, which alone caused oil prices around the world to double after the Iraqi invasion This was the only operation of all their ones planned that was attempted, although their plan to attack landing Marines was on call and ready to go at a moments notice should they ever have attempted the amphibious invasion. Luckily for the Coalition, it was a planned farce. Planning On 22 January, Iraqi leadership ordered the mission profile to attack Ras Tanura to be updated and executed. The planned date for the attack was 23 of January. In light of the ongoing war, Iraqi planners changed the mission profile several ways in order to improve their odds of success against Coalition air- power. The main change was the entire mission was going to be conducted from an altitude of approximately 30-50m, at speeds of around 580 mph. It was hoped that this would allow the Iraqi jets to enter Saudi airspace nearly undetected, or at least detected too late to stop the attack. Iraqi F1s were in fact EQ-4s loaded for the mission with two 400-kg bombs, Remora and Sycomor pods. Their departure was planned for early morning on 23 January when US jets bombed the airfield and destroyed two of the aircraft assigned to the mission. After prepping two more aircraft, another bombing raid later the same day destroyed another one. In addition, power was knocked out to the airfield temporarily, causing one of the aircraft to be trapped inside its hangar. The mission was delayed until 24 January. However, it was pushed back again due to delays in clearing cluster bombs around the aircraft hangars. The raid finally got off the ground in the early morning of 26 January. Mission The Iraqi aircraft took off with tanker aircraft and flew towards the Iranian border at extremely low altitudes to avoid detection. Once they reached the Iranian border, they turned south and headed towards their target. En route they had to complete an aerial refueling at an altitude of 100m, which they did successfully. The four jets continued on with the mission, making it to about 50 miles south of Kuwait unopposed. The reason for the lack of opposition, either by Iraqi planning or luck, was the flight path took them directly between the control zones of the US Navy and US Air Force, causing a large delay in either of them acting on the intruding enemy aircraft. Once they were detected, an AWAC promptly cleared the airspace in front of the Iraqi aircraft and vectored two Saudi F-15s against them. This was done under the direct orders of General Schwarzkopf, who wanted to demonstrate that the ongoing war was a multi-national conflict. Up until this point, only American aircraft had shot down Iraqi aircraft. The Royal Saudi Air Force was widely regarded as inferior in training and discipline to other Coalition air forces, and was seen as mediocre at best. For this reason, Saudi jets were kept well out of the active combat zone and assigned to patrols just inside the Saudi border in order to prevent them from interfering with ongoing operations by the rest of the coalition. It was for this reason that on top of vectoring the Saudi jets to intercept the Iraqi bombers, the AWACs routed a number of US Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers behind them in case the Saudis were unable to complete the air- air kill. Upon seeing the incoming F-15s, the two MiG-23s fled back to Iraq, leaving the Mirage F1s unprotected. Despite their fighter cover fleeing, the two Mirages piloted by Major. Ali Hussein Fadel and Capt. Mohammed Saleem, pressed on with the mission. Flying the lead Saudi F-15 was Capt. Iyad Al- Shamrani. Despite being given good vectors, Al-Shamrani struggled to complete the intercept. With the Iraqi bombers fast approaching Ras Tanura, the American AWACs went step-by-step with Al-Shamrani to line himself up behind the two remaining Iraqi jets. Al-Shamrani eventually managed to shoot both Iraqi jets down with AIM-9s, though only mere minutes before they reached their target. Both Iraqi pilots Fadel and Saleem were killed. Result Al- Shamrani instantly became a hero to the Saudi people, and to this day is the only Saudi fighter pilot with multiple air-air kills. He would go on to be the only non-American coalition pilot to claim any air-air victories for the duration of the war. The Iraqi mission report states that due to the low altitude of the mission, Iraqi radar lost contact with the aircraft soon after they crossed into Kuwait and it was assumed that they were shot down upon not returning to base.

The sole species is Sabahphrynus maculatus, also known as the spotted Asian tree toad or Sabah earless toad. It is endemic to Borneo where it is only known from Sabah, East Malaysia. Taxonomy Sabahphrynus, as currently understood, results from recognizing two little-known species, Pedostibes maculatus and Ansonia anotis, as conspecific. This taxon seems to be more closely related to Leptophryne, Ingerophrynus, and Didynamipus than to Ansonia and Pedostibes, although its exact closest relatives remain uncertain. In addition to being genetically a distinct lineage among Southeast Asian bufonids, it is also morphologically unique: it lacks middle-ear structures and tympanum. Description Sabahphrynus maculatus males grow to at least and females to in snout‚Äìvent length. The head has no bony crests and the parotoid glands are absent. The outer finger tips are expanded into spatulate discs. The subarticular tubercles are present, but weak. The webbing of toe is moderately developed. The males lack vocal sac opening and mandibular spines. The dorsum, at least in males, is light green. Habitat and distribution Sabahphrynus maculatus are found in the western lower montane Sabah, Borneo. Specimens are known from the Kinabalu Park and Crocker Range National Park.

Hack In June 2016, Boogie's YouTube account was temporarily closed due to an anonymous hacker. The unidentified person got hold of his phone number via Verizon during his time at VidCon and was able to gain access to his accounts associated with it, including his YouTube channel. His channel was restored less than a week later. Controversies Since 2018, Boogie has been involved in several controversies. In October 2018, Boogie faced scrutiny due to his relationship with the controversial counseling service BetterHelp. He and other YouTubers sponsored by the service were accused of profiting from mental illness, which led to Boogie publicly terminating his partnership with the company. Later in October 2018, Boogie was removed from a Dungeons & Dragons charity event due to concerns from LGBT activists over his support of Gamergate. In February 2019, Boogie joked that he would \\"make a better team leader\\" over another player due to their parents' divorce and correlated it with anger issues during a live stream of the game Apex Legends. He became the subject of criticism following these comments. In April 2019, Boogie admitted to potentially committing tax fraud. He stated that he purchases Magic: The Gathering cards for his channel, writes them off as a business expense, and then resells them without claiming the income on his taxes. The IRS states that income above $400 from self-employment must be reported. In June 2019, Boogie faced criticism after clips from older live streams of him making racially charged comments resurfaced. He commented during one live stream, \\"That's a lot of money, I guess, for a person of color, or is it not?\\" after receiving a $3 donation from a follower who frequently donated to him on his stream with the message \\"I am a black person\\". On June 27, 2019, Boogie announced on Twitter that he had purchased a new Tesla automobile. Following his announcement, Boogie held a live stream in early July in which he sarcastically asked for money to help pay for the new car, upsetting some of his viewers who took his comments seriously. Boogie subsequently received harsh criticism for his live stream, prompting him to clarify that he did not actually purchase the car, but rather only put a down payment on it, and that he had cancelled the order as a result of the backlash against him, among other things. In August 2019, Boogie made a controversial statement against his internet trolls where he claimed \\"I think that there are rapists and Nazis out there who... are more redeemable than you because at least they're doing something they believe in.\\" In August 2020, Boogie announced on Twitter that he was teaming up with Palangi Studios co-founders, Matt Murphy & Joe Boyajian, for an upcoming project. After no other details were announced regarding this project, Boogie tweeted about two guys who tried to hustle him into receiving a Playstation 5 before the release date was verified by Sony. There was significant backlash from the Palangi Studios community who felt that Boogie was blatantly insinuating the co-founders had been behind the scheme. Boogie eventually ended up removing the tweet and apologizing for the situation during a livestream, later blaming a recent panic attack for the accusations.

He played college football for Princeton University, and thereafter he played professionally for the Washington Redskins and New York Giants of the NFL, the Montreal Alouettes and BC Lions of the CFL, the Orlando Americans and Carolina Storm of the AFA, and the Tampa Bay Bandits, San Antonio Gunslingers, and Portland Breakers of the USFL.  Early life  Winters was born in Asbury Park in the Wanamassa section of Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. He grew up in nearby Tinton Falls and played high school football, basketball, and baseball for the Monmouth Regional High School Golden Falcons.Triblehorn, Chuck. \\"Calendar benefits gridders\\", Red Bank Register, September 11, 1974. Accessed October 25, 2017. \\"Ocean Township's Jim Falco has joined New Shrewsbury's Bill Kahl-Winter of Monmouth Regional on the Princeton varsity football squad.\\" He was an All- Shore and All-County selection as a three-year quarterback for the team and won the prestigious Thom McAn Scholar Athlete Award for Monmouth County his senior year. He also played catcher on the baseball team and forward on the basketball team.  College career  Winters received a full academic scholarship to Princeton University, where he graduated with a A.B. in History and a teaching certification in Social Studies. He lettered for the Princeton Tigers, starting out as a quarterback and then moving to tight end where he played his freshman, sophomore, and junior years. His senior year, he played tight end and offensive tackle.  Professional career  Upon graduation, Winters attended a free agent tryout camp, and earned a contract as an offensive lineman with George Allen's Washington Redskins in 1976, but was released in training camp. In 1977, he signed with new head coach John McVay and the New York Giants, receiving a $5,000 bonus. He suffered a ruptured appendix on July 26 due to dehydration after playing more than sixty five plays in 95 degree heat during a controlled offensive scrimmage against the New York Jets. Winters was expected to make the final roster, with McVay stating on August 9 that \\"We're going to keep a spot open on our final roster for him,\\" and \\"That's how much we think of him.\\" On August 17, Winters was placed on the non-football related injury list by the Giants in the hopes of being activated onto the roster once healthy, but developed an infection (peritonitis) keeping him out for the remainder of the season. Winters was released the following year in training camp on August 15, and picked up on a five-day trial by the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL. He went on to start for head coach Joe Scannella at right tackle for the remainder of the season, which included six of the next eight regular season games, two playoff games, and the 66th Grey Cup. The following year, he was traded to the BC Lions during training camp and played in one preseason game for head coach Vic Rapp but suffered a knee injury during it. The injury required surgery and resulted in him being placed on injured reserve for the season. He spent the 1980 season rehabilitating his knee and started a career as a financial consultant, and legally shortened his name to Bill Winters. He went on to play two full seasons in the AFA, starting twelve games at center for the Orlando Americans in 1981, and thirteen games at right guard and right tackle for the Carolina Storm in 1982. The Storm went undefeated at 13‚Äì0 and won the American Bowl league championship that year. In 1983, Winters signed on with John F. Bassett's Tampa Bay Bandits in the newly emerging USFL, where he started eleven of the team's first twelve games at left guard for head coach Steve Spurrier before sustaining a stress fracture of his right leg, ending his season. He was waived in training camp the following year in 1984, but recalled by the Bandits off waivers after the first regular season game. He was then waived again three games into the regular season, but was claimed by the San Antonio Gunslingers of the USFL, where he started thirteen of the last fourteen games at center for head coach Gil Steinke in their inaugural season. He also did the snapping for field goals and extra points. In 1985, he was traded in the off-season to the Portland Breakers where he rejoined his former line coach from San Antonio Mike Barry. He went on to play eighteen games for the Breakers, starting one game at right guard for head coach Dick Coury. The following year Winters was to sign and play for the Orlando Renegades of the USFL and head coach Lee Corso but the USFL ceased operations and Winters retired from professional football.  Life after football  Winters has worked as a financial consultant and insurance agent through the years, and continues to do it part-time. In addition, he has done some acting and voice over work, writing and some coaching. He authored a book called From the Outhouse to the Penthouse and Somewhere in Between: The Story of One Free Agent's Trip Through the Ranks of Pro Football. He is a lifetime member of the National Football League Players Association and a member of the Screen Actors Guild. After serving as a teacher for 9 years and a coach for 4 years in the Spring Independent School District in Houston, Texas, where he helped coach the Spring Dekaney High School Wildcats to the 2011 5A Division II State Football Championship, he resigned his position to pursue new opportunities.

It was built in August 1944 by the Lima Locomotive Works in Lima, Ohio, as the ninth engine of its class. It is a high powered fast freight locomotive that carried perishables between Chicago and Buffalo, New York. 763 was retired from service on the NKP and is currently awaiting restoration at the Age of Steam Roundhouse. Original career Nickel Plate 763's career consisted of pulling fast freights of perishables between Chicago and Buffalo. Pulling trains at up to 70 MPH, these engines quickly gained a reputation as high-speed brutes on the track. In 1958, due to lowering part supplies and the demand for more cheap and efficient motive power, the Nickel Plate removed all of its S-2's from service and sat dormant. The sister engine of 763, 765 was recommissioned to provide steam heat to a streamlined passenger train, and was the last Berkshire under steam for the Nickel Plate. Retirement Number 763 was ultimately retired at the end of 1958, and sat for nearly 2 years with the label of \\"stored serviceable\\" until 1960, when most of the Berkshires on the Nickel Plate were sent to scrap yards. Six berks were preserved, including 763. The 763 was put in a museum until in 1966, when the Norfolk & Western, NKP's new owner moved her to outdoor display at Wasena Park in Roanoke, Virginia. AFT Plan and Fall Through In 1976, 763 was moved to New Jersey for a possible overhaul as it was a contending locomotive to pull the American Freedom Train. Once the engine arrived it was to be checked over and restored to working condition and double head with no. 755. However, this plan fell through and 763 was sent back to Roanoke with Southern Pacific 4449 being chosen instead. Back In Roanoke to Present After the AFT fall through, NKP 763 was returned to Roanoke, where it was placed on display at the Virginia Museum of Transportation. The VMT ended up selling 763 to Jerry Jacobson, president of the Age of Steam Roundhouse and then CEO of Ohio Central Railroad for $125,000. In 2007, Jacobson returned 763 to her home state Ohio. The 763 is currently on static display awaiting restoration at the Age of Steam Roundhouse in Sugarcreek, Ohio. 763's restoration will cost more than $1,000,000.

This allows organizations taking the 501(h) election to potentially perform a large amount of lobbying if it is done using volunteer labor or through inexpensive means. The 501(h) election is available to most types of 501(c)(3) organizations that are not churches or private foundations. It was introduced by Representative Barber Conable as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 and codified as , and the corresponding Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations were finalized in 1990.  Lobbying restrictions  The Internal Revenue Service (headquarters pictured) regulates lobbying by tax- exempt organizations. Most 501(c)(3) organizations may switch from a subjective \\"substantial part test\\" to an objective \\"expenditure test\\" by making a 501(h) election. 501(c)(3) organizations, named after the section of the Internal Revenue Code that defines them, are the most common category of nonprofit organization in the United States. They make up 74% of all tax- exempt organizations as of 2013, encompassing organizations with charitable, educational, or religious missions. By default, 501(c)(3) organizations are subject to a provision that \\"no substantial part of the activities [may be] carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation\\". This test, called the substantial part test, is subjective and not precisely defined by the IRS, making it difficult for organizations engaging in policy advocacy to determine whether they are in compliance with the law. Under the 501(h) election, this is replaced with an objective expenditure test based only on the annual financial expenditure, with no other limits on the actual extent of the lobbying activities. An organization may take the 501(h) election by filing a one-page form with the IRS, which remains in effect until revoked by the organization. The 501(h) election is not available to churches or to private foundations. Lobbying is defined as attempting to influence legislation, and is divided into two categories. The first, direct lobbying, occurs through communication with any member or staff of Congress, or of a state or local legislature, or any government official participating in the formulation of legislation. The second, grassroots lobbying, is attempting to affect the opinion of the general public on legislation, although some communications to an organization's own members are excluded from this classification. The limit on lobbying expenditure is calculated as a fraction of the organization's total tax-exempt expenditures. For organizations with $500,000 or less of total tax-exempt expenditures in a given year, no more than 20% of that amount may be spent on lobbying. Decreasing percentages are allowed for organizations with higher tax-exempt expenditures, with an absolute spending cap of $1,000,000 eventually being reached. Lobbying expenses above the allowed amount are subject to a 25% excise tax, and excessive lobbying over a four-year period may lead to loss of tax-exempt status. This cap applies to the sum of direct and grassroots lobbying expenses. Grassroots lobbying is also subject to its own limit, which is one quarter of the total lobbying cap. Regardless of their 501(h) status, 501(c)(3) organizations may not participate in electoral campaigns or support specific candidates for office, a prohibition that has been in effect since the passage of the Johnson Amendment in 1954. Also, funds derived from federal government or private foundation grants or contracts may never be used for lobbying.  Effects  The expenditure caps provide a safe harbor for non- profit organizations engaging in policy advocacy. Because the limitation is expressed solely in terms of dollar amounts, organizations can effectively perform a large amount of lobbying if it is done through volunteer labor or through inexpensive media such as email or websites. However, the 501(h) election is not advantageous for very large non-profits whose lobbying expenditures exceed the $1,000,000 total cap or the $250,000 grassroots lobbying cap. These organizations may still be able to justify the expenditures as insubstantial if their operating budget is much larger, although it does entail increased risk. Multiple commentators have called non- profit lobbying beneficial because it balances lobbying by for-profit corporations. Tufts University political science professor Jeffrey Berry wrote in The Washington Post that, given that many non-profits are health care or social service providers, \\"they are the foot soldiers in a largely private system that delivers critical services to the disadvantaged. They are often closer to the problems‚Äîand the solutions‚Äîthan the policymakers in city halls, state capitals and Washington.\\" In initially enacting the provision, Congress intended to increase the flow of information from non-profits to the legislative process. Senator Edmund Muskie said of an early version of a lobbying reform bill in 1971 that \\"it is fundamental to our constitutional system that [tax-exempt organizations] should have equal access along with business groups and others in presenting views to Congress.\\" Nevertheless, as of 2009, only 1.3 percent of eligible 501(c)(3) organizations had taken the 501(h) election according to one count. A 2003 survey of non-profits found a widespread but erroneous belief that non-profit organizations were banned from political advocacy of any sort, with little awareness of the 501(h) election. This was attributed to the long gap between the provision's enactment by Congress in 1976 and the publications of final rules by the IRS in 1990 and the complexity of the 501(h) provisions, as well as the IRS's lack of interest in publicizing the provision. A 2013 survey of executive directors of non- profit organizations in Boston found that the organizations were 6.3 times more likely to engage in policy advocacy if they had taken a 501(h) election than those who did not.  History  alt=A headshot of Representative Barber Conable, a man in his 50s wearing a suit and thick-rimmed glasses = Background = Lobbying restrictions on non-profits date to Department of the Treasury regulations in 1919. These regulations denied tax-exempt status to organizations that engaged in \\"dissemination of controversial propaganda,\\" which included political advocacy. In the influential 1930 case Slee v. Commissioner, the American Birth Control League's tax-exempt status was revoked due to its publication of a magazine supporting the repeal of birth control laws, despite its other charitable activities. The substantial part test was enacted as part of the Revenue Act of 1934. One justification given for this limitation was that donating money to influence legislation was \\"selfish\\" and not charitable if it enhanced the donors' personal interests, although the lack of a total ban on lobbying implied that non-selfish lobbying could be permitted.Manny, p. 765. Subsequent cases important to political advocacy by non-profits include Seasongood v. Commissioner, Speiser v. Randall, and Cammarano v. United States. In 1966, the Sierra Club's tax-exempt status was revoked in a high-profile case due to its publications of advertisements in The New York Times and The Washington Post opposing the construction of dams in the Grand Canyon.Sullivan, pp. 16‚Äì19, 22. = Enactment = The 501(h) election was enacted in the Tax Reform Act of 1976 which was introduced by Representative Barber Conable, after several attempts to introduce various similar provisions beginning in 1969. There were several justifications given for the mechanics of the new option: correcting the vagueness of the substantial part test; ensuring that small organizations were not more restricted than large ones; providing a tax penalty for initial infractions rather than immediate loss of tax-exempt status; and increasing the lobbying influence of non-profit organizations relative to for-profit ones, the later of which were at the time able to deduct their lobbying expenses.Manny, pp. 769‚Äì772, 776. IRS regulations implementing the specifics of the 501(h) election were not finalized until 1990. An initial 1987 proposal of regulations was criticized for being overly broad in what constituted grassroots lobbying, such as including mention of legislation in a fundraising letter, or allowing audience members at public forums to publicly express opinions about legislation, which would cause the entire cost of these activities to be applied as lobbying expenses. The public reaction to the proposed regulations lead to a congressional hearing in the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight in March 1987, followed by the establishment of an advisory board within the IRS to revise the proposed regulations. The final 1990 regulations were less stringent, excluding fundraising communications from lobbying activities and establishing the four-year window for violations before tax-exempt status would be revoked.Sullivan, pp. 39‚Äì50.

This is done by connecting Radio receiver and a PC using a CAT interface and a CAT Program A CAT interface is a piece of hardware that connects between the PC and a radio that provides a connection to allows the radio and the PC to communicate with each other. The CAT interface provides the signals to and fro via correct voltage levels and in the case of a Universal Serial Bus (USB) CAT interface it requires a \\"protocol\\" for communication but communication itself is down to the radio and the software on the PC. A Software that may be called a CAT program allows a radio to be controlled through the PC.

Functionality of CAT equipment (software & interface) is down the radio and what features the software writers included in the CAT software. Modern radio systems do have more CAT functionality If you run a logging program that supports CAT, then that software may take advantage of the CAT system by retrieving information from the radio to help fill in log details, such as the frequency that the contact was made on. CAT is also useful on many radios were there are many sub-menus in the radios menu system, many of the sub-menu items can be easily changed via the PC. On many HF radios the CAT system is also used to program the memories on the radio, but you would need to use appropriate programming software.

Background The California Equal Pay Act of 1949 (EPA) stated that \\"No employer shall pay any individual in the employer's employ at wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex in the same establishment for equal work on jobs\\". Because of the vagueness of this law, employers are able to find loopholes and pay women in California much lower than their male co-workers. As of 2015, female workers make only 80 cents for every dollar earned by male workers thus putting the gender wage gap of 20%. Over 38.8 billion dollars is lost due to the wage gap between men and women. On October 6, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law and the amendment took effect on January 1, 2016. Features The new bill is set to fix many of the previous law's issues by fixing terms such as \\"bona fide factor other than sex\\", \\"substantially similar work\\" and \\"same establishment\\" that have allowed employers to justify the wage gap. Before employers would rely on irrelevant \\"factors other than sex\\" to justify the wage gap. SB358 is set to alter the term \\"bona fide factor other than sex\\" defense with actual legitimate factors. It ensures to employees who perform \\"substantially similar work\\" but are paid differently to have equal pay. It also adds onto the \\"same establishment\\" clause that stated that men and women must be paid equally in same workplace establishment but now it is that men and women must be paid equally underneath the same establishment of work but they don't have to be working under the \\"same establishment\\" as employers have been able to justify lower wages despite males doing the same job at another company getting paid more. The key feature of SB358 is that it prevents employers from discriminating against its employees who seek to discuss, disclose, or inquire about their co-workers' pay.
