It was originally established in 1938, and was renamed as Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo in 1994. It is organised by The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong (CMA).  History  The Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo originated in the 1930s when mainland China started to impose import tariffs, leading to Hong Kong manufacturers‚Äô exports facing major setbacks. Amid their difficulty, they decided to explore the Southeast Asia market, and did so by joining the 1st Chinese Products Expo in Singapore in 1935. As Hong Kong products are received quite well in Southeast Asia, the region quickly became one of the main exporting markets for Hong Kong. Once Hong Kong products are established in overseas market, they began to develop their local market immediately. Â∑•ÂïÜÊó•Â†±Á§æË´ñ 1967Âπ¥12Êúà5Êó• = 1938 to 1974 = The first exhibition was co-organized by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association and Hong Kong YWCA, held from 2 to 8 April in 1938 at St. Paul's College under the name Exhibition of Chinese Products. Using the slogan ‚ÄúChinese People should use Chinese Goods‚Äù, it aimed to encourage Hong Kong citizens and the Chinese diaspora to support Chinese-made products. In 1950, the 8th Exhibition was instead renamed Exhibition of Hong Kong Products and started to focus on goods manufactured in Hong Kong rather than mainland China. The slogan also changed to ‚ÄúHong Kong people use Hong Kong goods‚Äù, to encourage local consumers to purchase goods manufactured in Hong Kong. The event grew rapidly in popularity after World War II. In the 1960s and '70s, it attracted nearly 2,000 exhibitors and over 1.5 million visitors each year. Due to the government not allocating land for a permanent exhibition venue, the CMA stopped staging the exhibition in 1974. From 1938 to 1974, 31 Hong Kong products exhibitions were organised. The number of exhibitors increased significantly from 40 in the first year to about 2,000 in the last, and the visitor count went from 30,000 to around 2 million. = 1994 onwards = In celebration of its 60th anniversary, the exhibition was staged again in 1994 and renamed Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo. The 4-day expo, which was held at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, was attended by 200,000 visitors. The 33rd to 37th HKBPE was then held at Tamar Site in Central from 1998 to 2002, and was relocated to Victoria Park in Causeway Bay in 2003.

Currently, the orchestra's artistic director is Richard Pontzious, its principal conductor is James Judd, and its conductor laureate is Sergiu Comissiona. History AYO's history includes the premiere of Tan Dun's Symphony 1997 with cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and concerts in venues such as Beijing's Great Hall of the People, New York's Avery Fisher Hall, California's Hollywood Bowl, Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, Berlin's Shauspielhaus, Vienna's Konzerthaus, Northern Virginia's Wolf Trap, and the Sydney Opera House. The orchestra has also performed in the White House and at the United Nations. A formation committee of Hong Kong businessmen and women created the organizational structure for the Asian Youth Orchestra in 1987 and established it as a tax- exempt non-profit organization qualified under Section 88 of the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Ordinance.

Royal Decree of Graces On 10 August 1815, King Ferdinand VII of Spain approved the Spanish Royal Decree of Graces, which granted Puerto Rico the right to have commercial ties with countries which were in good standing with Spain. It also granted free land to settlers, as well as incentives for investing money and providing technology for agricultural development to any Spaniard willing to relocate and settle in those territories.Ponce, Ciudad Senorial: La ciudad es conocida como la Perla del Sur: Desarrollo Economico y Cultural de Ponce: Un buen ejemplo del desenvolvimiento de Puerto Rico en el Siglo XIX. El Nuevo Dia. \\"Historia de Puerto Rico.\\" Collectible No. 24. 3 July 2007. Page 3. Retrieved 9 April 2012. Puerto Rico was largely undeveloped until 1830, when immigrants from the Spanish provinces of Catalonia, Majorca, and the Canary Islands began to arrive. They gradually developed the sugarcane, coffee, and tobacco plantations, based on the use of African slave labor. Real C√©dula de 1789 \\"para el comercio de Negros\\" Spain had approved Decree of Graces of 8 September 1777 in regard to Venezuela, and the Decree of Graces of 1789, which granted its subjects the right to purchase slaves and to participate in the flourishing business of slave trading in the Caribbean. Situation in the Spanish Colonies At the beginning of the 19th century, the Spanish colonies in the western hemisphere fought for their independence. In South America, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Jos√© de San Mart√≠n led colonists to victory against Spanish rule; in Mexico, Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos led the movement. By 1825, the Spanish Empire had lost control of all of its territories in the Americas with the exception of Puerto Rico and Cuba. These two possessions were also demanding more autonomy, and pro-independence movements had been gathering strength. Trying to forestall the loss of these colonies, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. It printed the decree in English and French, as well as Spanish, and distributed copies throughout Europe to attract non- Spanish settlers. The Crown offered free land on the condition that new settlers swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church. They hoped to supplant the independence movement with new settlers. Situation in Europe During the latter part of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, great economic and political changes occurred in Europe. Thousands of farm workers migrated to cities seeking industrial jobs and better opportunities. Those who stayed behind to attend the farmlands suffered the widespread crop failures, brought on by long periods of drought and diseases such as the potato fungus which contributed to the Great Famine of the 1840s. Cholera epidemics broke out and starvation was widespread in Europe. Archivo General de Puerto Rico: Documentos Social and economic disruption also followed the European Revolutions of 1848, which erupted in Sicily and the German states. The French Revolution of 1848 contributed to the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and more changes. These conditions led to a massive European immigration to the Americas. Hundreds of Corsicans, Italians, French, Portuguese, Irish, Scots, and Germans, attracted by the offers of free land by the Spanish Crown, moved to the colony of Puerto Rico and accepted the conditions. As soon as these settlers swore their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and their allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church, they were given a \\"Letter of Domicile\\". After five years, the settlers were granted a \\"Letter of Naturalization\\" that made them Spanish subjects. In 1870, to attract non-Catholic Europeans, Spain's Cortes of C√°diz passed a law granting the right of religious freedom in the islands. Aftermath The new settlers soon adopted the language and customs of their new homelands, and many intermarried with the local residents. Many became prominent business and political leaders. The Royal Decree ceased to have effect in 1898, when Spain finally lost her last two possessions in the New World to the United States under the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The original Spanish Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 is kept in the General Archives of Puerto Rico in the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Ferguson (born November 28, 1974) is a former American football defensive tackle in the National Football League for the New York Jets, Dallas Cowboys, and Miami Dolphins. He was selected by the New York Jets in the seventh round of the 1997 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Georgia. Early years Ferguson attended Nettleton High School. He earned varsity letters in football, as a center on the basketball team, and in track and field. In football, he was a two-time All-South and a three-time All-District honoree. College career Ferguson enrolled at Itawamba Community College. He was a two-time All-Area and an All-State honoree. As a sophomore in 1994, he also earned Junior College All-American status, after recording 88 tackles and 2.5 sacks. Ferguson originally intended to go Ole Miss from Itawamba, but switched to Georgia in the final 72 hours before 1995 National Signing Day. Playing for the Georgia Bulldogs in 1995 and 1996, he lined up next to Jermaine Smith in Georgia's defensive front. In a memorable game against Auburn, Ferguson sacked quarterback Dameyune Craig on fourth-and-3 in the fourth overtime, sealing Georgia's 56-49 win. Professional career Former Cowboys teammates Ferguson (right) and Akin Ayodele in Miami in 2009. =New York Jets= Falling to the seventh round of the 1997 NFL Draft, Ferguson was selected 229th overall by Bill Parcells' New York Jets. The Jets were the only club to invite him for a visit before the draft, because most teams apparently dissuaded from considering him after he was tested positive for marijuana at the pre-draft combine, reportedly being the only player to do so. Seventeen defensive tackles were taken ahead of him, including Darrell Russell and Renaldo Wynn in the first round. Parcells originally expressed reluctance to pick Ferguson at all, but trusted Georgia's head coach, Jim Donnan. Ferguson was signed to a two-year deal by the Jets only few days after the draft. In his first season with the Jets, Ferguson shared time with veteran Ernie Logan at nose tackle, before replacing him as starter at the beginning of the 1998 NFL season. In 1999, Ferguson was suspended for four games after testing positive for steroids. After earning a $12 million contract during the 2000‚Äì2001 offseason, Ferguson tore his right rotator cuff during the first practice and missed all of the 2001 NFL season. He returned to the field to following season and played all games in 2002, 2003 and 2004. =Dallas Cowboys= A highly coveted free-agent in 2005, coming off a very strong 2004 season in which he totaled 59 tackles and 3¬Ω sacks, Ferguson left the Jets for the Dallas Cowboys, rejoining Bill Parcells who had become their head coach in 2003. Ferguson was signed to a five-year, $21.5 million contract that included a $9 million signing bonus. A replacement for La'Roi Glover most of the season, Ferguson started three games in 2005. After Glover left for the Rams in 2006, Ferguson took over as full-time starter. Following a season-ending biceps injury in the Cowboys' victory over the New York Giants in Week 1 of the 2007 season, Ferguson lost his starting job to Jay Ratliff. That following off-season he was traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for a sixth round draft pick in the 2009 NFL Draft (#197-Stephen Hodge). The teams also swapped their 2008 sixth-rounders (#167-Erik Walden), with the Cowboys moving up from the bottom third to the top of that round. =Miami Dolphins= Jason Taylor, Joey Porter and Chad Pennington. Rejoining Bill Parcells on a third team, Ferguson became the Dolphins' starting nose tackle in 2008. He has since appeared in all games and, as of November 2009, compiled 55 tackles (33 solo). In 2008, the Dolphins' opponents averaged only 101.3 rushing yards per game, and 4.2 yards per carry. In a game against the Carolina Panthers on November 19, Ferguson suffered right knee injury that caused him to miss the rest of the 2009 NFL season. Considering his age and the fact that he is playing on the last year of his contract, it was believed that this injury would end his 13-year tenure as an NFL player because he planned to either re-sign with the Dolphins, or retire. On March 6, 2010, Ferguson was suspended for the first eight games of the 2010 NFL season. He was penalized for taking steroids, the second time he failed the NFL drug test. Three days later, he re-signed with the Dolphins. However, on July 15, Ferguson announced his retirement from the NFL.

It is located opposite Fort Point at the entrance to the San Francisco Bay. Fort Baker was previously named the Lime Point Military Reservation. It was renamed in 1897.:File:Fort-Baker-Sausalito-Florin-WLM-20.jpg Fort Baker is named for Edward Dickinson Baker, a former U.S. Senator from Oregon.

It is known for its views of the San Francisco Bay. Fort Baker and Horseshoe Cove  History  =Military usage= Fort Baker and Marin Headlands in fog The military history of the area that is now Fort Baker began in 1850 when President Millard Fillmore created The Lime Point Military Reservation, for coastal defense positions and logistic support facilities, on the north side of the Golden Gate, across from Fort Point. However, due to lengthy litigation the land was not acquired by the Federal Government until 1866. Between 1872 and 1876, four barbette batteries were built: at Point Cavallo (Battery Cavallo), on the ridge above Lime Point (Cliff and Ridge Batteries), and on Gravelly Beach to the west (Gravelly Beach Battery). The only buildings on the reservation were barracks-like quarters for construction crews, storehouses, and offices, to the west of Horseshoe Bay. In 1890 plans were drawn up for modern \\"Endicott Type\\" coastal artillery batteries to be built from Point Cavallo to Point Bonita. Four batteries were completed by 1901: Batteries Spencer, Kirby, Duncan, and Orlando Wagner. In 1897 a tent camp was established where the present Main Post is today, and the reservation was renamed \\"Fort Baker\\". Construction of permanent structures began in 1901. Fort Baker is named for Edward Dickinson Baker, a former U.S. Senator from Oregon. Active in California politics in the 1850s, Baker lost his life while leading a regiment of Union troops, the California Regiment, during the Battle of Ball's Bluff in the Civil War. He and his wife are buried in the San Francisco National Cemetery at the Presidio. The Baker‚ÄìBarry Tunnel, a half-mile long tunnel connected Fort Barry and Fort Baker. In June 1937, the tunnel was widened to 20 feet wide. By December 1942, during World War II, there were 159 structures at Fort Baker, many of them temporary. For example, a temporary frame hospital, built near the beach at the foot of the parade ground, was completed in October 1941 and demolished in 1981.Gordon Chappell, \\"Historic California Posts: Fort Baker (Lime Point Military Reservation, Fort at Lime Point)\\", The California State Military Museum, California State Military Department, retrieved March 3, 2008 During WWI and WWII Fort Baker became the headquarters and training command post for the newly formed 91st Division (United States) Army. During WWI the division served in France. In WWII the division served in Italy. Since the soldiers in this division came from the far western states it became known as The Wild West Division. Since the Powder River in Wyoming was a well known river during the army's campaigns against the native American peoples, this river was also known by this era's soldiers. Out of this they developed the custom when an enlisted saluted an officer he would say, \\"Powder River!\\" when the officer returned the salute he would say, \\"Let'er buck!\\" This became a tradition in the 91st Division which was practiced into the third millennia. During the 1960s and 1970s the World War II wooden Army Hospital buildings were occupied by the Sixth U.S. Army Medical Laboratory. This medical Laboratory was the Reference Laboratory for all medical facilities in the Sixth Army area excluding Class II facilities such as Letterman General Hospital. The Sixth Army Medical Laboratory also performed testing for rabies, all virology tests, and virology research. In the later 1980's the fort became an army reserve training facility/resource called the 91st Training Division with the mission of being staffed with a cadre of leadership personnel (experienced officers and NCO's/Sergeants) and drill instructors so that in the event of a major war‚Äîwith the draft re- instituted‚Äîdraftees would be sent to the 91st to receive their basic training (about 9 weeks) followed by advanced infantry training to prepare the draftees for combat. Then the 91st would become an active army infantry division to be deployed to whatever theater of war the army selected for them. In the parlance of soldiers this is called,\\"The infinite wisdom of the army.\\" In 2000, the final uniformed elements of the US Army left the Presidio of San Francisco and Fort Baker, a subpost of the Presidio. The 91st Division (Training Support), an Army Reserve unit, moved its headquarters from Fort Baker to Parks Reserve Forces Training Area, in Dublin, California. =Current activities = Many of the military-built buildings still stand, and current institutions in the area include Coast Guard Station Golden Gate, a motor lifeboat station,Emmett Berg, \\"Coast Guard missions at Station Golden Gate are anything but routine\\", Fog City Journal, November 19, 2007 the Travis Marina (an Air Force Morale, Welfare and Recreation facility) and Presidio Yacht Club and the Bay Area Discovery Museum.Tacy Dunham, \\"Hike of the week: Can't beat the views at East Fort Baker\\", Marin Independent Journal, November 8, 2007 A sustainability and climate change focused think-tank, The Institute at the Golden Gate, has its offices at Fort Baker ().Institute at the Golden Gate Cavallo Point conference center The Cavallo Point Lodge In January 2005, an agreement was reached by the city of Sausalito and the National Park Service with developers for a retreat and conference center.Fort Baker Agreement Announced City of Sausalito: City Manager's Weekly Report, January 20, 2005.

It is located south of Balboa Park, north of Sherman Heights/Highway 94 (M. L. King, Jr. Freeway), and east of Downtown. Golden Hill is one of San Diego's most historic and architecturally eclectic zones, with many pre-1900 homes and apartments. In the 1910s, it became one of the many San Diego neighborhoods connected by the Class 1 streetcars and an extensive San Diego public transit system that was spurred by the Panama-California Exposition of 1915 and built by John D. Spreckels. These streetcars became a fixture of this neighborhood until their retirement in 1939.The Home of the San Diego Historic Class 1Streetcars Street cars, the number 2 line operated until the mid-1950s This neighborhood is also in walking distance of Downtown, City College and much of Balboa Park. Auto access is direct from freeways 5 and 94, The major through streets and bus routes are Broadway (East and West), and 25th Street and 30th Street (North and South). The Zip code is a portion of 92102. Pedestrianism, like in other urban mesa neighborhoods surrounding Balboa Park, is high relative to the rest of San Diego.

The initial search for Wood was one of the largest search efforts in the city's history, and the two-year search for her killer was one of the largest manhunts in Canada. Biography Ardeth Wood was the first daughter born to Brenden Wood and Catherine Ashley, on October 28, 1975, in Saint John, New Brunswick. Wood spent most of her life in Ottawa, and graduated from Lester B. Pearson Catholic High School in 1994. She proceeded to undergraduate studies at Carleton University before pursuing a PhD in philosophy at the University of Waterloo. Wood was recognized as an exceptional student, and, in Waterloo, was co-editor of Eidos: The Canadian Graduate Journal of Philosophy. Disappearance Wood was on leave from her doctoral studies and visiting her family in Ottawa in the summer of 2003. She was riding her bicycle along a path beside the Rockcliffe Parkway in the Green's Creek area when she was last seen on August 6, 2003. News of her disappearance was reported widely in Canada, and the entire city of Ottawa rallied around a search effort that involved hundreds of volunteers, the police, and the military. Her body was found in the woods around Green's Creek on August 11, 2003. Manhunt Ottawa police received many tips that a man on a bicycle was seen luring women into the woods along the path where Wood had traveled. A composite sketch of the murder suspect was compiled soon thereafter, and was widely distributed across Canada. Over two years after the murder, on October 20, 2005, police arrested Chris Myers, a 25-year-old man, who had been previously charged with assaults in North Bay, Ontario. Staff Sgt. Randy Wisker led the investigation into Wood's murder, and relied on a loose collection of tips prior to the arrest. Conclusion On January 8, 2008, Chris Myers pleaded guilty to Ardeth Wood's murder, and was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for ten years. Remembrance Wood has been remembered with scholarships in her name at the educational institutions where she studied: *University of Waterloo *Carleton University A spectacular Bebb's oak tree in the Dominion Arboretum of the Central Experimental Farm was dedicated to Wood in 2007. The tree was split in half by a violent windstorm 27 September 2017, and Wood's brother now wants to clone the tree for this reason.

Conover Cove, on the western side, and Princess Cove, slightly north of Conover on the western side, are the two anchorages used by pleasure boaters. Conover Cove has a small dock which can accommodate shallow-draft vessels. The island is accessible by private boat. There is no public ferry service. Panther Point, at the south end, has dangerous rocky reefs which extend well past the island. Following the local tradition of naming hazardous reefs after the ships that found them, Panther Point is named after the Panther, a merchant coal-carrier, which ran aground there in 1874, carrying a full load of coal from Nanaimo. Divers still visit what remains of the ship. Between 1947 and the mid-1960s the island was developed as a vacation resort. One cabin remains standing and intact, and the remains of a few other guest cabins are still present. David Conover wrote a book, Once Upon an Island, which describes this period of the Island's history. Conover continued the tale in One Man's Island and Sitting on a Salt Spring. The increasing popularity of the island has attracted tourists and animals alike. Within the last decade there has been a bear and a cougar scare.

He was widely renowned in the Tibetan Buddhist world as a master of Dzogchen.

Only 30 of the original party survived. In 1961, they were resettled in South India in Bylakuppe in a series of Tibetan camps where Penor Rinpoche initially built a bamboo temple to train a small handful of monks in 1963. =Life in India= In the 1970s, Penor Rinpoche began to train Khenpos in the Nam Cho cycle.

In 1993, a nunnery was added, and by 2004 there were 4000 monks and 800 nuns at the monastic center. =Teachings in Western countries= He made his first visit to the United States in 1985, invited by Gyaltrul Rinpoche to Ashland, Oregon, to confer the Nam Cho cycle of teachings. In 1987 he recognized Catharine Burroughs as the incarnation of Genyenma Ahk√∂n Lhamo.Jetsunma Akhon Lhamo The historical Genyenma Ahk√∂n Lhamo was the sister of the founder of Palyul, Kunzang Sherab. In 1988 he gave the Kama teachings at Gyatrul Rinpoche's Yeshe Nyingpo center in Ashland, Oregon, followed immediately thereafter by the Longchen Nyingthig at Ven. Peling Tulku Rinpoche's centre in Canada, Orgyan Osal Cho Dzong. After this he gave the Rinchen Terzod empowerments at Kunzang Palyul Choling. Towards the end of this cycle of empowerments he ordained 25 western monks and nuns. In 1995, was invited by John Giorno to give teachings and empowerments for a week in New York City. He then traveled to Kunzang Palyul Choling to give the Nam Ch√∂ cycle. After this trip, he sent Khenpo Tsewang Gyatso, who had previously taught in the U.S. in 1992, to establish centers in New York and other regions. In 1998, he established the Palyul Retreat Center in McDonough, New York, offering a one-month retreat course that follows a similar if abbreviated curriculum to the one at Namdroling monastery. He offered Kalachakra empowerments, first in Rochester in 1996 and next at his retreat center in 2007. He also granted the Nam Ch√∂ cycle of teachings in Austin, Texas, in 2002. =Head of the Nyingmapa= Within the Nyingma school there was no main throneholder; thus, upon onset of the Tibetan diaspora, there was a request from the Tibetan Government in Exile to the Nyingmapa followers to request someone to be such a representative: someone of the highest esteem who could be responsible for all of the Nyingma followers. Request was usually made during Nyingma Monlam Chenmo in Bodhgaya. * Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje (c. 1904‚Äì1987), was unanimously requested to become first Head of the Nyingmapas and served from the 1960s until passing away. * Dilgo Khyentse (c. 1910‚Äì1991), was requested to become second Head of the Nyingmapas and served from 1987 until his passing away. * Drubwang Padma Norbu Rinpoche (1932‚Äì2009), was requested to become third Head of the Nyingmapas and served from 1991 until retirement in 2001. ::: Kyabje Penor Rinpoche statement on retirement at palyul.orghttp://www.palyul.org/docs/announce.html Kyabje Drubwang Pema Norbu Rinpoche statement in 2001 in regards to the position of The Head of the Nyingmapas and on the retirement. * Mindrolling Trichen (c. 1930‚Äì2008), was requested to become fourth Head of the Nyingmapas and served from 2003 until his passing away. * Chatral Sangye Dorje was requested to become fifth Head of the Nyingmapas, but declined. * Trulshik Rinpoche (1923-2011) served as the fifth Head of the Nyingmapas from 2010 until his passing away. * Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche (1926-2015), served from 2012 until his passing away. * Katok Getse Rinpoche (1954-2018), Was asked to assume the role in 2018 for the agreed 3 year rotation period, has accepted but passed away before completion of the term. * Dzogchen Rinpoche(b. 1964) Was asked to assume the role in 2019 for the agreed 3 year rotation period but declined. * Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche Was asked to assume the role in 2019 for the agreed 3 year rotation period but declined. Issuing the statement which with everyone's agreement resulted in the position responsibilities transfer to the head of Nyingma Monlam Chenmo. =Activities= Monlam Chenmo Each year a prayer festival called \\"Monlam Chenmo\\" is held in Bodh Gaya, the place of the Buddha's Enlightenment. Recognizing its importance, Penor Rinpoche headed a committee of monks, tulkus and khenpos who organized the yearly prayer ceremony. South Indian Monastery He was responsible for an ever-expanding population of Himalayan monks and nuns who come to Namdroling Monastery based on the traditional cultural style of sending a son or daughter to the monastery for an education. Many of the young monks and nuns come from extremely impoverished families located in Bhutan, Nepal or the Tibetan refugee camps in India. The monastery provides full room, board, clothing, medical care and an education in the traditional Tibetan Buddhist canon. The population of students exceeds several thousand. South Indian local community He sponsored the pavement of the road leading from Bylakuppe to Kushalnagar. He also built a small hospital that still requires equipment, but provides infirmary services to the local community. A side benefit of his activities is that the temples he built brings busloads of Indian tourists to the area daily, increasing the income and economic activity in the area. Worldwide His main U.S. representative is Khenchen Tsewang Gyatsho Rinpoche, who maintains a yearly travel schedule that includes Canada, Singapore as well as Arizona, California, Florida, Montana, New York, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, DC. Centers for practice are located internationally, including India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and America. Retreats Monks and international students went on retreat with Penor Rinpoche and received teachings directly from him on two occasions per year. The first was in the 2nd month of the lunar calendar at Namdroling Monastery in South India. The second was in the United States at Palyul Ling. The retreats consisted of the teachings as structured within the Nam Ch√∂ cycle beginning with Ngondro, followed by the Inner Heat practice of Tsa Lung, and then Dzogchen Trekcho and Togyal.

It is based out of Palyul Monastery, one of the six \\"mother\\" monasteries of the Nyingma lineage. The primary teachings followed by Palyul Monasteries were revealed by Terton Migyur Dorje, a \\"Dharma Treasure Revealer\\" who received teachings mystically. The works of Migyur Dorje have been passed down from teacher to disciple as the Nam Ch√∂ or \\"space treasure\\" cycle of teachings. It was these teachings that HH Penor Rinpoche followed and transmitted to his students along with some texts from the Longchen Nyingthig cycle. On 27 March 2009, at around 21:30 Indian Standard time, Penor Rinpoche died at his residence at the Namdroling Monastery.Head of oldest sect of Tibetan Buddhism passes away-updated Well in advance of his death, Penor Rinpoche requested the Fifth Karma Kuchen Rinpoche, his designated successor, to establish his seat at Palyul Monastery in Tibet. The Fifth Karma Kuchen is 12th and current Palyul throne holder. Monasteries =Palyul Monastery= Palyul Monastery has been rebuilt in Tibet since the Cultural Revolution.

According to the City of San Diego Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk parcel maps,http://arcc.sdcounty.ca.gov/Pages/parcelmaps.aspx University Heights is bounded on the west and north by the edge of the mesa, the southern boundary is Lincoln Avenue, and the eastern boundary is Boundary Street along the western edge of Interstate 805. The area is filled with a number of restaurants, coffee shops, boutiques, and artist studios primarily on Park Boulevard and Adams Avenue. Live entertainment can be found most nights. Adjacent to Hillcrest, Normal Heights and North Park,http://npmaddotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/landuse.pdf additional restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and night clubs are within easy reach. The neighborhood sits in a central San Diego location with a broad spectrum of housing options, from cottages, apartments and condominiums, to million-dollar homes. Downtown, Balboa Park, San Diego Airport, Mission Valley, San Diego State University (SDSU, or \\"state\\"), are only a few minutes away. History The area was founded in 1888. The name \\"University\\" (both for the neighborhood and nearby University Avenue) derives from a plan, originally proposed during the land boom of the 1880s, to build a branch of the University of Southern California in the area. The plan fell through, and the tract of land intended for the university was later used for the State Normal School (predecessor to San Diego State College). The headquarters of San Diego Unified School District currently occupies the site, near the corner of El Cajon and Park boulevards. The original subdivision boundaries of the University Heights neighborhood in San Diego from 1888. The area's population and facilities grew dramatically in 1915 because of the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition in nearby Balboa Park in 1915-16. On the far northern edge of this mesa, at the scenic rim of Mission Valley, an ostrich farm and public garden spot was constructed near what is now the corner of Adams Avenue and Park Boulevard. Later a neighborhood of homes called Mission Cliff Gardens was built on the site. The gardens were a popular tourist site. The neighborhood still retains the original garden boundary wall of rounded stones. A Class 1 streetcar at Trolley Barn Park, near Mission Cliff Gardens in University Heights University Heights became one of the many San Diego neighborhoods connected by the Class 1 streetcars and an extensive San Diego public transit system that was spurred by the Panama-California Exposition of 1915 and built by John D. Spreckels. Built in part to exclusively serve Mission Cliff Gardens, these streetcars became a fixture of this neighborhood until their retirement in 1939.The Home of the San Diego Historic Class 1Streetcars A trolley barn in the area was used for trolley housing and repairs; the facility was converted into a warehouse for the San Diego Paper Box Company and ultimately demolished in 1980. Developers planned to build a large condominium complex at the site, but residents convinced the city to preserve the land for a park, now Old Trolley Barn Park. Architecture and historic districts Shirley Ann Place between Madison Ave. and Monroe Ave., has been designated a historic district by the City of San Diego for its 1920s Spanish Colonial Revival bungalows.University Heights Historical Society, \\"Once Upon A Time in North Park: Shirley Ann Place\\"Save Our Heritage Organisation Parks Trolley Barn Park on Adams Avenue, just east of Park Boulevard, is popular with young families and hosts free concerts on Friday evenings during the summer. Sidewalks around the playground in the park are laid out in a pattern mimicking the local street plan, a design also echoed on the carved stone plaque. Street sign In 1994 community development funds were allocated to construct a street overhead sign. In 1995 a contest was held calling for entries from local artists for the street sign design. Kevin Whaley's winning concept design was unveiled at the University Heights Community Association meeting. The design incorporated historical elements from the past and present within the community. In 1996 the City of San Diego awarded the construction project to Young Electric Sign Company (YESCO). On April 3, 1997 the sign was unveiled and illuminated for the first time during a community celebration. The ribbon was cut by then- Mayor Susan Golding and several dignitaries were on hand. The sign serves today as a local landmark and identity for the University Heights community.

Perlecan is a large multidomain (five domains, labeled I-V) proteoglycan that binds to and cross- links many extracellular matrix (ECM) components and cell-surface molecules. Perlecan is synthesized by both vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and deposited in the extracellular matrix. Perlecan is highly conserved across species and the available data indicate that it has evolved from ancient ancestors by gene duplication and exon shuffling.  Structure  Perlecan consists of a core protein of molecular weight 470 kDa to which three long chains (each approximately 70-100 kDa) of glycosaminoglycans (often heparan sulfate, HS, but can be chondroitin sulfate, CS) are attached. The core protein consists of five distinct structural domains. The N-terminal domain I (aa ~1-195) contains attachment sites for HS chains. Although HS chains are not required for correct folding and secretion of the protein, lack of HS or decreased sulfation can decrease perlecan's ability to interact with matrix proteins. Removal of HS chains may affect matrix organization and endothelial barrier function. Domain II comprises four repeats homologous to the ligand- binding portion of the LDL receptor with six conserved cysteine residues and a pentapeptide, DGSDE, which mediates ligand binding by the LDL receptor. Domain III has homology to the domain IVa and IVb of laminin. Domain IV consists of a series of IG modules. The C-terminal Domain V, which has homology to the G domain of the long arm of laminin, is responsible for self-assembly and may be important for basement membrane formation in vivo. Thus, perlecan core protein and HS chains could modulate matrix assembly, cell proliferation, lipoprotein binding and cell adhesion. A diagram showing the domain structure of perlecan is available here  Function  Perlecan is a key component of the vascular extracellular matrix, where it interacts with a variety of other matrix components and helps to maintain the endothelial barrier function. Perlecan is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation and is thus thought to help maintain vascular homeostasis. Perlecan can also promote growth factor (e.g., FGF2) activity and thus stimulate endothelial growth and re-generation.  Modification of glycosaminoglycan chains  Modifications of the heparan sulfate chains on C- and N-terminal domains are the best-studied differences in the secretory pathway of perlecan. Chondroitin sulfate can be substituted for heparan sulfate, and sulfate incorporation or the sugar composition of the chains can change. Loss of enzymes involved in the heparan sulfate synthetic pathway lead to a number of conditions. Differential heparan sulfate chain modification can occur through a number of regulatory signals. Perlecan in the growth plate of mouse long bones shows glycosylation changes in the chondrocyte progression from the resting zone to the proliferating zone. Although initially the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of perlecan were thought to be exclusively heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate chains can be substituted during specific regulatory cues. By expressing a recombinant form of the N-terminal domain I of the protein and demonstrating that digestion of the peptide with either heparanase or chondroitinase did not lead to complete loss of the peptide's activity, it was shown that chondroitin sulfate chains can be added to human perlecan. This was in agreement with previous data showing chondroitin sulfate GAG chains attached to bovine perlecan produced by chondrocytes and that recombinant human domain I protein was glycosylated with both heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains when expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The preferential addition of heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains to domains I and V could have an effect on the differentiation of mesenchymal tissues into cartilage, bone or any number of tissues, but the regulatory mechanism of changing from heparan sulfate to chondroitin sulfate addition are not well understood. While studying the effect of proteoglycan composition on nephritic permselectivity, it was noted that puromycin treatment of human glomerular endothelial cells (HGEC) altered the sulfation level of GAG chains on proteoglycans such as perlecan, which in turn caused a decrease in the stability of the GAG chains. The core protein mRNA levels of proteoglycans were not affected, thus the decrease in GAG chains was as a result of some other factor, which in this case turned out to be a decrease in expression of sulfate transferase enzymes, which play a key role in GAG biosynthesis. It seems that there may be some overlap in diseases stemming from loss of heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression and loss of enzymes involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis.  Degradation  Cells can modify their extracellular matrix and basement membranes in response to signals or stress. Specific proteases act on the protein in the extracellular environment when cells have a reason to move or change their surroundings. Cathepsin S is a cysteine protease that moderately attenuates binding of FGF-positive cells to a perlecan-positive substrate. Cathepsin S is a potential protease that acts on the core protein of perlecan in the basement membrane or stroma. The heparan sulfate chains of perlecan bind growth factors in the ECM, and serve as co-ligands or ligand enhancers when bound to receptors. Another study showed that release of HS-bound basic FGF in culture could be achieved through treatment with stromelysin, heparitinase I, rat collagenase and plasmin, and these proteolysis sites are illustrated in figure 1. This was proposed as a non-exhaustive list of the proteases that could mediate release of growth factors from the heparan sulfate chains of perlecan. Although Whitelock et al. suggested that thrombin cleavage consensus sequences exist in the core protein of perlecan, they also postulate that any thrombin activation of perlecan actually comes from cleavage of other ECM constituents. This article states that heparanase is responsible for cleavage of the heparan sulfate chains of perlecan in matrix. This releases growth factors bound to the heparan sulfate, specifically FGF-10. Addition of heparanase to cell culture of epithelia in basement membrane caused an increase in epithelial cell proliferation due to FGF-10 release. In a model of explant growth in vitro using corneal epithelium, Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 expression correlates with an initial degradation of the original basement membrane. Reformation of basement membrane in culture was dependent on an initial upregulation followed by a downregulation of MMP-9, in contrast to the constant expression of MMP-2. This is not evidence that MMP-2 and MMP-9 directly cleave perlecan protein in vivo but shows that the proteins clearly modulate some factor in maturation of basement membrane. Another family of metalloproteases, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein 1/Tolloid-like family, releases the c-terminal endorepellin domain of the perlecan core protein. The laminin-like globular domain contains the active motif of endorepellin, and is unable to be cleaved by cells expressing mutant and inactive forms of the BMP-1 proteins. Furthermore, the critical residue necessary for this cleavage to take place was localized to Asp4197. This proteolytic process may have significance in disease as a corresponding fragment was found in the urine of patients suffering end-stage renal failure and in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women who have undergone premature rupture of the membrane.  Expression  = Expression during development = Timing of gene expression during development varies from tissue to tissue. Basement membranes are often the driving force behind separating epithelia from stroma and connective tissue. Perlecan is of particular importance in cardiovascular, neural and cartilaginous development. Pre-implantation blastocyst development is a controlled cascade of gene regulation and intercellular signaling. Extracellular perlecan has been observed at the blastocyst stage of mouse embryonic development, specifically upregulated at the point when the embryo reaches ‚Äúattachment competence‚Äù. This finding was upheld at both the mRNA level and the protein level, shown by RT-PCR and immunostaining. Later embryonic development is just as precisely regulated as pre-implantation development, and is more complicated due to differentiation of all tissues. The first study of perlecan expression during embryonal development found that the protein was first expressed during development of the cardiovascular system, and later correlates with maturation of the majority of tissues in the body, i.e. separation of epithelial layers from endothelia and stroma by basement membranes. Again, this upregulation during cardiovascular development is concomitant with the role of perlecan's C-terminus as endorepellin. Spatio-temporal specificity in trans-activation of the perlecan gene during development is key to the maturation of basement membranes and thus to the complete separation of epithelia from endothelia and stroma. A thorough study of perlecan expression during chick embryo development has shown that perlecan is present at the morula stage and for the rest of development, although expression can be transient and precisely timed in certain tissue predecessors. In the rat embryo, perlecan expression has been shown to increase in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) post e19 in fetal development. This correlates perfectly with the ceasing of proliferation of VSMCs at e18 and a change in their phenotype. The theory put forward in this study is that perlecan plays an anti-proliferative role for VSMCs once a certain developmental point is reached, much like confluence-dependent expression of perlecan in culture. These findings were corroborated by similar results from studies of rat pulmonary artery and lung epithelia. These tissues also were found to begin perlecan production once cell division had ceased, around fetal day 19. The development of the nervous system and extension of axons is precisely directed by cues from extracellular matrix molecules. Olfactory neurite outgrowth in mouse development is guided at least in part by an ECM laid down by olfactory epithelial cells (OECs). Perlecan and laminin-1 appear to be important in this guidance pathway, although perlecan induction occurs slightly later than laminin-1. This data is supported by earlier data showing that OECs express FGF-1 during olfactory development, and that perlecan can stimulate olfactory sensory neurite outgrowth in culture in the presence of FGF-1. Perlecan also showed nerve adhesive properties in a previous study, further suggesting that it may act in an attractive role in combination with laminin rather than a repulsive one. Cartilage and bone development have proven to be dependent upon perlecan expression. The protein becomes visible by immunostaining on day 15 during mouse development, independently from other basement membrane proteins, suggesting that it is simply a part of the ECM of developing chondrocytes, in addition to collagen II and other cartilage markers that are expressed starting on day 12. Taken with the data, that mice lacking the pln gene cannot maintain stable cartilage, it is apparent that perlecan is essential to the maturation and stability of cartilaginous structure. This is supported by a study showing that knockdown of perlecan production inhibits the final stages of chondrogenic differentiation in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts in culture. Bone development, i.e. mineralization of cartilaginous tissue, correlates with loss of perlecan and heparan sulfate at the chondro-osseous junction (COJ). In an effort to understand how heparan sulfate and perlecan direct mesenchymal stem cells into the osteogenic pathway, human mesenchymal stem cells were treated with heparanase and chondroitinase in culture. This led to increased mineralization and expression of osteocyte markers, supporting the data showing that loss of heparan sulfate at the COJ is a key factor in osteogenesis. It is thought that the driving force behind heparanase and chondroitinase activation of osteogenesis is release of bone morphogenetic protein bound in the heparan sulfate chains.  Animal models  Perlecan knockdown in embryonic zebrafish has been achieved through the use of Morpholinos targeted to the perlecan transcript. Morpholinos were used to block translation of the perlecan mRNA in zebrafish embryos, as part of an investigation into perlecan function in skeletal and vascular development. The Morpholino targets the five prime untranslated region of the perlecan mRNA thus blocking translation of the message. Loss of the perlecan protein in these fish led to serious myopathies and circulation problems. As shown in a later study from the same laboratory, this phenotype could be rescued through the addition of exogenous VEGF-A. The importance of perlecan to mammalian development is demonstrated by perlecan gene knockout experiments. Nearly half of all mice in which the perlecan gene has been knocked out (perlecan null mice) die at embryonic day 10.5, when the perlecan gene normally starts to be expressed. Others die just after birth with severe defects such as abnormal basement membrane formation, defective cephalic and long bone development and achondroplasia. The knockout strategy employed for the first perlecan knockout mouse was a floxing of exon 6 by insertion of a neomycin cassette, and subsequent CRE expression for removal of exon 6 from the genome. This resulted in the cartilage-compromised phenotype previously discussed and loss of basement membrane integrity in a variety of tissues. The fetal mortality rate is high and the mouse that survive die soon after birth. A separately developed perlecan knockout mouse model was created by insertion of a neomycin cassette into exon 7 of the pln gene. These knockout mice were also 40% embryonic lethal, with the rest of the mice dying soon after birth due to severe skeletal abnormalities. In yet another mouse knock-in model, the perlecan gene was mutated by homologous recombination of the endogenous perlecan gene with a construct containing 2 and 5 kb arms of homology surrounding a deleted exon 3, which is only 45 base pairs in length. This deletion abolished heparan sulfate chain attachment to the resulting core protein in vivo. The ensuing study showed that mice lacking heparan sulfate additions on perlecan had collapse of lens capsule integrity by postnatal week 3, indicating a role for heparan sulfate in maintaining lens capsule basement membrane integrity, similar to the TGF-Œ≤ knockout mouse model. Exon 3 knockout mice also showed decreased wound healing and angiogenesis capabilities when challenged by either epidermal injury or FGF-2 addition to the cornea. In the epidermal injury study, a wound spanning the depth of the epidermis was created in exon 3-negative mice and control mice, and in the knockout mice angiogenesis and the hallmarks of wound healing were slow to develop possibly due to decreased growth factor sequestration by the heparan sulfate-negative perlecan. A similar result was produced in the corneal micropocket assay, where FGF-2 is implanted into the cornea of mice and in normal mice angiogenesis is induced. In the knockout mice this angiogenic effect was impaired, although not completely. Studies from gene knockout mice and human diseases have also revealed critical in vivo roles for perlecan in cartilage development and neuromuscular junction activity. = Signaling pathways and their effect on expression = Signaling pathways function to elevate or decrease levels of transcription of genes, which in turn cause cells to change their gene expression profile. The end effect of signaling pathways is exerted on the promoter of genes, which can include elements upstream or downstream of the transcriptional start site, some of which can exist inside of the transcribed gene itself. A number of signaling molecules can effect changes in perlecan expression including the transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Œ≤), interleukin(IL) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) families of molecules.  Transcriptional activation  The upstream 2.5 kilobases of the perlecan promoter region were studied by CAT activation in cell lines of various histological origins. This study concluded that there existed a TGF-Œ≤ responsive element in the promoter just 285 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. This result has been corroborated in such tissues as human colon carcinoma cells. and murine uterine epithelium by in vitro addition of the cytokine to cell culture medium. In vitro studies of TGF-Œ≤1 signaling and its effects on perlecan expression can have varying results in different cell types. In human coronary smooth muscle cells in culture, TGF-Œ≤1 signaling showed no effect on perlecan expression although it did upregulate other matrix constituents. In vivo demonstration of the dynamic regulation of perlecan and its control by extracellular signaling pathways is critical to our understanding of the protein's role in development. To this end, a transgenic mouse line was created expressing porcine TGF-Œ≤1 under the lens- specific Œ±A-crystallin promoter and then another similar line was created but with the gene driven by the Œ≤b-crystallin promoter, corresponding to another lens-specific gene. This developmentally dynamic tissue showed a serious misregulation of extracellular matrix components including perlecan with TGF-Œ≤1 over expression. Corneal opacification occurred in both transgenic lines early in development due to greatly increased expression of perlecan, fibronectin and thrombospondin-1 in the corneal mesenchyme. The effect was more pronounced in the Œ≤B-1 Crystallin promoter-driven line. The IL family of inflammatory cytokines also upregulates the pln transcript. In a mouse model of Alzheimer's plaque formation, IL-1-alpha effects an increase in perlecan expression in response to brain injury. IL-4 treatment of human gingival fibroblasts in culture led to increased production of various heparan sulfate proteoglycans including perlecan. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts in vitro with IL-1-beta did not lead to any significant increase in perlecan production. Another signaling pathway shown to augment pln transcription is the VEGF pathway. VEGF165 treatment of human brain microvascular endothelial cells in culture stimulates increased pln transcription. This molecule is a ligand of VEGF Receptor-2 (VGFR2), and it seems that this VEGF165 response is specific for perlecan upregulation, leading to a positive feedback loop involving fibroblastic growth factor (FGF), FGF Receptor (FGFR) and VEGFR2 in response to endothelial damage. This microvascular-specific regulation by VEGF165 raises the possibility that the anti-coagulant function of perlecan is a part of the damage-control process in brain endothelia. Protein Kinase C signaling is putatively responsible for upregulating transcription and translation of certain proteoglycans including perlecan. When the endocytic pathway of HeLa cells is inhibited by overexpression of a mutant dynamin, Protein Kinase C is activated and perlecan message and protein are subsequently increased. In contrast, the usual downregulation of perlecan in response to hyperglycemia is lost in mice negative for PKC-Œ±.  Transcriptional downregulation  Interferon-Œ≥ signaling mediates transcriptional repression of the perlecan gene. This was first shown in colon cancer cell lines, and subsequently in cell lines of other tissue origins, but in each case intact STAT1 transcription factor was required for the signal to take effect. This led the investigators to believe that the transcription factor STAT1 was interacting with the Pln promoter in the distal region, localized to 660 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Interferon- Œ≥ treatment of blastocyst-stage murine embryos leads to a loss of perlecan expression on the trophectoderm, and thus an embryonic morphology and phenotype in cell culture, which is suggestive that these interferon-Œ≥ treated blastocysts would be defective in implantation. Presumably the loss of perlecan expression stems from downregulation of transcription via STAT1 transcription factor activity as shown previously. These in vitro results are not necessarily representative of normal physiological interferon- Œ≥ concentrations, nor are the cytokine normally expressed widely but instead at very specific developmental timepoints. Important to note is that perlecan expression can be decreased by treatment with an exogenous cytokine such as interferon- Œ≥, and if there were a physiologically abnormal increase in expression of the cytokine it could interfere with implantation. = Cell stressors and their effect on expression = Mechanical and chemical stress can damage basement membranes or the cells they support. This could influence the gene expression profile of the cells, especially in their extracellular matrix, which often provides physical support and a chemical barrier for the cells. Hypoxia, inflammation, mechanical and chemical stress have been examined as to how they relate to perlecan expression. Hypoxia is a condition found in disease states and during injury and often results in a lack of endothelial cell proliferation. This and perlecan's role as endorepellin prompted one study into the nature of perlecan expression regulation by endothelial cells during hypoxic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, this study found that perlecan expression by rat cardiac microvascular endothelial cells was decreased sixty-one percent compared to normal controls. The contention of this paper is that perlecan downregulation leads to a loss of FAK activation and thus less ERK signaling, leading to decreased cell proliferation. It does seem counterintuitive that endothelial cells would proliferate less quickly due to loss of perlecan and its endorepellin subunit. It could be that these endothelial cells merely downregulated transcription of many genes in response to hypoxic conditions. In another study, hypoxia led to induction of genes associated with apoptosis and cell death, but repression of genes was not limited to proteins associated with a specific pathway. When T84 intestinal epithelial cells are exposed to hypoxic conditions for 24 hours a significant increase in perlecan mRNA and protein production occurs. They relate this to the fact that many genes elevated in response to hypoxia contain a cAMP response element (CRE) in their promoter, as does pln. This difference between endothelial cells from the study in 2007 and the epithelial cell studied in these experiments is indicative of how varied the regulatory mechanisms of perlecan may be in different cell types. The development of beta-amyloid plaques on the brain is associated with onset of Alzheimer's disease. These plaques induce a constant state of inflammation in areas of accumulation, leading to expression of certain inflammation-related gene products, some of which perpetuate the inflammation in the brain context. As previously mentioned, to investigate the effect of brain inflammation on expression levels of perlecan, needle stab wounds were created in mice brains, and after inflammation and variable periods of recovery, mRNA and protein levels were assessed via in situ hybridization and immunostaining. Perlecan levels were increased in the hippocampus but not in the striatum during the healing period, along with IL 1-alpha expression. Perlecan expression was traced to microglial cells in the hippocampus and astrocytes. This role for perlecan in beta-amyloid plaque generation is supported by an earlier study showing that perlecan and beta-amyloid treatment of rat brains led to formation of senile plaques, whereas treatment with beta-amyloid alone did not have the same effect. At the organismic level, mechanical stress has a profound impact on extracellular matrix integrity and probably causes induction of a number of ECM genes for repair and remodeling of ECM in tissue stroma and basement membranes. One study examined the in vitro effects of pressure on global gene transcription using a microarray approach and a cell stretching system meant to simulate intraocular pressure in the lamina cribosa (connective tissue) of the optic nerve head. Their findings were that perlecan and several other proteoglycans were upregulated in response to the stretching stimulus. TGF-Œ≤2 and VEGF were induced as well, possibly contributing to the upregulation of the perlecan transcript and protein. It has been shown that autocrine TGF-Œ≤ signaling is a compensatory result of mechanical stress in vitro in endothelial cells. Using a similar cell stretching mechanism to mimic arterial pressure, this investigation showed that perlecan production increased in response to mechanical strain. This is contingent upon TGF-Œ≤ autocrine signaling in a positive feedback loop with p38 and ERK. This endothelial cell increase in production of VSMC growth inhibitors (i.e. heparin) is reversed in VSMCs, where mechanical stress induces proliferation. Deformation of VSMC cells in culture leads to perlecan upregulation, with a significant increase in sulfation of the heparan sulfate chains. This is not in contrast to the data shown where perlecan expression is constant beyond e19 in rat VSMC, which suggested that perlecan plays an antiproliferative role for VSMCs. In this case, it seems that the molecule's signaling function is the operative upregulated factor, especially due to the increase in sulfation of the heparan sulfate chains. Chemical damage to organs can affect not only the cell's genetic and mechanical integrity but the extracellular matrix of the tissue. To study the effect of chemical damage on liver cells, wistar rats were treated with carbon tetrachloride for 48 hours prior to sacrificing. Prior to treatment with CCl4, perlecan staining was limited to the bile duct and sinusoidal blood vessels of the liver. After treatment, perlecan staining was intense in areas of necrosis. This could have been due to the increase in capillarization of the liver as an attempt to regenerate damaged tissue. A similar finding was shown in acetamenophin treatment of mice, where perlecan and other matrix components were heavily expressed in necrotic lesions of the liver. = Expression in cell culture = One of the resounding arguments against the validity of in vitro results of cell culture on 2D plastic plates is that the environment does not accurately reflect that of the cells in the organism. This problem is being dealt with by developing 3D cell cultures using a wide variety of substrates as the scaffolds or environments for the cells. In this kind of setting the expression of ECM genes has the potential to more closely resemble that of the native expression profile. 3D scaffolds, the structures on which the cultured cells grow, can be composed of other cells, i.e. cocultures, synthetic polymers mimicking the cells natural environment or purified ECM such as matrigel, and any mixture of these three components. One such system has been developed to study skin development and basal membrane formation between keratinocytes and the stroma. This system is used to delineate the development of basement membrane between fibroblasts in the stroma (in this case fibroblasts in a type-I collagen gel) and keratinocytes grown on top of the gel. Perlecan expression and thus basement membrane maturation is dependent on nidogen crosslinking of collagen IV and laminin Œ≥1 chain in this system. This effect also led to a lack of hemidesmosomes in the developing tissue. Another system using a disorganized hydrated collagen I gel has been used to demonstrate that primary human corneal fibroblasts will eventually invade the gel and create a matrix consisting of collagen type I and perlecan, as well as several other sulfated matrix glycoproteins. This mimics the in vivo corneal fibroblast's developmental program and response to injury. One of the long-term goals of creating 3D cell culture systems is to engineer tissues that can be used as replacements for patients with many types of disease. In tissue engineered heart valves created by seeding myofibroblasts onto collagen type I followed by endothelial cells, heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression has been verified, although no distinction between syndecan and perlecan has been made in these tissues. Another procedure that could be made possible by tissue engineering is keratoepithelioplasty. Transplanted tissue must remain intact, which requires a pre-formed basement membrane. Collagen gels have promoted formation of a complete basement membrane by corneal epithelial cells in culture. Perlecan also holds promise to serve as a scaffold for plating cells in culture. Human salivary gland ductal and acinar cells have been successfully grown on a bioactive peptide containing a sequence repeated in domain IV of the perlecan protein. These cells reproduce acini-like structures similar to those found in the native gland and tight junctions, along with complete basement membranes in culture.  Disease association  = Cancer = While Perlecan suppression causes substantial inhibition of tumor growth and neovascularization in null mice, in contrast, when perlecan-null cells are injected into nude mice enhanced tumor growth is observed when compared to controls. Cancer progression and pathogenesis is intimately linked to extracellular matrix composition and the role of perlecan and other ECM molecules in cancer is being studied by a large number of laboratories. Since the basement membrane is the first obstacle in the way of extravasating carcinoma cells, the functions of perlecan in this process are multiple. One model system used to study perlecan expression in carcinoma cell lines is that of the MeWo/70W melanoma metastatic progression cell lines. MeWo cells are characteristically less invasive than their clonal variant cell line 70W. One lab studied perlecan expression in 27 invasive melanomas and 26 of the 27 samples showed a significant increase in perlecan message when compared to normal tissue from the same patients. They then used the MeWo and 70W cell lines to study if perlecan expression changed during treatment with neurotrophins, which can stimulate cell invasion through matrigel in vitro. The more invasive 70W cells began expressing perlecan message ten minutes after stimulation with the neurotrophins, and the MeWo cells did not produce any pln message regardless of treatment. This study took special note of the fact that perlecan upregulation occurred even before that of heparanase, an essential protein involved in the process of extravasation. In ovarian cancer as in other cancers, perlecan expression occurs differently throughout progression of the disease. Perlecan staining is lost in ovarian basement membrane that has been breached by an invasive adenocarcinoma, which is in contrast to perlecan staining in the basement membranes of normal ovaries and those with benign tumors, where basement membrane is homogeneous and very similar in composition to that in other normal tissues. This is consistent with other results showing loss of perlecan in basement membranes affected by invasive cervical cancer spreading to the pelvic lymph nodes, which comes as no surprise due to the correlation of elevated levels of heparanase mRNA expression with invasion of similar cervical carcinoma. By contrast, tumor formation of the immortalized mouse epithelial cell line RT101 injected into rats was dependent on perlecan expression by the mouse cells and not on the presence of endogenous rat perlecan. RT101 cells with perlecan knocked down by antisense did not show tumor formation in this system, however cells expressing the antisense perlecan and a recombinant construct encoding domains I, II, and III of mouse perlecan did indeed show tumor formation. Thus in this system it does appear that tumor cell expression of perlecan is necessary for tumor aggregation. More research into GAG chain or core protein modification by invasive tumor cells as compared to benign tumor cells and normal tissue would be informative to better understand perlecans role in cancer migration. Several laboratories have studied in vitro tumor cell angiogenesis using antisense constructs to the perlecan message. The full-length reverse complement cDNA, driven by a strong promoter, is transfected into various cell types to completely eliminate perlecan expression. Antisense in colon carcinoma cells blocks perlecan translation, leading to decreased tumor growth and angiogenesis. A similar in vitro decrease in proliferation occurred in NIH 3T3 cells and a human melanoma cell line expressing antisense perlecan mRNA. Findings in vitro with Kaposi's sarcoma cell lines showed that loss of perlecan via transfection with an antisense construct led to decreased proliferation and migration of this highly metastatic cell type. These results are in contrast to in vivo results with the same Kaposi Sarcoma lines, which show that decreased perlecan leads to increased angiogenesis, which facilitates migration and thus is associated with increase in tumor grade. Antisense knockdown of perlecan in fibrosarcoma cell lines led to increased growth and migration both in vitro and in vivo. These findings of greater tumorigenesis in vivo are supported by data showing that the C-terminus of the perlecan protein acts as an endostatic module now known as endorepellin. A ribozyme construct was created for use in knocking down perlecan translation levels. This ribozyme was targeted at a sequence coding domain I of the perlecan protein. It reduced expression of perlecan up to 80% in the prostate cancer cell line C42B. In contrast to previously discussed studies these cells produced smaller tumors than their parental cells when injected into athymic mice. What this disparity in results means for invasion is unknown, although it is true that perlecan is part of the extracellular matrix in mesenchymal tissue, and cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may upregulate perlecan expression as part of their EMT programming. = Diabetes and cardiovascular disease = Perlecan levels are decreased in many disease states - e.g., diabetes, atherosclerosis and arthritis. Perlecan has an important role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. Decreased perlecan in the glomerular basement membrane has a central role in the development of diabetic albuminuria. Perlecan expression is down regulated by many atherogenic stimuli and thus Perlecan is thought to play a protective role in atherosclerosis. Diabetes and atherosclerosis are commonly associated syndromes. 80% of diabetes-associated deaths involve some form of atherosclerotic complication, and the basement membrane of endothelia has been implicated in the atherogenic process. Synthesis of heparan sulfate was shown to decrease in the arteries of diabetics and in arteries developing atherosclerotic lesions. The mechanism by which heparan sulfate was downregulated in these lesions remained unknown for some time. One theory states that high glucose in circulation could lead to a decrease in GAG chain attachment to perlecan, but not necessarily a change in the synthetic pathway of the GAG chains or that of the core protein. After treatment of human aortic endothelial cells with high glucose medium, secreted perlecan contained less sulfate incorporation accompanied by less overall GAG chain incorporation. Although no signaling pathway is identified leading to this decrease in GAG chain incorporation, it is suggested that the 30% loss in overall glycosylation of the protein could mean loss of one of the three HS chains on perlecan in this model of diabetes-associated hyperglycemia. It is also noted that similar decreases in extracellular HS without a change in staining for the core protein chains occur in diabetic kidneys and in kidney cells in culture treated with high glucose. Atherosclerosis is most often the culprit in coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions, and a large aggregation of perlecan protein is symptomatic of advanced atherosclerotic plaques. VSMCs are the producers of the perlecan in this condition, meaning that a good deal of research has been focused on understanding the means of perlecan upregulation in this condition. In a test of the effect of circulating nonesterified fatty acids (symptomatic of diabetes and atherogenesis) on perlecan expression by VSMCs, expression did not change when compared to control cells. This was in contrast to a 2-10-fold increase in expression of other basement membrane proteoglycans. Thrombin is another marker associated with atherogenesis and procoagulation, and it selectively upregulates production of perlecan but not other proteoglycans in human VSMCs in culture. It is suggested that this effect is only seen when VSMCs reach confluence, but not prior to confluence. This concept is similar to previously mentioned studies showing that perlecan is only produced by VSMCs once they have ceased proliferation during development. Another marker in the atherosclerotic pathway is angiotensin II, which also upregulates perlecan expression in VSMCs in culture. Given the prominence of perlecan expression in atherosclerosis there is potential for therapy based upon perlecan expression and research may eventually proceed in that direction. = Genetic disease = Mutations in the HSPG2 gene, which encodes perlecan, cause Schwartz‚ÄìJampel syndrome.

The race film or race movie was a genre of film produced in the United States between about 1915 and the early 1950s, consisting of films produced for black audiences, featuring black casts. In all, approximately five hundred race films were produced. Of these, fewer than one hundred remain. Because race films were produced outside the Hollywood studio system, they were largely forgotten by mainstream film historians until they resurfaced in the 1980s on the BET cable network. In their day, race films were very popular among African American theatergoers. Their influence continues to be felt in cinema and television marketed to African Americans. The term \\"race film\\" is sometimes used to describe films of the period aimed at other minority audiences. For instance, the 1926 film Silk Bouquet (also known as The Dragon Horse) starred the Asian-American actress Anna May Wong and was marketed to Chinese-American audiences.\\"She (Wong) also appeared in a Chinese 'race' film, The Silk Bouquet, released in June 1926 ....\\" ¬© Anna May Wong - Silent and Sound Film Actress - goldensilents.com  Financing and production  African Americans produced films for black audiences as early as 1905, but most race films were produced after 1915.Caddoo, Cara; Envisioning Freedom: Cinema and the Building of Modern Black Life: Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2014; 24 As many as 500 race films were produced in the United States between 1915 and 1952.McMahan, Alison; Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema; New York: Continuum, 2002; 148 As happened later with the early black sitcoms on television, race movies were most often financed by white-owned companies, such as Leo Popkin, and scripted and directed by whites, although one producer, Alfred N. Sack, made some films written and directed by black talent such as Spencer Williams. Many race films were produced by white-owned film companies outside the Hollywood-centered American film industry such as Million Dollar Productions in the 1930s and Toddy Pictures in the 1940s. One of the earliest surviving examples of a black cast film aimed at a black audience is A Fool and His Money (1912), directed by French emigree Alice Guy for the Solax Film Company.McMahan; 147 The Ebony Film Company of Chicago, created specifically to produce black-cast films, was also headed by a white production team.Leab, Daniel. From Sambo to Superspade: The Black Experience in Motion Pictures. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1975; 45 Some black-owned studios existed, including Lincoln Motion Picture Company (1916‚Äì1921), and most notably Oscar Micheaux's Chicago-based Micheaux Film Corporation, which operated from 1918‚Äì1940. On his posters, Micheaux advertised that his films were scripted and produced exclusively by African Americans. Astor Pictures also released several race films and produced Beware with Louis Jordan. The race films vanished during the early 1950s after African-American participation in World War II contributed to the starring of black actors in lead roles in several Hollywood major productions, many of which focused on the serious problems of integration and racism, such as Pinky with Ethel Waters; Home of the Brave with James Edwards; and Intruder in the Dust, all in 1949; and No Way Out (1950), which was the debut of the notable actor Sidney Poitier. The last known race film appears to have been an obscure adventure film of 1954 called Carib Gold.  Venues  In the South, to comply with laws on racial segregation, race movies were screened at designated black theaters. Though northern cities were not always formally segregated, race films were generally shown in theaters in black neighborhoods. Many large northern theaters segregated black audiences into the balconies or by later showtimes. While it was rare for race films to be shown to white audiences, white theaters often reserved special time-slots for black moviegoers. This resulted in race films often being screened as matin√©es and midnight shows. During the height of their popularity, race films were shown in as many as 1,100 theaters around the country.  Themes  Lobby card for The Gunsaulus Mystery (1921) Produced primarily in northern cities, the target audience consisted primarily of poor southern blacks and southerners who had migrated northward. Many race films, particularly those produced by white studios, expressed middle-class urban values, especially education and industriousness. Common themes included the \\"improvement\\" of the black race, the tension between educated and uneducated blacks, and the tragic consequences in store for blacks who resisted liberal capitalist values. The most famous race movie, The Scar of Shame, incorporated all of these themes. Race films typically avoided explicit depictions of poverty, ghettos, social decay, and crime. When such elements appeared, they often did so in the background or as plot devices. Race films rarely treated the subjects of social injustice and race relations, although blacks were legally disenfranchised in the South and suffered discrimination in the North and South. Race films avoided many of the popular black stock characters found in contemporary mainstream films, or else relegated these stereotypes to supporting roles and villains. Micheaux depicted his protagonists as educated, prosperous, and genteel. Micheaux hoped to give his audience something to help them \\"further the race\\". Black comedians such as Mantan Moreland, who had played supporting comedy roles in mainstream Hollywood films, reprised his character as the lead in such films as Professor Creeps and Mr Washington Goes To Town. Some black entertainers, such as Moms Mabley or Pigmeat Markham, starred in their own vehicles. Mabley and Markham did not appear in mainstream entertainment until the late 1960s, when both were featured on Laugh-In on American television. Many black singers and bands appeared in lead or supporting roles in race films; Louis Jordan, for example, made three films.  Historical significance  Race films are of great interest to students of African American cinema. They are historically significant due to their ability to showcase the talents of actors who were relegated to stereotypical supporting roles in mainstream studio films. Hattie McDaniel and Clarence Muse are two of the most striking examples of talented performers who generally were given minor roles in mainstream film. A few stars from race films were able to cross over to relative stardom in mainstream works - for example, Paul Robeson and Evelyn Preer. Hollywood studios often used race movies as a recruiting source of black talent.

The album was later reissued and packaged in 2005 as part of the Universal Records Gold series, and simply retitled Gold. It charted at #110 in the UK Albums Chart. Content An overview of Berry's Chess recordings, it contains every 45 rpm single released by Berry on the Chess label from his debut in 1955 through March 1965 with the exceptions of the holiday record \\"Merry Christmas, Baby,\\" \\"Anthony Boy,\\" \\"Chuck's Beat\\" with Bo Diddley, and \\"Little Marie.\\" This does not include content from every released EP single, but of the 28 A-sides from this time period, 14 were top ten hits on the Billboard R&B; singles chart and ten were Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. It also includes an additional three singles, \\"Tulane\\" from 1970, \\"Bio\\" from 1973, and his only #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, \\"My Ding-a-Ling\\" from 1972. After the 31 A-sides, the set's 50 songs total includes eleven b-sides, seven album tracks, and one that appeared on the 1990 rarities compilation, Missing Berries. Four of the b-sides charted independently from their plug side. Robert Christgau states that although Anthology is less expensive than The Chess Box, it removed several good songs like \\"Have Mercy Judge\\" and \\"Anthony Boy\\". David McGee, Milo Miles, and Mark Kemp, of Rolling Stone magazine, are of the opinion that Anthology is one of the best of Berry's compilation albums.

In its operation it ran directly on the streets of Oakland, Sacramento, Yuba City, Chico, and Woodland and ran interurban passenger service until 1941 and freight service into the 1960s.  History  =Summary= Car ferry 'Ramon' of the Oakland, Antioch, and Eastern Railway The Sacramento Northern (SN) was an electrified interurban railroad in California that extended from Oakland north to Chico. There were three branches, one to Woodland, one to Colusa, and one to Oroville. The SN had been two separate interurban companies connecting at Sacramento until 1925. The Oakland, Antioch, and Eastern Railway was a catenary-wire powered line that ran from Oakland through a tunnel in the Oakland hills to Moraga, Walnut Creek, Concord, Pittsburg, to Sacramento. It was renamed the San Francisco-Sacramento Railroad briefly. The Northern Electric Railway was a third-rail powered line that ran from Sacramento north through Marysville-Yuba City to Chico. The train crossed the Sacramento River on the Red Gate Bridge. It was renamed the Sacramento Northern Railroad in 1914. In 1928, the two lines combined to become the Sacramento Northern Railway and came under control of the Western Pacific Railroad which operated it as a separate entity. An extensive multiple-car passenger service operated from Oakland to Chico until 1941 including providing dining car service on some trains. Passenger traffic was heaviest from Sacramento to Oakland. Freight operation using electric locomotives continued into the 1960s. The SN was a typical interurban in that its trains, including freight, ran on downtown city streets in Oakland, Sacramento, Yuba City, and Woodland. This involved multiple car trains making sharp turns at street corners and obeying traffic signals. Once in open country, SN's passenger trains ran at fairly fast speeds. With its shorter route and lower fares, the SN provided strong competition to the Southern Pacific and Western Pacific railroads for passenger business and minor freight business between those two cities. North of Sacramento, rail business was less due to the small town agricultural nature of the region with its small towns and by competition from the SP Railroad. =Detailed history= The original, route connected Chico with Sacramento. The original name of this line was the Chico Electric Railway (CERY), in operation from 1904 to 1905. CERY was sold in 1905, after a few months of operation, to the Northern Electric Railway (NER). The NER went into bankruptcy in 1914, and was acquired by a new corporation named the Sacramento Northern Railroad (SNRR). The Western Pacific Railroad (WP) purchased the SNRR in 1922 as a subsidiary and kept the original name. In 1925 the WP created a \\"new\\" Sacramento Northern Railway (SNRy), in order to group the growing collection of WP interurban railroad holdings. The Sacramento Northern Railway was created from two interurban railroads: *Northern Electric Railway ‚Äî the third-rail-powered \\"North End\\" from Sacramento north through the agricultural Sacramento Valley to Marysville-Yuba City and Chico from late 1905 to 1918. It became the Northern Division of the SNRy. *San Francisco-Sacramento Railroad ‚Äî the trolley-wire-powered \\"South End\\" operated from Sacramento south through farmland, marshes, over a bay by its own ferry, to Pittsburg-Concord, through the Contra Costa County hills and tunnel to Oakland and the Key System ferry pier. In 1928 the San Francisco-Sacramento Railroad (formerly the Oakland, Antioch and Eastern Railway, and originally the Oakland and Antioch Railway) became the Southern Division of the SNRy. By retaining the Sacramento Northern Railway as a subsidiary rather than just absorbing it into the Western Pacific Railroad, the WP earned more income by interchanging freight with a separate Sacramento Northern Railroad due to extra fees earned from shipper-customers by interchanging freight from one railroad (itself) to another (the Sacramento Northern). Western Pacific also owned regional sister electric railroads, the Tidewater Southern Railway (TS) (Stockton to Modesto) and the Central California Traction Company (CCT) (Stockton to downtown Sacramento). The TS and the CCT used the same downtown Sacramento terminal and ran directly on Sacramento streets. The two divisions used different voltages as well as different methods of current collection, thus only some powered equipment could traverse the entire Chico to Oakland route. When in Oakland, SN used Key System electric power. Some equipment carried a third rail shoe, a trolley pole, and a pantograph. The differing electrical systems, third rail for the North End and trolley wire for the South End, were retained. Some passenger interurban cars and freight locomotives were designed to operate on both \\"Ends\\" but most could not and had to remain on their home divisions. The combined main line extended for between San Francisco and Chico. At the southern end the SNRy shared track, electric propulsion power, and facilities of the East Bay's expansive Key System commuter lines. At first this used the Key System's ferry terminal at the Oakland Mole in West Oakland. Then beginning in 1939 it used the tracked lower deck of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge into the Transbay Terminal in San Francisco. After 1958, the Key System ceased operating, and the tracks were removed from streets and the Bay Bridge. Scheduled service At , the SN was one of the longest interurban lines in the nation. It was built and operated to first-class railroad standards, such as providing dining and parlor car service. It operated at speeds up to per hour. In June 1939 SN, ran three weekday trains from Chico to San Francisco, one from Sacramento to SF, and three from Concord to SF. The fastest train took 5 hr 43 min from Chico to San Francisco, and 2 hr 48 min Sacramento to SF. Passenger service west from Sacramento (to Chico) ended in August 1940. In January 1941, SN operated two weekday trains from Pittsburg to San Francisco and two Concord trains to SF. Interurban passenger service totally ended in 1941, but local Chico service lasted until 1947. Afterwards, SN transitioned to become a shortline freight-hauling railroad. Financial issues As with most interurban railroads in the US, the SN's return on initial investment was lower and its annual operating costs were higher than had been projected at conception. Interurbans, like most railroads, were very labor-intensive, particularly with the labor costs of maintaining motorized rolling stock and repairing electrical systems. Passenger business was less than initially projected and became increasingly unprofitable, even after SN reached downtown San Francisco via the new San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge in 1939. Its freight business and its relationship with the adjacent Western Pacific Railroad was the lifeblood of the railroad, keeping it in profit long after passenger service had ceased. Although it had a somewhat shorter route from Oakland to Pittsburg/Antioch in competing with the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific steam railroads, its route through the Oakland hills was steep (4%) and curvy by railroad standards plus it had on-street operation in Oakland. Freight trains usually had just a few cars on those grades with locomotives (\\"juice jacks\\") at both ends of the train. From Sacramento north to Chico, the SN competed with the Southern Pacific Railroad and, up to 1922, with the Western Pacific from Marysville south. It traversed a low density population rural farm country from Chico which contained only Marysville-Yuba City as major towns before it reaching Sacramento. Thus, passenger business north of Sacramento was light and could not be expected to increase. The SN had branches to Vacaville and Dixon, Woodland, Marysville and Colusa, and Oroville.(cited: Swett, Interurban Press: History of the Sacramento Northern) Business decline The railway suffered from state wide business decline due to the Great Depression plus the increasing automobile use on improved roads. Passenger service ended in 1941, while streetcar service in Chico continued until 1947. Other travails included the 1951 Lisbon Trestle Collapse, in which crewmen were hurt and a long causeway trestle needed costly rebuilding.; the withdrawal of the Sacramento Northern's aging train ferry, \\"Ramon\\"; and the abandonment of service on the Dixon Branch. Freight service continued and was heavy during World War II. In 1956 SN reported 45 million ton-miles of revenue freight; at the end of the year it operated of road and of track. 1956 operating revenue was $2.2 million, but in that year ICC included SN among the Class Is. Reducing electrification The SN received its first diesel locomotives in 1941 and this began its process of de-electrification. All electric operation ceased in 1965 at Yuba City after which the railway operated as a dieselized freight subsidiary of the Western Pacific. Trackage was abandoned over the years, especially that which duplicated routes on other railroads. The SN name ceased to exist with the WP's acquisition by the Union Pacific in 1983. Present day segment The SN line south of Sacramento connecting the present day ghost towns of Montezuma, Dozier, and Cannon in Solano County is now owned and operated and electrified by the Western Railway Museum as a heritage railway. Much of the SN's former equipment is part of the museum's permanent collection. Timeline    *  Route  Sacramento Northern Railway in 1931 = Oakland to Sacramento = Although the SN's Oakland Yard at 40th and Shafter was the end of its right-of-way, its trains continued west along 40th St. on the tracks of the Key System and on to the Key System's \\"mole\\". In later years, the trains ran over the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge which was built near the site of the Key mole, to San Francisco's downtown Transbay Terminal, connecting by way of the Key's tracks on Yerba Buena Ave and 40th Street. This service ended with the railroad's passenger service in 1941, but freight interchange with the Key System continued until that system's demise. The terminus of the SN's right of way in Oakland was a compact yard on the corner of 40th Street and Shafter Avenue. The main line ran on single track north up the center of Shafter Avenue in a residential area, passing Emerson Elementary School at 49th Street. At the end of Shafter, the track crossed College Avenue next to Claremont Junior High School and started a long curving 4% grade into the Oakland hills in the Rockridge district of Oakland. It then crossed the Temescal Canyon inlet of Lake Temescal via a bridge. During the preparations for the Broadway (Caldecott) Tunnel project, this inlet was filled in and the Sacramento Northern tracks re-routed along the top of a new high embankment above the lake, buttressed by a massive retaining wall that still exists today. From Lake Temescal, the tracks ran southeast through the Montclair district of Oakland. It crossed into Montclair over a trestle at Moraga Ave. andThornhill Dr., then ran along a high berm between Montclair Recreation Center and Montclair Elementary School, before crossing Mountain Blvd and Snake Road via trestle. High above the northwest side of Shepherd Canyon, the line headed east, then made a sharp turn northeast as it passed through a major cut in the hill. It then climbed up Shepherd Canyon to a station called \\"Havens\\" at Paso Robles Dr., named for real estate developer Frank C. Havens, one-time partner of the Key System's \\"Borax\\" Smith who was trying to encourage sales in Shepherd Canyon. At Havens, below Saroni Drive, the line entered a short ravine leading to the entrance of a one mile long single-track tunnel under the Oakland Hills. The tunnel itself is still intact but is sealed at both ends. In 1994, home developers filled in the approach ravine and tunnel mouth and constructed residential homes on this fill and on top of the tunnel. The upper foot of the top of the tunnel portal could be observed in the back yard of one of the new homes. A home further northeast behind the first was constructed on top of the unlined tunnel, and by altering drainage in the area caused the tunnel below the home to slowly subside. The home shifted and dropped and had to be removed. The SN track exited the tunnel into Contra Costa County at Pinehurst Road near Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve, and immediately curved over a bridge over Pinehurst Road to run southeastward through Redwood Canyon. The railroad designated a station just outside the tunnel portal as \\"Eastport.\\" The tunnel portal is no longer visible, largely as a result of a landslide which occurred during the El Ni√±o rains of the early 1980s. The right of way ran along an extant fire trail near the spot where Pinehurst Road makes a sharp u-turn. This fire trail was previously known as Winding Way on some maps, and was originally an old 19th century logging road built by Hiram Thorn, for bringing redwood logs out of the Moraga Redwoods and to his mill, and then over the mountain into Oakland. Even earlier, the route up the canyon to what is now Huckleberry preserve was a cattle trail for the Spanish and Mexican ranchers, en route to a landing at the mouth of Temescal Creek on San Francisco Bay. At the sharp curve at Eastport, the tracks immediately crossed over Pinehurst road on a bridge. The right-of-way then headed down Redwood Canyon on a ledge (still apparent today) just above Pinehurst Road, progressing southeast past the small community of Canyon. The line then turned north to Moraga, past St Mary's, and thence northeasterly through Lafayette, Saranap, and the valley past Walnut Creek and to Concord and Pittsburg. Some of the right of way through Contra Costa County is now used by the BART system to Concord. At Pittsburg, the tracks ran parallel, adjacent, and south of the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific main lines, then dropped down, turned north sharply and went under the SF and SP through an underpass to almost immediately reach the SN ferry landing on Suisun Bay. (This track layout and underpass are still shown on a 2009 Google website map of Pittsburg.) The Pittsburg side ferry landing and depot was called \\"Mallard\\" by the SN. There a ferry boat (the Ramon) carried an entire passenger train across to a north side landing near Suisun called \\"Chipps\\" on Chipps Island. From here the line proceeded north across an extensive marshland on a long trestle. After the trestle, the tracks continued north through farmland past Montezuma, Rio Vista Junction, Creed (where there was a branch west to Vacaville and Travis Air Force Base), and on to Dozier and Yolano before continuing on the four mile long Lisbon trestle (which collapsed in July 1951 as a steeple cab powered freight train of steel plate for Pittsburg was crossing it) into West Sacramento, then entered the city of Sacramento by way of the \\"M\\" Street Bridge (1911), and later by way of its replacement (1935), the Tower Bridge, which is still in use. At West Sacramento, just west of the Tower Bridge, the line to Woodland left the southbound main line and headed west. The SN progressed through downtown streets onto I Street to reach the substantial columned two story brick and stone \\"Union Terminal\\" on I Street between 11th and 12th. Union Terminal, also used by Central California Traction trains to Stockton in the early years, is now gone after use in the 1950s-1960s as a grocery store. Downtown Sacramento streets, particularly east and south of the Tower Bridge, carried many SN and Central California Traction tracks. In 1913 a spur was built that connected Rio Vista Junction to the town of Dixon to the north, but it was unprofitable and was abandoned after a year or two. Freight service from Oakland to Lafayette ceased on March 1, 1957. Overhead wire and tracks were removed and the Shepherd Canyon tunnel sealed. The former roadbed from St Mary's College through Lafayette was converted to the popular Lafayette-Moraga trail. The following year, freight service only extended from Walnut Creek to Sacramento. The Ferry \\"Ramon\\" was removed from service in 1954, so SN, through parent Western Pacific, had to obtain trackage rights on the Santa Fe from Stockton to Pittsburg where SN trains could reach SN tracks and freight shippers in Pittsburg and Concord. When the Union Pacific absorbed Western Pacific/SN it obtained further trackage rights on the Santa Fe which extended to Port Chicago where SN had a small yard. Thus, Pittsburg trackage was removed in the early 1990s. (As of 2009, Google and MapQuest maps acquired by web searching \\"Rio Vista CA\\" shows original SN track and sidings (most now abandoned) at Pittsburg and north of Suisun Bay including the northward turn under the SF & SP to the Suisun Bay shore. The track Rio Vista-Creed is still shown as SN.) At Rio Vista Junction is the present California Electric Railway museum and active electrified track. = Sacramento to Woodland Branch = The electrified Woodland branch line left the Oakland bound main line at West Sacramento and ran straight west toward Woodland (known as the Yolo Shortline RR until 2003 and now known as the Sierra Northern Railway). The track proceeds across a very long elevated wood viaduct-bridge over the wide Yolo flood plain to enter Woodland and go down Main Street to the Woodland Opera House where the interurban cars turned around. Today SERA terminates shortly before East Street several blocks east of the Opera House. The Woodland terminal was a unique Mission-style structure and was recently reconstructed. The Sacramento bound interurban cars exited the terminal onto Main Street through a unique archway in the station wall. = Sacramento to Marysville to Chico = From the Sacramento depot at present day Terminal Way, the SN's \\"North End\\" ran north up 11th Street to a Northern Electric-built girder bridge crossing the American River and then proceeded to Rio Linda. The line continued to E. Nicolaus, then Marysville where it crossed the Feather River into adjacent Yuba City, split off the branch to Colusa, then went on to Live Oak, split off the branch to Oroville, then to Gridley and to Chico where it terminated. In Chico there were yards and primary shops. From a junction just northwest of Yuba City, another branchline ran west to Meridian and Colusa. It crossed the Sacramento River at Meridian on a narrow combined rail and vehicle bridge. From Yuba City to Meridian the track ran alongside and north of the Colusa Highway, California route 20. In 1992 this track and unusual Meridian bridge were still in use and provided the SN with a Southern Pacific-Union Pacific interchange at Colusa. As of 2009, Google website maps still show the former SN trackage in most areas alongside Route 20. Terminals and Stations Sacramento's first interurban terminal (for the Northern Electric Railway's line from Chico and Yuba City) was at Eighth and J Streets. Sacramento's two other interurban lines, the San Francisco-Sacramento and the Central California Traction (to Stockton) had separate terminals. Pressure from Sacramento to stop loading multiple car interurban trains on city streets led to construction of a terminal for all three in 1925. This produced the impressive two story columned brick Union Station along I Street between 11th and 12th Streets, near the current Sacramento RT Light Rail 12th & I station. Trains left I street to circle behind the terminal to one of four tracks for passenger loading. The station burned in 1972 and was then torn down. The SN mission style terminal at 30 mile distant Woodland was unusual in that the trains from Sacramento went through an arch in the station wall to reach a rail yard in the rear. This terminal was close to the Woodland Opera House, unique for such a small town.  Technical information  = Electrification = Because of interconnection with the Key System, SN cars had to operate under a number of different electrical standards. The North End was electrified at 600 volts DC, the nationwide standard trolley and interurban voltage at the time of construction. Trolley wire and trolley poles were used only in urban areas. In the open country, the line used a solid, uncovered top-contact third rail. Cars built originally for the North End could not operate south of Sacramento. The South End (former OA&E;, Oakland, Antioch, and Eastern) was electrified largely at 1,200 volts dc until 1936, after which it operated at 1,500 volts, with areas of 600 volts in Oakland and Sacramento. The interurban cars had to use a pantograph rather than the trolley pole on Key System rails (electrified at 600 volts) and over the Bay Bridge (electrified at 1,200 volts for the Southern Pacific); the Key System used a covered top-contact third rail over the bridge. Because of the Key System's third rail, cars that could traverse the whole system had to have their third rail shoes removed, since the top-contact shoes would have fouled the Key System rail's cover. They were normally added or removed in Sacramento. Such all-line capable cars were switchable between 600 V and 1,200 V operation; they could also operate at half power at the 1,200 V setting on 600 V overhead. The SN's south end high-quality electrification used catenary rather than a single trolley wire, leading to the eventual exclusive use of pantographs rather than trolley poles south of Sacramento. Catenary allows the vertical supporting poles to be spaced farther apart than if a single suspended trolley wire is used, plus it is better for pantograph operation at speed due to stability (The South Shore line uses pantographs with a single trolley wire in Michigan City streets but has catenary for high speed operation elsewhere). = Cars and trains = Sacramento Northern offered dining service aboard parlor-observation cars Bidwell, Sacramento, Moraga and Alabama. The Alabama had been built in 1905 as the private car of Pacific Electric Railway owner Henry E. Huntington and was purchased by the SN. This elegant car operated on the Sacramento Northern from 1921 until destroyed in 1931 by a fire caused by a short circuit in its coffeemaker. Sacramento Northern name trains operating between Oakland, Sacramento and Chico included the Comet, Meteor, Sacramento Valley Limited and Steamer Special = Suisun Bay crossing and ferry=  Planned bridge  The Oakland, Antioch and Eastern needed to cross Suisun Bay, and chose to do so between West Pittsburg and Chipps Island, a gap of . The bay saw heavy shipping traffic and thus a high-level drawbridge with long approaches was required. Construction began in 1912; the estimated price tag was $1.5 million and construction time was estimated as two and a half years. This would have delayed the opening of the railway, and so an alternative plan of a ferry service was implemented as a temporary measure. Construction of the bridge stopped in May 1913 after construction of the pier on the Contra Costa County side, because of a shortage of funds. The railway, not meeting revenue expectations, never did restart construction, and the \\"temporary\\" ferry service became permanent.  Car ferry service  The railway was one of only two interurbans to operate a car ferry, and was the longer and more ambitious of the two. The first ferry constructed, the Bridgit (a pun on \\"Bridge It\\") was constructed of wood in San Francisco and launched in July 1913. It was destroyed by fire on May 17, 1914. After unsuccessful experiments with an unpowered barge, the railroad rented car floats from other railroads in the area and commissioned a new, steel ferry from the Lanteri Shipyard in nearby Pittsburg. The Ramon was constructed entirely from flat steel plate to save time, and had no curved surfaces on its hull. It was double ended with a central, raised bridge in the typical carfloat style. Power was by a distillate engine, one of the largest constructed, which was insufficient to counteract high winds and currents in the bay. Three tracks were installed on the deck, all long enough to carry three passenger cars or five freight cars. All three could not be used at the same time; the central track overlapped the other two, and either the single central track or the two outside tracks could be used, depending on load. All tracks were equipped with powered trolley wire. The Ramon was retired in 1954 after a Coast Guard inspection determined that the hull plating was no longer in a safe condition, and it was scrapped locally.bridgefinder.merediancalif.com = Bridges and viaducts = California route 20 crossed the Sacramento River at Meredian on a bridge also carrying the Sacramento Northern's line to Colusa. The tracks were in the center of the bridge and the two highway lanes were on the sides. It was replaced in 1977. The SN had two very long wood viaducts that crossed the Yolo flood plain.  Remnants  * Some of the SN's original track is still in service with the Union Pacific or other railroads, while portions of the right-of-way are used for BART in the Oakland and Walnut Creek-Concord area or light rail in the Sacramento area. A portion is owned by the Western Railway Museum near Rio Vista, California and Suisun City, California, and a portion of it has been re-electrified and trolleys operated as part of the museum. Extensive history with photographs are available on the museum website. See References. * A number of SN cars and locomotives survive. Many are at the Western Railway Museum, while others are in the collections of the Western Pacific Railroad Museum at Portola, California and the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California * In Yuba City, the original Northern Electric bridge over the Feather River is still standing though the rails have been removed. It is located just to the south of the Hwy 20 bridge and still has the NE initials on both sides of the bridge. Another NE bridge exists in Sacramento over the American River, now part of a bike/jogging path from downtown Sacramento to the suburb of Rio Linda and paved with asphalt. * The Marysville depot is still standing near J St and 4th (look up the hill) and is in private use. * The SN's Oakland Yard at Shafter and 40th was demolished in the 1960s to make way for several new structures including a medical office building, razed by a fire in the late 1990s. In 2006-7, an apartment building was constructed with the name \\"Temescal Station\\", which, although reminiscent of the site's former railroad use, was never the name of the SN's yard and station here. At this location, the SN tracks joined those of the Key System for the trip to the Bay Bridge and on to San Francisco. There was a Temescal Station - a stop, not a depot - just northwest of Lake Temescal. The present freeway crosses Oakland's College Avenue in roughly the same location where the SN tracks had crossed coming up Shafter Avenue. * Tracks still exist in rural Solano County south of Dixon where they cross Highway 113. These tracks run from Collinsville in the south up to Dozier, at Highway 113. This is the last of the existing track outside of Sacramento. While Google Maps shows a distinct line from Dozier through Vale and Yolano to Saxon, over to Arcade, and then up to Riverview, there are no tracks present beyond Dozier. The line is still intact from Collinsville to Rio Vista Junction to Dozier, as is the spur from Dozier to Vacaville Junction. * The SN's Woodland depot survived in increasingly poor condition until about 1980 when it was acquired by a private individual who found the original plans for it in the California State Archives and proceeded to raze it, then entirely reconstruct it. * Remnants of the Tres Vias to Oroville branch line (grade and culverts) are still visible along Grand Ave and to the east of the intersection of Feather Avenue and Tenth Street in rural Thermalito; the grade presently serves as a storm water levee. The stone bridge pilings also remain where it crossed the Feather River as well as some wood pilings to the east though they are being removed/buried due to construction of Riverbend Park. * Miles of the Oakland right-of-way remain throughout the Montclair hills and the village as paved walking paths, concrete retaining walls that used to support overpasses, and high elevated embankments. These structures cut through tennis courts, the school yard, and behind the park and recreation center building. They are also visible,(although less accessible) behind the old firehouse and adjacent structures. From Montclair/Piedmont the SN route ascended into Shepherd Canyon and entered a tunnel to cross under the Oakland Hills to emerge from the tunnel and drop down toward Moraga and Walnut Creek to Pittsburg (Mallard) where the car ferry awaited. In the days of SN operation the Shepherd Canyon area was lightly developed. In 1978, however, many houses had been and were being constructed around the west tunnel area. A hiking path led along the former right of way directly to the tunnel portal which had been sealed off with concrete. By 1992, a developer had placed fill at this location and a house was constructed right where the portal had been. As observed at that time, the top two feet of the concrete portal had become an unusual bench in the back yard of the new unoccupied home. Another house sat above and behind the first directly on top of the tunnel which had not been filled in. This construction caused the tunnel to subside along with the new house, which had to be destroyed. Sacramento Northern electric locomotive #654 hauling a train on Bridge Street * Part of the NE/SN Colusa line was still in operation until just a few years ago using diesel electric motive power. While passenger service to Colusa long ago ended, freight was moved from Marysville across the Feather River on Northern Electric-branded bridges into Yuba City. West of Yuba City, a combined railroad and highway bridge was at Meridian and still existed with rails in 1992. Children at Bridge Street Elementary School often see brand new John Deere tractors and other equipment arriving in Yuba City and various agricultural commodities leaving the city. Leaving Yuba City heading westward towards Colusa on HWY 20, the abandoned NE/SN Colusa line is on the right and visible for many miles. This entire operation was abandoned by Union Pacific a few years ago with the grade crossings being removed in late 2007 from Hwy 99 and Hwy 20. * A short portion of SN trackage remains south of Sankey Road, between Elverta and Pleasant Grove. From Pleasant Grove Rd., turn west on Sankey Rd. Cross the UP tracks and you will immediately notice some abandoned trackage on the left (SN). The tracks run from south of Sankey Road to just west of the WP tracks at a 45 degree angle. Used as a train training school at one time, the site remains with original SN trackage (which goes nowhere and connects with nothing) and some obsolete equipment (cars, engines) that are used by the Modoc Railroad Academy. As of 2020 this trackage has been removed probably because Modoc Railroad Academy lost ownership of the land. The only evidence that a rail line used to be there is the ballast roadbed. Following the levee road north of Sankey from this point, the long abandoned SN railbed and small bridges still exist (no rails). Traveling on Hwy 99 north of Sacramento when the Hwy99/Hwy70 split is reached, the old SN roadbeds are on the right. You'll see power poles still with wiring traveling next to the rail bed and a rice silo where SN once loaded freight. Traveling north on Hwy 70, the SN railbed is on the left, visible all the way into Marysville with interesting small bridges. * Although the trackage has been removed, many areas between Marysville/Yuba City and Chico have evidence of the old NE/SN. The wye at Colusa Junction is obvious as the area has yet to be paved over. North from there along Tierra Buena Road (parallel to the old grade), up to the intersection with Eager Road, stands the old trestle crossing Live Oak Canal. * In the town of Live Oak, at the old crossing with the then Southern Pacific mainline (now also Union Pacific since 1996) one can see clear evidence of the old roadbed and street crossings at both \\"N\\" Street and Nevada Street. * Virtually every cross street west of Larkin Road from Yuba City to the Thermalito afterbay near Oroville has evidence of the old railroad grade. Some even have rails still embedded in the asphalt. Some west of Larkin Road on Turner Avenue has rails in the ground. Also at the hardware store on East Gridley Road in Gridley can be seen not only rails in the concrete but the base to a grade crossing protection device. * At the end of Anderson Way, also in Gridley off Larkin Rd, stands a foundation to a sub- station used to power the catenary wire and third rail when the line was electrified. * Along the portion of the Sacramento-Marysville line to the north of the American River and within the city of Sacramento, the rails have been replaced with a bicycle trail, called the \\"Sacramento Northern Bikeway.\\" *Part pf the Rio Linda Depot Building was moved to 6804 6th Avenue in Rio Linda and is in use as a private residence. *A replica of the Rio Linda Depot building was built in the original location and now serves as a community meeting place, a visitors center and a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department extension office.

He was enthusiastic about this appointment but was faced with corrupt priests which he condemned in a pulpit address while also singling out King Frederick II. The king sent his agents to attack Boniface who sustained serious injuries but managed to escape. He travelled to Rome and secured permission from a reluctant Pope Gregory IX to resign. The pope wanted to make him the bishop of another see though Boniface refused the offer. In 1245 he attended the First Council of Lyon which Pope Innocent IV had convoked.

He was the uncle of James III of Scotland who granted him the Earldom of Buchan. Buchan repaid his nephew by fighting for his cause against rebellious southern barons. Through his marriage to Margaret Ogilvie he acquired the title Lord Auchterhouse. Life James Stewart was the second son of Sir James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorne, and Joan Beaufort, the widow of James I of Scotland. \\"Hearty James\\" was a younger brother of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl, and a younger half-brother of James II of Scotland and Princess Margaret Stewart, first wife of Louis XI of France. In 1467, his nephew James III granted him and his wife the lands of the Baronies of Strathalva and Down, with the Castle of Banff and the fishings of the water of River Deveron. In 1469, James III conferred on James the Earldom of Buchan (first of the third creation). James III conferred the estate of Traquair to William Rogers, an eminent musician, and one of his favourites. After holding the lands for upwards of nine years, Rogers sold them for an insignificant sum, in 1478, to Buchan. When the southern barons entered into a conspiracy against the King, the Earl of Buchan remained loyal. The King crossed the River Forth, and passed into the northeastern counties, where a strong force rallied around him. He then marched south, and came in sight of the rebellious barons at Blackness in West Lothian, and the Earl of Buchan attacked and drove back the left wing of the insurgent army. Negotiations were opened, and the Earl of Buchan insisted on severe measures against the insurgent nobles; but George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly and William Hay, 3rd Earl of Erroll were opposed to this, and they retired to the north. It was evident, however, that Buchan‚Äôs view was right. A pacification was arranged in May 1488, in which the barons promised to return to their allegiance and maintain the rights of the Crown and the peace of the kingdom; and the King disbanded his army and returned to Edinburgh. However the rebellion continued and on 11 June 1488 at the Battle of Sauchieburn James III and was defeated and killed. The victorious barons passed the night on the field of battle. On the following morning they proceeded to Linlithgow, issued a proclamation, and immediately seized the Royal treasure and the reins of Government. The Earls of Buchan, Huntly, and Lennox, Lord Forbes and others, who had fought for James III, were summoned to appear before Parliament and answer to a charge of treason. Parliament met at Edinburgh on 6 October 1488, and considered the position of those who had been summoned for treason. The Earl of Buchan tendered his submission; and he was pardoned and restored to power. None of the others who was cited appeared, and consequently their possessions were placed at the disposal of Parliament. In 1491 Buchan conferred Traquair, on his natural son James Stewart. Buchan died in 1499, and was succeeded by his son, Alexander, 2nd Earl of Buchan. Family Before 1467 James Stewart married Margaret Ogilvie, the heiress of Sir Alexander Ogilvie of Auchterhouse. They were parents to two children: *Alexander Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan (d. 1505) *Isabel Stewart of Buchan, a mistress of James IV of Scotland, and mother of Lady Janet Stewart, who was in turn a mistress of Henry II of France. Buchan had several illegitimate children with his mistress Margaret Murray (b. ca. 1446), many of whom were later legitimized by a royal charter issued in 1488‚Äì1489. *James Stewart, 1st Laird of Traquair (1480‚Äì1513), was the founder of the Traquair family.

People have practised pigeon keeping for about 10,000 years in almost every part of the world. In that time, humans have substantially altered the morphology and the behaviour of the domesticated descendants of the rock dove to suit their needs for food, aesthetic satisfaction and entertainment. People who breed pigeons are commonly referred to as pigeon fanciers.Wendell (1977) 1 The hobby is gaining in popularity in the United States, after having waned within the last 50 years. Both the hobby and commercial aspects of keeping pigeons are thriving in other parts of the world. Types of pigeons kept The rock dove, which is generally believed to be the ancestor of domesticated pigeons,Wendell (1977) 37 was probably domesticated around ten thousand years ago. There are hundreds of breeds of domesticated pigeons arising from this common ancestor which are currently cultivated by pigeon fanciers. Because of the large number of domesticated breeds, pigeon fanciers find it convenient for certain purposes to group sets of domesticated pigeons into larger groups. In the United States and United Kingdom, there are three major recognized groups of breeds of domesticated pigeons: * Flying/Sporting * Fancy * Utility It is worth noting that pigeon fanciers in other nations use different schemes in grouping domesticated pigeons; for example, a nationwide pigeon organization in Germany uses a far different grouping scheme. The Australian grouping system is similar to the UK/European groupings. For example, see: Major breed families of fancy pigeon. =Flying/Sporting pigeons= These pigeons are kept and bred for their aerial performance and for reproduction. Racing homers are a type of homing pigeon, trained to participate in the sport of pigeon racing, and have been used to carry messages during times of war. Such races often have large cash prizes of up to $1 million as the Sun City Million Dollar Pigeon Race. Fanciers who fly racing pigeons sometimes win long-distance races and even break records. Other flying/sporting pigeons are bred for unique flying characteristics other than homing, such as rolling, high-flying, and diving. These birds, which may be flown in competitions, include but are not limited to Rollers, Tumblers, and Tipplers. A few varieties, for example, the Parlor Roller, are considered to be within the flying/sporting group even though they do not fly. This is because they compete on the basis of their performance and not their appearance. Competitors in pigeon sporting competitions such as pigeon races can win large sums of prize money when their pigeons return home the fastest from a race. The use of pigeons to carry messages is commonly called pigeon post. Pigeons can also carry small light-weight packages, and have been used to smuggle drugs into a prison. =Fancy pigeons= Fancy pigeons are pigeons which are specially bred to perpetuate particular features. Examples of fancy pigeons would include Jacobins, Fantails and Pigmy Pouters. Their owners compete them against each other at exhibitions or pigeon shows and judges decide who has the best by comparing them to each other and their respective breed standard. There are many breeds of fancy pigeons of all sizes, colors and types. =Utility pigeons= A pair of White Kings Utility pigeons are bred for their meat and as replacement breeding stock. The meat of pigeons is customarily referred to as squab and is considered a delicacy in many parts of the world. Examples of utility varieties include Kings, several different varieties of Mondaines and Carneau. * All of the above pigeon breeds may also be exhibited in pigeon shows but true utility pigeons and flying/sporting pigeons are rarely exhibited. This is because true utility pigeons are bred for meat and true flying/sporting pigeons are bred for their aerial performance so that in both cases appearance is usually a very minor consideration. Pigeon housing Houses for pigeons are generally called lofts.Wendell (1977) 507 Pigeon houses are also sometimes referred to as \\"coops\\" although the word seems to have originally applied to the breeding pens inside the housing.Wendell (1977) 537 There are as many different kinds of enclosures used to house pigeons in as there are pigeon fanciers. There are no real constraints on the design of housing for pigeons but there are some things that most fanciers find desirable. These pigeon houses often contain specially constructed openings to allow the pigeon keeper to give his animals liberty for purposes of exercise while allowing them to re-enter the house without special assistance from the keeper. At the same time these houses are constructed to keep the pigeons safe from predators and inclement weather and give them nesting places in which to raise their squabs. = Multiple pens = Many pigeon fanciers build their pigeon loft with at least two pens. This allows a few positive outcomes for the pigeon fancier: # They are able to separate their males from females in order to control breeding. # They are able to separate young, unmated pigeons from mated and settled pairs. This allows the mated and settled pairs to breed better. Most fanciers have at least two pens for their pigeons and often fanciers have more than two pens or possibly multiple pigeon lofts. Extra pens allow for the keeping of spare, unmated females and males which can be useful to replace existing pigeons which might perish from disease or predation. Because it can be difficult to determine the sex of a young pigeon it is also handy to have extra pens for pigeons that have been weaned but which have not given external indications of their sex yet. = Trap/landing board = A Sputnik trap. For those pigeon fanciers that fly their pigeons (not all pigeon fanciers allow their pigeons to fly freely outside of their aviary) the pigeons need a means of ingress to the loft. A trap or at least bobs and landing board allows the pigeon to get back into their home when they are ready to do so. There are different variations of trap and bobs used.Wendell (1977) 524 Racing pigeons are commonly trapped home using a bob wired trapping arrangement that the birds push against the bob wires to gain access, but are restricted by the wires when trying to get back outside. Another form of trap typically called a Sputnik trap (pictured) uses openings set on an angle which are just wide enough for one bird to gain access by dropping through into the loft. = Flypen = Sometimes pigeon fanciers cannot allow their birds complete liberty due to complaints of neighbors. However, pigeons have much better health and seem to be in much better spirits when they're given room to fly. So most fanciers, including those that let their birds fly, will build a large enclosed area free of obstacles where the pigeons can fly as freely as they wish. This is usually referred to as a flypen.Wendell (1977) 522 = Nest boxes = Pigeon fanciers will often provide their mated pairs with nest boxes in which to build their nests. Because pigeons are quite territorial about their nesting area pigeons co-exist much more harmoniously when each mated pair has two nest boxes of its own. = Perches = Again, pigeon fanciers often provide their birds (both mated and unmated pigeons) with more perches than the birds need. Because pigeons are also quite territorial about their perch it is best to ensure that every pigeon in the loft has many places to perch. Pigeon fanciers often have their pigeon lofts in suitably modified garden sheds. In Glasgow and other areas of Scotland there has been a tradition of pigeon keepers building their own freestanding urban pigeon lofts, or doocots, standing about 4m high in areas of waste ground close to housing estates. In New York City, pigeon fanciers often build pigeon lofts on the roof of the building. Image:Doocot in Greenock garden.jpgPigeon loft in a garden. Image:Glasgow doocot Firrhill 1.jpgGlasgow doocot. Image:Glasgow doocot Firrhill 2.jpgEntrance door. Portrayal in the arts There have been several portrayals of pigeon keeping and pigeon fanciers in the arts. One of the more famous portrayals of this hobby was in the film On The Waterfront where the main character, Terry Malloy, is a pigeon keeper. In the film Ghost Dog, the title character is a hitman who communicates only using homing pigeons. There have been portrayals of pigeon keeping in other art forms as well. The artist Zina Saunders has painted portraits of New York pigeon keepers as part of her Overlooked New York project. Photographer Zak Waters shot a black and white project documenting the lives of pigeon fanciers in the UK called Birdmen. Sydney-based photographer Ho Hai Tran recently debuted his work On Pigeons which chronicled more than a year spent with the Pigeon Fanciers Society of New South Wales in Australia. The work was also exhibited in early 2013 in a show entitled Fancy which showcased portraits of some of the most notable fancy breeds including the Pouter, Jacobin, King and Dragoon. In the musical The Producers, the deranged ex-Nazi named Franz Liebkind, who writes the fictitious play Springtime for Hitler, is a pigeon fancier. The British visual and performance artist, Victoria Melody, investigated pigeon fanciers to create a 2009 exhibition, Demographics of a Pigeon Fancier, and a 2012 theatre show, Northern Soul. The projects were the result of months spent living with British pigeon fanciers during the racing season.Melody's description of the exhibition on her website On the U.S. television show NYPD Blue, Detective Bobby Simone raised pigeons. Several episodes featured Simone tending to his pigeons on the roof of his home. = Origins of commercial pigeon keeping = Since their initial domestication by people, pigeons have been seen as a cheap source of good meat. The Romans certainly kept pigeons for food as evidenced by the fact that they were familiar with the practice of force-feeding squabs in order to fatten the young pigeons faster.Wendell (1977) 475 Pigeons were especially prized because they would produce fresh meat during the winter months when larger animals were unavailable as a food source. In the past wealthy landowners often had pigeon houses and kept pigeons. Strict laws were enacted to protect the inhabitants of these structures. =Improving yield= Ten pairs of pigeons can produce eight squabs each month without being fed especially by the pigeon keepers. For a greater yield, commercially raised squab may be produced in a two-nest system, where the mother lays two new eggs in a second nest while the squabs are still growing in the first nest, fed by their father. Establishing two breeding lines has also been suggested as a strategy, where one breeding line is selected for prolificacy and the other is selected for \\"parental performance\\". Hazards Keeping pigeons has been found to lead to a condition called pigeon fancier's lung in some fanciers. Pigeon fancier's lung is an extrinsic allergic reaction resembling asthma which occurs when a person has been exposed to certain proteins in the dust associated with a pigeon's feathers over long periods of time, usually several years. When a fancier develops this condition, there are several treatments which may help him or her to keep his or her pigeons. However, some cases are so severe that the fancier must avoid close contact with pigeons.

He also wrote some Odia poetry. He wrote several Bengali poems criticising the Partition of India. Most notable is \\"Teler shishi bhaanglo bole khukur pare raag karo. Among his many essays, the book Banglar Reneissance has an analytical history of the cultural and social revolution in Bengal. Ray's best known work is Pathe Prabaase, a diary of his trip in Europe in 1931. He died in Kolkata on 28 October 2002.  Family History  This Bengali icon's ancestral place is Kotrung ( present-day Uttarpara Kotrung ) in the Hooghly district of West Bengal. His ancestors migrated from Kotrung to Balasore district of Odisha. His grandmother , Durgamoni , was the daughter of an aristocrat Bengali Sen family of Jajpur . Annada Shankar Ray's father was Nimaicharan Ray and his mother was the daughter of an aristocrat Bengali Palit family of Cuttack. Nimaicharan Ray shifted his base to Dhenkanal following a family feud. Educational life Ray graduated in English from Ravenshaw College in Cuttack. He topped the list of Indian Civil Service examinees in 1927. He had failed to make the mark in the previous year, being cut off by one rank. He was the first ICS officer from the territory later forming the state of Orissa. Literary career After serving in various administrative posts, he sought voluntary retirement in 1951 to devote himself to literary pursuits. Ray was a Gandhian in politics and Rabindranath Tagore inspired his literature. His first published book was Tarunya (1928), which gave him a footing as an essayist. His first two novels were Asamapika and Agun Niye Khela. As an essayist, he was urbane and sophisticated and combined in his craft two different styles of prose, represented by Tagore and Pramatha Choudhury. A significant breakthrough in his literary career came with the publication of Pathe Prabase, a diary of his Europe trip, in 1931. Ray also established himself as a short-story writer. His collections include Prakritir Parihas (1934), Man Pavan (1946), Kamini Kanchan (1954) and Katha. A Bengali rendering of a short story by Tolstoy and an appraisal of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay‚Äôs essay Narir Mulya marked his debut on the literary scene at the age of 16. In Oriya, the poetry \\"Sabita\\" finds place in higher studies of the language at college level, making him one of the few poets to have the distinction of getting such acclaim from two different language speaking states of India.

Set in the 1990s, the book was published in 2004. Thomson is a New Zealand-born physician who is inspired to work in Cambodia after meeting a mature age Cambodian medical student in his Auckland University class. Postlewait is a New York social worker who is struggling to make ends meet after the end of her marriage. Cain is an idealistic Harvard graduate who does not want to go into corporate law. The three stories intersect through the years from Cambodia, to Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, Bosnia and Liberia. This is the first account from UN workers on the front line and an honest memoir about the successes and failures of the UN. \\"Brutal and moving in equal measure, Emergency Sex (And Other Desperate Measures) explores pressing global issues while never losing a sense of the personal. Deeply critical of the West's indifference to developing countries and the UN's repeated failure to intervene decisively, the book provoked massive controversy on its initial publication. Kofi Annan called for the book to be banned, and debate was sparked about the future direction of the UN. Brilliantly written and mordantly funny, it is a book that continues to make waves.\\" Other critiques were not as impressed by the book. The Guardian claimed that one should not become an aid worker if \\"Your favourite book about aid is Emergency Sex.\\" The New Yorker questioned the behavior of the authors, and in its review quoted figures who had been criticized in the book, including Shashi Tharoor, the Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information and an overseer of the peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia. Thandoor stated that ‚Äú[i]t didn‚Äôt seem right for people to work for the organization and trash it the way these people did.‚Äù Doing so while collecting a paycheck, he said, was ‚Äúslightly contemptible. The review further noted that \\"‚ÄúEmergency Sex,‚Äù with its tales of drug use and disillusionment and its emphasis on personal drama, is not a typical whistle-blowing tract; however, the authors do make a number of serious allegations of corruption, negligence, and inadequate leadership, particularly with regard to the genocides in Rwanda and Srebrenica. It also suggested that some of the authors' comments could be described as reckless, and that Andrew Thomson would like his job back; Thomson, who had been stationed in Geneva \\"for the remainder of his term\\" at the time of the book's publishing, was fired for his contributions. Thomson said, ‚ÄúI think Shashi Tharoor has put himself and the organization on a really slippery slope, and at the ugly bottom of that you run into historical revisionism and Holocaust deniers\\", but stated that he still wished \\"to go on serving as a doctor to the staff,‚Äù Later, with the help of the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower's association, Thomson was reinstated and promoted. The book has been optioned for television. Randall Wallace, script writer for Braveheart, is working on the screen play.

Vincamine is extracted from either the seeds of Voacanga africana or the leaves of Vinca minor (lesser periwinkle). Medical uses Vinpocetine has been clinically indicated in Europe for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke and dementia for over three decades. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby or result in miscarriage. Vinpocetine is not approved for any therapeutic use in the United States. The FDA has ruled that vinpocetine, due to its synthetic nature and proposed therapeutic uses, is ineligible to be marketed as dietary supplement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Despite this, vinpocetine remains widely available in dietary supplements often marketed as nootropics. The sale of vinpocetine as a supplement is banned in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada due to \\"potential harmful nootropic characteristics\\". Evidence does not fully support a benefit in either dementia or stroke. As of 2003, three controlled clinical trials had tested \\"older adults with memory problems\\". Side effects Adverse effects of vinpocetine include flushing, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, transient hypo- and hyper-tension, headaches, heartburn, and decreased blood pressure. FDA issued a statement in 2019 warning that \\"vinpocetine may cause a miscarriage or harm fetal development\\". Vinpocetine has been implicated in one case in the induction of agranulocytosis, a serious condition in which granulocytes are markedly decreased. Some people have anecdotally noted that their continued use of vinpocetine reduces immune function. Commission E warned that vinpocetine-reduced immune function could cause apoptosis (cellular death) in the long term. Mechanism of action Vinpocetine‚Äôs mechanism of action has been postulated to involve three potential effects: blockage of sodium channels, reduction of cellular calcium influx, and antioxidant activity. Studies have also suggested that vinpocetine can inhibit PDE-1 in isolated rabbit aorta; inhibit IKK in vitro, preventing IŒ∫B degradation and the following translocation of NF-Œ∫B to the cell nucleus; and increase DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, in isolated striatal nerve endings of rats. Dietary supplement The inclusion of vinpocetine in dietary supplements in the U.S. has come under scrutiny due to the lack of defined dosage parameters, unproven short- and long-term benefits, and risks to human health. In the U.S., vinpocetine supplements are marketed as sports supplements, brain enhancers, and weight loss supplements. A 2015 analysis of 23 brands of vinpocetine dietary supplements sold at GNC and Vitamin Shoppe retail stores reported widespread labeling errors. Only 6 of the 23 supplement labels (26%) provided consumers with accurate dosages of vinpocetine (ranging from 0.3 to 32 mg per recommended daily serving), while 6 of 23 (26%) contained no vinpocetine at all, despite their labels claiming that the ingredient was in them. In total, 9 of the 23 products tested were mislabeled and 17 of 23 (74%) did not provide any information on the quantity of vinpocetine. In response to the study, then-Senator Claire McCaskill, while at the time serving as the top Democrat on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, urged the FDA to suspend sales of vinpocetine supplements and asked 10 retailers to voluntarily stop selling vinpocetine products. McCaskill stated \\"The way we regulate these supplements isn‚Äôt working‚Äîand it‚Äôs putting the lives and well-being of consumers at risk. We‚Äôve seen products with false labels, tainted ingredients, wildly illegal claims, and, now, products containing synthesized ingredients that are classified as prescription drugs in other countries.\\" A 2016 analysis of eight brands of vinpocetine supplements sold in the U.S. found that the amount of vinpocetine contained was highly variable, ranging from 0.6 to 5.1 mg per serving, with most of the product labels providing no information on the amount of vinpocetine. Only one of the products tested contained the amount of vinpocetine that was specified on the label (1.070 mg per serving). The authors of the study noted that the lack of proper labeling regarding the amounts of vinpocetine in the products could pose a risk of adverse effects to consumers. =Lawsuits= Procera AVH is a dietary supplement containing undisclosed amounts of vinpocetine in combination with huperzine A and acetyl-l-carnitine. In 2012, manufacturer Brain Research Labs (BRL) agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a class action lawsuit which alleged that the company had falsely marketed Procera AVH as capable of improving brain function, in violation of the Consumer Fraud Act. In July 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled that marketing claims for Procera AVH, which promoted the product as a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to memory loss and cognitive decline, were false, misleading, unsubstantiated, and in violation of the FTC Act. BRL and its affiliated companies, Brain Power Partners, Brain Power Founders, and MedHealth Direct (all based in Laguna Beach, California) were fined $91 million. KeyView Labs, the Tampa, Florida- based company that purchased BRL in 2012, was fined $61 million. Also named in the FTC complaint were George Reynolds (aka Josh Reynolds), founder and chief science officer of BRL, and John Arnold, the sole officer and employee of MedHealth. The FTC complaint charged Reynolds with making deceptive expert endorsements for Procera AVH. The defendants in the case ultimately agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle the allegations of deceptive advertising brought by the FTC and California law enforcement officials. In addition, a permanent injunction barred the defendants from making similar deceptive claims about Procera AVH in the future and from misrepresenting the existence, results, or conclusions of any scientific study.

He also received honorary graduate degrees from Bob Jones University and Louisiana Baptist Theological Seminary in Sacred Theology. He was the brother-in-law of auto racing legend Hector Honore. Sumner died in December 2016 at the age of 94.http://www.garbc.org/news/with-the-lord/robert-sumner-pastor-and-author/ Ministry He was pastor of a number of Baptist churches in Illinois, California, Texas and Ohio. In 1959, he created the non-profit Sumner Evangelistic Foundation. In 1965, he was on the Council of 14 (now Council of 18) of the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, and he changed the name of his foundation to Regular Baptist Evangelism. In May, 1966, this group launched a newsletter called The Regular Baptist Evangelist, which 9 months later became just The Biblical Evangelist. He has also attended many Christian conferences and lectures. In November, 1980, The Biblical Evangelist stopped publication and Sumner became Managing Editor of a Christian newspaper of (which he had served previously starting in 1954), The Sword of the Lord, which was published by John R. Rice.phone conversation with Robert Sumner 6-20-2014 In 1982, Sumner left The Sword after a dispute with the editor that was mediated by Jack Hyles. After the ordeal, Sumner complained that he was left \\"without an editorial voice\\", so he restarted The Biblical Evangelist by sending letters to former subscribers asking them to resubscribe. Sumner continued as editor of the Biblical Evangelist until 2016, publishing the last edition only two months before he died.Sumner, Robert History - The Biblical Evangelist (accessed 5/26/06) Hyles Expose Sumner received some attention for criticizing Jack Hyles in 1989 when he wrote a story in The Biblical Evangelist called, \\"The Saddest Story I've Ever Told,\\" which accused Hyles of sexual scandals, financial misappropriation and doctrinal errors. These charges were denied by Hyles who deemed them \\"lies\\". Hyles' daughter, Linda [Hyles] Murphrey, confirmed in 2012 the truth of charges against her father, and that she considered her father the leader of a \\"cult.\\" She speaks of this in a TEDx Talk.

The combfish has a long, white body with a prominent, wide, black stripe from its mouth across its eye along the body to the end of the tail. The lower margin of the stripe is wavy and comb-like, giving the fish its common name. The portion of the stripe on the tail fin turns yellow during the breeding season. Also, a thin, red stripe runs along the top of the body from the mouth, along the base of the dorsal fin, for the fin's full length. Comb wrasses often act as cleaners and some get most of their food in this way. The contrasting colour pattern with its cleaning signal stripe acts as a strong attraction to many other reef fish, and they are often surrounded by groups of fishes waiting to be cleaned.

All teachers were summoned by his Majesty king Sobhuza II at the royal kraal to express their concerns. On this day, one of the main speakers to speak on behalf of teachers was the late former deputy prime minister Albert Shabangu. Dlamini was not scheduled to speak on that day, but his colleagues requested that he should speak on behalf of them. He spoke with eloquent SiSwati and received widespread cheers from his colleagues for having defended their strike and clearly making the needs of the teachers known. From time to time, Dlamini would serve King Sobhuza II. Whilst serving in the King's advisory council, he's also head of the southern African development community's brigade (SADC Brigade) which is a group of SADC peace- keeping troops tasked with the responsibility to engage in conflict areas to install peace.

Opened in 1965, the center currently comprises more than eighty-five stores on one level. Anchor stores include Burlington Coat Factory and Marshalls, the mall also features a food court and multiplex movie theater. The 2018 Clint Eastwood movie The Mule had scenes shot in the parking lot of the strip mall. History Originally and formerly called North DeKalb Center, the mall first opened July 29, 1965, with fifty-four stores; original anchor stores included Atlanta-based department store Rich's, and a Woolworth dime store. In 1986, North DeKalb Mall was expanded and renovated with two new anchor stores: department store chains Mervyn's and discount chain Lechmere. The mall was renamed Market Square at North DeKalb at this time. Lechmere closed in 1989 and was replaced with the discount pharmacy chain Phar-Mor, which closed in 1992 and was eventually replaced with a movie theater and Rhodes Furniture. Mervyns shuttered all of its Georgia locations in 1997; the store at North DeKalb was replaced by an Uptons, which closed in 1999, then it became the current Burlington Coat Factory. Stein Mart was added in the early 1990s, replacing a portion of a mall wing which once housed a Spinnaker's restaurant, a Bonanza Steakhouse and smaller mall stores. Old Navy was also added but later closed, becoming Ross Dress for Less. Rhodes Furniture was later Shoder Furniture for a short time before becoming Marshalls in 2010. A furniture store also replaced the old Stein Mart. Hendon Properties, which bought the mall for $25 million (USD) in 2003, planned on bringing a Costco to the mall. On May 15, 2014, it was announced that Lennar Commercial Investors LLC, together with Sterling Organization, purchased the mall for an undisclosed amount, with plans to convert the enclosed portion to an open-air concept. In the spring of early 2016, the Macy's anchor closed. North Dekalb Mall has since become the 'almost' mall of Dekalb County with Costco 'almost' becoming a store anchor for nearly a decade. The mall's primary traffic stems from Emory University employees who use North Dekalb Mall's vast parking lots as a temporary location for ride sharing into the University. This along with limited traffic from the AMC movie theater has helped keep the mall from going completely under. As of 2019, multiple vacant storefronts in the North DeKalb Mall in Georgia were now renovated so that they could be used for filming. Casual Corner, Software Etc., B.

The Etruscan art and antiquities in the family palazzo-museum of Florence, Casa Buonarroti, are his contribution to the artistic-intellectual memorial to the Buonarroti.In the catalogue to the exhibition in Casa Buonarroti, Filippo Buonarroti e la cultura antiquaria sotto gli ultimi Medici (Florence, Cantini, 1986), the curator Daniela Gallo assumes that Filippo must have collected most of the Etruscan art in the Buonarroti collection. Buonarroti pursued studies in law and exercised an early scientific curiosity. His early iconographic study of Imperial bronze coins and medals of Roman emperors in the collection of Cardinal Gasparo di Carpegna,Gasparo dei conti di Carpegna (1625-1714), titular archbishop of Nicea, a functionary of the Papal curia, was made a cardinal in 1670 (Salvador Miranda, \\"Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church\\"). which he dedicated to Cosimo III, made his reputation as a scholar; it was published as Osservazioni Istoriche sopra alcuni medaglioni antichi all'Altezza Serenissima di Cosimo III Granduca di Toscana\\"Observations on some ancient medalions [dedicated] to His Most Serene Highness, Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany\\" (On-line catalogue entry). (Rome 1698) and contained thirty full-page engraved plates by Francesco Andreoni, all but one of coins. The books had its origins in Buonarroti's years 1684 to 1699 in Rome in the familia of Cardinal Carpegna, whom he served as secretary, conservator of collections and librarian.On-line Informatico Archivio di Stato di Firenze.

In Firenze: nella stamperia di S.A.R. per Jacopo Guiducci, e Santi Franchi, MDCCXVI [1716]. In 1699 Cosimo III recalled him to Tuscany and employed him as Auditore delle Riformagioni, as minister of the Pratica of Pistoia, secretary of the Florentine Pratica and as a participant in a newly organised committee for jurisdictional affairs. In 1700 he was made a senator, a purely honorary role in the Medici Grand Duchy. He is remembered most for his pioneering study of gold glass vessel bottoms used as grave-makers in the Catacombs of Rome, Osservazioni sopra alcuni frammenti di vasi antichi di vetro ornate di figure trovati nei cimiteri di Roma (1716),Observations on some fragments of antique glass vases decorated with figures, found in the cemeteries of Rome in which he made the extraordinary, almost proto-Romantic assertion that the aesthetic crudity of early Christian art, often remarked by connoisseurs of Roman arts, had served to intensify the piety of the worshipper, an early expression of feeling for primitive art.James Hall, \\"Michelangelo and the Etruscans\\", New York Review of Books 53.17 ¬∑ 2 November 2006 He updated and edited Thomas Dempster's De Etruria regali (in eight volumes, 1723), a classic study of Etruscan art that had been written a century earlier by the Scottish scholar who was based in Pisa.See Seduzione etrusca : dai segreti di Holkham Hall alle meraviglie del British Museum, a cura di Palolo Bruschetti, Bruno Gialluca, Paolo Giulierini, Suzanne Reynolds, Judith Swaddling, Milan, Skira, 2014.

Firearm modification is commonly done in order to enhance various aspects of the performance of a firearm. Reasons for these modifications can range from cosmetic to functional, and can be simple operations that the owner can perform, or complex operations requiring the services of a gunsmith. Modifications performed Common modifications include: * Cosmetic and ergonomic modifications ** Replacement or alteration of grips or stocks ** Changing of sights, such as the adjustable iron sights or a telescopic sight ** Adding or removing weight to ease carrying, alter balance, or help moderate recoil ** Metal engraving or custom woodwork ** Checkering or stippling wood or metal ** Altering the metal finish, using techniques such as bluing, electroplating, or parkerizing ** Use of a shorter barrel to reduce size and weight, or a longer barrel to increase velocity * Caliber conversions ** Rechambering or rebarreling for a new caliber, such as conversions made to chamber a wildcat cartridge ** Use of a caliber conversion sleeve or other readily removable insert to fire a smaller, less expensive cartridge * Operating mechanism conversions ** Muzzleloading or paper cartridge to metallic cartridge conversions, such as the Allin conversion or Lund conversion ** Conversion from fully automatic or select fire to semiautomatic only or manual operation, or vice versa ** Short recoil to blowback conversions, used in various .22 Long Rifle conversions, such as the Colt Ace and J. A. Ceiner conversion kits. ** Conversion from handgun to carbine or rifle ** Addition of a rifled barrel to a shotgun to allow it to better fire shotgun slugs *Accurizing *Sporterizing Some commonly customized firearms include the Ruger 10/22 carbine, the M1911 pistol, and the AR-15 rifle, all of which have large numbers of aftermarket parts suppliers. Shooting disciplines such as bullseye pistol and benchrest shooting also rely extensively on custom-built and modified firearms to achieve top accuracy. Legal issues Care must be taken when modifying firearms, as some operations may convert a legal firearm into an illegal one. An example of this is the restrictions in the US National Firearms Act, which define restricted classes of firearms. Examples of illegal firearms under this act are: *Rifles with overall lengths under 26 inches, or barrels under 16 inches in length *Shotguns with overall lengths under 26 inches, or barrels under 18 inches in length *Machine guns *A conversion to a fixed cartridge of over .50 caliber These restrictions vary from location to location; some areas may restrict magazine capacity or require special safety devices such as loaded chamber indicators, integral locking mechanisms, magazine disconnects. Also commonly required are identifying marks such as serial numbers or firearm microstamping components, removal of which may be illegalSee Gun Control Act of 1968 Furthermore - conversion of semi-automatic weapons into select-fire weapons has been illegal for non-SOT holding gunsmiths since the passage of the Hughes Amendment in 1986. Such weapons may be held only by law enforcement and military only except for \\"dealer samples\\" left in the hands of SOT holders. Fully automatic weapons converted to semi-automatic only operation are machine guns per the NFA. The BATFE's policy is \\"Once a machine gun, always a machine gun.\\" See also * Pedersen rifle References Firearm terminology ","title":"Firearm modification"},{"id":"4329257","text":"Cows at a stock tank with piped water A stock tank is used to provide drinking water for animals such as cattle or horses. Stock tanks can range in size from 100 L to over 5500 L (30 to 1500 gallons) and typically are made of galvanized steel. These tanks are filled either by a pump, windpump, creek, spring, or even rely on runoff water from rain or melting snow. In Texas, ranchers refer to ponds and watering holes as stock tanks. Trick tank A trick tank is type of stock tank. It collects precipitation, holds the water in a covered tank to minimize evaporation and maintain adequate water quality, and dispenses water on demand into a basin from which animals can drink. Dispensing may be regulated by a mechanical float device similar to a ballcock in the tank of a flush toilet. Trick tanks are manufactured in several styles, including inverted umbrella and apron. They are heavy and often are used in remote wilderness locations, to which they may require delivery via helicopter.New Mexico Game & Fish: Habitat Stamp Projects To provide water to wild animals, not livestock, fencing may be built to surround a trick tank. Fences serve to exclude cattle and sheep. Trick tanks are widely used in the southwest United States, where periodic droughts may cause population crashes in game animals unless water supplies are provided.  Other uses  Stock tanks can be repurposed as backyard pools, or \\"stock tank pools,\\" using chlorine tabs and a filter pump Stock tanks are increasingly used as \\"rustic\\" backyard above-ground pools, or \\"stock tank pools\\" by retrofitting a filter pump and adding chlorine to keep the water clean throughout the summer. Metal stock tanks have also been used as a cheap alternative for a hot tub. Various heating methods are possible, including use of a propane heater or submersible wood stove. Another use of a stock tank is at a fair or other event where they are filled with ice to keep canned and bottled beverages, or even perishables such as watermelons. A cowboy church commonly uses a stock tank for water baptisms. Stock tanks can also make perfect indoor habitats for aquatic pets, such as turtles or frogs. Tackle shops are known to store minnows for fishing in them.

Although it only had 10 modules at time of release, it currently has more than 120 modules plus several different enclosures and accessories. Design A-100 modules are designed to be rackmounted, each being 3U tall and a multiple of 2HP wide, and a variety of cases are available to house them. This type of racking system, 'Eurorack', has been adopted by many other manufacturers of synthesiser modules. Modules are patched using standard mono miniature (3.5 mm) leads. This combination of 3U height, multiples of 2HP width, and 3.5 mm leads is known more generally as the Eurorack standard, and is in contrast to the older combination of 5U height and 6.35 mm leads pioneered by Moog. Other companies such as Analogue Solutions, Analogue Systems, Roland, Moog and Cwejman have also adopted the Eurorack standard, making it relatively easy to integrate their modules into each other's systems. Example uses Using certain modules designed specifically for the purpose, it is possible to use the A-100 system to emulate a Trautonium or a Theremin, as well as to use it as a vocoder.

The play consists of a single scene with four male characters. Plot The plot concerns Robert and Jeff, two old friends who are taking their theater partnership (Jeff writes the plays, Robert directs them) to the big screen in their first film. They've saved filming the final and most important scene of their movie for last; a complicated outdoor sequence involving hundreds of extras portraying disillusioned marines jogging at sunset. All is going seemingly well, until suddenly yet slowly, three cows walk directly into the shot. In response to this, some colorful language is exchanged. After some deep contemplation of whether or not one could feasibly find cows on a marine compound, let alone in Guam at all, Robert has somewhat of a mental breakdown as the sun continues to set \\"seemingly faster than it's ever set before\\". This causes Robert and Jeff to question their work, their relationship, the artistic health of contemporary film-making, and the ethics of shooting cows with firearms. The other two roles are a hard-nosed manager (Reuben) and a geeky production assistant (Craig).

He played full-forward in Caulfield Grammar's First XVIII, a team which also contained two other future VFL players: Ron Cabble who played with Hawthorn, and Footscray's John Schultz. Evans later gained both a BSc and an MBA. Football career Although not solidly built (he weighed 78 kg), he was 6'2\\" (188 cm), and his very long arms gave him extra inches in marking contests. Recruited from Essendon Baptists in 1958 ‚Äì he had broken the Essendon District Football League's Essendon goalkicking record in 1957 ‚Äì he played his first senior match for Essendon, as a reserve, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, against Melbourne on 10 May 1958. Altogether, he played 64 games for Essendon from 1958 to 1962, mostly at full-forward, kicking 210 goals. He played his best football under coach Dick Reynolds. He missed a number of games through injury in 1961; but, in 1962, John Coleman's second year as coach, he only played six senior games for Essendon,As an individual player, he was never comfortable with the change of coaching style that came with Coleman. Coleman insisted on a far more strong, fearless, and vigorous style of team playing, than that formerly demanded by the gentler, more graceful Reynolds. having lost his regular place at full-forward to Charlie Payne. His brief senior record is impressive: * 1958: 10 games (2 as a reserve), 27 goals (including 7 goals in one match) ‚Äî plus 1 night game, 1 goal. * 1959: 20 games, 78 goals (including 9 goals in a match on two occasions, and 6 goals in a match on another two occasions) ** 1959: full- forward in losing Grand-Final team)1959 VFL season#Grand Final Teams ** 1959: Victorian State Team ** 1959: VFL Leading Goalkicker at 19 years, 78 goals (including 5 goals from only 6 touches in the 1959 First Semi-Final against Collingwood, and 2 goals in the losing GrandFinal against Melbourne) * 1960: 18 games, 67 goals (including 10 goals in a match on one occasion, 8 goals in a match on one occasion, and 6 goals in a match on another) ** 1960: Victorian State Team ** 1960: VFL Leading Goalkicker 67 goalsThe 1960 season had been conducted throughout a very wet winter. The constant rain and the atrocious condition of many of the grounds ‚Äì with, for example, the Fitzroy Football Club's home ground, the Brunswick Street Oval often a quagmire ‚Äì meant that there were very few opportunities for full-forwards in a season that was notable throughout for its very low scoring.

He retired as a footballer at the end of the 1965 season at the age of 26. Cricket career He was a fine wicket-keeper whilst at Caulfield Grammar School; and, much to the distress of its headmaster, S. W. Kurrle, who wanted him to play for the school's First XI, Evans played his first District cricket match for North Melbourne Cricket Club whilst still at school, at 16 years of age.Youth has its Pennant Fling, The Argus, (Friday, 2 December 1955), p.29. When he returned to Melbourne after his sojourn in Western Australia, he resumed his cricketing career with North Melbourne, and went on to play a total of 126 games for the North Melbourne First XI. He captained the First XI, and was made a life member of the club. His club record of five catches and three stumpings as a North Melbourne First XI wicketkeeper has never been surpassed. Football administrator He served on the committee of the Essendon Football Club from 1978 to 1987, having lost the 1981 election for president by a single vote to his former teammate Greg Sewell.Mapleston, 1996, p. 197. In 1988 he stood for president once again; and, despite Sewell being a hot favourite for the position, Evans won the election. He served as President of the Essendon Football Club from 1988 to 1992. Evans unexpectedly announced his retirement as president of the Essendon F.C. at the end of 1992. As president he had been responsible for many significant events and changes, including engineering the 1992 move of Essendon's home matches to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the 1991 retention of coach Kevin Sheedy when it seemed inevitable that Sheedy would move to New South Wales and coach the Sydney Swans. Soon after his surprise resignation it was revealed that he had been appointed to one of the new positions of AFL commissioner whose task it was to guide, influence and direct the future of the AFL competition. He served as an AFL commissioner from 1993 to 1997 and from 1998 to 2007 he was the chairman of the AFL (i.e., the governing body of the premier Australian rules football competition). Business interests Evans also became a very successful businessman, working as an executive for Spotless, and later as the company's managing director from 1992 to 2004.There was considerable controversy in 2000 over the fact that, with the AFL's Chairman Ron Evans as its managing director, Spotless Services (through its subsidiary company Nationwide Venue Management, or NVM) was the operator of the AFL's Colonial Stadium, now known as Docklands Stadium ‚Äî see Channel Nine Sunday Programme Chat Transcript: John Lyons on the AFL and Channel Nine Sunday Programme Transcript: Behind the Rules. On 12 June 2006, in the Queen's Birthday Honours List, he was made a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia for service to business and Australian rules football. Legacy In 2006, the AFL announced that Evans was to have an abdominal tumor removed and that, due to his ill-health he was retiring. He died of abdominal cancer on 9 March 2007. He was posthumously awarded membership in the administrator's Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2007.Norm Smith officially an AFL legend ‚Äì realfooty.com.au The Ron Evans Medal was created in his name, awarded to the AFL Rising Star of that year, beginning in 2007, when it was inaugurally presented to Joel Selwood of the Geelong Football Club.

However, this interpretation of its implications has been criticized in several publications reviewed in Altenberg, L. (1995). The Schema Theorem and Price‚Äôs Theorem. Foundations of genetic algorithms, 3, 23-49., where the Schema Theorem is shown to be a special case of the Price equation with the schema indicator function as the macroscopic measurement. A schema is a template that identifies a subset of strings with similarities at certain string positions. Schemata are a special case of cylinder sets, and hence form a topological space.  Description  Consider binary strings of length 6. The schema \`1*10*1\` describes the set of all strings of length 6 with 1's at positions 1, 3 and 6 and a 0 at position 4. The * is a wildcard symbol, which means that positions 2 and 5 can have a value of either 1 or 0. The order of a schema o(H) is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template, while the defining length delta(H) is the distance between the first and last specific positions. The order of \`1*10*1\` is 4 and its defining length is 5. The fitness of a schema is the average fitness of all strings matching the schema. The fitness of a string is a measure of the value of the encoded problem solution, as computed by a problem-specific evaluation function. Using the established methods and genetic operators of genetic algorithms, the schema theorem states that short, low-order schemata with above-average fitness increase exponentially in successive generations. Expressed as an equation: :operatorname{E}(m(H,t+1)) geq {m(H,t) f(H) over a_t}[1-p]. Here m(H,t) is the number of strings belonging to schema H at generation t, f(H) is the observed average fitness of schema H and a_t is the observed average fitness at generation t. The probability of disruption p is the probability that crossover or mutation will destroy the schema H. It can be expressed as: :p = {delta(H) over l-1}p_c + o(H) p_m where o(H) is the order of the schema, l is the length of the code, p_m is the probability of mutation and p_c is the probability of crossover. So a schema with a shorter defining length delta(H) is less likely to be disrupted. An often misunderstood point is why the Schema Theorem is an inequality rather than an equality. The answer is in fact simple: the Theorem neglects the small, yet non-zero, probability that a string belonging to the schema H will be created \\"from scratch\\" by mutation of a single string (or recombination of two strings) that did not belong to H in the previous generation. Limitation Plot of a multimodal function in two variables. The schema theorem holds under the assumption of a genetic algorithm that maintains an infinitely large population, but does not always carry over to (finite) practice: due to sampling error in the initial population, genetic algorithms may converge on schemata that have no selective advantage. This happens in particular in multimodal optimization, where a function can have multiple peaks: the population may drift to prefer one of the peaks, ignoring the others. The reason that the Schema Theorem cannot explain the power of genetic algorithms is that it holds for all problem instances, and cannot distinguish between problems in which genetic algorithms perform poorly, and problems for which genetic algorithms perform well.

It was the largest shopping mall in Georgia when it opened on August 8, 1973. History Cumberland Mall in Atlanta was the first four-anchor mall built in Georgia, and only the second such mall in the entire Southeastern United States. It was developed by Crow Carter & Company. The original anchors to the mall were Rich's, Davison's, Sears and JCPenney. Cumberland Mall remained one of the leading malls in the region for over a decade before Town Center Mall in Kennesaw opened in 1986. Cumberland Mall originally featured many distinct design elements to heighten the original mall experience, but as competition forced a major reshuffling of the mall, much of this was stripped away in the renovation of 1989. Some of the original tenants that were lost at this point were Magic Pan, McDonald's, Piccadilly Cafeteria and Cashin's Restaurant among others. One of the additions, however, was a food court, which had not existed previously. In 2003 Cumberland Mall lost its first anchor, Macy's (formerly Davison's). The vacant store resulted in a major redevelopment plan. The redevelopment included the demolition of the old Macys, which was replaced with a new mall entrance complete with an open-air wing. This mall has restaurants such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Maggiano's Little Italy, The Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, Stoney River Legendary Steaks, and Ted's Montana Grill. Other changes included the demolition of the JCPenney, which planned to close its store, for the construction of a new Costco. The changes also included a complete interior renovation with new skylights and an expanded food court. These changes were planned to keep the mall competitive, even with only two traditional department stores remaining: Macy's (former Rich's) and Sears. All the renovations were completed in early 2007. In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties, including the Sears at Cumberland Mall, into Seritage Growth Properties. On March 11, 2015, Tomorrow's News Today - Atlanta detailed Kroger's plans to take over the upper level of Sears and reopen it as a 93,000-square-foot grocery store by the summer of 2016. On January 12, 2016, Kroger announced that it was no longer coming to Cumberland Mall after all. On August 22, 2018, Sears announced that it would be closing in November 2018 as part of a plan to close 46 stores nationwide. After the store closed Costco and Macy‚Äôs are the remaining anchors left. As of Monday, June 8, 2020 Ted‚Äôs Montana Grill has officially closed its doors for good due to COVID-19 financial restraints; so now the only restaurants left are Buffalo Wild Wings, Maggianos Little Italy, The Cheesecake Factory, P.F. Chang‚Äôs Bistro, and Stoney River Legendary Steaks! On August 21, 2020, Dick's Sporting Goods and Golf Galaxy were added to the mall and replaced the upper level of the former Sears building, along with Planet Fitness; which is opened on September 1, 2020. The mall is connected to the Cobb Galleria Centre via a pedestrian walkway that bridges Cobb Parkway. =Current anchors= *Costco Wholesale (November 15, 2006-present) *Dick's Sporting Goods/Golf Galaxy (August 21, 2020-present) *Macy's (1986-2003, March 6, 2005-present) *Planet Fitness (September 1, 2020-present) =Upcoming anchors= *Round One Entertainment (2020) =Former anchors= *Davison's (August 8, 1973-1986) *JCPenney (August 8, 1973-2005) *Rich's (August 8, 1973-March 6, 2005) *Sears (August 8, 1973-November 26, 2018) Cumberland Mall in 2018 See also *Cumberland (edge-city of Atlanta) *Cobb Galleria References  External links  *Official Website Shopping malls in the Atlanta metropolitan area Buildings and structures in Cobb County, Georgia Tourist attractions in Cobb County, Georgia Brookfield Properties Retail Group Shopping malls established in 1973 ","title":"Cumberland Mall"},{"id":"4329406","text":"In computer programming, a declaration is a language construct that specifies properties of an identifier: it declares what a word (identifier) \\"means\\".\\"A declaration specifies the interpretation and attributes of a set of identifiers. A definition of an identifier is a declaration for that identifier that: * for an object [variable or constant], causes storage to be reserved for that object; * for a function, includes the function body; * for an enumeration constant, is the (only) declaration of the identifier; * for a typedef name, is the first (or only) declaration of the identifier.\\" C11 specification, 6.7: Declarations, paragraph 5. Declarations are most commonly used for functions, variables, constants, and classes, but can also be used for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions. Beyond the name (the identifier itself) and the kind of entity (function, variable, etc.), declarations typically specify the data type (for variables and constants), or the type signature (for functions); types may also include dimensions, such as for arrays. A declaration is used to announce the existence of the entity to the compiler; this is important in those strongly typed languages that require functions, variables, and constants, and their types to be specified with a declaration before use, and is used in forward declaration. The term \\"declaration\\" is frequently contrasted with the term \\"definition\\", but meaning and usage varies significantly between languages; see below. Declarations are particularly prominent in languages in the ALGOL tradition, including the BCPL family, most prominently C and C++, and also Pascal. Java uses the term \\"declaration\\", though Java does not require separate declarations and definitions. Declaration vs. definition One basic dichotomy is whether or not a declaration contains a definition: for example, whether a declaration of a constant or variable specifies the value of the constant (respectively, initial value of a variable), or only its type; and similarly whether a declaration of a function specifies the body (implementation) of the function, or only its type signature. Not all languages make this distinction: in many languages, declarations always include a definition, and may be referred to as either \\"declarations\\" or \\"definitions\\", depending on the language. However, these concepts are distinguished in languages that require declaration before use (for which forward declarations are used), and in languages where interface and implementation are separated: the interface contains declarations, the implementation contains definitions. In informal usage, a \\"declaration\\" refers only to a pure declaration (types only, no value or body), while a \\"definition\\" refers to a declaration that includes a value or body. However, in formal usage (in language specifications), \\"declaration\\" includes both of these senses, with finer distinctions by language: in C and C++, a declaration of a function that does not include a body is called a function prototype, while a declaration of a function that does include a body is called a \\"function definition\\". In Java declarations occur in two forms. For public methods they can be presented in interfaces as method signatures, which consist of the method names, input types and output type. A similar notation can be used in the definition of abstract methods, which do not contain a definition. The enclosing class can be instantiated, rather a new derived class, which provides the definition of the method, would need to be created in order to create an instance of the class. Starting with Java 8, the lambda expression was included in the language, which could be viewed as a function declaration.  Declarations and Definitions  In the C-family of programming languages, declarations are often collected into header files, which are included in other source files that reference and use these declarations, but don't have access to the definition. The information in the header file provides the interface between code that uses the declaration and that which defines it, a form of information hiding. A declaration is often used in order to access functions or variables defined in different source files, or in a library. A mismatch between the definition type and the declaration type generates a compiler error. For variables, definitions assign values to an area of memory that was reserved during the declaration phase. For functions, definitions supply the function body. While a variable or function may be declared many times, it is typically defined once (in C++, this is known as the One Definition Rule or ODR). Dynamic languages such as JavaScript or Python generally allow functions to be redefined, that is, re- bound; a function is a variable much like any other, with a name and a value (the definition). Here are some examples of declarations that are not definitions, in C: extern char example1; extern int example2; void example3(void); Here are some examples of declarations that are definitions, again in C: char example1; /* Outside of a function definition it will be initialized to zero. */ int example2 = 5; void example3(void) { /* definition between braces */ }  Undefined variables  In some programming languages, an implicit declaration is provided the first time such a variable is encountered at compile time. In other languages, such a usage is considered to be an error, which may resulting in a diagnostic message. Some languages have started out with the implicit declaration behavior, but as they matured they provided an option to disable it (e.g. Perl's \\"\`use strict\`\\" or Visual Basic's \\"\`Option Explicit\`\\").

He is best known for his contributions in developing Australian multiculturalism and for being one of the most prominent moderate Liberal Party of Australia politicians. Early years Born in Sydney in 1938, Macphee studied at the University of Sydney and the University of Hawaii, attaining a Bachelor in Law and a Master in Arts, before moving to Melbourne where he served as Director of The Victorian Chamber of Manufacturers. In 1974 he won the blue-ribbon seat of Balaclava as the Liberal candidate. After the Liberals gained government under the leadership of Malcolm Fraser the following year, Macphee initially remained on the backbench, but in November 1976 Macphee was promoted to the junior ministry where he served as Minister for Productivity. In government After three years in the productivity portfolio, Macphee replaced Michael MacKellar as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Fraser and MacKellar had already adopted the recommendations of the Galbally report, which led to a new framework for migrant settlement. Macphee, with the full support of Fraser, continued the pace of reform, allowing large numbers of Indochinese refugees into Australia and he also introduced a family reunion scheme for these refugees. Macphee was assisted by receiving full bipartisan support from the shadow Immigration Minister Mick Young.Kelly P., \\"John Malcolm Fraser\\" in Grattan M. (ed) Australian Prime Ministers, New Holland, Sydney, 2000 p. 369-70. In the 1980 and the 1983 elections, Macphee retained his seat, defeating Labor candidate Chris Kennedy. Macphee helped oversee the introduction of the Special Broadcasting Service. He played an important role in the opening of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs and he worked with the Institute's director, Petro Georgiou, in overseeing government policy in this area. After his retirement Macphee described his time as Immigration Minister as the most \\"exciting...[and] absolutely enriching\\" time during his period in parliament. Macphee became a Cabinet minister in May 1982 when Fraser promoted him to Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. Macphee defended the role of compulsory arbitration as a means to protect wages in spite of pressure from the more conservative elements within the party, and held this post until the Fraser Government was defeated in March 1983.Woodward D., Australia Unsettled: The Legacy of 'Neoliberalism', Pearson, Sydney, 2005 p. 72 In opposition Upon this defeat, the Liberal Party became badly divided between the moderate (wet) and the conservative (dry) forces within the party. Macphee, as one of the party's leading moderates, became a strong supporter of Andrew Peacock, who defeated John Howard for the leadership of the party. Macphee remained in Shadow Cabinet, continuing as shadow Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations before he was given the job of shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs after the 1984 election. At this election, Macphee transferred to the newly created Goldstein, essentially a reconfigured version of Balaclava. In 1985 Howard successfully challenged for the leadership. Macphee stood for the deputy leadership that Howard had vacated, finishing runner-up to Neil Brown with 15 votes out of 70. Howard kept Macphee in the Shadow Cabinet, although he became Shadow Minister for Communications rather than retain his more prestigious former portfolio. Macphee kept this position until April 1987 when Howard sacked him.Henderson G., Menzies' Child, The Liberal Party of Australia 1944 - 1994, Allen & Urwin, Sydney, 1994 p. 290 In 1988 Howard commented that immigration from Asia should be slowed down. This position attracted criticism from the Labor Party but also many of his colleagues in the Liberal Party, especially from those who had implemented multicultural policies under Fraser. In order to expose Liberal divisions on the issue, Prime Minister Bob Hawke moved a motion in Parliament that race or ethnic origin should never be a criterion for becoming an immigrant to Australia. Macphee was one of the several Liberals who crossed the floor to support the motion and he received support from prominent Liberal Party politicians such as Nick Greiner and Jeff Kennett for his stand.Henderson (1994), p. 298 Preselection challenge Early in the following year, Macphee lost Liberal preselection in Goldstein‚Äîthe real contest in this safe Liberal seat‚Äîto academic David Kemp. This challenge was portrayed in the media as a \\"wet\\" versus \\"dry\\" battle, although some commentators, such as Gerard Henderson, argued that Macphee had simply lost the support of the Liberal members in his electorate.Henderson (1994), p. 299 Macphee blamed his loss on his decision to oppose Howard's position on Asian immigration. This event further crippled an already divided party and contributed to Howard losing the leadership back to Peacock in May 1989. With the next election not due until 1990, Macphee briefly returned to Shadow Cabinet under Peacock, again serving as shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs. He returned to the backbench until retiring prior to the 1990 election, due to David Kemp being preselected in his place as the candidate for Goldstein. After politics Macphee remained in public life. He served on the board of CARE Australia and from 1994 he served as a director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for a period of five years. Macphee also worked with fellow former Liberal MP Alan Hunt in reforming the Victorian Legislative Council in a Constitutional Commission set up by the Bracks Labor Government. On 26 January 1992, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for \\"service to the Australian parliament\\". Macphee was critical of the Howard Government (with no love lost between him and Howard), stating that he was \\"consistently outraged\\" by the Government's position on refugee policy. He also publicly supported the 2005 \\"backbench revolt\\" of Petro Georgiou, Judi Moylan, Bruce Baird and Russell Broadbent, which saw the softening of some aspects of the legislation.Macphee I.M., Liberalism Gets a Hearing Again, The Australian, 20 June 2005 Macphee was also highly critical of the Howard Government's role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.The Age, 6 March 2003 In 2017 speaking as a former immigration minister, Macphee criticised the powers held by current Immigration Minister Peter Dutton as \\"unchecked and unjust.\\" https://www.theguardian.com/australia- news/2017/may/04/duttons-powers-unchecked-and-unjust-former-liberal- immigration-minister-says References . 1938 births Living people Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Members of the Cabinet of Australia Members of the Australian House of Representatives Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Balaclava Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Goldstein Officers of the Order of Australia Politicians from Melbourne People from Sydney Australian people of Scottish descent 20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Ian Macphee"},{"id":"4329444","text":"Happy Endings is a 2005 American dramedy film written and directed by Don Roos and starring Tom Arnold, Jesse Bradford, Bobby Cannavale, Steve Coogan, Laura Dern, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Lisa Kudrow and Jason Ritter. The expression \\"happy ending\\" is a colloquial term for offering sexual release to a client at the end of a massage. Plot The film follows a diverse group of mostly middle- class Los Angelenos through the emotional ups and downs in their flawed yet very human lives, each loosely connected to each other through a restaurant. In the first story, Mamie reluctantly agrees to work with a would-be young filmmaker in order to locate the now grown son she secretly gave up for adoption after becoming pregnant from her stepbrother Charley - who is later revealed to be gay - 19 years earlier. In the second story arc, her stepbrother, and his domestic partner, Gil, are deciding whether or not to confront their friends, a lesbian couple, regarding the paternity of their son. And in the third, a young man, Otis, is involved with a band and trying to keep his father, Frank, from learning that he is gay, while also dealing with the seemingly gold-digging woman, Jude, who inserts herself into their lives.

The asteroid was discovered on 17 March 1993, during the Uppsala‚ÄìESO Survey of Asteroids and Comets (UESAC) at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile. It was named for actor and Monty Python member, Graham Chapman.  Orbit and classification  Grahamchapman is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest collisional groups of stony asteroids. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,211 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1951, extending the body's observation arc by 42 years prior to its official discovery observation at La Silla.  Physical characteristics  = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Grahamchapman measures 2.84 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.245. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with Petr Pravec's revised NEOWISE data and gives an albedo of 0.224 with a diameter of 2.85 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 14.97. = Asteroid moon = In February 2006, observations by the Ond≈ôejov NEO Photometric Program determined that Grahamchapman is orbited by a minor-planet moon. The satellite is about a quarter the size of Grahamchapman, and orbits it about once every 19 hours, 23 minutes, and 5 seconds. = Rotation period and shape = The lightcurve study also showed that Grahamchapman itself has a rotation period of 2.28561 hours with a brightness variation of 0.10 magnitude (). A second photometric observation in December 2008, gave an identical period with an amplitude of 0.11 magnitude (). A low brightness amplitude typically indicates that the body has a nearly spheroidal shape.  Naming  This minor planet is named after the comic actor Graham Chapman (1941‚Äì1989). It is the first in a series of six asteroids carrying the names of members of the Monty Python comedy troupe, the others being 9618 Johncleese, 9619 Terrygilliam, 9620 Ericidle, 9621 Michaelpalin and 9622 Terryjones.

It is a charitable private limited company, based at Lumen House, Library Avenue, Harwell Campus, Didcot, OX11 0SG, England. History UCISA was formed on 1 April 1993, by a merger of three bodies: the Inter-University Computing Committee (IUCC), the Polytechnics and Colleges Computer Committee (PCCC), and the Management Information Systems Committee (MISC). This merger took place in response to the Further and Higher Education Act of 1992 which effectively removed the binary distinction between universities and polytechnics/colleges, creating a single higher education sector. Description ucisa represents almost all the major UK universities and higher education colleges and has a growing membership among further education colleges, other educational institutions and commercial organisations interested in information systems and technology in UK education, providing a network of contacts and a lobbying voice. Information systems and technology are increasingly important in further and higher education. The UK Government, funding bodies and powerful commercial interests recognise this, each bringing its agenda and initiatives to bear on individual institutions. In this evermore complex and demanding climate, UCISA plays an important role as the key membership organisation representing those responsible for delivering information systems and technology services in universities, colleges and related institutions. Although mainly for the higher education sector, increasing integration, shared concerns across sectors mean that UCISA membership is appropriate for many other types of educational institution. UCISA is also relevant to those with a commercial interest in the education sector, especially through the annual conferences, which provide an opportunity to meet those involved in information systems and technology delivery within universities and colleges. UCISA provides a national and international presence for the people who work on information systems and services. It helps them to share best practice, maximise cost- effectiveness, develop ideas and inform and support policy making within their institution, nationally and internationally. Aims UCISA exists to promote excellence in the application of information systems and services in support of teaching, learning, research and administration in higher and further education. Its aims are to identify best practice and to spread its use through: * the organisation of conferences, seminars and workshops; * the promotion and support of collaboration between institutions; * the publication, including electronic publication, of material; * the promotion of development and research; * and to inform and support policy-making processes within institutions and nationally on the cost-effective application of information systems and services. Organisation The activities of ucisa are partly devolved to interest-specific working groups; these are: * UCISA-IG (Infrastructure Group) ‚Äì the focal point for activities that sit between the hardware and application programs. * UCISA-CISG (Corporate Information Systems Group) ‚Äì deals with corporate information or management information systems and administrative computing services. * UCISA-NG (Networking Group) ‚Äì monitors and promotes the communications network, associated network services and network security. * UCISA-SDG (Staff Development Group) ‚Äì handles information and activities concerning the training and personal development of staff. * UCISA-SSG (Teaching, Learning and Information Group) ‚Äì offers assistance for members on information, computer-based learning and computer- mediated communications systems. * UCISA-PG (Procurement Group) ‚Äì an advisory body to develop value for money in ICT purchasing.

The method approximates the solution by the vector in a Krylov subspace with minimal residual. The Arnoldi iteration is used to find this vector. The GMRES method was developed by Yousef Saad and Martin H. Schultz in 1986.Y. Saad and M.H. Schultz GMRES is a generalization of the MINRES methodPaige and Saunders, \\"Solution of Sparse Indefinite Systems of Linear Equations\\", SIAM J. Numer. Anal., vol 12, page 617 (1975) https://doi.org/10.1137/0712047 developed by Chris Paige and Michael Saunders in 1975. GMRES also is a special case of the DIIS method developed by Peter Pulay in 1980. DIIS is also applicable to non-linear systems.  The method  Denote the Euclidean norm of any vector v by v. Denote the (square) system of linear equations to be solved by : Ax = b. , The matrix A is assumed to be invertible of size m-by-m. Furthermore, it is assumed that b is normalized, i.e., that b = 1. The n-th Krylov subspace for this problem is : K_n = K_n(A,r_0) = operatorname{span} , { r_0, Ar_0, A^2r_0, ldots, A^{n-1}r_0 }. , where r_0=b-Ax_0 is the initial error given an initial guess x_0 e0. Clearly r_0=b if x_0=0. GMRES approximates the exact solution of Ax = b by the vector x_n in K_n that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the residual r_n= Ax_n-b. The vectors r_0,Ar_0,ldots A^{n-1}r_0 might be close to linearly dependent, so instead of this basis, the Arnoldi iteration is used to find orthonormal vectors q_1, q_2, ldots, q_n , which form a basis for K_n. In particular, q_1=r_0_2^{-1}r_0. Therefore, the vector x_n in K_n can be written as x_n = x_0 + Q_n y_n with y_n in mathbb{R}^n , where Q_n is the m-by-n matrix formed by q_1,ldots,q_n . The Arnoldi process also produces an (n+1)-by-n upper Hessenberg matrix tilde{H}_n with : AQ_n = Q_{n+1} tilde{H}_n. , Because columns of Q_n are orthonormal, we have :  r_n  =  b - A x_n  =  b - A(x_0 + z_n)  =  r_0 - A z_n  =  beta q_1 - A Q_n y_n  =  beta q_1 - Q_{n+1} tilde{H}_n y_n  =  Q_{n+1} (beta e_1 - tilde{H}_n y_n)  =  beta e_1 - tilde{H}_n y_n  , , where : e_1 = (1,0,0,ldots,0)^T , is the first vector in the standard basis of mathbb{R}^{n+1} , and : beta = b-Ax_0 , , x_0 being the first trial vector (usually zero). Hence, x_n can be found by minimizing the Euclidean norm of the residual : r_n = tilde{H}_n y_n - beta e_1. This is a linear least squares problem of size n. This yields the GMRES method. On the n-th iteration: # calculate q_n with the Arnoldi method; # find the y_n which minimizes r_n; # compute x_n = x_0 + Q_n y_n ; # repeat if the residual is not yet small enough. At every iteration, a matrix-vector product A q_n must be computed. This costs about 2m^2 floating-point operations for general dense matrices of size m, but the cost can decrease to O(m) for sparse matrices. In addition to the matrix-vector product, O(nm) floating-point operations must be computed at the n -th iteration.  Convergence  The nth iterate minimizes the residual in the Krylov subspace Kn. Since every subspace is contained in the next subspace, the residual does not increase. After m iterations, where m is the size of the matrix A, the Krylov space Km is the whole of Rm and hence the GMRES method arrives at the exact solution. However, the idea is that after a small number of iterations (relative to m), the vector xn is already a good approximation to the exact solution. This does not happen in general. Indeed, a theorem of Greenbaum, Pt√°k and Strako≈° states that for every nonincreasing sequence a1, ‚Ä¶, am‚àí1, am = 0, one can find a matrix A such that the rn = an for all n, where rn is the residual defined above. In particular, it is possible to find a matrix for which the residual stays constant for m ‚àí 1 iterations, and only drops to zero at the last iteration. In practice, though, GMRES often performs well. This can be proven in specific situations. If the symmetric part of A, that is (A^T + A)/2, is positive definite, then : r_n leq left( 1-frac{lambda_{min}^2(1/2(A^T + A))}{ lambda_{max}(A^T A)} right)^{n/2} r_0, where lambda_{mathrm{min}}(M) and lambda_{mathrm{max}}(M) denote the smallest and largest eigenvalue of the matrix M, respectively.Eisenstat, Elman & Schultz, Thm 3.3. NB all results for GCR also hold for GMRES, cf. Saad & Schultz If A is symmetric and positive definite, then we even have : r_n leq left( frac{kappa_2(A)^2-1}{kappa_2(A)^2} right)^{n/2} r_0. where kappa_2(A) denotes the condition number of A in the Euclidean norm. In the general case, where A is not positive definite, we have : frac{r_n}{b} le inf_{p in P_n} p(A) le kappa_2(V) inf_{p in P_n} max_{lambda in sigma(A)} p(lambda), , where Pn denotes the set of polynomials of degree at most n with p(0) = 1, V is the matrix appearing in the spectral decomposition of A, and œÉ(A) is the spectrum of A. Roughly speaking, this says that fast convergence occurs when the eigenvalues of A are clustered away from the origin and A is not too far from normality.Trefethen & Bau, Thm 35.2 All these inequalities bound only the residuals instead of the actual error, that is, the distance between the current iterate xn and the exact solution.  Extensions of the method  Like other iterative methods, GMRES is usually combined with a preconditioning method in order to speed up convergence. The cost of the iterations grow as O(n2), where n is the iteration number. Therefore, the method is sometimes restarted after a number, say k, of iterations, with xk as initial guess. The resulting method is called GMRES(k) or Restarted GMRES. For non-positive definite matrices, this method may suffer from stagnation in convergence as the restarted subspace is often close to the earlier subspace. The shortcomings of GMRES and restarted GMRES are addressed by the recycling of Krylov subspace in the GCRO type methods such as GCROT and GCRODR. Recycling of Krylov subspaces in GMRES can also speed up convergence when sequences of linear systems need to be solved.  Comparison with other solvers  The Arnoldi iteration reduces to the Lanczos iteration for symmetric matrices. The corresponding Krylov subspace method is the minimal residual method (MinRes) of Paige and Saunders. Unlike the unsymmetric case, the MinRes method is given by a three-term recurrence relation. It can be shown that there is no Krylov subspace method for general matrices, which is given by a short recurrence relation and yet minimizes the norms of the residuals, as GMRES does. Another class of methods builds on the unsymmetric Lanczos iteration, in particular the BiCG method. These use a three-term recurrence relation, but they do not attain the minimum residual, and hence the residual does not decrease monotonically for these methods. Convergence is not even guaranteed. The third class is formed by methods like CGS and BiCGSTAB. These also work with a three-term recurrence relation (hence, without optimality) and they can even terminate prematurely without achieving convergence. The idea behind these methods is to choose the generating polynomials of the iteration sequence suitably. None of these three classes is the best for all matrices; there are always examples in which one class outperforms the other. Therefore, multiple solvers are tried in practice to see which one is the best for a given problem.  Solving the least squares problem  One part of the GMRES method is to find the vector y_n which minimizes :  tilde{H}_n y_n - beta e_1 . , Note that tilde{H}_n is an (n + 1)-by-n matrix, hence it gives an over- constrained linear system of n+1 equations for n unknowns. The minimum can be computed using a QR decomposition: find an (n + 1)-by-(n + 1) orthogonal matrix Œ©n and an (n + 1)-by-n upper triangular matrix tilde{R}_n such that : Omega_n tilde{H}_n = tilde{R}_n. The triangular matrix has one more row than it has columns, so its bottom row consists of zero. Hence, it can be decomposed as : tilde{R}_n = begin{bmatrix} R_n  0 end{bmatrix}, where R_n is an n-by-n (thus square) triangular matrix. The QR decomposition can be updated cheaply from one iteration to the next, because the Hessenberg matrices differ only by a row of zeros and a column: :tilde{H}_{n+1} = begin{bmatrix} tilde{H}_n & h_{n+1}  0 & h_{n+2,n+1} end{bmatrix}, where hn+1 = (h1,n+1, ‚Ä¶, hn+1,n+1)T. This implies that premultiplying the Hessenberg matrix with Œ©n, augmented with zeroes and a row with multiplicative identity, yields almost a triangular matrix: : begin{bmatrix} Omega_n & 0  0 & 1 end{bmatrix} tilde{H}_{n+1} = begin{bmatrix} R_n & r_{n+1}  0 & rho  0 & sigma end{bmatrix} This would be triangular if œÉ is zero. To remedy this, one needs the Givens rotation : G_n = begin{bmatrix} I_{n} & 0 & 0  0 & c_n & s_n  0 & -s_n & c_n end{bmatrix} where : c_n = frac{rho}{sqrt{rho^2+sigma^2}} quadmbox{and}quad s_n = frac{sigma}{sqrt{rho^2+sigma^2}}. With this Givens rotation, we form : Omega_{n+1} = G_n begin{bmatrix} Omega_n & 0  0 & 1 end{bmatrix}. Indeed, : Omega_{n+1} tilde{H}_{n+1} = begin{bmatrix} R_n & r_{n+1}  0 & r_{n+1,n+1}  0 & 0 end{bmatrix} quadtext{with}quad r_{n+1,n+1} = sqrt{rho^2+sigma^2} is a triangular matrix. Given the QR decomposition, the minimization problem is easily solved by noting that :  tilde{H}_n y_n - beta e_1  =  Omega_n (tilde{H}_n y_n - beta e_1)  =  tilde{R}_n y_n - beta Omega_n e_1 . Denoting the vector betaOmega_ne_1 by : tilde{g}_n = begin{bmatrix} g_n  gamma_n end{bmatrix} with gn ‚àà Rn and Œ≥n ‚àà R, this is :  tilde{H}_n y_n - beta e_1  =  tilde{R}_n y_n - beta Omega_n e_1  = left begin{bmatrix} R_n  0 end{bmatrix} y_n - begin{bmatrix} g_n  gamma_n end{bmatrix} right. The vector y that minimizes this expression is given by : y_n = R_n^{-1} g_n. Again, the vectors g_n are easy to update.Stoer and Bulirsch, ¬ß8.7.2 Example code =Regular GMRES (MATLAB / GNU Octave)= function [x, e] = gmres( A, b, x, max_iterations, threshold) n = length(A); m = max_iterations; % use x as the initial vector r = b - A * x; b_norm = norm(b); error = norm(r) / b_norm; % initialize the 1D vectors sn = zeros(m, 1); cs = zeros(m, 1); %e1 = zeros(n, 1); e1 = zeros(m+1, 1); e1(1) = 1; e = [error]; r_norm = norm(r); Q(:,1) = r / r_norm; beta = r_norm * e1; %Note: this is not the beta scalar in section \\"The method\\" above but the beta scalar multiplied by e1 for k = 1:m % run arnoldi [H(1:k+1, k) Q(:, k+1)] = arnoldi(A, Q, k); % eliminate the last element in H ith row and update the rotation matrix [H(1:k+1, k) cs(k) sn(k)] = apply_givens_rotation(H(1:k+1,k), cs, sn, k); % update the residual vector beta(k + 1) = -sn(k) * beta(k); beta(k) = cs(k) * beta(k); error = abs(beta(k + 1)) / b_norm; % save the error e = [e; error]; if (error <= threshold) break; end end % if threshold is not reached, k = m at this point (and not m+1) % calculate the result y = H(1:k, 1:k)  beta(1:k); x = x + Q(:, 1:k) * y; end %----------------------------------------------------% % Arnoldi Function % %----------------------------------------------------% function [h, q] = arnoldi(A, Q, k) q = A*Q(:,k); % Krylov Vector for i = 1:k % Modified Gramm-Schmidt, keeping the Hessenberg matrix h(i) = q' * Q(:, i); q = q - h(i) * Q(:, i); end h(k + 1) = norm(q); q = q / h(k + 1); end %---------------------------------------------------------------------% % Applying Givens Rotation to H col % %---------------------------------------------------------------------% function [h, cs_k, sn_k] = apply_givens_rotation(h, cs, sn, k) % apply for ith column for i = 1:k-1 temp = cs(i) * h(i) + sn(i) * h(i + 1); h(i+1) = -sn(i) * h(i) + cs(i) * h(i + 1); h(i) = temp; end % update the next sin cos values for rotation [cs_k sn_k] = givens_rotation(h(k), h(k + 1)); % eliminate H(i + 1, i) h(k) = cs_k * h(k) + sn_k * h(k + 1); h(k + 1) = 0.0; end %%----Calculate the Given rotation matrix----%% function [cs, sn] = givens_rotation(v1, v2) % if (v1  0) % cs = 0; % sn = 1; % else t = sqrt(v1^2 + v2^2); % cs = abs(v1) / t; % sn = cs * v2 / v1; cs = v1 / t; % see http://www.netlib.org/eispack/comqr.f sn = v2 / t; % end end  See also * Biconjugate gradient method  References   Notes  * A.

Facilitations can be categorized as mutualisms, in which both species benefit, or commensalisms, in which one species benefits and the other is unaffected. Much of classic ecological theory (e.g., natural selection, niche separation, metapopulation dynamics) has focused on negative interactions such as predation and competition, but positive interactions (facilitation) are receiving increasing focus in ecological research.Boucher, D.

This article addresses both the mechanisms of facilitation and the increasing information available concerning the impacts of facilitation on community ecology.  Categories  Nurse log harboring a western hemlock tree There are two basic categories of facilitative interactions: * Mutualism is an interaction between species that is beneficial to both. A familiar example of a mutualism is the relationship between flowering plants and their pollinators. The plant benefits from the spread of pollen between flowers, while the pollinator receives some form of nourishment, either from nectar or the pollen itself. * Commensalism is an interaction in which one species benefits and the other species is unaffected. Epiphytes (plants growing on other plants, usually trees) have a commensal relationship with their host plant because the epiphyte benefits in some way (e.g., by escaping competition with terrestrial plants or by gaining greater access to sunlight) while the host plant is apparently unaffected. Strict categorization, however, is not possible for some complex species interactions. For example, seed germination and survival in harsh environments is often higher under so-called nurse plants than on open ground. A nurse plant is one with an established canopy, beneath which germination and survival are more likely due to increased shade, soil moisture, and nutrients. Thus, the relationship between seedlings and their nurse plants is commensal. However, as the seedlings grow into established plants, they are likely to compete with their former benefactors for resources.  Mechanisms  The beneficial effects of species on one another are realized in various ways, including refuge from physical stress, predation, and competition, improved resource availability, and transport. = Refuge from physical stress = Facilitation may act by reducing the negative impacts of a stressful environment. As described above, nurse plants facilitate seed germination and survival by alleviating stressful environmental conditions. A similar interaction occurs between the red alga Chondrus crispus and the canopy- forming seaweed Fucus in intertidal sites of southern New England, USA. The alga survives higher in the intertidal zone‚Äîwhere temperature and desiccation stresses are greater‚Äîonly when the seaweed is present because the canopy of the seaweed offers protection from those stresses. The previous examples describe facilitation of individuals or of single species, but there are also instances of a single facilitator species mediating some community-wide stress, such as disturbance. An example of such ‚Äúwhole-community‚Äù facilitation is substrate stabilization of cobble beach plant communities in Rhode Island, USA, by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora).Bruno, J. F. 2000. Facilitation of cobble beach plant communities through habitat modification by Spartina alterniflora. Ecology 81:1179-1192. Large beds of cordgrass buffer wave action, thus allowing the establishment and persistence of a community of less disturbance-tolerant annual and perennial plants below the high-water mark. In general, facilitation is more likely to occur in physically stressful environments than in favorable environments, where competition may be the most important interaction among species. This can also occur in a single habitat containing a gradient from low to high stress. For example, along a New England, USA, salt marsh tidal gradient, a presence of black needle rush (Juncus gerardii) increased the fitness of marsh elder (Iva annua) shrubs in lower elevations, where soil salinity was higher.Bertness, M. D. and S. D. Hacker. 1994. Physical stress and positive associations among marsh plants. American Naturalist 144: 363-372. The rush shaded the soil, which decreased evapotranspiration, and in turn decreased soil salinity. However, at higher elevations where soil salinity was lower, marsh elder fitness was decreased in the presence of the rush, due to increased competition for resources. Thus, the nature of species interactions may shift with environmental conditions. = Refuge from predation = honeydew on aphids. Another mechanism of facilitation is a reduced risk of being eaten. Nurse plants, for example, not only reduce abiotic stress, but may also physically impede herbivory of seedlings growing under them. In both terrestrial and marine environments, herbivory of palatable species is reduced when they occur with unpalatable species. These ‚Äúassociational refuges‚Äù may occur when unpalatable species physically shield the palatable species, or when herbivores are ‚Äúconfused‚Äù by the inhibitory cues of the unpalatable species. Herbivory can also reduce predation of the herbivore, as in the case of the red-ridged clinging crab (Mithrax forceps) along the North Carolina, USA, coastline.Miller, M. W. and M. E. Hay. 1996. Coral-seaweed-grazer-nutrient interactions on temperate reefs. Ecological Monographs 66: 323-344. This crab species takes refuge in the branches of the compact Ivory Bush Coral (Oculina arbuscula) and feeds on seaweed in the vicinity of the coral. The reduced competition with seaweed enhances coral growth, which in turn provides more refuge for the crab. A similar case is that of the interaction between swollen-thorn acacia trees (Acacia spp.) and certain ants (Pseudomyrmex spp.) in Central America. The acacia provides nourishment and protection (inside hollow thorns) to the ant in return for defense against herbivores. In contrast, a different type of facilitation between ants and sap-feeding insects may increase plant predation. By consuming sap, plant pests such as aphids produce a sugar-rich waste product called honeydew, which is consumed by ants in exchange for protection of the sap-feeders against predation. = Refuge from competition = Another potential benefit of facilitation is insulation from competitive interactions. Like the now familiar example of nurse plants in harsh environments, nurse logs in a forest are sites of increased seed germination and seedling survival because the raised substrate of a log frees seedlings from competition with plants and mosses on the forest floor.Harmon, M. E. and J. F. Franklin. 1989. Tree seedlings on logs in Picea-Tsuga forests of Oregon and Washington. Ecology 70: 48-59. The crab-coral interaction described above is also an example of refuge from competition, since the herbivory of crabs on seaweed reduces competition between coral and seaweed. Similarly, herbivory by sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) on kelps (Laminaria spp.) can protect mussels (Modiolus modiolus) from overgrowth by kelps competing for space in the subtidal zone of the Gulf of Maine, USA.Witman, J. D. 1987. Subtidal coexistence: storms, grazing, mutualism, and the zonation of kelps and mussels. Ecological Monographs 57: 167-187. = Improved resource availability = Facilitation can increase access to limiting resources such as light, water, and nutrients for interacting species. For example, epiphytic plants often receive more direct sunlight in the canopies of their host plants than they would on the ground. Also, nurse plants increase the amount of water available to seedlings in dry habitats because of reduced evapotranspiration beneath the shade of nurse plant canopies. A special case concerns human facilitation of sap-feeding birds. Three African bird species (Village Weaver Ploceus cucullatus, Common Bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus, and Mouse‚Äêbrown Sunbird Anthreptes gabonicus) regularly feed on the sap flowing from holes made by local wine tappers in Oil‚Äêpalm trees Elaies guineensis in the Bijag√≥s archipelago, Guinea‚ÄêBissau. However, the most familiar examples of increased access to resources through facilitation are the mutualistic transfers of nutrients between symbiotic organisms. A symbiosis is a prolonged, close association between organisms, and some examples of mutualistic symbioses include: ; Gut flora:Associations between a host species and a microbe living in the host‚Äôs digestive tract, wherein the host provides habitat and nourishment to the microbe in exchange for digestive services. For example, termites receive nourishment from cellulose digested by microbes inhabiting their gut. ; Lichens:Associations between fungi and algae, wherein the fungus receives nutrients from the alga, and the alga is protected from harsh conditions causing desiccation. ; Corals:Associations between reef-building corals and photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae, wherein the zooxanthellae provide nutrition to the corals in the form of photosynthate, in exchange for nitrogen in coral waste products. ; Mycorrhizae:Associations between fungi and plant roots, wherein the fungus facilitates nutrient uptake (particularly nitrogen) by the plant in exchange for carbon in the form of sugars from the plant root. There is a parallel example in marine environments of sponges on the roots of mangroves, with a relationship analogous to that of mycorrhizae and terrestrial plants. = Transport = The movement by animals of items involved in plant reproduction is usually a mutualistic association. Pollinators may increase plant reproductive success by reducing pollen waste, increasing dispersal of pollen, and increasing the probability of sexual reproduction at low population density. In return, the pollinator receives nourishment in the form of nectar or pollen. Animals may also disperse the seed or fruit of plants, either by eating it (in which case they receive the benefit of nourishment) or by passive transport, such as seeds sticking to fur or feathers.  Community effects  Although facilitation is often studied at the level of individual species interactions, the effects of facilitation are often observable at the scale of the community, including impacts to spatial structure, diversity, and invasibility. = Spatial structure = Many facilitative interactions directly affect the distribution of species. As discussed above, transport of plant propagules by animal dispersers can increase colonization rates of more distant sites, which may impact the distribution and population dynamics of the plant species. Facilitation most often affects distribution by simply making it possible for a species to occur in a site where some environmental stress would otherwise prohibit growth of that species. This is apparent in whole-community facilitation by a foundation species, such as sediment stabilization in cobble beach plant communities by smooth cordgrass. A facilitating species may also help drive the progression from one ecosystem type to another, as mesquite apparently does in the grasslands of the Rio Grande Plains.Archer, S. 1989. Have southern Texas savannas been converted to woodlands in recent history? American Naturalist 134: 545-561. As a nitrogen-fixing tree, mesquite establishes more readily than other species on nutrient-poor soils, and following establishment, mesquite acts as a nurse plant for seedlings of other species. Thus, mesquite facilitates the dynamic spatial shift from grassland to savanna to woodland across the habitat. = Diversity = Facilitation affects community diversity (defined in this context as the number of species in the community) by altering competitive interactions. For example, intertidal mussels increase total community species diversity by displacing competitive large sessile species such as seaweed and barnacles. Although the mussels decrease diversity of primary space holders (i.e., large sessile species), a larger number of invertebrate species are associated with mussel beds than with other primary space holders, so total species diversity is higher when mussels are present. The effect of facilitation on diversity could also be reversed, if the facilitation creates a competitive dominance that excludes more species than it permits. = Invasibility = Facilitation of non-native species, either by native species or other non-native species, may increase the invasibility of a community, or the ease with which non-native species become established in a community. In an examination of 254 published studies of introduced species, 22 of 190 interactions studied between introduced species in the studies were facilitative.Simberloff, D. and B. Van Holle. 1999. Positive interactions of non-indigenous species: invasional meltdown? Biological Invasions 1: 21-32. It is worth noting that 128 of the 190 examined interactions were predator‚Äìprey relationships of a single plant-eating insect reported in a single study, which may have overemphasized the importance of negative interactions. Introduced plants are also facilitated by native pollinators, dispersers, and mycorrhizae.Richardson, D. M. et al. 2000. Plant invasions‚Äîthe role of mutualisms. Biological Reviews 75: 65-93. Thus, positive interactions must be considered in any attempt to understand the invasibility of a community.  Conclusion  Facilitation is a significant ecological process that produces community-level effects through individual interactions. By improving dispersal, increasing access to resources, and providing protection from stress, predation, and competition, facilitation can impact community structure, diversity, and invasibility. Incorporation of facilitation into such classic theories as natural selection and niche separation should be a goal of current and future ecologists. This will require further research into the mechanisms of facilitation at the level of individuals, and the impacts of facilitation at the level of population, community, and ecosystem. Continued study of positive species interactions will serve to improve our understanding of processes and application of theories.  Notes   References  * Shears N.T.; Babcock R.C.

Function  This gene encodes a member of the interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF) family. Family members share a highly conserved N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a less conserved C-terminal protein-binding domain. The function of IRF6 is related to the formation of connective tissue, for example that of the palate. This gene encodes a member of the interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF) family. In addition, it has been observed that IRF6 gene is under epigenetic regulation by promoter methylation.  Pathology  A mutation of the IRF6 gene can lead to the autosomal dominant van der Woude syndrome (VWS) or the related popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS). Van der Woude syndrome can include cleft lip and palate features along with dental anomalies and lip fistulas. In addition, common alleles in IRF6 have also been associated with non-syndromic cases of cleft lip and/or palate through genome-wide association studies and in many candidate gene studies. These disorders are caused by mutations in the IRF6 gene and some of the phenotypic heterogeneity is due to different types of IRF6 mutations. One explanation for this phenotypic variation between syndromes is based on a differential impact on the structure of the dimerized mutant proteins. VWS mutations appear to result in haploinsufficiency while PPS mutations may be dominant negative in nature. The spectrum of mutations in VWS and PPS has been recently summarized. IRF6 has been shown to play a critical role in keratinocyte development. A role for IRF6 in the common forms of cleft lip and palate has also been demonstrated and may explain ~20% of cases of cleft lip only. Variants in IRF6 have yielded consistent evidence of association with syndromic cleft and/or palate across multiple studies. A study by Birnbaum and colleagues in 2009 confirmed the impact of this gene on the etiology of cleft lip and/or palate, and the GENEVA Cleft Consortium study, which studied families from multiple populations, reconfirmed the findings that IRF6 mutations are strongly associated with cleft and/or palate. A role of IRF6 in causing cleft lip and/or palate is further supported by analysis of IRF6 mutant mice which exhibit a hyper-proliferative epidermis that fails to undergo terminal differentiation, leading to multiple epithelial adhesions that can occlude the oral cavity and result in cleft palate. Research on animal models indicate IRF6 determines keratinocyte proliferation and also has a key role in the formation of oral periderm. Recently, through utilization of mouse genetics, gene expression analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies and luciferase reporter assays, it has been shown that IRF6 is a direct target of p63, which underlies several malformation syndromes that include cleft features, and p63 activates IRF6 transcription through the IRF6 enhancer element. Variation in the enhancer element increases susceptibility to cleft lip only. Both cleft lip with or without a cleft palate and cleft palate only features have been seen in families with an IRF6 mutation. In addition, different types of clefts can segregate within the same family.  Epigenetics  The IRF6 aberrant promoter DNA hypermethylation has been observed associated with cancer onset/progression. Indeed, this improper epigenetic phenomenon has been observed in women affected by Vulvar Squamous cell carcinoma arose from vulver lichen sclerosus. Methylation of the IRF6 promoter may be a marker of cancer risk in patients affected by this disease.  Cancer  IRF6 gene has been observed progressively downregulated in Human papillomavirus-positive neoplastic keratinocytes derived from uterine cervical preneoplastic lesions at different levels of malignancy. For this reason, this gene is likely to be associated with tumorigenesis and may be a potential prognostic marker for uterine cervical preneoplastic lesions progression. Similarly, IRF6 has been found to be genetically and epigenetically disregulated in Vulvar cancer.

It has almost 900 people living on 70 km2. The commune's territory is made up of the Belep Islands (also known as the Belep Archipelago), which lie to the north of New Caledonia's mainland. The two principal islands in the Belep Archipelago are Art Island (a.k.a. Aar) and Pott Island fr (a.k.a. Phwoc). The rest of the archipelago consists of the Northern and Southern Daos Islands, and several very small islets. The administrative centre of the commune is the settlement of Waala, on Art Island, the largest of the Belep Islands.

A Catholic mission was founded in Belep in 1856 by Pierre Lambert (1822-1903) but only lasted until 1863. The Marists later returned, and another priest Marie-Joseph Dubois (1913-1998), who lived there 1940-1941, wrote a history of B√©lep in 1985. In 1879, following a widespread Kanak rebellion led by Ata√Ø, some of the insurgents were temporarily moved from Grande Terre to the islands as punishment. The islands were the site of a leper colony between 1892 and 1898 during which time the islanders were exiled to Balade and suffered greatly. On their return, they were not allowed to reoccupy Isle Pott, taken by a colonial copra farmer, monsieur Mary, permitted by government authority.French wiki version It took the clans until the 1950s to buy it back.https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/15221322.pdf The standard of living in Belep has risen since the 1950s, in common with other outlying parts of New Caledonia.

A modern medical clinic, serviced by a French doctor and nurses, was also built. Waala has the only primary school, shops, church, and post office. In 1961, Belep became a commune; its first mayor was elected in 1969. In the 1980s, when the movement for Kanak independence became violent (Les Ev√®nements) some Belema migrated to the Mainland to escape political divisions.https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/15221322.pdf Belep struggles to obtain resources from the territorial government and there is still no schooling beyond primary level (children then have to attend boarding school on Grande Terre, in Poum for example).

The airport is located in the village of Kiby, east of the town of Vads√∏ along the Varangerfjorden. The airport is operated by the state-owned Avinor and handled 77,348 passengers in 2014. The asphalt runway is long. Services are provided by Wider√∏e using Dash 8-100 aircraft to other communities in Finnmark and to Troms√∏ International Airport. The routes are subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications through public service obligations. Vads√∏ was during the late 1930s and from the mid-1940s served with a seaplane route operated by Wider√∏e and Norwegian Air Lines. Planning of an airport started in the mid-1960s, with the airport opening in 1974. It was originally served both by Wider√∏e and by Norving, the latter to B√•tsfjord and providing air ambulance services. The airport received a major upgrade, with a hangar and larger terminal, ahead of the 1984 introduction of the de Havilland Canada Dash 7. History The first seaplane route to Vads√∏ was started by Wider√∏e in 1938, which flew along the coast south to Trondheim.Arnesen: 24‚Äì29 The route was interrupted by World War II, but resumed in 1946, when it was flown by Norwegian Air Lines using the Junkers Ju 52. The water aerodrome in Vads√∏ was simple and consisted of a designated landing area and a buoy, with passengers having to be boated out to the aircraft. From 1954 the route was taken over by Wider√∏e, who introduced the de Havilland Canada Otter.Arnesen: 61‚Äì67 From 1962 to 1963, Varangfly (later renamed Norving) flew a seaplane route to Kirkenes and B√•tsfjord.Melling: 39 They applied for concessions to operate a route from 1964, but the government was not willing issue to necessary subsidies.Melling: 43 The control tower Varangfly proposed Vads√∏ as a possible site of a small airfield in 1964, suitable for landing air taxis and air ambulances.Melling: 52 A county- appointed committee recommended in 1966 that Vads√∏ be one of six locations of airfields.Melling: 64 Planning of a national network of regional airports started in the 1960s. At the time a bus ride from Vads√∏ to Kirkenes Airport, H√∏ybuktmoen took seven hours. Vads√∏ was selected as one of five initial locations in northern Troms and Finnmark which received regional airports. This was the fourth and final stage of the regional airport implementation. The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA, later renamed Avinor) considered two locations for the airport: at Fossemyrene just north of the town center, and at Kiby, east of the town. The latter was preferred. An aviation club was founded in 1971 and used a field at Karlebotn. They moved to the frozen lake of Navarsvannet during the winter before moving to Golnes from the summer of 1972. The airfield at Golnes was created by leveling a moraine ridge. Norving used Golnes for ambulance and taxi services from 1972 until Vads√∏ Airport opened.Melling: 94 Both Wider√∏e and Norving applied to operate the Finnmark route, which would connect the airports together and to the primary airports in Finnmark and Troms√∏ Airport. Norving planned to operate with their Britten- Norman Islanders and Britten-Norman Trislanders. The government opted to selected Wider√∏e and their Twin Otters, citing the need for a single operator for all subsidized regional routes in the country.Melling: 109 Vads√∏ Airport opened on 1 August 1974 at the same time as S√∏rkjosen Airport, Hammerfest Airport, Mehamn Airport and Berlev√•g Airport. The airport featured a combined control tower and terminal, which had a capacity for 30 people. Twin Otters landed at Vads√∏ four times daily. Norving started a service from Kirkenes via Vads√∏ to B√•tsfjord Airport in January 1975. However, they did not have permission to fly passengers between Vads√∏ and Kirkenes.Melling: 124 Wider√∏e introduced the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 in 1984, which required an upgrade to the airport. Specifically a new terminal building was built along with a hangar. For a short period the airport had a cafe. Wider√∏e took over Norving's B√•tsfjord service in 1990.Melling: 303 Wider√∏e operated Twin Otters on the route until 1995, when the Dash 8 was introduced. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997, in exchange for NOK 4.1 million being paid to Vads√∏ Municipality. Flights to Mehman have been subject to public service obligations since 1 April 1997. The CAA articulated in 1999 plans to extend the runway to , but this was never followed up. The government proposed in 2002 that Vard√∏ Airport be closed, citing the proximity to Vads√∏ (69 km/43 mi); the closing was never carried. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. The navigational aids and runway were upgraded in 2007. Facilities The airport is located at Kiby, east of the town center of Vads√∏. The terminal has a capacity of 170 passengers per hour and can handle two simultaneous Dash 8-100 aircraft. The asphalt runway is long and aligned 08‚Äì26, roughly east‚Äìwest, and equipped with a SCAT-I landing system, based on the Global Positioning System. The airport has paid parking, a taxi stand and five car rental companies. The airport area is cramped and there is little room for further expansion. Should the airport be expanded in the future a new terminal is needed, since it's located too close to the runway according to safety rules. It is planned to in that case place it southeast of the present terminal.Mulighetsstudie og kostnadsoverslag for utvidelse av Vads√∏ lufthavn An alternative is to build a new airport somewhere between Vads√∏ and Vard√∏ which would serve both towns (the distance to a halfway point between the cities is ). Airlines and destinations Vads√∏ is served by Wider√∏e, which operates 39-seat Dash 8-100 aircraft to other communities in Finnmark. The routes are operated as public service obligations financed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport served 77,348 passengers, 6,967 aircraft movements and handled 294 tonnes of cargo in 2014. The distance from Vads√∏ Airport to Kirkenes Airport, H√∏ybuktmoen is by air and by road. For the year starting on 1 April 2008 this segment had 12,136 passengers to Kirkenes and 9,573 from Kirkenes. A large portion of these transfer to Oslo-bound flights at H√∏ybuktmoen. The driving time from Vads√∏ to Kirkenes is between two and three hours, as the road runs around Varangerfjorden. There is a proposal that a fast ferry service could start on the route, or even a tunnel to be built.Vil ha snarvei mellom Vads√∏ og Kirkenes Accidents and incidents On 4 January 1984 a Cessna aircraft crashed into the sea after take-off from the airport. Three people were killed, although no bodies or the wreck were found, only parts. Because the airport was not manned at the time of the accident, it was not reported until fourteen hours after it occurred.

Exertion traditionally connotes a strenuous or costly effort, resulting in generation of force, initiation of motion, or in the performance of work. It often relates to muscular activity and can be quantified, empirically and by measurable metabolic response. Physical In physics, exertion is the expenditure of energy against, or inductive of, inertia as described by Isaac Newton's third law of motion. In physics, force exerted equivocates work done. The ability to do work can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of exertion relative to gravity. For example, a force exerted upwards, like lifting an object, creates positive work done on that object. Exertion often results in force generated, a contributing dynamic of general motion. In mechanics it describes the use of force against a body in the direction of its motion (see vector). Physiological Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion. Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood lactate concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and musculoskeletal strength, as well as metabolic capability. This often correlates to an output of force followed by a refractory period of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions. Muscular energy reserves, or stores for biomechanical exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of ATP and increased O2 consumption. Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract. Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates response to somatic sensations and mechanisms. A rating of perceived exertion, as measured by the RPE-scale, or Borg scale, is a quantitative measure of physical exertion. Often in health, exertion of oneself resulting in cardiovascular stress showed reduced physiological responses, like cortisol levels and mood, to stressors. Therefore, biological exertion is effective in mediating psychological exertion, responsive to environmental stress. Overexertion causes more than 3.5 million injuries a year. An overexertion injury can include sprains or strains, the stretching and tear of ligaments, tendons, or muscles caused by a load that exceeds the human ability to perform the work. Overexertion, besides causing acute injury, implies physical exertion beyond the person's capacity which leads to symptoms such as dizziness, irregular breathing and heart rate, and fatigue. Preventative measures can be taken based on biomechanical knowledge to limit possible overexertion injuries.

Looking like a Suzuki Endurance racer, it can be considered to be the first affordable, modern racer-replica suitable for road use. It was introduced at the Cologne Motorcycle Show in October 1984. Air and oil cooled The air and oil-cooled models can be divided into the first- generation and the second-generation colloquially referred to as 'slabbies' and 'slingshots' respectively. The 1985-1987 models featured very flat bodies compared to modern sport-bikes, hence the term 'slab-sided'. 1988-1991 (1992 USA) models are sometimes referred to as slingshots because the carburetors introduced in 1988 were marketed as slingshot carburetors (slingshot describes the cross-section of the semi-flat slide carbs). =GSX-R750 (F) 1985= The original model featured a lightweight aluminum alloy frame, flatslide carbs, twin discs with 4-pot calipers, and tyres both front and rear. To save weight, the designers specified an air-and-oil-cooled engine, rather than a water- cooled engine. The seat has separate front and rear sections but from 1986 onwards all models have a one-piece seat. =GSX-R750 (G) 1986= The 1986 model received a 25 mm longer swing arm to improve the handling. Apart from a modified belly pan and upgraded headlamps, there is very little difference between the 1985 and 1986 models. 1986 is the first year the model was introduced to the US. =GSX-R750R 1986= Racing homologation Limited Edition model, limited production. Including a dry clutch system, steel tank, solo seat rear section bodywork, and Limited Edition graphics, as well as the GSX-R 1100's adjustable anti-dive forks.GSXR1100 rims large discs and 1100 calipers =GSX-R750 (H) 1987= The 1987 model received upgraded 41 millimeter front forks with NEAS (New Electrically Activated Suspension) from the previous year's RR and a steering damper was fitted as standard. The fuel tank capacity was increased to 21 liters. =GSX-R750 (J) 1988= First major revision. New chassis design, engine revisions, and bodywork. Introduction of a new short- stroke version of the oil-cooled engine, now displacing 748 cc. The engine had 73 millimeter bore and 44.7 millimeter stroke and could achieve higher engine speeds (13,000 rpm redline indicated, but rev limiter engaged at 13,500 according to the Suzuki shop manual). Internal engine dimensions changed to accommodate the new bore and stroke. This engine used larger valves and carburetors than in previous years. Mikuni model BST36SS 'Slingshot' carbs were 36 millimeter diameter and featured vacuum operated slides; the slide cross section resembled the shape of a slingshot. A four spring clutch was used on the short stroke motor. New styling, and twin black silencers. Wheels were now a diameter, three-spoke design, and used a 160/60VR17 in the rear and 120/70VR17 in the front. Slingshot graphic first appeared on the bodywork. Forks now used a cartridge design and were 43 millimeter in diameter. The second-generation model was heavier than the first but had a stiffer frame and more power. =GSX-R750 (K) 1989= Minor changes such as modified lower bodywork, changes to graphics, and silver exhaust silencers. Magazines reported that the exhaust manifold now featured small chamfers on the collector for increased ground clearance. Cycle magazines also reported a change to the rear shock mounting geometry and front fork length to improve ground clearance. Graphics/paint schemes varied slightly between global markets. US models were available in blue/white and red/white schemes. The SACS acronym decal, located on the lower bodywork of the blue/white models, changed from a diagonal lettering to a straight lettering. =GSX-R750R 1989= Limited edition racing homologation model. The redesigned engine reverted to the original long-stroke (70 x 48.7 millimeter) configuration. The crankcase, crankshaft connecting rods, and clutch were upgraded to serve as a ready to race platform. The RR also received new 40 millimeter Slingshot carbs and 4-into-1 exhaust pipe, close-ratio gearbox, braced rear swing arm, single- seat unit, and 19 liter aluminum fuel tank. Only 150 were sold in the U.S. =GSXR750RK 1989= The GSX-R750RK, also known as the RR, was a limited edition a version first produced in 1989. Out of 500 made, 200 went to Europe and none to the US. =GSX-R750 (L) 1990= Although this model looks very similar to the previous '89 model many changes were made. The 90 models featured changes to the engine, suspension, bodywork, brakes, and chassis. This was the first GSX-R to be fitted with inverted forks as standard (USA models retained the conventional forks until 1991) and returned to the bore and stroke of the original long-stroke engine. The engine returned to the 749 cc engine bore and stroke dimensions of the original long-stroke engine but still maintained the 13,000 rpm redline. It now featured an mm valve (smaller than the 88-89 short stroke but larger than the 85-87) and used larger carburetors. The new Mikuni model BST38SS carburetors were 38 mm diameter and featured an additional \\"Powerjet\\" high-speed circuit that was used to fine- tune fuel mixture from 10,000 rpm to the rev limiter. In the unrestricted USA bikes, the Powerjet circuit was jetted with a \\"zero\\" sized jet and activating the circuit simply required replacing the \\"zero\\" jet with a #57.5 to #62.5 jet. All other worldwide bikes with the 38 millimeter carbs came equipped with a functioning Powerjet circuit. The slide breathers were now divorced from the airbox. The exhaust system was also changed, gone were the dual silencers and replaced with one stainless steel silencer on the right side. The transmission output shaft was lengthened to accommodate a wider wheel. A new curved oil- cooler design and oil lines (attached to the oil pan similar to the original 85-87 engines) were installed. The frame was changed for 1990 and used some of the features from the 1989 GSX-R 1100 frame. The rake was now 25.5 degrees and wheelbase . The front suspension now had inverted forks, the triple clamps (yokes), and handlebars were changed to accommodate the new forks. The rear suspension featured a new damper (shock) and swingarm. The rear damper (shock) now had a remote reservoir and damping adjustment. The revised swingarm now featured cast ends for the axle adjustment. The rear wheel was widened to (previously ) but the tire size remained the same. A non-adjustable steering damper was added which attached from the left frame rail to a clamp on the left fork (US models did not receive the damper but the frame had the tapped mounting holes). The rear sprocket carrier and sprocket changed to a six-bolt design (previously five). The front brake rotors changed to a slotted design (previously cross drilled holes). The bodywork changed slightly also. The side vents became less rectangular and in a slightly different position. Anew fender was also used with the inverted forks (except the U.S.). =GSX-R750 (M) 1991= The '91 GSX-R750M gained 15 kg over the previous model. The most notable feature of the \\" M \\" are the faired in headlamps and a slanted nose, both of which were designed to reduce drag. Also fitted was a new larger seat and new rear bodywork that featured twin tail lamps. This was the last GSX-R to use the oil-cooled SACS engine (except for the U.S.). Internal engine changes included a new valvetrain that used one dedicated cam lobe and rocker arm (finger follower) per valve (previous models used one lobe and one forked rocker per two valves). Valve clearance (lash) was now adjusted with shims (previous models used a screw and nut). The cam duration and indexing changed slightly as well as the porting according to a magazine article. The rear tire width was increased to a 170 millimeter section width. The gauges also changed to white-colored needles (previously amber colored). =GSX-R750 (N) 1992 Oil Cooled = 1992 US models are the same as the 1991 with different paint and graphics. All other markets got the new water-cooled GSX-R 750. Mikuni Carburetor 36 Water-cooled =GSX-R750 (WN) 1992= New water-cooled engine and revised frame, bodywork, and suspension. USA market models retained the oil-cooled engine and the USA 1992 model is basically the same as the 91 models with different graphics. A sleeved down version was available as the GSXR-600 for 92 and 93, both years were available with inverted forks. The 1992 GSXR-600 was water-cooled for the US market while the 750 had to wait one more year. =GSX-R750 (WP) 1993= Mostly cosmetic changes, a major revision of engine internals, the crank & connecting rods were forged steel instead of cast iron. Valve-train was revised as well which allowed for a significant increase in power. =GSX-R750 (WR) 1994= Reduced power and weight on last year's model. The inverted forks for this year were blue anodized. The swinging arm now has upper bracing (similar to 750RK) rather than the 'banana' style of the previous model. =GSX-R750 SPR 1994-1995= The 'SPR' limited- edition racing homologation model has special factory parts including wide- mouthed TRM40 carbs, close-ratio gearbox, magnesium engine covers, an alloy water pump, six-piston brake calipers, and a new braced swingarm. A wider rear wheel holding a wider 180 rear section tire was also fitted. The 'SPR' was 10 kilos lighter than the WP. =GSX-R750 (WS) 1995= The last model to use the double-cradle for more stiffness over the 94 model year and the top fairing was all new with lighter, twin reflector beam headlights. Touted by Motorcyclist as having the most ground clearance leaned over, just behind a Ducati 916. SRAD The SRAD (Suzuki Ram Air Direct) provides air intakes at the front that force air directly into the airbox. All models as of 1996 have employed this design. =GSX-R750 (T) 1996= The 1996 GSX-R introduced a new twin-spar frame which was derived from Suzuki's RGV 500 GP racer. A new compact and lightweight engine incorporated magnesium covers on the cylinder head, starter motor, and clutch cover to aid weight reduction. These changes resulted in a decrease in weight by 20 kg to 179 kg, while power had increased to a . This year's model finally addressed the weight problems that had plagued the GSX-R through the first half of the 90s. Other features included an electronically-controlled \\"main jet block off under decel\\" system (for emissions purposes) 39 millimeter Mikuni carburetors and 43 mm inverted forks which were fully adjustable. Also, a 17-inch rear rim was fitted as standard with a 190/50-17 size tire as fitted to all models from 1996 to 1999. =GSX-R750 (V) 1997= Minor internal tweaks on the 1996 model, improved aerodynamics. =GSX-R750 (W) 1998= Introduction of electronic fuel injection. Gain in power to 134-135 bhp. =GSX-R750 (X) 1999= GSXR750 1999 Only minor modifications were carried out on the 1999 model consisting of new graphics and a few internal tweaks. The 1999 Model year GSX-R won the sport bike of the year award and produced 134 Crank Horsepower for the final year of the SRAD design. The manual also lists the rear wheel as having increased to 190 millimeters from 180 millimeters in the previous years. A steering damper was fitted under the bottom yoke. A 6\\" rear wheel was supplied on UK and EU model bikes from 1998 Model WW. This rim took a 190/50/17 tire. = GSX-R750 Y 2000 = All New Model covering 2000 through 2003 -Lighter Stronger Faster: Sometimes called superman bike because of headlight shape. Engine: Much smaller yet stronger motor, upgraded fuel injection with improved fueling correction for barometric pressure/altitude, redesigned narrower cylinder head with straighter intake tracts, bigger air box, better ram air, stainless steel 4 into 1 exhaust, lighter stronger engine components, and covers Body: More aerodynamic bodywork, smaller frontal area, redesigned instrument cluster, new LCD information (odometer, coolant temperature, clock). Frame: New re-designed twin spar frame, extended swingarm, lighter front brakes to reduce unsprung mass, lighter cast wheels to reduce rotating mass. = GSX-R750 K1 2001 = Transmission had a number of parts changed due to design defect that caused 2nd gear to slip and cause transmission failures. The input shaft and a number of other parts were upgraded and an internal service bulletin issued by Suzuki to its dealerships. GSX-R 750 K4 with Scorpion carbon can = GSX-R750 K2 2002 = Few minor tweaks for 2002: Changes to the EFI, new adjustable swingarm, new mirrors, and new fully brushed exhaust. = GSX-R750 K3 2003 = Colors changed. First-year that bikes have lights on 24 hrs (UK). Redesign year (Not UK). = GSX-R750 K4 2004= 2008 Suzuki GSX-R 750 Refined version of the 00-03 model years. ECU now 32 bit, from 16 bit, titanium valves, new body work, black powdercoated frame and swingarm, and 4-piston radially mounted Tokico brakes. The engine produced claimed power at crank shaft; at 12,750 rpm rear wheel hp tested by bike magazine on uncertified dynamometer, and torque of 79 N.m (58.2 ft.lb) @ 10,750 rpm. Redline was 14,500 rpm. Dry weight was just making it one of the lightest GSX-R's ever produced. 2011 Suzuki GSX-R750 =GSX-R750 K5 2005= Besides changing color on the motorcycle, Suzuki celebrated the 20th anniversary of the model by launching the Suzuki 20th Anniversary GSX-R 750, which included custom paint, custom exhaust, and sunex brake rotors... EL blue chain, blue seat and 20th-anniversary placards. =GSX-R750 K6, K7 2006-2007= Redesign year. New frame and swingarm and motor. Stroke increased and transmission is now stacked. Rotors also went from 300 mm to 310 mm. Modifications compared to the previous model include all-new compact and lightweight 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine designed for overall weight reduction, optimum combustion efficiency, and power delivery. Re-designed cylinder head with narrower valve angles creating a more compact combustion chamber design, higher 12.5:1 compression ratio, large intake and exhaust ports for improved intake and exhaust efficiency, and high power output Valve bucket diameters are increased to work with more aggressive camshafts. Lightweight titanium valves with steel alloy springs and aluminum spring retainers operated by thin-wall hollow camshafts to reduce weight and inertia. =GSX-R750 K8, K9, L0 2008-2010= New model - revised headlights, new colors, multi-mode power adjustments. At the rear wheel, the engine produces at 12,500 rpm, and torque of @ 11,200 rpm. The dry weight is . =GSX-R750 (L1-L9) 2011-2020 = Currently the longest ever produced GSX-R 750 series without any major changes. New model, clean and sleek body style, new headlight, addition of Italian made Brembo brake calipers (front) and Nissin (back). The 2011 model is about lighter than the previous year's model. It has a \\"back torque limiting\\" clutch that allows for slicker downshifting. A lightweight Showa Big Piston Fork (BPF) comes standard along with a Showa rear shock. Features a more compacted instrument panel which was inspired by the GSX-R1000 instrument panel. The engine power produced at the rear wheel is @ 12,600 rpm. Torque at the rear wheel is @ 11,100 rpm. The wet weight is . In August 2019, Suzuki announced the 2020 GSX-R750, mentioning color options but no other changes.

Why Social Preferences Matter In his 2002 collaboration with Urs Fischbacher, Why Social Preferences Matter ‚Äì The Impact of Non-Selfish Motives on Competition, Cooperation and Incentives, he begins with the abstract: > A substantial number of people exhibit social preferences, which means they > are not solely motivated by material self-interest but also care positively > or negatively for the material payoffs of relevant reference agents. We show > empirically that economists can fail to understand fundamental economic > questions when they disregard social preferences, in particular, that > without taking social preferences into account, it is not possible to > understand adequately (i) effects of competition on market outcomes, (ii) > laws governing cooperation and collective action, (iii) effects and the > determinants of material incentives, (iv) which contracts and property > rights arrangements are optimal, and (v) important forces shaping social > norms and market failures. He conjectures that we could call economics \\"the dismal science\\" because it consistently assumes the worst in human motives, which contrasts sharply with the pervasive idea that consumer tastes are heterogeneous. He attacks the idea on two fronts. First, because a great amount of evidence has contradicted the selfishness hypothesis; second, because failure to regard other-concerning behavior ignores central market activities.The Economic Journal, \\"Why Social Preferences Matter ‚Äì The Impact of Non-Selfish Motives on Competition, Cooperation and Incentives\\" (Blackwell Publishers, Oxford and Malden, 2002) Vol. 112, No. 489 C1‚ÄìC33 See also * Dictator game * Inequity aversion * List of publications in economics Selected bibliography References  External links  * University of Z√ºrich, Department of Economics * Homepage of Ernst Fehr * FehrAdvice & Partners AG, The Behavioral Economics Consultancy Group 1956 births Living people People from Bregenz District Austrian economists Swiss economists Experimental economists University of Zurich faculty Neuroeconomists Austrian expatriates in Switzerland Recipients of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art Recipients of the Gottlieb Duttweiler Prize Fellows of the Econometric Society Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellows of the Association for Psychological Science Members of Academia Europaea Labor economists ","title":"Ernst Fehr"},{"id":"4329793","title":"Back to School (Mini Maggit)"},{"id":"4329794","text":"The Mushroom Rock, a landmark located in the middle of the parkwayMushroom Rock. Little River Canyon National Preserve. Retrieved April 21, 2018. Little River Canyon Rim Parkway, also known as Alabama State Route 176, Dekalb County Road 148 and Cherokee County Road 275, forms a scenic drive following the Little River Canyon National Preserve in northeastern Alabama. The highway was first designated in 1972 as State Route 275, but was later renumbered to State Route 176 on the northern portion east of former Dekalb County Road 81 and turned back south of former Dekalb County Road 81 in September 1980. As one of Alabama's most scenic attractions, the highway itself is only well-maintained on the state portion. The turned back portion, which was highly substandard previously, fell into serious disrepair under local control, almost to the point of abandonment. On the small part of the section maintained by Dekalb County, the road is less than two lanes wide. In Cherokee County, the road widens to two narrow lanes, but has miles of broken pavement and potholes. The roadway is also characterized by extremely steep grades both at the Johnnies Creek tributary and where the roadway descends from Lookout Mountain to the Canyon Mouth Park. While the State Route 176 portion has less severe grades, it is designed similarly with sharp curves and a couple sharp dropoffs at the edge of the canyon in some areas. In terms of scenery and attractions, not only does the route cross many seasonal tributaries, but also it has many lookout points, smaller canyons such as Bear Creek, Dees Branch and Johnnies Creek, and a view of the state's highest waterfall, Grace's High Falls. Halfway along the route at Eberhardt Point, the highway passes by the site of Canyonland Amusement Park, an abandoned and mostly demolished park that featured a chairlift into the canyon floor. The existence of Canyonland Amusement Park was the likely reason that the original State Route 275 was created. This was especially notable, because a sign for the park (painted over, but with a Coca-Cola logo) was originally placed in an island in the middle of the road entrance on the southern terminus. Another point of interest is the Canyon Mouth Park, where Little River leaves the canyon just before entering Lake Weiss. The state portion of the parkway received asphalt for the first time in 2004 (all of the parkway was originally paved with tar and gravel).

It is west of Sandy on the road to Bedford. Its population in 2001 was 636, but had reduced to 620 at the 2011 Census. In the twentieth century the village name was spelled variously as: Moggerhanger, Mogerhanger, Muggerhanger and Morehanger. Local pronunciation of the name is as Morhanger. History The civil parish name is Mogerhanger. The parish includes the hamlet of Chalton which is mentioned in the Domesday Book where it is listed amongst the lands held by Adeliza, wife of Hugh de Grandmesnil, on behalf of the King. The land consisted of a mill, meadow for 10 ploughs and woodland for 16 pigs. This was said to be an outlying area of Potton which was held by the King's niece, Countess Judith.Williams, Ann & Martin, G. H., eds. (2002) Domesday Book: a complete translation. London: Penguin; p. 585 Notable buildings The parish church is dedicated to St. John the Evangelist.

The glucose and fructose are linked by an alpha-1,6-glycosidic bond (chemical name: 6-0-Œ±-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose). Isomaltulose is present in honey and sugarcane extracts. It tastes similar to sucrose (table sugar) with half the sweetness. Isomaltulose, also known by the trade name Palatinose, is manufactured by enzymatic rearrangement (isomerization) of sucrose from beet sugar. The enzyme and its source were discovered in Germany in 1950, and since then its physiological role and physical properties have been studied extensively.Sentko, A. and Willibald-Ettle, I. (2012). \\"Isomaltulose.\\" In: Sweeteners and Sugar Alternatives in Food Technology, 2nd Ed. Editors O'Donnell, K. & Kearsley, M.W. Wiley-Blackwell. Oxford, UK. Isomaltulose has been used as an alternative to sugar in foods in Japan since 1985, in the EU since 2005, in the US since 2006, and in Australia and New Zealand since 2007, besides other countries worldwide. Analytical methods for characterization and assay of commercial isomaltulose are laid down, for example, in the Food Chemicals Codex. Its physical properties closely resemble those of sucrose, making it easy to use in existing recipes and processes. Isomaltulose is hydrogenated to produce isomalt, a minimally digestible carbohydrate that is used as a sugar replacer, for example in sugar-free candies and confectionery. Like sucrose, isomaltulose can be digested to glucose and fructose. However, while in sucrose the glucose is linked to the anomeric carbon of the fructose (an Œ±-1,2 linkage), in isomaltulose the linkage is to the 6 carbon (Œ±-1,6), making isomaltulose a reducing sugar, unlike sucrose. The fructose in isomaltulose exists in a ring structure that readily opens to exhibit a carbonyl group as in ketones and aldehydes, which explains why isomaltulose is a reducing sugar. In comparison with sucrose and most other carbohydrates, isomaltulose is not a significant substrate for oral bacteria. Consequently, acid production from isomaltulose in the mouth is too slow to promote tooth decay. Function In nutrition, isomaltulose is a source of food energy, providing the same amount of energy as sucrose. Like sucrose, isomaltulose provides sweetness to foods, but isomaltulose is only about half as sweet as sucrose. In food preparation and processing, both isomaltulose and sucrose have similar characteristics allowing recipes that use sucrose able to use isomaltulose instead or together. =Available carbohydrate= Isomaltulose is an available carbohydrate like sucrose and most other sugars or maltodextrins, in the sense that it is fully metabolised in the small intestine, and does not enter the large intestine or get excreted in urine. When eaten by humans, isomaltulose is digested completely and absorbed. Its intestinal digestion involves the enzyme isomaltase, which is located at the surface of the brush border lining the inner wall of the small intestine. This enzyme is otherwise involved in the digestion of Œ±-1,6 linkages present in starch. The products of isomaltulose digestion are glucose and fructose, which are absorbed and enter the bloodstream. Once absorbed, the glucose and fructose follow the same metabolic pathways through the body as if they were derived from sucrose. While fructose is mostly converted to glucose or glycogen stores in the liver, glucose from the small intestine and liver is distributed via the circulatory system to different parts of the body where it serves cellular metabolism as an energy source directly or indirectly after storage as glycogen in the tissues of the body, especially in skeletal muscle. =Source of energy= As an available carbohydrate, the food energy value of isomaltulose is identical to that of sucrose. For both, it is 4 kcal/g (17 kJ/g), a value that is used in food labelling or dietary planning. =Slow and sustained release of carbohydrate and energy= Isomaltulose is slow to be digested and absorbed, and is therefore gradually released as glucose and fructose into the bloodstream. After ingestion, the enzymatic digestion of sucrose and isomaltulose occur on the same sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex, which is located in the small intestine. Several studies show that this complex breaks down isomaltulose more slowly than sucrose. The maximum rate at which isomaltase can process isomaltulose (Vmax) is 4.5 times lower than that of sucrase for sucrose. e-book As a result of its slow digestion, isomaltulose travels further through the human small intestine than does sucrose, as evidenced by the difference in incretin responses they elicit. The incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is secreted from the earlier (proximal) part of the small intestine in lower amounts after ingestion of isomaltulose than sucrose, whereas the incretin hormone glucagon- like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted from a later (distal) part of the small intestine in higher amounts with isomaltulose than with sucrose. Compared with sucrose, the absorption of energy as carbohydrate from isomaltulose is prolonged. The resulting sustained energy supply to the body from isomaltulose is reflected in the prolonged shape of the blood glucose concentration response curve. =Lower blood glucose and insulin response= The blood glucose and insulin concentrations after ingestion of isomaltulose are lower than those due to sucrose or glucose, giving isomaltulose a glycemic index (GI) of 32 as recorded in the Sydney University GI database, compared to 67 for sucrose and 100 for glucose, making isomaltulose a particularly low-GI carbohydrate (GI<55). Confirmation of a low glycaemic response to isomaltulose is provided in numerous studies for different population groups including healthy people, overweight or obese persons, prediabetic persons, and type 1 or type 2 diabetes patients.> Among these studies, all show the lower blood glucose response of isomaltulose and where tested also show the associated reduction in the blood insulin response. A significant role for the incretin hormone GLP-1 has been established, which is secreted in response to distal carbohydrate absorption and limits the rise in blood glucose concentration after a meal. A claim corresponding to the low glycemic response of isomaltulose and its potential to lower the blood glucose response to foods when replacing other sugars has been approved in EU legislation following the publication of a positive opinion from the European Food Safety Authority. In the long term, when eating a diet including carbohydrate, avoiding undesirably high concentrations of glucose in blood and the associated demand for insulin, is supportive of the prevention and management of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and possibly overweight and obesity‚Äîas indicated by the International Carbohydrate Quality Consortium consensus of expert nutrition scientists. Continuous monitoring of 24-h blood glucose concentration following diets including isomaltulose instead of sucrose lowers the blood glucose profile over the day, as a result of a lower blood glucose response to individual meals. A lower glycemic diet can be achieved by choosing foods with low or reduced glycemic properties, more specifically by choosing lower GI foods from within each food group (fruit, vegetable, whole grains, etc.). The use of Isomaltulose in place of sucrose and other carbohydrates allows for the production of foods with reduced GI. Several studies provide evidence of improvements in both blood glucose control and lipid metabolism in both diabetic and non-diabetic persons upon regular consumption of isomaltulose when compared with other carbohydrates such as sucrose, maltodextrin, or glucose. =Effect on fat oxidation= Compared to other carbohydrates, isomaltulose ingestion is associated with higher rates of fat oxidation and lower rates of fat storage. Mechanistically this involves a lower blood glucose concentration, which then provides a reduced stimulus to insulin secretion, which in turn allows more fatty acids to be released from adipose tissue for oxidation as an energy source. The lower insulin concentration also decreases carbohydrate oxidation, allowing more fatty acids to be oxidized. A lower insulin concentration also lowers the rate of liver free fatty acid recycling via plasma triglycerides and reduces the storage of triglycerides in adipose tissue. Practical implications include higher rates of fat oxidation after ingestion of isomaltulose than higher glycaemic carbohydrates. This has been shown in many studies with different areas of focus:  Weight management and body composition  Studies have looked at the effects on fat oxidation and other metabolic responses when replacing sugars with isomaltulose in meals (or drinks) taken by healthy or overweight to obese adults, with or without impaired glucose tolerance, while largely sedentary. These studies have shown isomaltulose to have a role in reducing adiposity, at least central obesity. Abdominal fat decreases when consuming isomaltulose instead of sucrose (sugar replacement) or instead of breakfast calories (largely carbohydrate replacement). This is brought about at least in part by a lower GIP and higher GLP-1 response when carbohydrate is slow to digest and is absorbed slowly in the lower (distal) small intestine.  Physical activity and sports nutrition  Others studies have examined the potential benefits of slow and sustained release of carbohydrate during physical activity. Using isomaltulose in place of other ingested carbohydrates, higher rates of fat oxidation also occur during endurance activities, where preserving glycogen is important. In addition, trials using a recovery protein drink have shown that incorporating isomaltulose and a nutritional supplement (Œ≤-hydroxy- Œ≤-methylbutyrate ) may help recovery from resistance exercise‚Äîso reducing of muscle damage and improving athletic performance.  Type 1 diabetes patients engaging in physical activity  In people with type 1 diabetes, taking isomaltulose instead of glucose during moderate carbohydrate loading before exercise improves blood glucose control and protects against hypoglycemia while maintaining running performance. The reduced risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia arises in part from a lower requirement for insulin by injection (50% lower) when using isomaltulose and in part from the higher contribution of fat oxidation to energy metabolism, which preserves glycogen stores, further reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. =Cognitive performance (mood and memory)= The rate of glucose supply from dietary carbohydrates can affect cognitive performance, with effects on mood and memory having been shown in several studies that compared isomaltulose with higher glycaemic carbohydrates taken at breakfast, showing improvements in mood and memory in healthy children, middle-aged adults, and aged adults. =Oral health= Isomaltulose is ‚Äòkind to teeth‚Äô. Fermentation of carbohydrates by bacteria in the mouth (especially on the teeth) is responsible for the formation of dental plaque and oral acids. The acid initiates tooth demineralisation and tooth decay (dental caries). Isomaltulose largely resists fermentation by oral bacteria and is the first carbohydrate of its kind with negligible acid production on teeth, as shown by pH telemetry. The evidence is strong and provides the basis for ‚Äòkind to teeth‚Äô claims approved by both the Food and Drug Administration in the USA and European authorities following a positive opinion from the European Food Safety Authority. Use Isomaltulose is used in foods, drinks and health products owing to several of its properties. It is used in foods and beverages, where it provides a natural sucrose-like sweetness profile with a sweetening power about half that of sucrose, and no aftertaste. It has very low moisture absorption (hygroscopy), giving it free-flowing properties in instant powders, which because of their low risk of lumping can easily be used in drinks and other instant products. It is highly stable during processing, including acidic conditions and environments where bacteria might grow. In sports beverages, for instance, isotonicity (osmotic pressure equal to that of fluids in the body) can be maintained during storage over the beverage's shelf-life. Isomaltulose finds application in baked goods, pastry glazings and icings, breakfast cereals, cereal bars, dairy produce, sugar confectionery (e.g. chocolates, jellies, chewy confections and chewing or bubble gum), frozen desserts, fruit-juice beverages, malt beverages, sports beverages, energy drinks, instant drinks, and special and clinical nutrition feeds. Isomaltulose in permitted for use in foods and drinks in many regions worldwide. For example, it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is approved as a novel food by the European Commission, and in Japan has the status FOSHU (food for specific health use).

Aging work in New Zealand suggested these wrasses can live at least 35 years. Description Notolabrus fucicola is the largest wrasse species occurring in New Zealand‚Äôs waters. Its It grows to a length of in Australian waters but can be slightly larger around New Zealand, where they can reach lengths of and weights of up to . This species has quite a deep body and shows variable colouring, the young adult fish are reddish- brown mottled with green and orange and the adults are green-brown in colour with shades of purple and fuzzy yellowish vertical bars on their body and fins. Juveniles are a similar colour to young adults but have yellow markings. Distribution Notolabrus fucicola is found in the south eastern Indian Ocean and the south western Pacific Ocean in Australia and New Zealand. It is found throughout New Zealand including the Three Kings Islands, Stewart Island and Snares Island. In Australia it is found off the south east from southern New South Wales, Victoria to eastern South Australia, as well as Tasmania. Habitat and biology They are generalist predators with powerful canine teeth that enable them to remove chitons, limpets, and barnacles from rocks. They can also crush and eat mollusks, crabs, and sea urchins. As they grow their diet undergoes change with the smaller fish, of lengths between feeding mostly on amphipods and isopods, while the larger fish prey mainly on bivalves, crabs, and gastropods. It occurs in beds of kelp and over rocky reefs which have some exposure to tides and currents at depths of . These are territorial fish which are long-live, often over 20 years old, and they defend their territories aggressively. Notolabrus fucicola spawn in the southern Spring and Summer from July through to December, they do not spawn synchronously. Many other wrasses are protogynous hermaphrodites but this species is a secondary gonochorist, in which individual fish change sex before they reach sexual maturity. It has two colour forms, but it is not sexually dimorphic. In any population there will be just one morphological type of male. Workers have, so far, been unable to find any individuals with gonads in transition from female to male but particular environmental or social conditions may still be involved in inducing sex change in at least a some of the fishes in a population. Abstract Unlike other wrasses which are protogynous hermaphrodites populations of Notolabrus fucicola can have large individuals of both sexes. Naming and taxonomy Notolabrus fucicola was first formally described as Labrus fucicola in 1840 by the Scottish naturalist John Richardson (1787-1865) with the type locality being given as Port Arthur, Tasmania. When Barry C. Russell described the genus Notolabrus in 1988, he designated Labrus fucicola as its type species. Human usage Notolabrus fucicola is a quarry species for both commercial fisheries and recreational anglers. They have been known to bite divers, leaving a scraping wound. Off the coasts of Victoria and Tasmania this species is caught by commercial fishermen using traps and on hand-lines to be sold as live fish. In Tasmaniam waters and off eastern South Australia is a common bycatch in the lobster fishery, when caught it is frequently kept for use as bait. It is a quarry species for anglers and spear fishers too. Conservation Notolabrus fucicola are easy to catch, because of their territorial nature and the aggressive competition with other fishes for food, and are caught from rocks, boats, and piers, There have been areas where they have undergone local population declines which have overfishing as their most likely cause but sedimentation and nutrient pollution may also affect the condition of their inshore reef habitat. In Victoria there is a legal minimum length and the commercial fishery licenses are capped at 51. In Tasmania The minimum legal size is and the authorities have issued 58 fishing licences. Notolabrus fucicola occur in several marine protected areas within its distribution. Although the IUCN classify this fish as Least Concern they recommend that further research is required on the population of this species, especially on the effects fisheries have, and the population trends should be studied at the same time.

It is common name among Romance language-speaking populations as well as several Slavic countries in the Balkans, Lusophone Africa and South Africa. In the English language it is translated as Anthony, and has some female derivatives: Antonia, Ant√≥nia, Antonieta, Antonietta, and Antonella'. It also has some male derivatives, such as Anthonio, Ant√≥n, Ant√≤, Antonis, Anto√±ito, Antonino, Antonello, Tonio, Tono, To√±o, To√±√≠n, Tonino, Nantonio, Ninni, Tot√≤, T√≥, Tonini, Tony, Toni, Toninho, To√±ito, and T√µnis. The Portuguese equivalent is Ant√≥nio (Portuguese orthography) or Ant√¥nio (Brazilian Portuguese). In old Portuguese the form Ant√£o was also used, not just to differentiate between older and younger but also between more and less important, In Galician the form is Ant√≥n, in Catalan Ant√≤, and in Basque Antxon. The Greek versions of the name are Antonios (ŒëŒΩœÑœéŒΩŒπŒøœÇ) and Antonis (ŒëŒΩœÑœéŒΩŒ∑œÇ). The name derives from Antonius, a well-known Latin family name, probably of Etruscan origin. The Roman general Marcus Antonius held that the origin of the name was Anthon (ŒëŒΩŒ∏œéŒΩ), son of Hercules. This myth, recorded by Plutarch, was probably created by Marcus Antonius himself, in order to claim divine parentage. The name was in use throughout the Roman world which, at its height, comprised the whole of the Mediterranean and much of Europe as well as the Middle East. When the Roman Empire became Christian, the name continued in popularity because of the many great saints who bore the name. Later, the name was spread all around the world as Christianity was introduced to other locations (e.g. the Far East, the Americas, Australia, and Sub-Saharan Africa).

Michael Straczynski saw these early efforts and hired Hudgens to officially produce B5 promotional music videos for science fiction fan conventions and other events. Eight official videos were produced, plus more unofficial videos shown at conventions and distributed on the Internet. Hudgens had also dabbled in fan films, producing The Empire Strikes Quack in the late 1980s. Beginning in 2000, Hudgens made the first of a series of noted Star Wars fan films, Crazy Watto, a two-minute parody of Star Wars and used car commercials. The film proved very popular and would go on to be an official selection at Lucasfilm's Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards and screen at the Cannes Film Festival. His second film, Darth Vader's Psychic Hotline, is a fast-paced four-minute parody of many science fiction shows and films, and features Kevin J. Anderson, Claudia Christian and Peter David among others. This effort was the second runner-up for the Audience Choice Award at the 2002 Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, an award he would win the next year for The Jedi Hunter, a parody of Star Wars and The Crocodile Hunter. He would win the Audience Choice Award once more in 2005 for Sith Apprentice, his longest fan film to date, at twelve minutes. All of Hudgens fan films were produced, directed, shot, and edited by him, were made in collaboration with The Men in Black creator Lowell Cunningham, and were produced and released by Hudgens' Z-Team Productions company. Hudgens went on to create American Scary, a feature- length documentary about television horror hosts. The film premiered in October 2006 at the Hollywood Film Festival, and was released on DVD in February 2009. Hudgens' most recent effort was Backyard Blockbusters, a 2012 documentary about the fan film genre and the people behind it.

The colourless or white solid is the simplest molecular boron-nitrogen-hydride compound. It has attracted attention as a source of hydrogen fuel, but is otherwise primarily of academic interest. Synthesis Reaction of diborane with ammonia mainly gives the diammoniate salt [H2B(NH3)2]+(BH4)‚àí. Ammonia borane is the main product when an adduct of borane is employed in place of diborane: :BH3(THF) + NH3 ‚Üí BH3NH3 + THF Properties and structure The molecule adopts a structure like ethane, with which it is isoelectronic. The B‚àíN distance is 1.58(2) √Ö. The B‚àíH and N‚àíH distances are 1.15 and 0.96 √Ö, respectively. Its similarity to ethane is tenuous since ammonia borane is a solid and ethane is a gas: their melting points differing by 284 ¬∞C. This difference is consistent with the highly polar nature of ammonia borane. The H atoms attached to boron are hydridic and those attached to nitrogen are somewhat acidic. Resonance structures of ammonia-borane The structure of the solid indicates a close association of the NH and the BH centers. The closest H‚àíH distance is 1.990 √Ö, which can be compared with the H‚àíH bonding distance of 0.74 √Ö. This interaction is called a dihydrogen bond. The original crystallographic analysis of this compound reversed the assignments of B and N. The updated structure was arrived at with improved data using the technique of neutron diffraction that allowed the hydrogen atoms to be located with greater precision. Part of the crystal structure of ammonia borane Uses Ammonia borane has been suggested as a storage medium for hydrogen, e.g. for when the gas is used to fuel motor vehicles. It can be made to release hydrogen on heating, being polymerized first to (NH2BH2)n, then to (NHBH)n, which ultimately decomposes to boron nitride (BN) at temperatures above 1000 ¬∞C. It is more hydrogen-dense than liquid hydrogen and also able to exist at normal temperatures and pressures. Ammonia borane finds some use in organic synthesis as an air-stable derivative of diborane. Analogous amine-boranes Many analogues have been prepared from primary, secondary, and even tertiary amines: * Borane tert-butylamine (tBuNH2‚ÜíBH3) * Borane trimethylamine (Me3N‚ÜíBH3) * Borane isopropylamine (iPrNH2‚ÜíBH3) The first amine adduct of borane was derived from trimethylamine. Borane tert-butylamine complex is prepared by the reaction of sodium borohydride with t-butylammonium chloride. Generally adduct are more robust with more basic amines. Variations are also possible for the boron component, although primary and secondary boranes are less common. Additionally, many complexes of borane have been prepared, including borane dimethylsulfide (Me2S‚ÜíBH3) and borane‚Äìtetrahydrofuran (THF‚ÜíBH3).

History GSPI was established in January 2003 to satisfy the European Union requirements regarding counter- terrorist operations and internal protection following the Moscow theater hostage crisis in October 2002 and reported to the Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reform. Two Romanian police officers had conducted a study tour of EU countries police tactical units prior to the formation and significant assistance was provided from Germany's GSG 9 with the creation and development of GSPI. In 2007, GSPI joined the European Union ATLAS Network with other EU countries national police tactical units. In March 2009, GSPI was disbanded after a huge corruption scandal. In 2015, GSPI was re-established as part of the Directorate of Intelligence and Internal Security, later renamed to General Directorate for Internal Security.

Many of the characters listed here have names reflecting certain aspects of them, such as their status, personality, or role. Introduced in The Matrix =Apoc= Apoc (played by Julian Arahanga) is a crew member of the Nebuchadnezzar in The Matrix. =Agent Brown and Agent Jones= =Choi and DuJour= Choi (played by Marc Gray) is assumedly a bluepill who appears in the first movie buying illegal software from Neo, for which Choi pays $2,000 in cash. Choi, his latex-clad girlfriend DuJour (played by Ada Nicodemou), and several unnamed and unspeaking friends arrive at Neo's door after he had been mysteriously told to \\"follow the white rabbit\\" through his computer. When Neo notices that Dujour has a tattoo of a white rabbit on the back of her left shoulder, he accepts their offer to go with them to a goth club, where he is approached by Trinity. Going to the club and subsequently waking up late for work the following day set the stage for the rest of the film, though Choi, Dujour, and their friends are never seen or alluded to again. Much of Choi's dialogue foreshadows the rest of the film: \\"I know. This never happened. You don't exist\\", \\"You need to unplug\\", and \\"Hallelujah. You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.\\" These names would appear to be inspired by French language; \\"Choi\\" and \\"DuJour\\" resembles the French phrase \\"Choix du jour\\", meaning \\"Choice of the day\\". =Cypher/Mr. Reagan= Mr. Reagan (a.k.a. Cypher), played by Joe Pantoliano is a central character in The Matrix. =Dozer= Dozer (played by Anthony Ray Parker) is the pilot of the Nebuchadnezzar. =Morpheus= =Mouse= Mouse (played by Matt Doran) is a crew member of the Nebuchadnezzar. In the film, Mouse is the youngest crew member of the Nebuchadnezzar and the programmer of the virtual reality training simulation program. One of his stand-out scenes occurs when he is discussing to Neo whether the Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs food tastes like ‚ÄúTastee Wheat‚Äù (a brand of cereal, posters of which can be briefly seen in the train stations shown in The Matrix Revolutions), and adds to the theme of subjective reality by suggesting that the flavor associated with both is not the ‚Äòtrue‚Äô flavor, but the Machines‚Äô error. He is the creator of the program Woman in the Red Dress, which is used as a distraction in part of Neo‚Äôs training. He is a very eager young man, excited to see the possibility that Neo could be the one to end the war. He also offers Woman in the Red Dress in a private session to Neo saying, ‚ÄúTo deny our impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human‚Äù. Mouse is the first victim of Cypher‚Äôs betrayal of the crew. As Agent-led SWAT team members storm the building used by Neo and the others as an entry/exit point, Mouse attempts to stop their initial approach wielding dual automatic shotguns (custom made for the film), but is killed by the police. =Neo= Neo (born as Thomas A. Anderson, also known as The One, an anagram for \\"Neo\\") is the protagonist of the Matrix franchise. He was portrayed as a cybercriminal and computer programmer by Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Trilogy, as well as having a cameo in The Animatrix short film Kid's Story. Andrew Bowen provided Neo's voice in The Matrix: Path of Neo. In 2008, Neo was selected by Empire as the 68th Greatest Movie Character of All Time. Neo is also an anagram of \\"one\\", a reference to his destiny of being The One who would bring peace. There are claims that a nightclub in Chicago inspired the name of the character in the Matrix. Neo is considered to be a superhero. =Oracle= =Rhineheart= Mr. Rhineheart (played by David Aston) is Thomas Anderson's boss at the software company Metacortex. =Agent Smith= =Switch= Switch (played by Belinda McClory) was a member of the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar. Unlike the mental projections of other crews, who usually wear dark clothes and sunglasses, Switch wore white clothes and yellow, translucent sunglasses. Switch and Apoc (her lover) are portrayed as front- line soldiers while inside the Matrix, acting as \\"point\\" and \\"rear guard\\" in their escape from the Agents and police and providing covering fire as they make their way into the sewers. Switch's weapon of choice is a Browning Hi- Power pistol. Switch also pokes fun at Mouse, calling him \\"the digital pimp\\". Switch was killed when her mind was forcibly pulled from the Matrix by Cypher, who betrayed the crew in an attempt to return to the Matrix as a permanent resident himself. Cypher also killed Apoc and Dozer before being killed by Tank, the ship's Operator. The character was supposedly originally meant to be a feminine character in the Matrix and a man in the real world, and they decided to change that because they thought it would confuse the audience. =Tank= Tank (played by Marcus Chong) is the original Operator of the Nebuchadnezzar Tank watched over not only the jacked-in crewmembers, but also the ship itself in case the Sentinels (killing machines) detected the ship. Like all Operators, Tank was a skilled programmer who could provide jacked-in crewmembers almost anything they needed and guided them to and from dangerous events within the Matrix. One of his more famous lines, is when Tank meets Neo and tells him of the significance that Morpheus found Neo, \\"It's a VERY exciting time.\\" Tank died after the events in The Matrix but before the events in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded. The character's duties as ship's Operator was handed over to Link, who is married to Tank and Dozer's sister, Zee. The demise of the character was reportedly due to actor Marcus Chong's salary demands and conflicts with the Wachowskis, the writers and creators of the Matrix series, leading to his removal. =Trinity= Introduced in The Matrix Reloaded =Architect= Portrayed by Helmut Bakaitis. He is the \\"father\\" of The Matrix. The Oracle states that he tries to \\"balance the equations\\" of the Matrix while she unbalances them. The character first appears in The Matrix Reloaded when Neo encounters him while looking for The Source. =Captain Ballard= Captain Ballard (played by Roy Jones Jr.), was the captain of the Zion hovercraft Caduceus in the film The Matrix Reloaded and the video game Enter the Matrix. =Bane= Bane (played by Ian Bliss) was a crew member of the Zion hovercraft Caduceus in the films The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. =Captain Mifune= Captain Mifune (Nathaniel Lees) is the head of Zion's Armored Personnel Unit (APU) corps. =Cas= Cas (played by Gina Torres) is the widow of the Nebuchadnezzar's former pilot Dozer. =Ghost= Ghost (played by Anthony Wong) is the guns specialist of the Logos ship in the video game Enter the Matrix and the feature films The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. Ghost is described by the Wachowskis as an \\"ascetic Buddhist killer\\".Making of Enter the Matrix dialogue A student of philosophy, he quotes and/or refers to Hume, William James, Nietzsche and especially Kierkegaard. Ghost's name may be a reference to the phrase \\"ghost in the machine\\", which describes the concept of mind-body dualism. Ghost's latest appearance was in the MMORPG The Matrix Online. Due to copyright issues with Anthony Wong, Ghost is bald and has been completely shaven of all facial hair. Ghost, along with \\"the Twins\\", are the only recurring characters up-to-date to lack voice actors for The Matrix Online. Ghost was the first to encounter \\"Trinity\\" inside the Matrix after her death, although it was not made clear whether this Trinity was 'real' or a simulation.The Matrix Online chapter 12.1 =Keymaker= = Kid = Michael Karl Popper (a.k.a. The Kid), played by Clayton Watson, is a Zion-dwelling self-substantiated exile, appears in The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions, and The Animatrix short, \\"Kid's Story\\". =Link= Link (played by Harold Perrineau) serves as the ship's pilot and operator for the crew of the Zion hovercraft Nebuchadnezzar, replacing Tank and Dozer. =Lock= Commander Jason Lock (played by Harry J. Lennix) is the supreme commander of all military defense forces of the human city Zion. His character appears in The Matrix Reloaded, Enter the Matrix, and The Matrix Revolutions. =Maggie= Maggie (played by Essie Davis) is a crew member on the Mjolnir (nicknamed Hammer). =Merovingian= The Merovingian (also known as the Frenchman) is a character in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. He is portrayed by French actor Lambert Wilson in both films and voiced by Robin Atkin Downes in The Matrix: Path of Neo. He also played a prominent role in The Matrix Online role-playing game. =Niobe= =Persephone= =Roland= Roland (played by David Roberts) is the captain of the hovercraft Mjolnir. He appears in the feature films Reloaded, Revolutions and the video games Enter The Matrix and The Matrix: Path of Neo. = Seraph = Seraph is described as the personification of a sophisticated challenge-handshake authentication protocol which guards the Oracle. He is portrayed by Collin Chou. As a challenge handshake authentication protocol, Seraph is effectively a login screen that fights the user to authenticate their identity. The role was initially offered to Michelle Yeoh, but she declined due to a scheduling conflict. The character was changed to a male, with Jet Li being offered a role. As Li declined the role, Chou signed on. =The Twins= The twins (portrayed by identical twins Neil and Adrian Rayment), are henchmen of the Merovingian. They are believed to be older versions of Agents from a previous iteration of the Matrix, before they became \\"Exiles\\", or rogue programs. =Zee= Zee (played by Nona Gaye) is a native Zionite who experienced the pain of losing her brothers Dozer and Tank (from the original Matrix film), both of whom were killed while serving aboard the Nebuchadnezzar. The role of Zee was originally given to singer/actress Aaliyah, who was killed in a plane crash on August 25, 2001, before she could complete shooting her part for The Matrix Reloaded. Many singers and actresses were named as potential replacements, including Eva Mendes, Samantha Mumba, Brandy Norwood and Tatyana Ali. Ali actress Nona Gaye was named as Aaliyah's replacement in April 2002. Gaye was nominated for an NAACP Image Award along with co-star Jada Pinkett Smith for the role of Niobe. Introduced in The Matrix Revolutions =Deus Ex Machina= Deus Ex Machina (motion-captured by Henry Blasingame, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) is the central interface of the Machine City that debuts in the third movie. It consists of a vast swarm of tiny Sentinels that emerge from hatches in a frame plate to form a three-dimensional image of a human face. =Sati= Sati is a sentient program, listed for erasure in the Machine World because she serves no purpose within it. =Sparks= Sparks (played by Lachy Hulme) is the operator and general-purpose crewmember of the Logos in the film The Matrix Revolutions and the video game Enter the Matrix. =Trainman= The Trainman (played by Bruce Spence) appears in The Matrix Revolutions. He is a program in the employ of the Merovingian, tasked with transporting programs from the machine world to the Matrix when they seek exile. Other =Jue= Jue (voiced by Pamela Segall) appears in the Animatrix film \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\". =Shimada= Shimada, voiced by Kit Harris, is Kid's second-in-command of the organization E Pluribus Neo in the MMORPG game The Matrix Online. =Tyndall= Tyndall appears only in The Matrix Online, in which she is voiced by Kit Harris.

It is one of the most visited monuments of Ancient Egypt. The structure was built around the 19th Egyptian Dynasty (c. 1290‚Äì1224 BC).Kleiner, Fred S. Gardner's Art Through the Ages. 14th. Boston: Wadsworth, 73. Print. Its design was initially instituted by Hatshepsut, at the North-west chapel to Amun in the upper terrace of Deir el-Bahri. The name refers to hypostyle architectural pattern.  Architecture and construction  Central columns of the Hypostyle Hall The Great Hypostyle Hall covers an area of . The roof, now fallen, was supported by 134 columns in 16 rows; the 2 middle rows are higher than the others (being in circumference and high). The 134 papyrus columns represent the primeval papyrus swamp from which Amun, a self-created deity, arose from the waters of chaos at the beginning of creating. The hall was not constructed by Horemheb, or Amenhotep III as earlier scholars had thought but was built entirely by Seti I who engraved the northern wing of the hall with inscriptions. Decoration of the southern wing was completed by the 19th dynasty pharaoh Ramesses II.  Inscriptions and reliefs  Inscriptions and reliefs A series of succeeding pharaohs added inscriptions to the walls and the columns in places their predecessors had left blank, including Ramesses III, Ramesses IV and Ramesses VI. The northern side of the hall is decorated in raised relief, and was mainly Seti I's work. The southern side of the hall was completed by Ramesses II, in sunk relief although he used raised relief at the very beginning of his reign before changing to the sunk relief style and re-editing his own raised reliefs. Ramesses II also usurped decoration of his father along the main north-south and east-west processional ways of the hall, giving the casual observer the idea that he was responsible for the building. However, most of Seti I's reliefs in the northern part of the hall were respected. The outer walls depict scenes of battle, Seti I on the north and Ramesses II on the south. Although these reliefs had religious and ideological functions, they are important records of the wars of these kings. On another wall adjoining the south wall of the Hall is a record of Ramesses II's Egyptian‚ÄìHittite peace treaty that he signed in Year 21 of his reign. In 1899, eleven of the massive columns of the Great Hypostyle Hall collapsed in a chain reaction, because their foundations were undermined by ground water. Georges Legrain, who was then the chief archaeologist in the area, supervised the rebuilding that was completed in May 1902. Later, similar work had to continue in order to strengthen the rest of the columns of the Temple. See also *Talatat Notes References Peter J. Brand, Rosa Erika Feleg, and William J.

History Reports say the larches were planted in 1938. It is unclear how the trees came to be planted and arranged in such a fashion. It seems they were planted in commemoration of Adolf Hitler's birthday, either by local Hitler Youth membersCleaver, Hannah (November 30, 2000). \\"Berlin forest swastika to go but its image may remain\\".

For a few weeks every year in the autumn and in the spring, the colour of the larch leaves would change, contrasting with the deep green of the pine forest. The short duration of the effect, combined with the fact that the image could only be discerned from the air and the relative scarcity of privately owned airplanes in the area, meant that the swastika went largely unnoticed after the fall of the Third Reich. During the subsequent Socialist period, Soviet authorities reportedly knew of its existence but made no effort to remove it.\\"German forest loses swastika\\" BBC News, December 4, 2000, retrieved March 9, 2006 However, in 1992, the reunified German government ordered aerial surveys of all state-owned land. The photographs were examined by forestry students, who immediately noticed the design. Removal The Brandenburg state authorities, concerned about damage to the region's image and the possibility that the area would become a pilgrimage site for National Socialist supporters, attempted to destroy the design by removing 43 of the 100 larch trees in 1995. However, the figure remained discernible with the remaining 57 trees as well as some trees which had regrown, and in 2000 German tabloids published further aerial photographs showing the prominence of the swastika. By this time, ownership of around half the land on which the trees sat had been sold into private hands, but permission was gained to fell a further 25 trees on the government-owned area on December 1, 2000, and the image was largely obscured. Similar incidents In the late 1970s, American troops discovered a swastika along with the numbers ‚Äú1933‚Äù planted in a similar style in Hesse. Who planted the trees is unknown. In September 2006 The New York Times reported on another forest swastika in Eki Naryn, Kyrgyzstan, positioned at on the edge of the Tian Shan Mountains.

The West Pennine Moors is an area of the Pennines covering approximately of moorland and reservoirs in Lancashire and Greater Manchester, England. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The West Pennine Moors are separated from the main Pennine range by the Irwell Valley. The moorland includes Withnell, Anglezarke and Rivington Moors in the extreme west, Darwen and Turton Moors, Oswaldtwistle Moors and Holcombe Moors. These moors are lower in height than the main spine of the South Pennines. At , the highest point is at Winter Hill. The area is of historical importance with archaeological evidence of human activity from Neolithic times. The area is close to urban areas, the dramatic backdrop to Bolton, Blackburn and Bury and neighbouring towns affording panoramic views across the Lancashire Plain and the Greater Manchester conurbation. The moorland is surrounded by the towns of Bolton, Chorley, Darwen, Horwich, Ramsbottom, Haslingden and Oswaldtwistle. Notable structures include Rivington Pike Tower, Winter Hill transmitting station, Peel Monument near Holcombe and the Jubilee Tower on Darwen Moor. United Utilities owns around 40% of the land for water catchment. The company operates four information centres at Rivington, Jumbles Country Park, Roddlesworth and Haslingden Grane. History =Prehistoric= It is possible that Mesolithic hunting camps existed on the moors but evidence is rare. The area was then covered by forest which Neolithic and Bronze Age settlers began to clear. More forest was cleared by the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings. Place names such as clough, fell and moss suggest they were named by Norse settlers. Parts of the moorland were within the Royal Hunting Forests in the Middle Ages. The landscape continued to change as a result of enclosures in the middle of the 16th century. Cheetham Close above Edgworth is the site of a destroyed Bronze Age megalith and is a scheduled ancient monument. On Anglezarke Moor are two prehistoric sites, Pikestones and Round Loaf, a landmark clearly visible from the route across Great Hill from White Coppice. A burial mound from about 1500 BC was discovered on Winter Hill around 0.5 km west of the summit. Another site, 1 km west of the summit, at Noon Hill Saucer Tumulus, is a burial site consisting of two concentric stonewalls which had two sets of burnt human bones, a broken urn containing more bones, two flint arrow heads and flint sacrificial knife in the centre. The site has been dated to around 1100 BC. Lead Mines Clough =Modern= In 1690, lead was discovered in Lead Mines Clough at Anglezarke. The mines were expanded in the 1790s and copper and galena were also extracted. Witherite (barium carbonate) was discovered around 1700, and used as a glaze for porcelain. Stone was quarried at several sites including Anglezarke and used for building farmhouses, barns, mills and stone boundary walls. There were small coal mines on Winter Hill and Quarlton. Belmont was the site of a bleaching and dyeing works, powered by water from Eagley Brook which powered mills along its valley. A reservoir was constructed, despite objections, requiring an Act of Parliament that stipulated two million gallons of water had to be released daily into Eagley Brook to sustain the industry that depended on it. Streams on the southern fringe of the moorland were utilised for water power and important for the bleaching and textile industries that grew up at Wallsuches, Horwich and Barrow Bridge. Near the transmitter is Scotsman's Stump, an iron post with a plaque, a memorial to a Scottish salesman, George Henderson, who was shot on the moor by an unknown assailant in 1838. He was en route to a local inn to meet a friend but failed to arrive. His friend searched and found him fatally shot. A man was charged with the crime but not convicted. A ranger on Winter Hill constructed two cairns on the moor to commemorate the alleged tragic death of two young men on the site many hundreds of years ago. Bolton Council demolished them claiming they were a safety hazard. He re-constructed them and successfully fought for them to remain. In the 1980s it was planned to excavate the site, but the plan was abandoned, so the truth behind the story is not known. There have been two air disasters on the moors. Overlooking the valley near Lead Mines Clough is a war memorial commemorating the crew of an RAF Wellington bomber that crashed there during the Second World War. On 27 February 1958 a commercial flight from Ronaldsway Airport on the Isle of Man to Manchester Airport ended tragically on Winter Hill. The weather was atrocious and due to the poor visibility, heavy snow and remote location, only seven of the 42 people on board survived. The crash remains the area's worst air disaster. Plaques to commemorate this are mounted on the Arqiva Winter Hill building and at Ronaldsway Airport. Geology and geography The underlying geology is the Millstone Grit series with sandstones and coarse gritstones separated by bands of shale. The area was covered by ice during the Ice Age and boulder clay deposited as the ice retreated. The rounded hill tops are millstone covered with shallow soil or peat above 400 metres. Lead, tin and coal have been mined in the area. Witherite was discovered at White Coppice. The moors are dotted with many ruins, such as Higher Hempshaw's The rounded moorland hills of the West Pennine Moors are generally lower in height than the higher moorland plateaux of the main Pennine range to the east. There are gritstone crags and steep escarpments creating dramatic landforms with \\"V\\"-shaped valleys drained by fast-flowing streams. The highest peak is Winter Hill at . The moors are incised by wooded valleys and cloughs; the largest is in the Roddlesworth valley near Tockholes. There are small coniferous plantations, particularly around the reservoirs, but overall woodland cover is minimal. The larger settlements are around the edges of the moors in the valleys, while the moors have scattered individual farmsteads built of local gritstone some of which have been abandoned or deserted. The predominant land use is for sheep farming. Unlike many areas of moorland in the north of England, the moors here are not managed for grouse shooting and consist largely of rough grassland and peat bog. There was a 50% loss of heather cover between 1946 and 1988. Reservoirs A view across Yarrow Reservoir, the newest of those built at Rivington The Jumbles reservoir is the home of a sailing club. Valleys on the moors were flooded in the mid-19th century to provide water first for local industry and later to guarantee clean water for the surrounding towns and Liverpool. There are several chains that contribute to the landscape and which provide opportunities for leisure and tourism. The Anglezarke, Upper Rivington, Lower Rivington and Yarrow reservoirs were built to provide Liverpool with clean water. The 'Rivington Pike Scheme' was undertaken by Thomas Hawksley between 1850 and 1857 to construct five reservoirs. Water from two higher-level reservoirs, Rake Brook and Lower Ruddlesworth, was carried south in 'The Goit', a man-made channel through Heapey and White Coppice connecting them to the reservoirs. The scheme was expanded in 1856 to include High Bullough Reservoir, built in 1850 supplying water to Chorley. The Upper Roddlesworth Reservoir was built in 1867‚Äì75. Yarrow Reservoir was begun in 1867 and designed by Thomas Duncan, the Liverpool Borough Engineer. The Rivington watershed comprises 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤) of land and the average flow rate through the filter beds at Horwich is 8.96 million litres/day (2.24 million gallons/day). To the east of the area can be found the separate chains of Belmont, Delph, Turton and Entwistle, Wayoh and Jumbles reservoirs. Situated in the northeast is Haslingden Grane, a glaciated valley with three reservoirs, Calf Hey, Ogden and Holden Wood. There is a car park and information centre at Clough Head. Access land In 1896, a mass trespass took place on the moors following the sale of land to Colonel Ainsworth for shooting. He tried to prevent members of the public from using the public rights of way. Reports claim a crowd of 10,000 people gathered to be confronted by a barrier and the police, but the crowd literally threw the police officers over the fence and proceeded to march across the land. A large amount of open moorland has been made accessible due to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 giving walkers the right to roam over the moorland. Much of this area is boggy and makes for difficult walking. The area around High Bullough reservoir is a nature reserve on the Anglezarke trail. Mountain biking has become popular since 2002, when the area was the setting for the biking events of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. In March 2020, the West Pennine Moors SSSI was on fire during the Coronavirus lock down, presumably due to a barbecue. Landmarks Panorama of Winter Hill from the west The main mast at Winter Hill transmitting station on Winter Hill extends to a height of and is owned by Arqiva. It carries analogue and digital radio transmissions and digital television transmissions of BBC TV, ITV, CH4, CH5, FREEVIEW, BBC radio and commercial radio services. This mast serves the North West region. Most other masts and towers on the site are for mobile phones base stations, emergency services communications and PMR services and various microwave links. Jubilee Tower, Darwen Due to its prominent position, Rivington Pike was used as a beacon on 19 July 1588, when it was lit to warn the population that the Spanish Armada had been sighted off The Lizard in Cornwall. A beacon was lit to mark the end of the Great War in 1918, the coronations of George V and Elizabeth II and the Royal wedding in 1981. The tower on top of the Pike was built as a shelter commissioned by John Andrews of Rivington Hall in 1733. It fell out of use when the estate was bought by William Lever in 1900. It is a Grade-II-listed building. The octagonal Jubilee Tower on Beacon Hill overlooking the town of Darwen was completed in 1898 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and to celebrate the victory of the local people for the right to access the moor. The tower is often referred to as \\"Darwen Tower\\". It is in height, and there is access to the top via the internal staircase from where Yorkshire, Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, Cumbria, and surrounding moorland can be seen. On rare occasions, in favourable weather conditions, it is possible see the Isle of Man to the northwest. The Peel Tower stands on Holcombe Hill as a memorial to the former Prime Minister. It is visible from miles around and its 148 steps can be climbed when the tower is open.  Wildlife and habitats  The West Pennine Moors and surrounding farmland have a rich and often undervalued level of biodiversity. On the unenclosed moorland, there are extensive areas of blanket bog on deep peat soils. Although much modified by grazing, burning and drainage, and in places dominated by purple moor-grass, characteristic species such as cotton-grass, heather, cross-leaved heath, cranberry and many species of sphagnum moss are well represented along with restricted plants such as bog rosemary. Elsewhere on the moorland there are areas of upland heath, acid grassland and upland flushes. Moorland birds include peregrine falcon, merlin, dunlin, wheatear, short-eared owl and golden plover. The moorlands of the West Pennine Moors have largely escaped the extensive planting of conifers suffered in some other parts of the northern uplands. At lower altitudes, the landscape is characterised by pasture and meadows enclosed by dry stone walls. Species-rich grassland is now restricted in both area and distribution, mostly to steeper valleys or cloughs where there are also some species-rich flushes, such as those at Oak Field SSSI. Some of the more improved pastures still retain populations of breeding wading birds such as Peewit or northern lapwing, snipe and curlew, and particularly in the fields and margins around Belmont Reservoir there are oystercatcher, redshank and common sandpiper. The Reservoir itself has nationally important populations of black-headed and Mediterranean gulls. Native broad-leaved woodland is also a habitat restricted almost entirely to valleys (cloughs), though there are examples of upland oak woodland, ash woodland and wet woodland dominated by alder and/or willow, such as at Longworth Clough SSSI. Along many of the reservoir valleys there are extensive areas of broad-leaved and conifer plantation such as around Roddlesworth Reservoir and Turton and Entwistle Reservoirs.

Serviciul de Informa≈£ii Externe (SIE, the Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service) is responsible for collecting information and carrying out intelligence activities abroad, although it also incorporates a small counter- intelligence unit that is tasked with the surveillance of foreign operatives on Romanian soil. Allegedly, in 1998 the Romanian Government decided that SIE needed a small anti-terrorist detachment, which could be used in capturing terrorist elements abroad, in cooperation with similar friendly structures from NATO.Magda Cri≈üan and Andrei BƒÉdin, Trupele Delta au ac≈£ionat pe DunƒÉre (\\"Delta Troops have acted on the Danube\\"), AdevƒÉrul, 24 February 2006. Accessed 27 March 2006. Thus, the detachment was created, with members taken mainly from Romania's national anti-terrorist authority, the Brigada AntiteroristƒÉ of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI, Romanian Intelligence Service). The small detachment was composed of only 23 operatives. Over the years, their number was decreased to 15 operatives. The Group's activities are unknown, and the unit was secret until its existence was revealed by the Romanian President Traian BƒÉsescu in a public speech, where he thanked the Group for taking part in the liberation of the three Romanian journalists held hostage in Iraq in 2005. Transcript of BƒÉsescu's 6 June 2005 press conference, in Romanian, on the official site of the Romanian presidency. Accessed. 27 March 2006. This created confusion among the written press in Romania, with some newspapers claiming the operators had actually been from Brigada AntiteroristƒÉ, while others were speaking of an entire \\"Anti-Terrorist Brigade of SIE\\". However, BƒÉsescu continued to praise the Group's activity on many occasions, including its alleged cooperation with similar NATO structures. It is highly unlikely that the President himself, who was the head of the Emergency Response Cell created to deal with the hostage crisis, was confused about the unit's very existence. Therefore, it is logical to assume that this unit truly exists, and that, according to BƒÉsescu and his hostage negotiation team, eight of its fifteen members were present in Baghdad during the hostage crisis, and managed to free all three hostages and bring them back to Romania. As an additional element to support this assumption, combatants with face- masks were seen disembarking from the Romanian Air Force C-130 aircraft which brought the hostages back to Bucharest.Magda Cri≈üan and Andrei Badin, Trupele Delta‚Ä¶, photo.

The mall is anchored by two Macy's locations, JCPenney, and Belk. History Opened in late February 1986, the mall was originally anchored by Rich's, Macy's and Sears. The Mall is almost identical to Gwinnett Place Mall. The Macy's store was the first in Atlanta not to have originally been part of the Atlanta-based Davison's chain, which became Macy's during its opening. The largest mall in the state when it opened, a fourth anchor, Mervyn's, joined the mall later in 1986. Town Center is part of a major retail hub in northern Cobb County, Georgia along Barrett Parkway. It is located between parallel parts of I-75 and I-575, just north of where the interstates meet or split from each other. The mall itself has seen several significant changes over the years. Built with a pad for an additional wing, a new wing extending north from the east wing was finally added in 1993 with a Parisian department store as the second to open in the Atlanta area with the first being at Phipps Plaza. This was also likewise done in 1995 at Gwinnett Place Mall with the same being as their third Atlanta location. This brought the store count at the mall up to 220 stores and the amount of anchor store up to five. No other mall in both the area and state had five anchors at the time except for North Point Mall, which opened also in 1993 and added the fourth Atlanta area Parisian three years later. Enormously successful and drawing away customers that originally shopped at older Cumberland and Cobb Center Malls, the mall was first renovated in 1995 but has never been expanded aside from the Parisian addition. Store consolidations and retractions, however, have varied the anchor line-up in recent years. First, in 1996, JCPenney took over the former location of Mervyn's, which pulled out of Georgia in late 1995 but at North Point as mentioned, Parisian replaced that store there. Second, Rich's and Macy's were merged into one store, prompting the closure of the three-story Macy's that had been there since the mall's original opening. However, part of the store was refurbished and is now used as a Macy's Furniture Gallery (originally a Rich's-Macy's Furniture Gallery) and now operates as Macy's Furniture Gallery, Macy's Furniture Clearance Center and Macy's Men's Store. Macy's now occupies the former Rich's location. Occupancy rates remain very high at the mall, and most major chain specialty stores are found in the mall. However, the mall is facing competition from all the big box stores on Barrett Parkway, two \\"lifestyle centers\\" that opened up on each end of the county and more upscale malls such as Lenox Square. However, on May 13, 2008, the mall announced a year-long renovation project and also added H&M.; The project was finished in May 2009 with new food court designs, family restrooms, children's play area, signage, and soft seating areas. On February 7, 2017, Macy's announced that Macy's Backstage will be opening inside Macy's in Spring 2017. On May 29, 2020, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 28 stores nationwide. The store closed on August 10, 2020.https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2020/07/12/total-sears-and- kmart-store-count-going-down-to-just-95/#1cc8215160eb Anchors =Current anchors= *Belk (2007‚Äìpresent) *JCPenney (1996‚Äìpresent) *Macy's (February 28, 1986 ‚Äì 2003, March 6, 2005-present) =Former anchors= *Mervyn's (1986-1995) *Parisian (1993-2007) *Rich's (February 28, 1986 ‚Äì March 6, 2005) *Sears (February 28, 1986 ‚Äì August 10, 2020) References https://www.tonetoatl.com/ External links * Town Center Community Improvement District.

The screenplay by Benn Levy and Tom Reed is based on the 1930 play Waterloo Bridge by Robert E. Sherwood. The film was remade in 1940 as Waterloo Bridge and as Gaby in 1956. Both remakes were made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which bought the 1931 version from Universal. Today, the rights to all three films are held by Warner Bros. and their subsidiary Turner Entertainment. Plot Lobby card Unable to find work in London at the height of World War I, American chorus girl Myra Deauville resorts to prostitution to support herself. She meets her clients on Waterloo Bridge, the primary entry point into the city for soldiers on military leave. During an air raid, she meets fellow American Roy Cronin, a member of the Canadian Army. Distracted from her original plans by an air raid, she makes no attempt to solicit Roy, and he remains naively unaware of her profession. After the raid is over, Roy escorts her to her apartment, and the two have dinner there. Describing herself simply as an unemployed chorus girl, Myra gains Roy's sympathy, and he offers to pay her overdue rent. After she rejects his offer and he departs, Myra returns to the streets. The following morning, Roy returns to visit her, and landlady Mrs. Hobley lets him into her apartment. There he meets Myra's friend and neighbor Kitty, who tells him Myra needs someone to love and protect her. Myra later berates Kitty for interfering and rejects her advice to marry Roy to ensure a better future for herself. Roy brings Myra to visit his family at their country estate, where he proposes to Myra, who later that night tells Roy's mother, Mary, the truth about herself. Mary is sympathetic but implores Myra not to marry Roy. The following morning, Myra slips away and returns to London by train. Eventually Roy visits her and asks her to explain her abrupt departure. Because he is on the verge of returning to the battlefields in France, he begs Myra to marry him immediately. She agrees, but escapes from her apartment through a window while he waits for her in the hallway. Seeking the rent, Mrs. Hobley enters, and believing Myra has run off to avoid her financial obligation, reveals her true profession to Roy. Although shocked, Roy searches for Myra and eventually finds her on Waterloo Bridge, where he tells her he still loves and wants to marry her. The military police insist Roy join a truck of departing soldiers or be considered a deserter, and once he secures Myra's promises to marry him upon his return, he departs. The air raid sirens sound, and as Myra seeks shelter, she is killed by a bomb. Cast * Mae Clarke as Myra * Douglass Montgomery (as Kent Douglass) as Roy Cronin * Doris Lloyd as Kitty * Frederick Kerr as Major Wetherby * Enid Bennett as Mrs Wetherby * Bette Davis as Janet Cronin * Ethel Griffies as Mrs Hobley * Rita Carlyle as The Old Woman (as Rita Carlisle) * Ruth Handforth as Augusta - the Maid Production Robert E. Sherwood had based his play on his own wartime experiences, including a chance meeting during a 1918 air raid with an American chorus girl turned streetwalker. The Broadway production opened on January 6, 1930 at the Fulton Theatre, where it ran for only 64 performances. Despite the fact it was neither a critical nor commercial success, film producer Carl Laemmle, Jr. considered it a prestige project and purchased the film rights for Universal Pictures. Having been impressed by the 1930 film Journey's End, Laemmle hired its director, James Whale, to helm Waterloo Bridge. Sherwood's play had evolved into a war film in the original screenplay, and Benn Levy was hired to restore it to a character drama, while Tom Reed provided \\"continuity and additional dialogue.\\" Stine, Whitney, and Davis, Bette, Mother Goddam: The Story of the Career of Bette Davis. New York: Hawthorn Books 1974. , pp. 12‚Äì13 Because Universal was undergoing financial problems, Laemmle budgeted the film at $252,000 budget and gave Whale a 26-day shooting schedule. Rose Hobart, under contract to Universal, was assigned the role of Myra Deauville but declined it when she learned the studio did not intend to renew her contract. She was replaced by Mae Clarke, a Columbia Pictures contract player now best known to audiences as the woman whose face was the target of half a grapefruit shoved into it by James Cagney in The Public Enemy. \\"I think Whale saw something I know I had then\\", Clarke later recalled, \\"and that was a basic confusion and insecurity I didn't mind projecting into my work.\\" She enjoyed working with the director, who \\"wanted to see what you thought of it,\\" she said. \\"He wouldn't say how to do it, he would tell you what was happening.\\" Less experienced co-star Kent Douglass, later known as Douglass Montgomery, required a great deal of attention from Whale, who shut down production for three days while he worked with the novice actor. Also in the cast was Bette Davis who, in the small role of Janet Cronin, was listed sixth out of nine in the opening creditshttps://ok.ru/video/1261892274928 and was ignored by all the critics. \\"Perfectly logical,\\" Davis later recalled. \\"I had about four lines ... I yearned all during shooting to play Myra. I could have!\\" Whale completed the film $50,000 under budget, and Laemmle was so impressed he gave the director the choice of any property the studio had in the planning stages. He selected Frankenstein and went on to become one of the leading directors at Universal. Censorship, remakes, and re-release Because of its controversial material, censor boards in Chicago, New York City, and Pennsylvania insisted extensive cuts be made to the film. When the Production Code was enforced in July 1934, it became impossible to re-release the original version of Waterloo Bridge. In 1939, MGM bought the rights to the property, and the following year released an adaptation starring Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor and directed by Mervyn LeRoy. The 1956 film Gaby, directed by Curtis Bernhardt and starring Leslie Caron and John Kerr, advanced the story's timeline to World War II and created a happy rather than tragic ending. After being stored in the studio vaults for 35 years, Waterloo Bridge was re-discovered in 1975, but a joint ownership agreement between MGM and Universal prevented it from being seen for another two decades. Critical reception Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times called the film \\"a praiseworthy picture\\" that \\"is somewhat sketchy in substance, but it is acted cleverly and there is imagination in the employment of the camera and the microphone.\\" He added, \\"It might have been even a more satisfactory production had Mr. Whale had full say as to the dialogue, for the lines from some of the cockney characters are occasionally a little forced. The whole narrative is an attenuated short story, with the result that parts of it are not especially interesting.\\" Billy Wilkerson of The Hollywood Reporter wrote \\"It is grown up entertainment, not sophisticated, but mature ... so moving and believable as to send any audience out talking and raving in appreciation.\\" Home media On December 5, 2006, Warner Home Video released the film, together with Baby Face and Red-Headed Woman, as part of a DVD box set titled TCM Archives ‚Äì Forbidden Hollywood Collection, Vol. 1.

It was established in 1834 in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne and served as the College of Medicine in connection with Durham University from 1851 to 1937 when it joined Armstrong College, to form King's College, Durham. In 1963 King's College became the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. The university now uses the name \\"Newcastle University\\". Collegium Medicum Novocastrense - the history of the Medical School, afterwards the Durham College of Medicine at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for forty years, from 1832 to 1872  Curriculum  The medical school follows a modern, integrated, systems-based curriculum, and was the first medical school in the country to operate an integrated medical curriculum. It operates in partnership with Durham University's medical school, which is based at the university's Queen's Campus. Students at both Newcastle and Durham study independently for the first two years, before all being assigned to one of four separate clinical base units for the third year. These base units are Tyneside, Northumbria, Wearside and Teesside. It is at these base units that the bulk of clinical teaching takes place. All students, including those from Durham, then go to Newcastle Medical School for their fourth year before returning to a base unit different from the one they attended in third year for their fifth and final year of university teaching. Again, this is an almost entirely clinical year. The medical school also offers an accelerated medical programme, intended for students who have a previous degree in a different (often unrelated) discipline. This lasts four years, the first year covering the same material as the first two years of the five-year course. Second year \\"accelerated\\" students are then taught alongside the third year students from the five-year programme. The medical school offers students the chance to intercalate a BSc in another area of study after the 2nd, 3rd or 4th year, either at Newcastle University or externally at another university. After, the 3rd and 4th years, the medical schools also offers students the opportunity to undertake a Master's degree or MPhil. Some students complete a PhD following the completion of an intercalated master's degree. After completing the extra year(s), students resume their medical studies.  Reputation and rankings  Newcastle Medical School consistently ranks as one of the top medical schools in the UK due to high levels of teaching and research; it is ranked in the top 10 UK medical schools by the Complete University Guide (8th), the Guardian (6th) and the Sunday Times (7th). It is the first institution in the UK to be given permission to pursue stem-cell research. The BMC Medicine journal reported medical graduates from Oxford, Cambridge and Newcastle performed better in postgraduate tests than any other medical school in the UK. Main building of the medical school As of 2020 the medical school admits some 367 students per year (including 26 from overseas) making it one of the largest medical schools in the UK. According to UCAS, Cambridge, Oxford and Newcastle are the most academically selective universities for entry to study medicine in the United Kingdom. During the 2020 admissions cycle for both the 4-year A101 graduate and 5-year A100 undergraduate MBBS course, there were 10 applicants for every place. Prospective students applying to the medical school for both the standard (5-year) and accelerated (4-year) programmes are required to sit the UCAT admission test. The most recent UCAT cut-off for invitation to interview for the A100 and A101 courses was 2730 and 2920 respectively for 2020 entry (scores in the 85th and 95th percentile of test- takers).  Malaysian campus branch  In 2008 the University announced that they were entering into an agreement to establish an international branch campus in Malaysia for the teaching of medical subjects. The development of the site in Johor, marks Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia (NUMed) as the 'anchor tenant' within the EduCity. Staff moved into the NUMed Malaysia buildings in May 2011, in preparation for students arriving in August. The Malaysian Bell's Court building features a section which is designed to look like the Arches in Newcastle upon Tyne. The International Campus offers MBBS, which is currently accredited by both the General Medical Council and Malaysian Medical Council and Undergraduate Degrees in Biomedical sciences. Both programmes lead to a Newcastle University degree, and are identical to the course in the UK. The MBBS programme is recognised across the globe, with the medical school listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools The main clinical teaching hospitals are Hospital Sultan Ismail and Hospital Sultanah Aminah in Johor Bahru, Hospital Sultanah Nora Ismail in Batu Pahat, Hospital Enche‚Äô Besar Hajjah Khalsom in Kluang and a number of community clinics. All teaching and examinations are conducted in English, with the use of translators in clinical settings if required. Opportunities exist for students to spend time in the UK Campus, both through Student Selected Components (SSC), electives and intercalation. There are currently over 700 students enrolled, from all over Malaysia and many countries of the world. There have been four cohorts of graduates from the MBBS programme (January 2018), with over 170 students. The Biomedical Sciences programme is a 2+1, with the final research-intensive year being conducted in the UK. It has graduated two cohorts of students to date. The Foundation in Science course opened in 2016, and students are guaranteed a place on the Biomedical Science or Medical degree programmes if they meet the academic criteria - in 2017 all met the criteria, and 86% chose to progress at NUMed. The Medical Society (MedSoc) Established in 1879, The Medical Society is the student society for all medical students at Newcastle. MedSoc is run by a committee of third year medical students, and tradition dictates you must be in this year to be elected.. As of May 2020, a Ratification Referendum is being held on whether the society should be affiliated with Newcastle University Student Union.  Deans and Pro-Vice-Chancellors  Following the merger of the College of Medicine with Armstrong College in 1937 the position of Dean of Medicine was created with a large degree of autonomy. A reorganisation of the University in 2002 led to this role being transferred to the Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Medical Sciences. = Deans of Medicine 1937‚Äì2002 = = Pro-Vice-Chancellors (Medical Sciences) from 2002 =  References   External links  * Medicine at Newcastle University * NUMed Malaysia (Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia) Medical schools in England Medical School Educational institutions established in 1834 1834 establishments in England ","title":"Newcastle University Medical School"},{"id":"4329982","text":"Sinagra can refer to: *Sinagra, Sicily, a town in the province of Messina on the island of Sicily in Italy *Sinagra, Western Australia, a suburb of Perth in Australia People with the surname * Adam Sinagra (born 1995), Canadian football quarterback * Anthony Sinagra (born 1940), American politician * Diego Sinagra (born 1986), Italian football player, son of Diego Maradona * Jack Sinagra (1950‚Äì2013), American politician * Vincenzo Sinagra, criminal ","title":"Sinagra"},{"id":"4329984","text":"In the 1820s, two English brothers, John Carter Allen (1795‚Äì1872) and Charles Manning Allen (1802‚Äì1880) adopted the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart, moved to Scotland, became Roman Catholics, and about 1839 began to claim that their father, Thomas Allen (1767‚Äì1852), a former Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, had been born in Italy the only legitimate child of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his wife Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern. They claimed that Thomas had, for fear of kidnapping or assassination, been brought secretly to England on a ship captained by their grandfather, Admiral John Carter Allen (1725-1800), and adopted by him. Thomas was thus, they claimed, ‚Äòde jure monarch of England in place of the then reigning sovereign Queen Victoria‚Äô.Sir Charles Petrie, The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807 (London, 1950) 189. ‚ÄòThey succeeded in fabricating around them an aura of bogus royalty which attracted the allegiance of a few romantic Jacobites in Victorian times‚Äô.James Lees-Milne, The last Stuarts (1984) page 230.

Vaughan, The last of the royal Stuarts: Henry Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York (1906) page 280 but it was as Sir Charles Petrie wrote ‚Äòproof of the hold which the House of Stuart has never ceased to exercise upon popular imagination in the British Isles, so that ... if a man were to declare himself the heir to the Yorkist or Tudor dynasty, he would attract but little attention, yet if he claim to be a Stuart he will find hundreds ready to believe him‚Äô.Sir Charles Petrie, The Jacobite movement: the last phase: 1716-1807 (London, 1950) 187. The brothers‚Äô two publications, Vestiarium Scoticum (Edinburgh, 1842) and Costume of the Clans (Edinburgh, 1843), described by the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper as ‚Äòshot through with pure fantasy and bare faced forgery‚Äô,‚ÄòInvention of tradition; the Highland tradition of Scotland‚Äô in Eric Hobsbawm and Terrence Ranger, eds., The invention of tradition (University of Cambridge, 1983) have been sources widely used by the tartan industry in Scotland.  Family Background  The brothers‚Äô grandfather, John Carter Allen (1725-1800), an admiral in the British navy, had three children: the above-named Lieutenant Thomas Allen (1767-1852), Jane or Jean Allen (c.1768-1829) who married Thomas Robinson, a widower, at Brighton in 1788, and Admiral John Allen (1771-1853). The three were named in John Carter Allen‚Äôs will, though he bequeathed only ¬£100 to Thomas and ¬£100 and a pair of silver candlesticks to Jane, leaving ¬£2,200 and the residue to John. This disparity caused comment and some have speculated that Thomas was illegitimate, but an income had been guaranteed to him under his marriage settlement in 1792. However, additional research in 2014 showed that John Carter Allen did not marry until 1780 and that his three children were all illegitimate, born in a period in which he held no commission.John Charnock, Biographia Navalis, vol. 6 (1798) 288. The three were named ‚Äònatural children of John Cator Allen‚Äô in the twelfth of sixteen codicils to the will of Elizabeth Arnold, his first wife‚Äôs mother, dated in 1788 and proved in 1789. She left them twenty guineas each and ¬£1,000 to their father.Anthony Camp, New light on the Sobieski Stuarts, in Genealogists' Magazine, vol. 31, no. 8 (December 2014) 298-306. The identity of their mother(s) has not been found. There was much tension in the family later and at one time the youngest son, John, was heard to say of Thomas, ‚Äòhe is no brother of mine‚Äô.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie (1909) 102. John Carter Allen himself had been baptised at St Dunstan in the West in 1724/5, the son of Carter Allen (1700-1734), an attorney in the parish of St Clement Eastcheap in the City of London, who had married Emma Hay or Hays at St Giles, Camberwell, in 1724. These details also were not known until 2014. Contemporaries of John Carter Allen had said at his death in 1800 that the late Lord Hillsborough (who died in 1793 and for whom John Carter Allen‚Äôs younger brother William Allen (1729-1811) had worked as an office clerk) had said that ‚Äòhe had a claim to the title of Erroll ... as being descended from the old Earl Hay in the male line‚Äô,Letter of William Scott in Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine, 1800, vol. i, page 1021. a worthless statement as the peerage had become extinct in the male line in 1717,The Complete Peerage, vol. v (1926) pages 99-100 but believed by Thomas who added Hay to his name. However, the uncertainty of their descent and the romantic nature of the various claims surrounding them greatly influenced the two brothers. They also added Hay to their names and in 1822 the eldest son, as John Hay Allan, published a Genealogical table of the Hays, from William de Haya, cupbearer to Malcolm IV, 1170, down to 1840, with all the branches (Edinburgh, 1840), though his descent is not shown in the book and the parentage of Emma Hay or Hays has not been found.  Thomas Allen  Although frequently referred to as Captain Allen, Thomas Allen never attained that rank. He retired from the Navy as a Lieutenant in 1798 and his subsequent history and movements and the extent to which he approved of his sons‚Äô later claims, are all far from clear. He had married Catherine Matilda Manning, a daughter of the Rev. Owen Manning the historian of Surrey, at Godalming in 1792. They had three children: (1) John Carter Allen, born at Oystermouth, Glamorgan, 4 August 1795 and baptised there, 5 October 1795; (2) Matilda Allen, born at Oystermouth, Glamorgan, 18 October 1799 and baptised there, 12 January 1800; and (3) Charles Manning Allen, born at Rotherfield Grays, Oxfordshire, 4 July 1802 and baptised there, 3 August 1802. Under their marriage settlement the couple and their future children had a life interest and income from properties in Mare Street and Well Street, Hackney. However, sometime about 1807 Thomas Allen formed a connection with a much younger woman, Ann, who was born in Hackney about 1790, and by whom he had five illegitimate children between 1808 and 1829. Her surname is usually given as Salmon (as she had a niece of that name living with her in 1851) but the death certificates of several of her children show it as Burton. The first child, William (died 1878), who used the surname MacGarrow, claimed to have been born in Glamorganshire or Wales but his baptism and the exact whereabouts of Thomas and Ann at this time have not been determined. It is said that from 1816 to 1829 Thomas was based at Boulogne, ‚Äòa safe refuge for English debtors‚Äô.Notes and Queries, vol. 197 (1952) 456 He certainly had increasing financial problems and in February 1817 he unsuccessfully appealed to the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Erskine, for help with the possible sale of some of the property held in trust under his marriage settlement. A last minute attempt to come to an arrangement about it failed and on 17 January 1818, as the result of an action in the Court of Kings Bench against Thomas and his son John (in a plea of debt for ¬£300 and damages by James Barstow), Thomas was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison. He was released by order of the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors on 20 December 1819 but continued to live in fear of his creditors. His reticence and desired anonymity was probably due to his illegitimacy and his relationship with Anne, but it was complicated by the later statements of his two legitimate sons on whom he looked with some displeasure. He had little in common with them and they in turn looked down on Anne as ‚Äòof much lower rank in life‚Äô than their mother.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 20-21, 102-3. Thomas and Anne apparently had their last child, Gilbert Hay Allen (1829-1902), in south London in 1829 and in 1839 Thomas was in hiding at 10 Portland Place North, Clapham Road, Lambeth, as ‚ÄòMr Salmond‚Äô.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 102. In the 1841 census he was entered at that address as ‚ÄòThomas MacGaradh‚Äô, aged 70, and born in Scotland. He ostensibly registered the death of his wife Catherine Matilda at Portland Place North, on 14 February 1841, again calling himself Thomas MacGaradh, but describing her as ‚ÄòMatilda Manning, widow‚Äô. When the census was taken a few months later Anne was living with him at this address as Anne MacGaradh. MacGaradh was, his sons said, a war-cry of the Hay family but it was entirely their creation and it seems likely that they or Anne were responsible for their father‚Äôs statements. The death of Catherine Matilda in 1841 did, however, eventually allow the purchase by Charles of the family‚Äôs life interest in the trust properties from his father‚Äôs bankruptcy assignees. It is said that Thomas ‚Äòspent the last seven years of his life in bed‚Äô,John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 89, 102. confined to his room at 22 Henry Street, Pentonville. He was there as ‚ÄòJohn Salmon‚Äô when the Census was taken in 1851 and he died at that address as Thomas Hay Allen on 14 February 1852. He was buried in that name at St Giles in the Fields, Middlesex, on 23 February 1852, aged 84. His son, Charles, in order to distance himself from him, wrote in 1877 that his father was called James and had died in 1839. Some believed that he was buried at Old St Pancras, Middlesex (as stated in the introduction to the 1892 edition of his sons‚Äô The costume of the clans, xvii, and repeated in the Dictionary of National Biography) and Beveridge added ‚Äòbut the stone said to have been placed over his grave cannot now be found‚Äô.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 89-90.  Sobieski Stuarts  No detail of the educations of Thomas‚Äôs two sons has been found though they claimed that the secret of their royal descent had been revealed to them about 1811, that they had fought for Napoleon at Dresden (in August 1813), Leipzig (October 1813) and Waterloo (June 1815) and had learned Gaelic in London. The youngest, Charles Manning Allen, who we now know was not born until 1802, married at St George, Hanover Square, on 9 October 1822, Anna Gardiner, who had an income from property in Ireland and was the widow of Major Charles Gardiner (1780-1818), the childless only son of General William Gardiner (1748-1806; DNB) former British Minister in Brussels and Warsaw and younger brother of Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy (1745-1798). The marriage was publicised as that of ‚ÄòCharles Stuart Hay Allen‚Äô. However, the couple moved to Scotland after marriage and their first child, Anna Marie Stuart, born 27 July 1823, was baptised at Edinburgh and there recorded in the surname Hay on 20 October 1823. Thomas‚Äôs eldest son, John Carter Allen, calling himself John Hay Allan, had apparently already been in Scotland for some time and in 1822 he published a volume of poems, Bridal of Caolchairn, and other poems (London, 1822) dedicated to the Duke of Argyll, and revealing a fair knowledge of that county but including several allusions to his claimed descent from the Hays of Errol. From 1826 to 1829, John joined his brother Charles at Windy Hill (now Milton Brodie), Alves, Morayshire, under the patronage of the Earl of Moray.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 25. The brothers were at Logie House, Edinkillie, Morayshire, from 1829 to 1838,John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 25. when John used the name Stuart Allan. As John Sobieski Stuart he and his brother, calling themselves ‚Äògrandsons to the Pretender‚Äô, had visited Ireland in May 1836.The Times, 9 May 1836, quoting the Glasgow Chronicle (John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 37-38). Lord Lovat then built ‚Äòan antique shooting lodge‚Äô for them on Eilean Aigas, an islet in the river Beauly, near Eskadale, Inverness, and there, always wearing the Stuart tartan, they held court from 1838 to 1845, attending the catholic church at Eskadale and being known as ‚Äòthe Princes‚Äô.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 93. The house is described as ‚Äòa very elegant mansion of the Elizabethan style‚Äô in the New Statistical Account of Scotland (1842).John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 93. On 18 October 1845, John married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, Georgina, eldest surviving daughter of Edward Kendall, J.P., of Austrey, Warwickshire.Burke‚Äôs Landed Gentry (1858) page 643. She had, he told Robert Chambers, ‚Äòonly ten thousand pounds, unless she survives her two sisters, who equally share with her‚Äô,John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 100. but the couple then moved to live in London.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 27. In his letter to Chambers just prior to the marriage John asked for a loan of ¬£100 until his wife‚Äôs dividends were paid but when his father-in-law eventually died in March 1872 the total estate was sworn at ‚ÄòUnder ¬£1,500‚Äô and later as ‚ÄòUnder ¬£2,000‚Äô.Principal Probate Registry, 10 June 1872. Thomas Allen‚Äôs daughter Matilda had married Henry Timothy Boisquet de la Fleuriere, at St Alphege, Greenwich, in 1818, and their son, Napoleon de la Fleuriere (1823-1881), was baptised at St Margaret, Westminster, in 1823. According to Matilda, her husband had been in the French service from 1804 to 1814 and from 1832 to 1853, but had been taken prisoner at Trafalgar and did not return to France until 1830. In 1835 using the name Matilda McFleur she then married at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, one Alexander McCaskery (died 1870), a police serjeant in Fulham, by whom she had at least three children. This seems not to have stopped her from soliciting the Cross of an Officer of the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur for Henry Timothy in 1854. Her date of death has not been found. In Scotland the brothers ‚Äòconducted themselves as members of a reigning dynasty who wished to preserve their incognito‚ÄôSir Charles Petrie, The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807 (London, 1950) 191. and their claims ‚Äòwere accorded a level of credence‚Äô (as the Dictionary of National Biography said at the end of the century) by ‚Äòmen of rank and intelligence, such as the tenth Earl of Moray (1771-1848), the fourteenth Lord Lovat (1802-1875), the late Marquis of Bute (1793-1848), Thomas Dick-Lauder (1784-1848), and Robert Chambers (1802-1871)‚Äô. However, the delusional John Sobieski Stuart, in spite of his expressed desire to withdraw from the public eye, went so far as to claim, in a letter to Chambers, that he and his brother had ‚Äòa body of supporters ready to push their claims to the uttermost‚Äô.Sir Charles Petrie, The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807 (London, 1950) 191-2].  The Claims  In June 1829 the elder brother had shown a manuscript, containing tartan patterns and dated in 1721, to Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder who was much impressed by it, but Sir Walter Scott warned Dick-Lauder that the brothers ‚Äòare men of warm imaginations ... of much accomplishment but little probity ‚Äì that is, in antiquarian matters‚Äô.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 59. Sir Walter Scott, who died in 1832, had rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, saying that the ‚Äòidea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date‚Äô. On behalf of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries he was shown a transcript of part of the brothers‚Äô manuscript but from its language alone ‚Äòindignantly declared his conviction that the MS itself must be an absolute fabrication‚Äô.Quarterly Review, vol. 81, June-September 1847, page 64. Scott remembered seeing one of the brothers wearing the badge of High Constable of Scotland (as the Earls of Errol were), ‚Äòwhich he could have no more right to wear than the Crown‚Äô.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 24. Dick- Lauder was himself an author of historical romances and had put up a monument to the Lauder family in Edinburgh showing a quite spurious descent, but one ‚Äòas he wished it to be‚Äô.Complete Baronetage (vol. 4, 1904) page 362, note a. However, calling himself John Sobieski Stuart, the elder brother then produced the lavish Vestiarium Scoticum (Edinburgh, 1842), costing ten guineas, which purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a better version of the 1721 manuscript, this one being dated to 1571. This John claimed had passed through the hands of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to his father Thomas, though his father‚Äôs letter on the subject, addressed to him as Ian and signed ‚ÄòJ. T. Stuart Hay‚Äô in 1829,John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 60. seems likely to be bogus. Considerable interest in clans and tartans continued, and the following year, under the name John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, John and his brother Charles published The costume of the clans: with observations upon the literature, arts, manufactures and commerce of the Highland and Western Isles during the middle ages; and the influence of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries upon their present condition (Edinburgh, 1843) which, as noted above, received intense criticism. Using the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart the brothers followed this with their Tales of the Century, or sketches of the romances of history between 1745 and 1845 (Edinburgh, 1847) in which they provided three scenes of the birth, youth and marriage of a man known by the Gaelic name of Iolair dhearg or the Red Eagle, said to have been recounted by an aged Jacobite in exile, Dr Beaton. After being called to attend the birth of a son to a young woman in Tuscany in 1773, where portraits of the Old and Young Pretenders were prominent, Beaton claimed to have been sworn to secrecy, but later to have seen a baby taken on board a British warship, HMS Albina, under Commodore O‚ÄôHaloran. In the second tale, some years later, the grown child arrived in the Western Highlands of Scotland where, although called O‚ÄôHaloran and thought to be the son of the former captain, he is known as The Red Eagle and addressed as a prince. In the third tale, which takes place in the Peak District of Derbyshire, a traveller meets The Red Eagle who, after various adventures, marries at Berwick, Catharine Bruce, the daughter of a Derbyshire local landowner. The gravestone of Charles Edward Louis Casimir Stuart and Lady Alice Hay shows the pretended title of Comte d'Albanie The stories, taken together, were designed in a roundabout way to suggest that the brothers‚Äô supposed grandfather was in reality Commodore O‚ÄôHaloran, and that the child, their father (known as Thomas Allen), was in reality the child of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Louise of Stolberg, and thus de jure monarch of England. Although the tales were ‚Äòcopiously augmented with historical notes‚Äô,Hugh Douglas, Bonnie Prince Charlie in love (1995) 218. in truth Admiral John Carter Allen did not command any ship in 1773, being on half-pay from 1771 to 1775. A strong attack on both the Vestiarium Scoticum and their Tales of the Century then followed and the brothers ancestral claims, which had received little acceptance in England, and the Vestiarium were completely discredited in a devastating anonymous article ‚ÄòThe heirs of the Stuarts‚Äô, believed to be by George Skene (1807-1875), Professor of Law at Glasgow University, which appeared in the Quarterly Review, vol. 81 (June-September 1847) 57-85. He concluded about the Vestiarium that ‚Äòthis pretended MS of the sixteenth century is an absolute fabrication, and of no authority whatever‚Äô and about the Tales that Prince Charles Edward Stuart ‚Äòcould have had no possible reason for concealing the birth of an heir‚Äô; any idea that he had ‚Äòleft a legitimate male progeny‚Äô was ‚Äòthe silliest of dreams‚Äô. In 1848 John attempted A reply to the Quarterly Review upon the Vestiarium Scoticum (Edinburgh, 1848) and the two brothers then produced Lays of the deer forest: with sketches of olden and modern deer-hunting (2 vols. Edinburgh, 1848), but three of their benefactors, the Earl of Moray, the Marquis of Bute and Thomas Dick-Lauder, died that year and the brothers were now so discredited that Charles took his wife to Prague where their son was in the Austrian armyJohn Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 101; Dictionary of National Biography. and John followed soon after.John Beveridge, The Sobieski Stuarts (1909) 27. John‚Äôs wife died at Presburg in 1862 and the brothers did not return to England until 1868. In London they then occupied themselves with research, being well-known figures in the British Museum, wearing Highland dress or military tunics and using pens embellished with gold coronets. John, who called himself ‚ÄòThe Chevalier John Sobieski Stewart‚Äô, in 1871 described himself as Count d‚ÄôAlbanie, Colonel of Hussars, and said that he was born at Versailles, France. He died without issue at 52 Stanley Street, St George Hanover Square, 13 February 1872, aged 74, and was buried at Eskadale. His widow died at Bath in 1888. John's brother Charles then assumed the title of Count of Albany and was active in Catholic circles in London but died from the same address (by then called 52 Alderney Street) on a trip to France on the Steamer Rainbow near Bordeaux, 24 December 1880, and was buried at Eskadale. His son Charles Edward Stuart Allen, the last self-styled Count of Albany, died in Jersey in 1882. He had married Lady Alice Hay (1835-1881), a daughter of the 18th Earl of Erroll, but they had no issue.

There are currently about 670 students in Presentation College. The school is housed in a modern building opened in late 2012, which replaced an older building constructed in the 1960s. Outdoor facilities include a floodlit grass rugby field, astro turf soccer pitch, a basketball court, and several other playing fields. The school is located on Putland Road just off the main Vevay Road, next to the Queen of Peace church. It is accessible via Dublin Bus routes 45, 84, 145 and 184. The Main Building cost ‚Ç¨30.7 Million To build and was funded by the department of education History The 1960s building from the front, at the senior rugby pitch Presentation College Bray was established in 1921 by the Presentation Brothers. Pres Bray originally served as a primary and secondary school, but the primary school was closed in the late 1980s; the old school building is now the home of the Bray Adult Education Centre. Central to the school's history was its connections to the Presentation Brothers. On 5 September 1921, the doors of Bray Head House were opened to admit 52 new students to The Presentation College. In 1924 outhouses at the back of the house were refurbished to provide extra classrooms and a science laboratory. In 1957 a new college building was opened. In 1971 this was replaced with a new Secondary School with a swimming pool and the 1957 building became the Junior School. In 1983 the Edmund Rice Building was opened. It includes a Science Laboratory, Geography Room, Career's Suite and other specialist rooms. In the late 1980s the Junior School closed; as this had been the last arm of the fee- paying aspect of the college, the school was now a wholly publicly funded secondary school. The last Brother left in the early 2000s after the Brothers closed the monastery at the school. In 2010, the Presentation Schools Trust took over trusteeship of the school from the Presentation Brothers. In August 2011, staff and students (600) moved the short distance to the new Presentation College building. The 1971 building was handed over to the builders in June for demolition to provide the site for a new Sports Hall. School Buildings Having worked on the project for over ten years the Board of Management of Presentation College Bray was given authorisation in January 2009 to proceed to seek tenders for construction of a new school. The builders came on site in early January 2010 and had the entire project substantially completed by February 2012. The work was done in four phases, the new school, demolition of the 1971 building, building a new sports hall and refurbishment of the Edmund Rice Building. The new building has 16 classrooms, 8 specialist rooms, administration, assembly areas, a library and a staff room. It is a state of the art educational facility. The contract cost was in excess of ‚Ç¨13 million plus VAT. Curriculum Boys at Pres Bray sit the Junior Certificate syllabus for their first three years at the school, and the Leaving Certificate syllabus for their last two. In between the two courses is an optional extra, Transition Year, affording students the opportunity to study subjects and topics not present on the exam syllabi. Subjects studied include:Subjects .

Romania is divided into 41 counties (jude≈£e) plus Bucharest. Each county (jude≈£) is centered on a municipality. Each one of the 41 municipalities has a main police headquarters for that county. Starting in the 1990s, the municipalities' police sections created Rapid Intervention detachments, to participate in operations that could pose a life-threatening risk to the officers involved in carrying them out. Deta≈üamentul de Interven≈£ii ≈üi Ac≈£iuni Speciale (DIAS, Special Actions and Interventions Detachment). DIAS groups were formed in all 41 municipalities, as well as in Bucharest. In 1999, however, Constantin Dudu Ionescu, who then headed the Ministry of Administration and Interior (MAI), signed the order for creating a much larger organization, called Serviciul de Poli≈£ie pentru Interven≈£ie RapidƒÉ (SPIR). SPIR was basically a much-enlarged DIAS, which was now composed of several teams, plus logistics and support structures. In November 2001, all 41 municipalities were obliged to change the names of their special detachments from DIAS; most were renamed to DPIR. Although all municipalities have their own DPIR teams, in some of them the detachments have different names. In the city of Bistri≈£a for example, the combatants still wear uniforms marked with DIAS, while in BacƒÉu the detachments are called DIR (not to be confused with an elite unit from the Ministry of Defense, Deta≈üamentul de Interven≈£ie RapidƒÉ). In Piatra Neam≈£, the team acts under the designation SIR, and is an entire Service, similar to SPIR (Serviciul de Poli≈£ie pentru Interven≈£ie RapidƒÉ) in Bucharest. To avoid confusion, all detachments which are under the command of the municipalities are practically referred to as DPIR, while the service in the capital city of Bucharest is referred to as SPIR. In each municipality, DPIR is composed by the combatant detachment DIAS and the EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) detachment DIR. In Bucharest, SPIR is composed by several detachments, which include the DIAS and DIR. Therefore, although Romanian newspapers and TV stations have unanimously adopted the names DPIR/SPIR for the action teams, the population and personal websites/blogs still use the nomination DIAS. Depending on point of view (DIAS being incorporated into DPIR/SPIR), they are both halfway correct. In the rest of the country, DPIR is composed by several units including EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), dog unit, riot control and hostage rescue. The units train daily in unarmed/armed combat, rapid intervention shooting, building searches, aircraft, marine, railway firearms intervention skills. The unit members are selected individually and are tested thoroughly throughout their careers. Most of the unit team members are frequently cross trained with other similar detachments including visitors from overseas police forces. Romania joined the EU in 2007, the DPIR's have been better funded and supplied with the latest equipment. Selection for the DPIR is extremely vigorous and only the most determined are accepted for continuation training. Recently in 2008 there have been joint training exercises with the GSPI, in 2009 they have also been involved in close protection, internal security, hazardous warrant and counter terrorist operations.

Built-in 1877-1878 as the third courthouse in the city, it is noted for a ghostly image that can be seen in one of its garret windows. This is claimed to be the face of freedman Henry Wells from 1878. According to a common version of the lies told, Wells was arrested in January 1878 on suspicion of burglary and arson, and lynched by a white mob soon after his arrest. He was alleged to have burned down the second courthouse in 1876 (built to replace one destroyed in 1865 by Union forces during the Civil War). Accounts in the story do not conform to historic facts; for instance, the windows were not installed until February through March 1878, so they could not contain his image. This period was one of the continuing social and racial tensions. In 1877, the federal government ended Reconstruction and withdrew its troops from the South. White Democrats had regained control of state legislatures and passed measures to impose white supremacy. Wells was arrested in January 1878 and charged with the courthouse burning two years before. A local newspaper reported that Wells died of wounds after being shot while fleeing arrest for robbery in January 1878; he reportedly confessed to burning the courthouse before dying. A total of 15 African Americans were lynched in Pickens County, many in the courthouse square, from 1877 to 1917. This was the fifth-highest total of any county in the state. A mass lynching was committed by a white crowd who fatally shot four black men and a black woman in their cells in September 1893. They were suspects in the burning of a cotton gin owned by a white man. Origins of the Wells story The story of Wells' face in the courthouse window seems to have been a conflation through the myth of two historic events, that of the lynching of African American Nathaniel Pierce, and that of the arrest and shooting of Henry Wells. He later confessed to burning down the courthouse, likely under coercion, and died of his wounds. White guilt over the lynching may have contributed to the account of Wells cursing the town and threatening they would be haunted by him. This period was one of turmoil, as the federal government was withdrawing the last of its troops from the south, formally ending Reconstruction. White Democrats had already regained control of the state legislature and on the local level, white minorities used racial violence to impose and maintain white supremacy. As the 19th century progressed, the rate of lynchings rose, mostly directed at black men. According to the West Alabamian, which was Carrollton's only newspaper at the time of the events, Nathaniel Pierce was being held on charges of murder when, on September 26, 1877, an armed mob forced their way into the jail where he was being held, took him outside the city, and lynched him. Pierce's lynching was not reported as having anything to do with the burning of the courthouse. The whites in town already suspected Henry Wells and an accomplice, Bill Buckhalter, of the arson. A story in the West Alabamian on December 13, 1876, said that Wells and Buckhalter were also suspected of robbing a store on the night in 1876 when the courtroom was burned. The newspaper reported that stolen merchandise from the store was found in their homes. But that supports their part in the robbery, not arson. Buckhalter was arrested in January 1878. He confessed to the burglary and blamed Wells for the burning of the courthouse. Wells was caught a few days later. When confronted by the police, he tried to flee and was shot twice. He confessed to burning the courthouse, likely under coercion, including beatings. He died from his wounds five days later. These two events appeared to have been combined into the commonly told myth of how a face appeared in the courthouse window, but neither Pierce nor Wells could have been the \\"face in the window.\\" Both Pierce and Wells died before the windows were installed in the new courthouse. The West Alabamian reported that windows were being installed in the courthouse on February 20, 1878. These windows were the windows in the main courtroom, which were the first windows installed to prepare for a court session scheduled in the middle of March. The garret windows, including the one with the ghostly face, were not installed until weeks after Wells' death. Face in the courthouse window What follows is the commonly told myth of how the face was etched into the window. On November 16, 1876, the people of Carrollton, Alabama watched as their courthouse burned to the ground. The Pickens County Courthouse had been a source of pride for them. Their first courthouse had been burned down by invading Union Army troops during the American Civil War. In the difficult days of the Reconstruction, when materials were scarce and money was even scarcer, rebuilding the courthouse seemed to be an impossible task. Yet, through hard work and deep personal sacrifices by residents, the courthouse was rebuilt. It stood as a symbol of defiance in the face of defeat by the Union. Fewer than twelve years after Union troops had set fire to the town's first courthouse, the new one burned in 1876. Some said it was a burglary gone wrong. Even as work began on a third courthouse, the townspeople demanded vengeance for the arson. Despite the lack of circumstantial evidence, they identified Henry Wells as a suspect; he was a freedman who lived near the town. Henry Wells was said to have a horrible temper, and he had been involved in several brawls. People said he constantly carried a straight razor and was not afraid to use it. Despite these rumors, however, there was only vague circumstantial evidence against him in the burning of the courthouse. But it was Alabama in 1878, and Henry Wells was a black man accused of burning down a symbol of town pride. He was charged and arrested on four counts: arson, burglary, carrying a concealed weapon and assault with intent to murder. He was taken to the sheriff's office, located inside the newly completed courthouse, to await trial. As word spread through the town of Wells' arrest, the sheriff could sense trouble brewing. As the first few drunken men began heading toward the courthouse, the sheriff took Wells to its high garret and told him to keep quiet. But as the angry mob gathered below, Wells' fear got the best of him. He went to the window and looked down on the crowd. He yelled defiantly, \\"I am innocent. If you kill me, I am going to haunt you for the rest of your lives!\\" Just then, a bolt of lightning struck nearby, flashing the image of Wells' face, contorted with fear, to the crowd below. The lynch mob forced its way into the courthouse, and took their victim outside, even as he continued to proclaim his innocence. They killed him. Early the next morning, as a member of the lynch mob passed by the courthouse, he happened to glance up at the garret window. He was shocked to see Wells' face looking down at him, just as it had the night before when it had been illuminated by the flash of lightning. He rubbed his eyes and cursed his hangover, but when he looked back up, there was Wells. He screamed, and as others arrived, they all remembered Wells' prediction. \\"If you kill me, I am going to haunt you for the rest of your lives!\\" The face remains in the courthouse window to this very day. No amount of washing has been able to remove it. On at least one occasion, it is said that every window pane in the courthouse was broken by a severe hailstorm; every pane, that is, except that with Wells' face. Another local version of this story is that while Wells was awaiting trial for being falsely accused of raping a white woman (a common accusation in lynchings), a lightning storm brewed, and an angry mob gathered below to lynch him, and he told them, \\"If you lynch me, you will forever see my face.\\" At this time lightning struck the very window in which he was standing. From that day forward, no amount of washing, or replacing that window, has been able to remove his face. The image on the window A historical sign erected in 1974 near the courthouse tells the story of the image in the window. The Alabama Historical Association erected a historic marker in 1974 telling the role of the courthouse and the myth of Henry Wells' face in the window. The image on the window is easily seen, although it appears to be more a face from some angles than from others. It is said that the image is only visible from outside the courthouse; from inside the pane appears to be a normal pane of glass. Since the photo was taken, the city of Carrollton has installed a reflective highway sign with an arrow pointing to the pane where the image appears. There are permanent binoculars installed across the street from the window for those who wish to get a closer look. In 2001, the courthouse was threatened with demolition, to be replaced with a contemporary facility. The window with the face image was covered with a piece of plywood spray-painted with a smiley face. Due to a public campaign to save the image, the courthouse is being renovated as funds become available. Racial aspects of the story The legend is related to the racism and white racial terrorism in Alabama during and especially after the Reconstruction Era, including numerous lynchings through the early 20th century. According to a 2015 study, Pickens County had 15 lynchings after Reconstruction; the last was committed before 1917; this is the fifth-highest total of any county in the state.\\"Supplement: Lynchings by County/ Alabama: Pickens\\", 3rd edition , from Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror, 2015 (3rd edition), Equal Justice Institute, Montgomery, Alabama Among these terrorist events was a mass lynching of five African Americans on September 14, 1893. A white mob stormed the county jail in Carrollton and shot to death in their cells Paul Archer, Will Archer, Emma Fair, Ed Guyton, and Paul Hill, freedmen (and one freedwoman) who had been arrested on charges of burning down the mill and gin house of a white man. No trial had been held. Two weeks before that Joe Floyd had also been lynched in Carrollton, without trial.Lynching in Carrollton, Alabama, 14 September 1893, Equal Justice Initiative; accessed 25 August 2016 John Harding Curry, who worked as a probate judge in the courthouse, recalls being concerned during the 20th-century civil rights demonstrations in Alabama of the late 1960s and early 1970s that someone might damage the courthouse window, as it could be seen to symbolize an era of terrible racism. However, although the town had some instances of race-related vandalism, the window was never touched. As Alan N. Brown has recounted it, another probate judge agreed to tell folktales to the 5th-grade class from a black school in Birmingham. Although he had never recounted the Wells story to a black audience, he told the students the story about the face in the courthouse window, ending his tale with a moral; \\"You might ask what that face in the courthouse is saying,\\" he told the students. \\"It says to me, 'Don't ever let this happen again!'\\" He asked the students if they had any questions. One little boy raised his hand and asked, \\"How do you know that's a black man up there?\\"Alan N. Brown, \\"Pickens County Courthouse\\", 2001, University of West Alabama; accessed 26 August 2016 Representation in other media Some version of this story was formed in the years after installation of the courthouse windows, and repeated in oral histories. In the later 20th century, the mythic account was included in compilations of ghost stories and folk tales published by whites. In this period of more than 80 years after events, separate events had repeatedly been combined into one myth: Henry Wells' story was included in Kathryn Tucker Windham's book of Alabama ghost stories, 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey (1969); Ghost Stories from the American South (1985), edited by W.K. McNeil; and Phantom Army of the Civil War and Other Southern Ghost Stories (1997), edited by Frank Spaeth and selected from FATE magazine. In Patricia McKissack's The Dark-Thirty: Southern Tales of the Supernatural, the story \\"Justice\\" features similar indelible images appearing on windows and features a lynching in its plot (although the motive and the details of the crime are very different from the Wells myth). In 2009 First National Bank of Central Alabama commissioned a play about the myth related to Henry Wells, the burning of the second courthouse, and the window image in the new courthouse from playwright Barry Bradford. Beginning in April 2010, his play The Face in the Courthouse Window has been produced each spring in the courtroom of the Courthouse., Courthouse Window All proceeds from the play go toward the preservation of the Courthouse.

It is driven by the head of water created by Mapledurham Lock and Weir, on the River Thames. The mill was built in the 15th century, and further extended in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. It is a grade II* listed building and is preserved in an operational state. The mill also houses a micro hydro-electric power station, using a Archimedes' screw turbine to generate electricity for sale to the National Grid. The turbine produces some 83.3 Kilowatts, which is sufficient to power about 140 homes.  History  A mill was already present at Mapledurham at the time of the Domesday Book. The central section of the current mill building dates back to the 15th century. Originally the mill had a single water wheel on the river side of the building. The mill was increased in size in the 1670s, and a leat was constructed to drive a second water wheel on the village side. It is this second wheel which is still in use today. In 1690, the mill was leased to James Web for the sum of ¬£60 per year. Around 1700, he expanded the mill again to allow him to install the equipment to produce the refined flour that was becoming popular. His son Daniel Webb took over from him in 1726 at a rent of ¬£100. In 1747, Thomas Atrum took over the mill at a rent of ¬£150, which was raised to ¬£205 in 1776. In 1777 a barn was added on the mill island, and a wharf built to allow the mill to supply flour to the London market by barge. However, by 1784 Thomas Atrum was bankrupt. The mill continued to flourish, and as late as 1823 plans were drawn up to rebuild the mill in classical style. The advent of cheap imported flour from North America damaged the mill's prosperity, but it remained in use until just after the Second World War. On 24 October 1951, the watermill was designated as a grade II* listed building. It was restored and brought back into use in 1980. In 2011, work started on the installation of a new Archimedes' screw turbine on the river side of the watermill in order to generate electricity. This was built to provide power to Mapledurham House, and replaced a turbine installed in the 1920s that was no longer functional. At the time the turbine was inaugurated in 2012, it was the most powerful turbine on the River Thames, and the largest of its type in the country.  Admission and access  The mill is located in the grounds of Mapledurham House, and like the house is open to visitors on weekend and bank holiday afternoons from April to September. The water mill is normally working on opening days, and visitors can visit both main floors of the mill, and see (and feel) its operation. Admission is charged, and joint tickets are available that allow admission to both house and mill. Access is by car down the narrow and steep lane that is Mapledurham village's only road connection, or by a boat service that runs from Thameside Promenade in Reading on all opening days.  Media coverage  The mill building is best known, and has gained worldwide recognition, for being featured on the cover of heavy metal band Black Sabbath's self-titled debut album in 1970. The watermill is also known for its starring role in the 1976 film of The Eagle Has Landed, where the mill leat is the scene of the dramatic rescue of a local girl by a German paratrooper that results in the unmasking of Steiner and his men. The mill was used as a filming location on the Children's Film Foundation Exploits at West Poley (1985) Starring Jonathan Jackson, Charlie Condou Brenda Fricker and Sean Bean. The mill appears in the introductory credits to the BBC television programme, Richard Hammond's Blast Lab, as the supposed hidden location of the underground lab. The mill also appears in the Midsomer Murders episode The Fisher King (season 7; episode 3), as the scene for the discovery of a body.

Appearance  The Eurasian least shrew weighs only 1.2‚Äì4 grams and has a body less than 4 cm long, with a 2.5 cm tail. This shrew has a brown back and a light grey underside, with a fairly clear boundary in between. The color of the back varies seasonally from chocolate brown in summer to light brown in winter. The same bicolor pattern extends to the tail, which has a dark brown tuft of hair at the end. The feet are the same color as the belly, with brown heels.  Distribution  The Eurasian least shrew inhabits the northern taiga region, and is found throughout Siberia, in northern Europe (Finland, northern Sweden and parts of Norway) and on the islands of Sakhalin and Hokkaid≈ç. It can be found in diverse habitats, including both coniferous and deciduous forests, open fields, and the edges of bogs. The population density appears to be fairly low throughout, though its prevalence may be underestimated in surveys since its small size lets it escape many commonly used traps.  Behavior  Due to its small size and reclusive habits, the Eurasian least shrew can be difficult to spot. Like shrews in general, the Eurasian least shrew mainly eats insects, but will also dine on carrion or any other source of protein it finds. In winter, it may occasionally seek food indoors. Because of its small size for a mammal, the Eurasian least shrew has an extremely high metabolic rate and must eat frequently to avoid starvation; in captivity it has been reported to eat 120 meals a day, consuming three to four times its own weight each day. The Eurasian least shrew is active around the clock, with occasional sleep periods of 10‚Äì50 minutes each. The Eurasian least shrew can swim well, and in captivity even seems to enjoy playing in water. Its small size also makes the Eurasian least shrew a phenomenal climber: it has been observed climbing up even the smooth inside corner of a glass terrarium. Its eyesight is poor, but it has very good hearing. While the Eurasian least shrew frequently emits sounds, much of its communication is in frequencies beyond the limits of human hearing.  Breeding  The female Eurasian least shrew has one or two litters a year, each typically consisting of 3‚Äì6 offspring. Little is known about the typical lifetime of the Eurasian least shrew in the wild, but in captivity some have managed to reach an age of over 2.5 years.  Identification  The Eurasian least shrew may be mistaken for the slightly larger Eurasian pygmy shrew (S. minutus), which is commonly found in the same areas. Besides the size difference, the two species may be distinguished by the tail and feet of the least shrew being noticeably shorter in proportion to its body.  References  * Siivonen, Lauri (ed.)

Emanuil Gojdu was born to an Aromanian family that originated in Moscopole. He attended high school in his native town. After completing the high school studies, he studied law at the Academy of Law in Oradea (Nagyv√°rad, 1820-1821), then in Pressburg (1821-1822) and Budapest (1822-1824), becoming both a lawyer and a politician in 1824. He was a supporter of the rights of the Romanians in the Kingdom of Hungary and Transylvania. In his will, dating from 1869, he left his wealth to \\"the Romanian Orthodox people of Hungary and Transylvania\\" and it was administered by a foundation which bore his name and functioned between 1870 and 1917, one which awarded thousands of scholarships to Transylvanian Romanians. Among the students who received such scholarships were Traian Vuia, Octavian Goga, Constantin Daicoviciu, Petru Groza and Victor Babe≈ü. In 1918, the headquarters of the foundation was moved to Sibiu (Hermannstadt/Nagyszeben) which became part of Romania, although its assets (mostly buildings) remained in Hungary. According to the 247th article of the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, Hungary was supposed hand over the assets to Romania. However, and despite several agreements between Hungary and Romania in 1924, 1930 and 1937, this was never done. The assets, consisting mostly of real estate in Budapest and of bank accounts which held the income from the buildings, was confiscated by the Hungarian Communist government in 1952, and in 1990 became the property of Erzs√©betv√°ros, the 7th District of the Budapest Municipality. In 1999, the Budapest Municipality leased the buildings to a Hungarian-Cypriot company. The assets are currently estimated to be worth between $812 million and $1.1 billion. In 2006, an agreement was signed between the two governments, through which the Romanian side would withdraw all claim in favor of a newly established Hungarian-Romanian foundation. However, it is not yet known whether the Romanian parliament would approve this. The Romanian Orthodox Church has made public its disagreement with any such compromise, and warned that it would use all legal means to get the assets, as it pretends to be the recipient according to Gojdu's will.

(, 1290 [or 1284] ‚Äì 19 February 1351), was an Italian penitent and hermit of the Third Order of St. Francis, who is venerated as a saint. Biography =Early life= The Church of Calendasco with the castle where St. Conrad was born in the background (left) He was born Corrado Confalonieri, a member of one of the noblest families of Piacenza, in the town of Calendasco, a fiefdom of his family. The date of his birth is uncertain. He married an aristocratic young woman named Ephrosyne when he was quite young. Though pious, he led the normal way of life for a man of his station. One day, as he was engaged in his usual pastime of hunting within his family's domain, he ordered his attendants to set fire to some brushwood in which game had taken refuge. The prevailing wind caused the flames to spread rapidly to the surrounding fields and forest. A peasant who happened to be found near where the fire began was accused of starting the blaze and was imprisoned, tortured to confess, and condemned to death. As the man was being led to execution, a remorseful Conrad publicly admitted his guilt to the Signoria of the city. As punishment and reparation for the damages he had caused, the city seized all his assets, only sparing his life due to his noble status. =Franciscan penitent= Thus reduced to poverty, and seeking penance for his act of cowardice, Conrad and his wife saw the hand of God in this event. As a result, in 1315 they agreed to separate and Conrad retired to a hermitage near the town of Calendasco, joining a community of hermits, who were Franciscan tertiaries, while his wife became a nun of the Order of Poor Clares at their monastery in the city. Conrad soon developed a reputation for holiness, and the flow of visitors left him unable to keep the solitude he sought. He then embarked on the life of a pilgrim, going to Rome, and from there to the Holy Land and Malta and, about 1340, to Palermo in Sicily, where he was directed to an isolated site in the Val di Noto. After many years of an itinerant life, he settled there in a grotto now named for him and for the rest of his life spent a most austere and penitential life of solitude, working numerous miracles, and gifted with prophecy. In 1343 Conrad felt called by God to serve the local people more directly and in 1343 went to the city of Netum, where he cared for the sick at the Hospital of St. Martin there for the next two years. He lived in a hermitage attached to the Church of the Crucified Christ occupied by the Blessed William Buccheri, a former equerry to King Frederick III of Sicily, who had also taken up a life of solitude and prayer. Conrad would regularly return to his grotto for silent prayer. His fame was such that in 1348 the Bishop of Syracuse, Giacomo Guidone de Franchis, went to his hermitage to beg his prayers for the relief of a famine afflicting the island. Conrad died while in prayer, kneeling before a crucifix, on 19 February 1351, the day he had predicted. At his request, his body was buried at the Church of St. Nicholas, the principal one of the city. After the city was leveled in an earthquake in the 1690s, it was transferred to the new church of the same name built in the relocated city, now called Noto, which now serves as the cathedral of the region. Veneration =Miracles= Conrad is especially invoked for the cure of hernia. This comes from miracles attributed to him. The legend relates that he was visited at his hermitage by a former friend and companion in arms, Antonio da Stessa, from Daverio. His friend was suffering from the pain of a hernia he had developed. Seeing the pain his old comrade was suffering, Conrad was moved to pity and prayed for him. Stessa was immediately cured of the hernia. The same outcome was accomplished for a local tailor, who suffered severely from several hernias. The miracle for which Conrad is best known is the \\"Miracle of the Bread\\". This developed during the aforementioned famine which afflicted Sicily as a result of a severe outbreak of the bubonic plague on the island during 1348-49. During that catastrophe, anyone who approached the hermit for help was given a loaf of bread, still warm, which, it was said, he had received from the angels. =Canonization= Shortly after Conrad's death, his demonstrably holy life and the large number of miracles attributed to him led the leadership of the city to request that the Bishop of Syracuse, to which diocese Noto belonged, begin the process for his canonization. When the waiting period required by Church law expired in 1485, this process was opened by Bishop Dalmazio Gabriele, O.P., who had himself witnessed the Miracle of the Bread. As part of the process, Conrad's body was exhumed for examination, and was found to be incorrupt, and placed in a silver urn for the veneration of the public. Pope Leo X beatified Conrad on 12 July 1515 and permitted the town of Noto to celebrate his feast day. On 30 October 1544, Pope Paul III extended permission to the whole island. On 2 June 1625, he was canonized by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, who was the Duke of Parma and Piacenza in a solemn ceremony at the cathedral of Piacenza, where it was declared an obligatory feast. On 12 September of that same year, permission was granted to the Franciscan Order by Pope Urban VIII for a distinct text for the Divine Office and Mass to be used for his feast; today it is celebrated solely by the Third Order of St. Francis to which he belonged. In Vietnam there is a popular devotion to Conrad. On his feast day, the Parish Church of San Corrado in Noto commemorates him by the distribution of blessed bread.

Lilavati rose to prominence as the wife of Parakramabahu I, king of the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. Being of royal descent herself, she then ruled as sole monarch on three occasions in the near-anarchy following Parakramabahu's death, with the backing of various generals. The primary source for her life is the Culavamsa, specifically chapter LXXX. It is known that Lilavati was the daughter of Sirivallabha and his wife Sugala, and that she had a brother, also called Manabharana. She would have met her future husband when still young as Parakramabahu was her cousin, the son of her uncle Manabharana of Dhakkinadesa. Following his death, Kittisrimegha ascended to the throne of Dhakkinadesa, and Manabharana's family came to live with Sirivallabha in Ruhuna. It is not known at what point she married Parakramabahu. Lilavati's family ‚Äì in particular her brother Manabharana of Ruhuna (who was married to both of Parakramabahu's sisters, Mitta and Pabhavati), and the Queen Mother, Sugala ‚Äì had a very difficult relationship with Parakramabahu. Manabharana fought against Parakramabahu on several occasions, whilst Sugala \\"had not a mind capable of reflection and was inclined herself by nature to evil\\". It is not known what role Lilavati played in the complex scheming between them. Reign and Death Lilavati's activities during the energetic reign of her husband are not known. As first mahesi (\\"queen consort\\"), she would have been the highest-ranking woman in court; her children (if any) would have had first claim to the throne, and on occasion she may even have accompanied the king on campaign. However the Culavamsa does not mention this, or indeed suggest she had any children by Parakramabahu. The queen re-emerges in the sources in the anarchy following Parakramabahu's death. Vijayabahu II, described as a 'poet king', lasted only a year before he was murdered by 'a traitor...of the Kulinga (sic) clan' named Mahinda. Mahinda in his turn was deposed by Kittinissanka, a Kalinga prince who had been Vijayabahu's chief minister. Kittinissanka reigned from 1187 to 1196 as Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa. Following Nissanka Malla's death, his younger brother Vikramabahu ascended to the throne, and was deposed after only a few months by his nephew Chodaganga. Chodaganga was then deposed by the 'powerful general' Kitti, who, rather than seizing the throne for himself, had Lilavati consecrated sovereign queen. Lilavati's first reign is described as \\"three years without mishap\\" in the Culavamsa. As the first queen of Parakramabahu she would have wielded a kind of legitimacy which other claimants of the throne lacked; furthermore her ancestry was considerably more venerable than that of Kitti or any of Nissanka Malla's house. The respect afforded her could explain how she survived her first deposition, by Sahassamalla, a prince of the Okkaka people, on 23 August 1200. A succession of rulers followed Sahassamalla, who was deposed in 1202 by the general Ayasmanta. Like Kitti, Ayasmanta refused the throne himself and appointed Nissanka Malla's first mahesi, Kalyanavathi, queen; unlike Kitti however he reserved genuine power for himself. Kalyanavathi was succeeded by the child king Dhammasoka, also under Ayasmanta's sway. In 1209 however the invading Chola armies of Anikanga Mahadipada put both Ayasmanta and Dhammasoka (who would have been around 15 months old) to death. Lilavati was thrust back into the limelight just seventeen days afterwards, when Anikanga was assassinated by the general Vikkantacamunakka. The Culavamsa describes the general as a 'villain...[who] slew the Monarch Anikaiiga [sic] and had the government carried on for a year by the first consort of King Parakkamabahu [sic], Lilavati by name, who had already reigned before'. Why the previously well-regarded queen was now associating with a villain is not made clear, nor why Ankanga, a Chola invader, is held in such high regard. Yet another invasion from South India ('a great Damila army from the opposite shore') dethroned Lilavati in 1210; its leader, Lokissara, 'brought the whole of Lanka under his sway and reigned, dwelling in Pulatthinagara, [for] nine months'. In turn he was deposed by the general Parakrama, 'the best among men of decision, endowed with great power and courage', who inaugurates Lilavati's final stretch on the throne in 1211. The queen appears to be back in favour with the authors of the Culavamsa, as this time she is described as 'of the dynasty of the Sun and Moon...she who afterward shone in royal splendour'. This last stretch in power for the queen lasted a mere seven months before she was dethroned by her Parakrama of Pandya, who established himself as king in Rajarata. Following this invasion Lilavati disappears from the historical record. It seems unlikely that Parakrama of Pandya would have put her to death, but his successor, the notoriously tyrannical Magha, may well have at some point after his invasion of 1215. Significance Queen Lilavati's life and reigns effectively spanned across the final decline and collapse of Sinhalese power in medieval Sri Lanka. The twenty-six years following her husband's death saw nine separate rulers and at least three invasions from the Chola and Pandya lands of South India. These invasions in particular would have been a blow to the pride of Lilavati's dynasty, which prided itself on having driven the Chola out and establishing native rule. It is difficult also to make sense of the factions at work in Rajarata, Ruhuna, and Dhakkinadesa at the time. Lilavati clearly belonged to the house of Vijayabahu, whilst Nissanka Malla, Vikramabahu, Chodaganga, Queen Kalyanavathi and Dhammasoka appear to represent a separate, Kalingan house. However adding confusion to the situation are invaders like Anikanga (who in some sources is presented as Dhammasoka's father), and the fact that there were divisions even within the clans themselves (such as Vikramabahu II and Chodaganga's fighting with each other). Parakramabahu I, Nissanka Malla, Vijayabahu II, and Lokissara are explicitly described in the Culavamsa as ruling the entirety of Lanka during this period, but following the invasion by Kalinga Magha and his tyrannical reign from 1215‚Äì1236, the island fractured into a series of discrete and competing kingdoms. Sri Lanka would not see geopolitical union again until 1450; It would be under the Kotte Kingdom.

Since their inception in the mid-1990s they have released two albums, I Guess Sometimes I Need to Be Reminded of How Much You Love Me and The Man Who Ate the Man, plus numerous singles and EPs and are currently signed to the record label 4AD. Magn√©tophone rose to international recognition out of a period of vibrant musical activity in the second city, which also spawned contemporaries Broadcast. Biography Matthew J Saunders and John Hanson formed Magn√©tophone in 1995 after they met at an art school on the outskirts of Birmingham in 1992. Their musical backgrounds followed similar lines in that they both played in rock-influenced bands. Saunders began experimenting with keyboards and computer soundchips (C64 SID chip in particular) around 1986, composing instrumental three voice music and sound effects. Inspired by rock'n'roll and the possibilities of audio 'art', in 1989 he took up his 'neighbour's neglected guitar' and began forming bands in the style of the Beatles and Led Zeppelin, playing pubs and clubs around Birmingham city centre. Hanson's first steps into music also began in the mid-1980s, and at the local community centre playing drums in the basement, in drop-in style workshops. Later, he discovered acoustic guitar and his 'first love', the bass, and went on to form bands also playing Led Zeppelin-esque tracks. Despite the similarity of their respective bands their paths didn't cross until 1992 when they enrolled on an art course at Solihull College. Here, they developed a friendship, sharing their enthusiasm for Spacemen 3, Suicide, Steve Reich, Talk Talk, Aphex Twin, Woody Allen, painting, printmaking and photography. At this time, both their bands simultaneously began to disintegrate leading them to form their own outfit Rocket Science. Rocket Science's first gig was at The Jug of Ale in Moseley, Birmingham. The duo played simple FM synthesis keyboards put through numerous guitar effects pedals, acoustic guitar, bass guitar and various tone generators and used a four-track recorder to play back a combination of processed found sounds, film dialogue, and distorted breakbeats. Their music at this early stage was instrumental and often repetitive, recalling the sounds of early techno- ambient albums by Aphex Twin, and the lush washes of Brian Eno. Performing music that required a certain level of calm and concentration on the part of the audience brought with it certain concerns: \\"We were finding that the quieter tracks were getting talked over to the point where you'd feel like you may as well stop and get up and go to the bar with them. We found to get around this, we had to make our beats and sounds louder and fiercer, so it was harder to talk over.\\" Magnetophone's music was at odds with the Brit Pop indie guitar bands that predominated in the second city's venues; consequently, from 1998‚Äì1999 Saunders and Hanson organised and promoted their own night of 'alternative' music entitled 'We Brought Our Friends'. During this time, the duo sent out demos to record labels, and one in particular caught the attention of London label Earworm Records. \\"You Should Write Music\\" backed by \\"Monitor Rocket Science\\" became the band's first 7\\" single, and prompted the change of name from Rocket Science to Magn√©tophone. This first single was met with great enthusiasm by the press, and by fellow musicians, including Spacemen 3's Sonic Boom who met the band at a 'We Brought Our Friends' show and later worked and performed with them. A series of other singles, 12\\"s, and compilations followed, and a long term relationship with Static Caravan Recordings began. The records between 1998 and 2000 showed the basis of the Magn√©tophone sound to be rooted in the electronic field, but it was also moving outside of it as its 'organic-ness' and obvious human intervention and performance appeared to be informed by guitar bands like My Bloody Valentine and MC5, and it is this that separates them from other electronica records of the same period and which caught the attention of 4AD's A&R; department. These records were still instrumental and took in elements of drum'n'bass, IDM, ambient-techno and avant-garde sound sculpting, and were tied together by strong, though sometimes hidden or intermittent melodies. The pieces were performed live and captured as whole performances, rather than being multi- tracked. John Peel was an ardent supporter of the band's output at this time and they recorded two Peel sessions, one at the BBC Maida Vale Studios, and one at the Irish Centre in a live performance in Birmingham in 2000. In March 2000, the band completed their debut LP I Guess Sometimes I Need to Be Reminded of How Much You Love Me, which was subsequently released by 4AD (where they remain signed today) to great critical acclaim in some quarters. The BBC used one of the tracks from this album, \\"So Much As Hold My Hand\\", on their World Service as the theme music for links between programmes and news bulletins. Their work since this LP has included collaborations with Kim Deal and Kelley Deal, King Creosote, James Yorkston, The Mountain Goats and Sonic Boom. In 2004, Magn√©tophone's track 'Kel's Vintage Thought', co-written with The Breeders' Kelley Deal, was voted by listeners of BBC 6 Music as the Rebel Playlist winner on the Steve Lamacq show. Their second LP, The Man Who Ate The Man, was released in 2005 and was voted best avant-post rock album of 2005 by Piccadilly Records. Shortly after its release, in late 2005, Magn√©tophone recorded a session for BBC Radio 1's Blue Room show at the Maida Vale Studios, and for BBC Radio 1's Rob da Bank show, both broadcast in November 2005. In 2007, Magn√©tophone contributed to Birmingham UK/Italian artist-collaboration- compilation Binary Oppositions which was a coming together of visual and audio art produced by Birmingham-based artists. Later that year New York art-house publication Visionaire released an audio media package called Visionaire 53 which brought together many disparate artists in the producing of one-minute- only pieces of music. Magn√©tophone contributed to this release along with other artists including Yoko Ono, U2, Michael Stipe, Pet Shop Boys, Cindy Sherman and it consisted of five records, 2 CDs, a record player and dome container. In 2008, Magn√©tophone contributed an instrumental track called \\"The Old Silver In and Out\\" to an online tribute compilation to classical and electronic composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, who scored music for Eyes Wide Shut, 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. The compilation included Mike Paradinas's u-ziq and Moyokoyani & His Robot Orchestra and all the tracks were supplied as free downloads. 2008 also saw a new development from Magn√©tophone with the duo setting up a record label called Test Conditions to release dubstep and electronica. Saunders' solo productions are recorded under the alias of Veil and latterly The Assembled Minds. The Magn√©tophone sound Magn√©tophone's records reference a number of different influences from Silver Apples, Suicide, My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3, to The Human League, Talk Talk, and Velvet Underground. However, one is not more apparent than the other and their music is more accurately a mixture of genres rather than bands: psychedelia, electronica, folk, synthpop, post-rock, ambient, pop. Their sound is a meeting of the broken and organic and the beautiful and systematised, and the progression of their sound through their eleven-year career, spans dysfunctional electronic instrumental pieces, to 'bewitching, mysterious' city-folk songs. Magn√©tophone's melodies, whether sung or played on an instrument, are supported by dirty, scratchy synths, solid electro and acoustic breaks, detuning guitars and sonic 'artefacts' that blink-in and out of the audio picture-frame seemingly at random. Tape hiss, projector clicks, fireworks, fragments of human voices move around sometimes contrapuntal, sometimes monophonic arrangements. The time signatures are generally or . The lyrics of The Man Who Ate The Man are more poetic than rock'n'roll inspired, and concern city relationships (\\"Benny's Insobriety\\" and \\"Without Word\\") or similar, but set against a rural backdrop (\\"A Sad Ha Ha (Circled My Demise)\\" and \\"The Only Witching You'll be Doing\\"). The themes explore control, loss, reverence, worth, relationship-pacts. Much of Magn√©tophone's music from the early singles to the first LP is notable for its 'challenging' nature (the pounding, broken, distorted beats and unrecognisable bass textures of \\"I Hear Blonde Falcons\\" being a case in point), and it is clear that the band at this stage were often concerned with creating original audio 'objects' that have questionable worth outside of pure abstract appreciation; other tracks from this time more clearly reference rock'n'roll's more simple appeal, and the balancing of these two ethics across a record creates a unique and unsettling audio and emotional experience. Throughout Magn√©tophone's recorded output, the listener will hear sonic experimentation in the form of mis-firing beats, sliding time frames, processed acoustic field recordings, minute background 'happenings' and synthesis manipulation and these are generally presented in 'alternative' song structures. However, their most recent LP The Man Who Ate The Man exhibits the sonic exploration of their early work, whilst also employing traditional acoustic instruments including guitar, drums and melodica, Anglo-folk vocal lines and song structures approaching the 'conventional'. \\"Whichever way a Magn√©tophone track is leaning in terms of its 'influence' or 'style', there is a tangible thread of intelligent and careful boundary-searching and maverick but conscientious sound construction through it; and always towards the end of creating a slightly uncomfortable environment for a \\"proper\\" song to play out in. Somehow, like Francis Bacon's 'snail trail of human presence' being evident in a painting, Magn√©tophone's music quietly announces that they have attended there, whilst suggesting it was perhaps other people.\\"(source: MySpace.com) Artwork The band state, \\"we want our sleeves to be equally as exciting as the music they represent\\", and to this end, they have presented their music in a variety of quality art 'packages'. The very first single, \\"You Should Write Music\\", consisted of a red audiophile-weight vinyl 7\\", with a matching textured sleeve and a single white sticker, containing the band name and track titles. Their work with V23's design-icon Vaughan Oliver and photographer/designer Chris Bigg has produced some unique sleeves, from the three-quarter cut-sleeved, double vinyl LP of \\"I Guess Sometimes...\\", to the laser-cut aluminium turntable pillar-disc that accompanied the CD version of the same LP, to the high-quality cardboard, gate-folding digipack of The Man Who Ate The Man, which contained eight small double-sided cards, printed with domestic interior images and cryptic phrases.

Description The parore has a moderately deep, compressed, oval shaped body with a thin caudal peduncle, It has a small head which has a slightly convex forehead, and small eyes. The mouth is small and does not extend as far as the eye. The jaws have an outer row of overlapping, flattened, tricuspid teeth beside a wide band of teeth of similar shape but which are tiny. Much of the body is covered im moderately small ctenoid scales and there is an arched lateral line, made up of 48-51 pored scales, which is parallel to the dorsal profile. It has a continuous dorsal fin which has no demarcation between its spiny and rayed parts. The spiny part has 14-16 spines and is one and a half times to almost twice as long as the soft rayed part which contains 11-12 soft rays. The spines in the middle of the are the longest and are just a little bit shorter than the soft rays, which get shorter towards the tail. The anal fin is similar to the soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin, contains 3 spines and 11-12 soft rays and is situated opposite it. The caudal fin has 17 rays, is very large and broadly forked. The pectoral fins are small, with 16 rays the uppermost being the longest, and the pelvic fins are small, containing a spine and 5 rays. The maximum size recorded is a fork length of , although total lengths around are more normal. The maximum published weight is . The colour and pattern of the parore is dark greenish-grey dorsally and silvery grey on the flanks and ventrally and belly. There are around 11 thin dark vertical bars underneath the dorsal finwhich fade ventrally. The head and pectoral fins are sometimes yellowish in colour but the fins are usually the same colour as the part of the body they are nearest to. Distribution The parore occurs off eastern Australia and New Zealand. In Australia it occurs from Mackay, Queensland, to east of Adelaide in South Australia and off most of Tasmania. In New Zealand it occurs on both the east and west coasts of the North Island from the North Cape to the Cook Strait. Habitat and biology Parore are found in shallow coastal and estuarine waters where the frequently congregate in large schools in the vicinity of rocky outcrops and jetties. The small juveniles use seagrass beds to hide from predators. This species is an omnivore which use their small sharp, incisor-like teeth for grazing on seaweed, especially the filamentous green algae Enteromorpha intestinalis and sea cabbage. They also a band of crushing teeth which are used to grind algae. Analysis of their stomach contents have shown that parore opportunistically feed on other food items like small crustaceans, pipi, mussels and worms. As parore mature, they congregate in large shoals and the adults form 'runs' from estuarine waters and coastal lakes into the sea. The fish spawn in the surf zone and mouths of estuaries, spawning takes place in the winter. Fisheries Parore are fished for commercially in New South Wales and in New Zealand they are landed as a bycatch in the grey mullet fishery. The fish are sold fresh. They are a popular quarry for recreational fisheries in Australia and can be caught of seaweed under a float or artificial wee fly,, less so in New Zealand where they appear to be mainly caught by recreational fishermen targeting other species. Species description The parore was first formally described as Boops tricuspidatus in 1824 by Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy & Joseph Paul Gaimard with the type locality given as \\"Shark Bay, Western Australia\\".

It is one of the greatest museums in Greece and the best in the world for Minoan art, as it contains the most notable and complete collection of artefacts of the Minoan civilization of Crete. Overview bull leaper (c.1500 BC), an ivory figurine from the palace of Knossos. Phaistos Disc Minoan jewelry. Kamares style vases from Phaistos and Knossos. Malia. Arkalochori Axe The Snake Goddess or a priestess performing a ritual (MM III). The museum began in 1883 as a simple collection of antiquities. A dedicated building was constructed from 1904 to 1912 at the instigation of two Cretan archaeologists, Iosif Hatzidakis and Stefanos Xanthoudidis. After three destructive earthquakes in 1926, 1930, and 1935, the museum nearly collapsed. The director of the Heraklion Museum was then Spyridon Marinatos, who made great efforts to find funds and persuade the locals and the central government alike that a new solid building was needed. In 1935, Marinatos succeeded in engaging Patroklos Karantinos to build a sturdy structure that has withstood both natural disasters and the bombing that accompanied the German invasion in 1941. Although the museum was damaged during World War II, the collection survived intact and again became accessible to the public in 1952. A new wing was added in 1964. The Herakleion Archaeological Museum is one of the largest and most important museums in Greece, and among the most important museums in Europe. It houses representative artifacts from all the periods of Cretan prehistory and history, covering a chronological span of over 5,500 years from the Neolithic period to Roman times. The singularly important Minoan collection contains unique examples of Minoan art, many of them true masterpieces. The Heraklion Museum is rightly considered as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide. The museum is located in the town centre. It was built between 1937 and 1940 by architect Patroklos Karantinos on a site previously occupied by the Roman Catholic monastery of Saint-Francis which was destroyed by earthquake in 1856. The museum's antiseismic building is an important example of modernist architecture and was awarded a Bauhaus commendation. Karantinos applied the principles of modern architecture to the specific needs of a museum by providing good lighting from the skylights above and along the top of the walls, and facilitating the easy flow of large groups of people. He also anticipated future extensions to the museum. The colours and construction materials, such as the veined polychrome marbles, recall certain Minoan wall-paintings which imitate marble revetment. The two-storeyed building has large exhibition spaces, laboratories, a drawing room, a library, offices and a special department, the so-called Scientific Collection, where numerous finds are stored and studied. The museum shop, run by the Archaeological Receipts Fund, sells museum copies, books, postcards and slides. There is also a caf√©. Most of the museum was closed for renovation from 2006 and reopened in May 2013.http://www.heraklion.gr/en/ourplace/archeological-museum/archeological- museum.html The Heraklion Archaeological Museum is a Special Regional Service of the Ministry of Culture and its purpose is to acquire, safeguard, conserve, record, study, publish, display and promote Cretan artefacts from the Prehistoric to the Late Roman periods. The museum organizes temporary exhibitions in Greece and abroad, collaborates with scientific and scholarly institutions, and houses a variety of cultural events.

It was a bilateral treaty between the governments of Australia and Indonesia, which provided for the joint exploitation of petroleum and hydrocarbon resources in a part of the Timor Sea Seabed. The treaty was signed on 11 December 1989 and came into force on 9 February 1991. The signatories to the treaty were then Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans and then Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. The Treaty has been the centre of much controversy as it was signed during a period of political uncertainty in East Timor. In 1991, Portugal challenged the validity of the Treaty in the International Court of Justice but no case could be brought due to the Court‚Äôs lack of jurisdiction. The United Nations replaced Indonesia as a treaty party in 2000 after East Timor gained independence from Indonesia. In 2002, the Timor Gap Treaty was replaced by the Timor Sea Treaty between the Government of East Timor and the Government of Australia. In 2019, the Timor Sea Treaty was replaced by the Treaty Between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste Establishing Their Maritime Boundaries in the Timor Sea.  Geography and Historical Context of the Treaty  The Timor Gap refers to the 60,000 square kilometre ‚Äúcoffin-shaped‚Äù area between Australia and East Timor. The area contains several oil and gas reserves. The exact value of the resources contained in the Timor Gap is unknown, but three of the largest reserves, Elang-Kakatua, Bayu-Undan and Sunrise-Troubadour are estimated to hold US$17 billion worth of oil. The Timor Gap does not refer to any geographical landmark but is instead the area of continental shelf that was subject to negotiations between Indonesia, Australia and Portugal in the early 1970s. In 1971-2 Indonesia and Australia delimited their seabed boundaries in the Timor Sea. Australia attempted to negotiate with Portuguese Timor to come to a similar boundary agreement, but these negotiations remained inconclusive when Portugal withdrew from East Timor in 1975. As a result, there was a break in the Australia-Indonesia boundary in the area surrounding East Timor. This break is known as the Timor Gap. On 7 December 1975, Indonesian forces invaded and annexed East Timor as its twenty-seventh province. This was nine days after East Timor had declared its independence following Portugal withdrawing from the country. The UN did not recognise Indonesia as the ruling force of East Timor and asserted Portugal as the administering authority of the nation. Australia initially refused to acknowledge Indonesian control of East Timor. However, in 1979 it gave de jure recognition of Indonesian occupation of the country, and began negotiations with Indonesia in relation to closing the Timor Gap. = Controversy surrounding Australia‚Äôs involvement in the Indonesian invasion in East Timor = The extent to which Australia knowingly allowed or encouraged Indonesia to invade East Timor has long attracted international debate. Australia was the only western nation to recognise Indonesian rule. It has been contended by commentators such as Noam Chomsky, that Australia was motivated to support Indonesia due to the prospect of an eventual Timor Gap Treaty, which would have significant financial and resource benefits, and enhance the nation‚Äôs relationship with Indonesia and its foothold in Asia. Gareth Evans responded to these criticisms by asserting that Australia did not support the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, but had no power to stop Indonesia‚Äôs invasion. He stated that there was ‚Äúnothing morally offensive‚Äù about Australia‚Äôs recognition of Indonesian sovereignty in East Timor as it never denied the right of self-determination of the East Timorese population. He also argued that East Timor ‚Äúwas never disadvantaged by the Timor Gap Treaty‚Äù, as it was always intended that East Timor would replace Indonesia in the Treaty if they emerged as an independent nation.  Formation and Signing of the Treaty  Indonesia and Australia held substantially different positions on how the Timor Gap should be delimited. Both positions were supported by conflicting sources of International Law, complicating the treaty making process. Australia proposed that the boundaries should be determined according to the Convention on the Continental Shelf 1958, which grants sovereignty to a nation over the continental shelf beyond their shores. Australia contended that the Timor Trough marked the edge of its continental shelf, giving the nation sovereignty over a significant share of the Timor Gap pursuant to the Convention. This position was upheld in the North Sea Continental Shelf Cases of 1969, where the International Court of Justice determined a state‚Äôs continental shelf to be the ‚Äúnatural prolongation of its land territory‚Äù. Indonesia‚Äôs position was based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982, which gives a state full and exclusive rights over the 200 nautical miles from its territorial sea baseline, even if its continental shelf is geographically much smaller (unless proved that the continental shelf extends beyond this 200 nautical miles). As neither party would concede, and an agreement on boundary lines could not be made, the parties instead agreed to a provisional arrangement in accordance to UNCLOS Article 83. In 1985, the parties agreed on the ‚ÄòZone of Cooperation‚Äô which would allow them to jointly exploit the resources in the Timor Gap. This arrangement was formalised on 11 December 1989 when the Timor Gap Treaty was signed by the Australian and Indonesian Foreign Ministers, Gareth Evans and Ali Alatas, during a flight over the Timor Gap. The Zone of Cooperation has been ‚Äúheralded as the most complex, comprehensive and sophisticated maritime joint development zone ever concluded‚Äù.  Effect of the Treaty  The Timor Gap Treaty divided the Zone of Cooperation into three areas ‚Äì Areas A, B and C. It created a regime for an initial term of 40 years for the exploration of resources in these three areas. Part II of the Treaty set out that Area B, the southern part of the Gap, was to be administered by Australia, with Indonesia entitled to 10 per cent of the Resource Rent Tax from petroleum revenues in the area. Area C, the northern part of the Gap, was to be administered by Indonesia who had to provide 10 per cent of tax revenue from petroleum activities in the area to Australia. Area A, the middle and largest portion of the Gap, was jointly administered by both parties and revenues were divided equally. The rights of both parties to Area A were monitored by the Joint Authority and Ministerial Council created by the Treaty. The Treaty stipulated that this division of the Zone of Cooperation did not affect the ability for Australia and Indonesia to reach a permanent boundary agreement, and both parties should continue efforts to do so. = Area A ‚Äî Shared Zone = Area A was administered by a Ministerial Council and a Joint Authority, which were responsible for the activities and allocation of resources in the Area. The Ministerial Council oversaw all matters concerning the Area, including the supervision of the Joint Authority. The Joint Authority performed a practical role in managing the activities of the Area. Part III of the Treaty outlined the function and structure of the Ministerial Council. Article 6(1) stipulated that the Ministerial Council held \\"overall responsibility for all matters relating to the exploration for and the exploitation of the petroleum resources in Area A of the Zone of Cooperation\\", including any policy making. A number of measures were put in place to ensure that the Ministerial Council held equal representation of both parties. An equal number of ministers from each nation were appointed to sit on the Council. Article 5(5) of the Treaty required that all decisions made by the Ministerial Council were achieved by unanimity. The location of the annual meetings that were held by the Council also alternated between Indonesia and Australia. The first annual meeting was held in 1991 in Bali, Indonesia and was attended by two ministers from each nation. The function and structure of the Joint Authority was found in Part IV of the Treaty. The Joint Authority was directly accountable to the Ministerial Council and was required to perform under its direction. Article 8 outlined that the Joint Authority was responsible for ‚Äúthe management of activities relating to exploration for and exploitation of the petroleum resources in Area A‚Äù. One of its largest roles was to enter into Production Sharing Contracts with corporations, under Article 8(b) of the Treaty. These contracts allowed companies to exploit oil resources in the Area. The Joint Authority supervised the behaviour of these companies to ensure all activities were pursuant to the Treaty's Petroleum Mining Code. A sample Production Sharing Contract was provided in Annex C of the Treaty. The Joint Authority was unable to enter into or terminate any contracts without the approval of the Ministerial Council. All activities of the Joint Authority were originally funded by Australia and Indonesia, but were intended to eventually be supported by the revenues generated by any mining in Area A. These responsibilities of the Joint Authority were equally shared between Australia and Indonesia. The Executive Board consisted of one Executive Director from each nation (which were appointed by the Ministerial Council) and one director of each of the four functions of the Authority: Technical, Financial, Corporate Services and Legal. The directors of the Technical and Financial functions could not be representatives from the same nation, as these were the two most important functions of the Authority. Agreement had to be reached by both parties on every decision. If no agreement could be made, the matter was referred to the Ministerial Council. The Joint Authority had offices in both Darwin, Australia and Jakarta, Indonesia.  International Court of Justice Proceedings  In 1991, Portugal brought proceedings against Australia in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in regards to the Timor Gap Treaty. Portugal argued that by being a party to the Treaty, Australia had violated the right to self determination of the East Timorese population, and had disregarded Portugal‚Äôs status as the administering authority of East Timor. The ICJ handed down its judgement on 30 June 1995. It ruled that no case was able to be brought against Australia without also considering Indonesia‚Äôs role as a Treaty party. To decide whether Indonesia could lawfully enter into treaties on behalf of the East Timorese population, the Court would have been required to determine whether Indonesia‚Äôs invasion of East Timor was lawful. The Court ruled 14 to 2 that this decision could not be made without Indonesia‚Äôs consent as they were an indispensable third party. Portugal‚Äôs claim were dismissed. Judge Weeramantry and Judge Skubiszewski dissented the decision. Judge Skubiszewski condemned the ruling of the court, stating that \\"recognition of annexation erodes self-determination\\", and the court's adherence to legal correctness alone had been to the detriment of justice and was \\"cause for concern\\". United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) Coat of Arms  Effect of East Timor‚Äôs Independence on the Treaty  East Timor gained independence from Indonesia in 1999. On 25 October 1999, The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was created by the Security Council Resolution 1272 to help East Timor transfer to a self governing territory. Had East Timor transitioned to independence immediately without UN administration, customary international law dictates that the nation would have ‚Äústart[ed] with a clean slate in the matter of treaty obligations‚Äù. East Timor would not have been required to assume the treaty obligations of Indonesia. However, Resolution 1272 gave extensive treaty-making power to the UNTAET, allowing the UN (via the UNTAET) to replace Indonesia as Australia‚Äôs treaty party, until East Timor transitioned to complete independence. On 5 July 2001, this arrangement was formalised in a Memorandum of Understanding that established the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA). The JPDA covered the same area as the Zone of Cooperation. This agreement was incorporated into Australian law in the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Act 2000 (Cth).  Current Position  The Timor Gap Treaty was replaced by the Timor Sea Treaty between the Government of East Timor and the Government of Australia (Timor Sea Treaty). On 20 May 2002, The Timor Sea Treaty was signed in Dili by the Australian Prime Minister at the time, John Howard, and the then East Timorese Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri. This was the same day that East Timor gained independence from UN rule. This new treaty created only one zone. Revenue from that zone was divided 10% to Australia and 90% to East Timor. In April 2016, East Timor brought conciliation proceedings against Australia under Annex V of the UNCLOS with the intent of establishing permanent maritime boundaries. A UNCLOS Conciliation Commission considered the matter and was able to solve the boundary disputes of each party. Following the proceedings, the Treaty between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste Establishing their Maritime Boundaries in the Timor Sea (Maritime Boundaries Treaty) was drafted. The Maritime Boundaries Treaty was signed on 9 March 2018 at the UN Headquarters in New York by the Foreign Ministers of Australia and East Timor. This treaty established permanent maritime boundaries between East Timor and Australia and a framework for resource development. The Timor Sea Treaty was terminated on 30 August 2019 when the Maritime Boundaries Treaty came into force.

From 1888 to 1898, the company was known as the Daimler Motor Company (DMC), formed under a partnership between Gottlieb Daimler of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG; predecessor to Mercedes-Benz) and William Steinway of piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons. Headquartered in Long Island City, Queens, New York City near Steinway's Astoria headquarters, the company sold Daimler motors for yachts and launches, and goods vehicles including buses and trucks. It built and sold a single automobile model, the original American Mercedes. History In 1885, Gottlieb Daimler and business partner Wilhelm Maybach developed one of the first gasoline-powered engines, known as \\"the grandfather clock engine\\". At some point in 1888, Daimler met piano maker William Steinway, son of Steinway & Sons founder Henry E. Steinway and a former associate of Maybach. Some sources state that Daimler visited New York as a member of a male voice choir and by chance met William Steinway. Most others state that Steinway met Daimler on a visit to Germany. Nonetheless, as a result of the meeting the two businessmen founded Daimler Motor Company in Long Island City, New York near Steinway's headquarters in Astoria, opening on September 29, 1888.Lord Montagu and David Burgess-Wise Daimler Century ; Stephens 1995 The company was officially incorporated on January 26, 1889. The company initially sold imported Cannstatt engines built in Germany. In 1891, DMC contracted National Machine Company of Hartford, Connecticut to build engines to Daimler specifications. USA-Daimler started making their own automobile and stationary engines in 1895 followed a decade later under new ownership by perhaps one complete automobile. Steinway confidently explained in an 1895 interview: \\"The fuel, petroleum, costs about one cent per hp and hour, making the automobile considerably less expensive than horse power. We already had a horseless vehicle here in 1893 but it was too lightly built for the rough cobblestone streets we have in this country‚Äù. =Change of ownership= the car is steered from the right hand side Following Steinway's early death in 1896, his heirs weren't confident in the viability of the automobile project, and sold all their shares to the General Electric Company in 1898. On August 2, 1898, the company was reorganized as Daimler Manufacturing Company (DMFG), with Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) the primary owner. The new company produced light trucks and buses under Daimler and Panhard et Levassor (another Daimler-contracted company) specifications. It also imported vehicles built in Europe by Daimler, Mercedes, and Panhard. In 1904, the company discontinued its boat building operations in order to focus on automobiles. That year DMFG constructed its first car, called the \\"American Mercedes\\". The car was based on the European Mercedes 40-45 hp, featuring a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/h), a 4-cylinder engine of 6.8 liters displacement and four-speed transmission. On January 17, 1905, the locally constructed car was shown at the New York International Auto Show. In the same month H. L. Bowden, Boston based owner of a steam yacht, established a speed record of 110 mph (175 km/h) average over a mile with flying start, in a car with a double Mercedes 60 hp engine at Daytona Beach, Florida.Steinway & Sons ‚Äì Owners' Magazine, 2009, p. 95. The brand stood out in the automobile market with Mercedes advertising stating: \\"If you want the best, of course you want a foreign car... Mercedes is the car for speed, power and noiseless running. It is the acme of reliability.‚Äù The first DMFG unit was sold in 1906, painted red. =Decline= On February 14, 1907, the DMFG factory was destroyed in a fire. The fire destroyed eight completed Mercedes, plus 40 others under construction, as well as drawings and machinery. One of these vehicles belonged to Standard Oil co-founder William Rockefeller. The fire also destroyed several nearby residences, rendering 100 local residents homeless. The rapid spread of the fire was attributed to the wooden construction of the Daimler facilities and much of the Steinway/Astoria neighborhood. Initially planning to rebuild, the company did not reconstruct the factory due to the financial panic of 1907 and the emergence of the American automotive industry. The company folded in 1913. Factory The company was located at 939 to 967 Steinway Avenue, on the south side of 20th Avenue between Steinway Street (then-Steinway Avenue) to the east and 38th Street (Kouwenhoven Street) to the west in Steinway section of Astoria, Queens. The factory was located across from the trolley depot of the Steinway Street Line trolley line operated by the Steinway Railway. It was just south of Steinway & Sons' main piano factory and the Steinway Mansion, both located at the north end of Astoria along Bowery Bay. The site consisted of several one-to-three buildings, all constructed of wood. The original building on the site measured 25 by 100 feet. A larger factory was constructed in 1895 when the company began building its own motors, and was expanded in 1899 to facilitate the construction of carriage and automobile bodies. This wooden- frame building occupied a 100 by 150 foot area of space facing Steinway Street, and stood two stories high, with a brick exterior and basement. Buildings on the west end of the block facing 38th Street were used for the storage of completed or partially completed vehicles. A second facility, the \\"Daimler Motor Company Boat Houses\\", was located at the north end of 36th Street (then-Blackwell Street) along the Bowery Bay coast.

The level of 4-EP is roughly proportional to Brettanomyces concentration and activity, and can therefore be used as an indicator of the yeast's presence. There are significant differences between strains of Brettanomyces in their ability to produce 4-EP. 4-EP is also a component of castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), used in perfumery. Biochemistry 4-EP is produced from the precursor p-coumaric acid. Brettanomyces converts this to 4-vinylphenol via the enzyme cinnamate decarboxylase.Brettanomyces Monitoring by Analysis of 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol at etslabs.com 4-Vinylphenol is further reduced to 4-ethylphenol by the enzyme vinyl phenol reductase.

Flaherty worked alongside her husband Robert Flaherty on several of films, including Louisiana Story (1948), for which she earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Story. Flaherty appeared in a feature-length documentary on her and her husband's film work, Hidden and Seeking (1971) directed by Peter Werner. Frances Flaherty was a crucial part of Robert Flaherty's success in film. She took on the role of director at times, helped to edit and distribute his films, even landing governmental film contracts for England.

It does not challenge the late 19th-century tri-partite division of the Germanic dialects into North Germanic, West Germanic and East Germanic, but proposes additionally that North and West Germanic (i.e. all surviving Germanic languages today) remained as a subgroup after the southward migration of the East Germanic tribes, only splitting into North and West Germanic later. Whether this subgroup constituted a unified proto-language, or simply represents a group of dialects that remained in contact and close geographical proximity, is a matter of debate, but the formulation of Ringe and Taylor probably enjoys widespread support: > There is some evidence that North and West Germanic developed as a single > language, Proto-Northwest Germanic, after East Germanic had begun to > diverge. However, changes unproblematically datable to the PNWGmc period are > few, suggesting that that period of linguistic unity did not last long. On > the other hand, there are some indications that North and West Germanic > remained in contact, exchanging and thus partly sharing further innovations, > after they had begun to diverge, and perhaps even after West Germanic had > itself begun to diversify. History and terminology This grouping was proposed by Hans Kuhn as an alternative to the older view of a Gotho-Nordic versus West Germanic division. This older view is represented by mid 20th-century proposals to assume the existence by 250 BC of five general groups to be distinguishable: North Germanic in Southern Scandinavia excluding Jutland; North Sea Germanic along the middle Rhine and Jutland; Rhine-Weser Germanic; Elbe Germanic; and East Germanic. The Northwest Germanic theory challenges these proposals, since it is strongly tied to runic inscriptions dated from AD 200 onwards. Dating Most scholars agree that East Germanic broke up from the rest of the languages in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC. The Runic Inscriptions (being written from the 2nd century) may mean that the north and West broke up in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The Migration Period started around the 4th and 5th centuries; an event which probably help diversify the Northwest Germanic (maybe even the West Germanic) languages even more. The date by which such a grouping must have dissolved‚Äîin that innovations ceased to be shared‚Äîis also contentious, though it seems unlikely to have persisted after 500 AD, by which time the Anglo-Saxons had migrated to England and the Elbe Germanic tribes had settled in Southern Germany. Shared innovations The evidence for Northwest Germanic is constituted by a range of common linguistic innovations in phonology, morphology, word formation and lexis in North and West Germanic, though in fact there is considerable debate about which innovations are significant. An additional problem is that Gothic, which provides almost the sole evidence of the East Germanic dialects, is attested much earlier than the other Germanic languages, with the exception of a few runic inscriptions. This means that direct comparisons between Gothic and the other Germanic languages are not necessarily good evidence for subgroupings, since the distance in time must also be taken into account. The following shared innovations, which must have taken place in Proto-Northwest Germanic, can be noted: * Lowering of stressed *ƒì to *ƒÅ. * Raising of word-final *-≈ç to *-≈´. * Shortening of word- final *-ƒ´ and *-≈´ to *-i and *-u. * Loss of *w between a consonant and unstressed *u. * Unstressed *am > *um. * Unstressed *er > *ar (if not already of Proto-Germanic date). * *u/*≈´ > *i/*ƒ´ in the second-person pronouns. Many common innovations are of post-Proto-Northwest Germanic date, however. These could have spread through an already differentiated dialect continuum, or have been present in latent form and solidified only in the individual dialects. * Unstressed *ai > *ƒì and *au > *≈ç. In Norse, final *-aiz > -ar in the genitive singular of i-stems. * Germanic a-mutation: stressed *u > *o before a non- close vowel, unless followed by a nasal and consonant. The West Germanic dialects differ in the outcome, with northern ones preserving *u while southern ones often have *o. The Proto-West Germanic situation thus cannot have been uniform, let alone the Proto-Northwest Germanic one. * Rhotacism: *z > *r. This change postdated the West Germanic loss of word-final *-z, and there are minor differences in the development of *z in West Germanic as well. * The replacement of reduplication with ablaut in the 7th class of strong verbs. This may have begun in the common history of North and West Germanic, but was not completed by the time of the split. Alternative groupings Postulated common innovations in North Germanic and Gothic, which therefore challenge the Northwest Germanic hypothesis, include: * Proto-Germanic , > , (e.g. Gothic triggwa, ON tryggva, OHG triuwe, \\"loyalty\\", see Holtzmann's Law) A minority opinion is able to harmonize these two hypotheses by denying the genetic reality of both Northwest Germanic and Gotho-Nordic, seeing them rather as mere cover terms indicating close areal contacts. (Such areal contacts would have been quite strong among the early Germanic languages, given their close geographic position over a long period of time.) Under such an assumption, an early close relationship between Nordic and Gothic dialects does not exclude a later similar relationship between remaining North and West Germanic groups, once the Gothic migration had started in the 2nd or 3rd century. There are also common innovations in Old High German and Gothic, which would appear to challenge both the Northwest Germanic and the Gotho- Nordic groupings. However, these are standardly taken to be the result of late areal contacts, based the cultural contacts across the Alps in the 5th and 6th centuries, reflected in the Christian loanwords from Gothic into Old High German.

History The West Wing of the Former Central Government Offices as seen from Battery Path. During the First Opium War, the British occupied Hong Kong in 1841 and one year later, the territory was ceded to them in the Treaty of Nanking. The new administration chose the site around present-day Battery Path to build its headquarters and defences. Construction on the path was completed in approximately 1841, at around the same time that its namesake‚ÄîMurray Battery‚Äîwas built. At the time, both the path and the battery were located on Hong Kong Island's waterfront with Victoria Harbour. However, it is now situated much farther inland due to the amount of land reclamation that has been undertaken since its opening. During the early twentieth century, the path was popular with and frequented daily by sedan chair drivers, who would take advantage of the shade provided by the banyan that lined the sides of the road. Although the use of sedan chairs ceased after the 1960s, the trees remain in the same place.

Deta»ôamentul de Interven»õie RapidƒÉ, DIR) (DSPI, The Special Detachment of Protection and Intervention) of the Romanian Ministry of Defense is an elite special operations unit of the Romanian military. It should not be confused with the Deta»ôamentul de Poli»õie pentru Interven»õie RapidƒÉ (DPIR/SPIR/DIR, Police Rapid Intervention Detachment) of the Police Force. They are different units, with radically different capabilities and reporting structure. History During the early 1990s, a very small special operations (SOF) detachment was born within the Romanian military. It was incorporated in what was at that time the 30th Guard Brigade, or Brigada 30 GardƒÉ \\"Mihai Viteazul\\". Referred to simply as \\"the special operations subunit\\", this small detachment was relatively unknown, even among armed forces personnel. In a few years, the unit was renamed Deta»ôamentul pentru Protec»õia Demnitarilor Militari (DPDM, \\"Detachment for the Protection of Military Dignitaries\\"). DPDM continued to be part of the 30th Guard Brigade. In 1998, the same year when the top-secret Grupul Antiterorist of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) was born, the DPDM was given its current name, Deta»ôamentul de Interven»õie RapidƒÉ, and starting with 2009 was renamed into \\"Deta»ôamentul Special de Protec»õie »ôi Interven»õie\\". In 2000, DSPI was moved again, from the 30th Guard Brigade to the Military Police. This was followed 5 years later by the reduction of the 30th Guard Brigade and its transformation into a regiment. The number of DSPI operatives continued to grow, and the detachment reached company-size soon (145 members in 2003). In December 2003, the military, which had kept the detachment secret for six years, unveiled it in a public show on television. DSPI was presented as being a small detachment of carefully selected operatives used mainly to protect military VIPs in Romania, as well as foreign VIPs visiting the country. However, when interviewed by a reporter, a DSPI operative stated that he had participated in several operations abroad, along with similar units from other NATO countries. Captain Arthur Elisei also suggested that DSPI has been partially modeled after the British SAS; the detachment has also trained with the Israeli Sayeret Mat'kal and Italy's GIS (Gruppo di Intervento Speciale). Organization 150px DSPI is a special unit inside the military, and is formed of highly skilled individuals. A very large percentage of its members are champions in martial arts, kickboxing, athletic disciplines and so on. DSPI was, until December 2003, top secret. DSPI operatives operate both in small 4- or 6-man teams and in larger teams, depending on the task to be performed. Although the detachment's main missions are VIP protection and anti-terrorist intervention, the unit is also capable of hostage rescue, airborne/seaborne assault and DA (Direct Action), which make it the Romanian equivalent of the British SAS, US Army's Delta Force or Israel's \\"Sayeret Mat'kal\\". DSPI is one of the three structures composing the Special Operations Command (created in 2005), the others being PSY OPS unit and the Batalionul 1 Opera»õii Speciale (Special Forces Battalion).

Marulan was previously known as Mooroowoolen. At the , Marulan had a population of 1,178 people. History In the early years of European settlement of Sydney, exploration southwest of Sydney was slow. In 1818, Hamilton Hume and James Meehan reached \\"the Goulburn plains\\" for the first time. Governor Lachlan Macquarie ordered the construction of the Great South Road (the basis of the northern end of the Hume Highway) in 1819 from Picton to the Goulburn Plains. The southern part of Macquarie's road ran from Sutton Forest roughly along existing minor roads to Canyonleigh, Brayton, Carrick and Towrang, where it joined the current route to Goulburn. Branching from this route (now called the Illawarra Highway at this point) just south of Sutton Forest, a road, now known as Old Argyle Road, developed in the 1820s. It ran to Bungonia, via Wingello, Tallong, and the southern outskirts of Marulan, all, except Wingello, located in Argyle County, along with Goulburn. In the early 19th century Bungonia was expected to become a major centre, but it subsequently proved unsuitable for intensive agriculture. When Thomas Mitchell rerouted the Great South Road in the 1830s, he decided to bring these two roads together and build a junction at old Marulan, with roads proceeding to Goulburn and Bungonia. When the Main Southern railway reached Marulan in 1868, the town migrated 3 km north to the railway station. Nevertheless, the old cemetery remains at the Bungonia Road intersection. A quarry is being developed near the intersection, so an interchange has been built there. In 1958, the first truck inspection station in New South Wales was opened on the outskirts of Marulan on the Hume Highway.First Truck Check Station in Operation Truck & Bus Transportation February 1959 page 61 In 1986, the town was bypassed when a dual carriageway section of the Hume Highway opened.

During the Edo period (1603-1867), another book of drawings, Toba Ehon, embedded the concept of manga. The word first came into common usage in the late 18th century, with the publication of such works as Sant≈ç Ky≈çden's picturebook Shiji no yukikai (1798), and in the early 19th century with such works as Aikawa Minwa's Manga hyakujo (1814) and the celebrated Hokusai Manga books (1814‚Äì1834) containing assorted drawings from the sketchbooks of the famous ukiyo-e artist Hokusai who lived from 1760‚Äì1849. Rakuten Kitazawa (1876‚Äì1955) first used the word \\"manga\\" in the modern sense. Japanese wood block illustration from 19th century Writers stress continuity of Japanese cultural and aesthetic traditions as central to the history of manga. They include Frederik L. Schodt, Kinko Ito,Ito, Kinko. 2004. \\"Growing up Japanese reading manga.\\" International Journal of Comic Art, 6:392-401. Adam L. Kern, and Eric Peter Nash.Nash, Eric Peter. 2009. Manga kamishibai: the art of Japanese paper theater. Abrams. . Schodt points to the existence in the 13th century of illustrated picture scrolls like Ch≈çj≈´- jinbutsu-giga that told stories in sequential images with humor and wit. Schodt also stresses continuities of aesthetic style and vision between ukiyo-e and shunga woodblock prints and modern manga (all three fulfill Eisner's criteria for sequential art).Eisner, Will. 1985. Comics & Sequential Art. Tamarac, Fl: Poorhouse Press. . While there are disputes over whether Ch≈çj≈´-jinbutsu-giga or Shigisan-engi was the first manga, both scrolls date back to about the same time period. However others like Isao Takahata, Studio Ghibli co-founder and director, contends there is no linkage with the scrolls and modern manga. Schodt and Nash also see a particularly significant role for kamishibai, a form of street theater where itinerant artists displayed pictures in a light box while narrating the story to audiences in the street. Torrance has pointed to similarities between modern manga and the Osaka popular novel between the 1890s and 1940, and argues that the development of widespread literacy in Meiji and post-Meiji Japan helped create audiences for stories told in words and pictures.Torrance, Richard. 2005. \\"Literacy and literature in Osaka, 1890-1940.\\" Journal of Japanese Studies, 31(1):27-60. Web version: http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_japanese_studies/v031/31.1torrance.html Accessed 2007-09-16. Kinko Ito also roots manga historically in aesthetic continuity with pre-Meiji art, but she sees its post-WWII history as driven in part by consumer enthusiasm for the rich imagery and narrative of the newly developing manga tradition. Ito describes how this tradition has steadily produced new genres and markets, e.g., for girls' (sh≈çjo) manga in the late 1960s and for Ladies Comics (redisu) in the 1980s. Hokusai Manga (early 19th century) Kern has suggested that kibyoshi, picture books from the late 18th century, may have been the world's first comic books. These graphical narratives share with modern manga humorous, satirical, and romantic themes. Although Kern does not believe that kibyoshi were a direct forerunner of manga, for Kern the existence of kibyoshi nonetheless points to a Japanese willingness to mix words and pictures in a popular story-telling medium. The first recorded use of the term \\"manga\\" to mean \\"whimsical or impromptu pictures\\" comes from this tradition in 1798, which, Kern points out, predates Katsushika Hokusai's better known Hokusai Manga usage by several decades.Bouquillard, Jocelyn and Christophe Marquet. 2007. Hokusai: First Manga Master. New York: Abrams. Illustrated magazines for Western expatriates introduced Western-style satirical cartoons to Japan in the late 19th century. New publications in both the Western and Japanese styles became popular, and at the end of the 1890s, American-style newspaper comics supplements began to appear in Japan, as well as some American comic strips. 1900 saw the debut of the Jiji Manga in the Jiji Shinp≈ç newspaper‚Äîthe first use of the word \\"manga\\" in its modern sense, and where, in 1902, Rakuten Kitazawa began the first modern Japanese comic strip. By the 1930s, comic strips were serialized in large-circulation monthly girls' and boys' magazine and collected into hardback volumes. Similarly, Inoue sees manga as being a mixture of image- and word-centered elements, each pre-dating the Allied occupation of Japan. In his view, Japanese image-centered or \\"pictocentric\\" art ultimately derives from Japan's long history of engagement with Chinese graphic art, whereas word- centered or \\"logocentric\\" art, like the novel, was stimulated by social and economic needs of Meiji and pre-war Japanese nationalism for a populace unified by a common written language. Both fuse in what Inoue sees as a symbiosis in manga.Inoue, Charles Shir≈ç. 1996. \\"Pictocentrism‚ÄîChina as a source of Japanese modernity.\\" In Sumie Jones, editor. 1996. Imaging/Reading Eros. Bloomington, IN: East Asian Studies Center, Indiana University. pp. 148-152. . The roots of the wide-eyed look commonly associated with manga dates back to sh≈çjo magazine illustrations during the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The most important illustrators associated with this style at the time were Yumeji Takehisa and particularly Jun'ichi Nakahara, who, influenced by his work as a doll creator, frequently drew female characters with big eyes in the early 20th century. This had a significant influence on early manga, particularly sh≈çjo manga, evident in the work of influential manga artists such as Makoto Takahashi and Riyoko Ikeda. However, other writers such as Takashi Murakami have stressed events after WWII, but Murakami sees Japan's surrender and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as having created long-lasting scars on the Japanese artistic psyche, which, in this view, lost its previously virile confidence in itself and sought solace in harmless and cute (kawaii) images. However, Takayumi Tatsumi sees a special role for a transpacific economic and cultural transnationalism that created a postmodern and shared international youth culture of cartooning, film, television, music, and related popular arts, which was, for Tatsumi the crucible in which modern manga have developed, along with Norakuro For Murakami and Tatsumi, trans- nationalism (or globalization) refers specifically to the flow of cultural and subcultural material from one nation to another. In their usage, the term does not refer to international corporate expansion, nor to international tourism, nor to cross-border international personal friendships, but to ways in which artistic, aesthetic, and intellectual traditions influence each other across national boundaries. An example of cultural trans-nationalism is the creation of Star Wars films in the US, their transformation into manga by Japanese artists, and the marketing of Star Wars manga to the US. Another example is the transfer of hip-hop culture from the US to Japan. Wong also sees a major role for trans-nationalism in the recent history of manga. Thus, these scholars see the history of manga as involving historical continuities and discontinuities between the aesthetic and cultural past as it interacts with post-WWII innovation and trans-nationalism.  After World War II  After World War II, Japanese artists subsequently gave life to their own style during the occupation (1945‚Äì1952) and post-occupation years (1952-early 1960s), when a previously militaristic and ultranationalist Japan was rebuilding its political and economic infrastructure.This section draws primarily on the work of Frederik Schodt (1986, 1996, 2007) and of Paul Gravett (2004). Time-lines for manga history are available in Mechademia, Gravett, and in articles by Go Tchiei 1998. Although Allied occupation censorship policies specifically prohibited art and writing that glorified war and Japanese militarism, those policies did not prevent the publication of other kinds of material, including manga. Furthermore, the 1947 Japanese Constitution (Article 21) prohibited all forms of censorship.The Japanese constitution is in the Kodansha encyclopedia \\"Japan: Profile of a Nation, Revised Edition\\" (1999, Tokyo: Kodansha) on pp. 692-715. Article 9: page 695; article 21: page 697. . One result was the growth of artistic creativity in this period. In the forefront of this period are two manga series and characters that influenced much of the future history of manga. These are Osamu Tezuka's Mighty Atom (Astro Boy in the United States; begun in 1951) and Machiko Hasegawa's Sazae-san (begun in 1946). Astro Boy was both a superpowered robot and a naive little boy. Tezuka never explained why Astro Boy had such a highly developed social conscience nor what kind of robot programming could make him so deeply affiliative. Both seem innate to Astro Boy, and represent a Japanese sociality and community-oriented masculinity differing very much from the Emperor-worship and militaristic obedience enforced during the previous period of Japanese imperialism. Astro Boy quickly became (and remains) immensely popular in Japan and elsewhere as an icon and hero of a new world of peace and the renunciation of war, as also seen in Article 9 of the Japanese constitution. Similar themes occur in Tezuka's New World and Metropolis. By contrast, Sazae-san (meaning \\"Ms. Sazae\\") was drawn starting in 1946 by Machiko Hasegawa, a young woman artist who made her heroine a stand-in for millions of Japanese men and especially women rendered homeless by the war. Sazae-san does not face an easy or simple life, but, like Astro Boy, she too is highly affiliative and is deeply involved with her immediate and extended family. She is also a very strong character, in striking contrast to the officially sanctioned Neo-Confucianist principles of feminine meekness and obedience to the \\"good wife, wise mother\\" (, ) ideal taught by the previous military regime.Uno, Kathleen S. 1993. \\"The death of 'Good Wife, Wise Mother'.\\" In: Andrew Gordon (editor) Postwar Japan as History.

The Japanese Psyche: Major Motifs in the Fairy Tales of Japan. Woodstock, CT: Spring Publications. Chapter 7, pp. 125-142. Sazae-san sold more than 62 million copies over the next half century. Tezuka and Hasegawa were also both stylistic innovators. In Tezuka's \\"cinematographic\\" technique, the panels are like a motion picture that reveals details of action bordering on slow motion as well as rapid zooms from distance to close-up shots. More critically, Tezuka synchronised the placement of panel with the reader's viewing speed to simulate moving pictures. Hence in manga production as in film production, the person who decides the allocation of panels (Komawari) is credited as the author while most drawing are done by assistants. This kind of visual dynamism was widely adopted by later manga artists. Hasegawa's focus on daily life and on women's experience also came to characterize later sh≈çjo manga.Sanchez, Frank (1997-2003). \\"Hist 102: History of Manga.\\" . AnimeInfo. Accessed on 2007-09-11. Between 1950 and 1969, increasingly large audiences for manga emerged in Japan with the solidification of its two main marketing genres, sh≈çnen manga aimed at boys and sh≈çjo manga aimed at girls.. See also . Accessed 2007-09-22. Up to 1969, sh≈çjo manga was drawn primarily by adult men for young female readers. Two very popular and influential male-authored manga for girls from this period were Tezuka's 1953-1956 Ribon no Kishi (Princess Knight or Knight in Ribbons) and Mitsuteru Yokoyama 1966 Mah≈çtsukai Sarii (Little Witch Sally). Ribon no Kishi dealt with the adventures of Princess Sapphire of a fantasy kingdom who had been born with male and female souls, and whose sword-swinging battles and romances blurred the boundaries of otherwise rigid gender roles. Sarii, the pre-teen princess heroine of Mah≈çtsukai Sarii,Sarii is the Japanese spelling and pronunciation of the English-language name \\"Sally\\". The word mah≈çtsukai literally means \\"magic operator\\", someone who can use and control magic. It does not mean \\"witch\\" or \\"magical girl\\" (which is mah≈ç sh≈çjo in Japanese), because tsukai is not a gendered word in Japanese. This use of an English- language name with a Japanese descriptive word is an example of transnationalism in Tatsumi's sense. came from her home in the magical lands to live on Earth, go to school, and perform a variety of magical good deeds for her friends and schoolmates. Yokoyama's Mah≈çtsukai Sarii was influenced by the US TV sitcom Bewitched, but unlike Samantha, the main character of Bewitched, a married woman with her own daughter, Sarii is a pre-teenager who faces the problems of growing up and mastering the responsibilities of forthcoming adulthood. Mah≈çtsukai Sarii helped create the now very popular mah≈ç sh≈çjo or \\"magical girl\\" subgenre of later manga. Both series were and still are very popular. = Sh≈çjo manga = In 1969, a group of women manga artists later called the Year 24 Group (also known as Magnificent 24s) made their sh≈çjo manga debut (year 24 comes from the Japanese name for 1949, when many of these artists were born). The group included Hagio Moto, Riyoko Ikeda, Yumiko ≈åshima, Keiko Takemiya, and Ryoko Yamagishi and they marked the first major entry of women artists into manga. Thereafter, sh≈çjo manga would be drawn primarily by women artists for an audience of girls and young women. In 1971, Ikeda began her immensely popular sh≈çjo manga Berusaiyu no Bara (The Rose of Versailles), a story of Oscar Fran√ßois de Jarjayes, a cross-dressing woman who was a Captain in Marie Antoinette's Palace Guards in pre- Revolutionary France.Shamoon, Deborah. 2007. \\"Revolutionary romance: The Rose of Versailles and the transformation of shojo manga.\\" Mechademia: An Annual Forum for Anime, Manga, and Fan Arts. 2:3-17. In the end, Oscar dies as a revolutionary leading a charge of her troops against the Bastille. Likewise, Hagio Moto's work challenged Neo-Confucianist limits on women's roles and activities as in her 1975 They Were Eleven, a sh≈çjo science fiction story about a young woman cadet in a future space academy.Hagio Moto 1975/1996 \\"They Were Eleven.\\" In: Matt Thorn (editor) Four Shojo Stories. San Francisco: Viz Media. . Original story published 1975; US edition 1996. These women artists also created considerable stylistic innovations. In its focus on the heroine's inner experiences and feelings, sh≈çjo manga are \\"picture poems\\" with delicate and complex designs that often eliminate panel borders completely to create prolonged, non-narrative extensions of time.McCloud, Scott. 1993. Understanding Comics. New York: Paradox Press. pp. 77‚Äì82. All of these innovations ‚Äì strong and independent female characters, intense emotionality, and complex design ‚Äì remain characteristic of sh≈çjo manga up to the present day. = Sh≈çjo manga and Ladies' Comics from 1975 to today = In the following decades (1975‚Äìpresent), sh≈çjo manga continued to develop stylistically while simultaneously evolving different but overlapping subgenres.≈ågi, Fusami 2004. \\"Female subjectivity and sh≈çjo (girls) manga (Japanese comics): sh≈çjo in Ladies' Comics and Young Ladies' Comics.\\" Journal of Popular Culture, 36(4):780-803. Major subgenres have included romance, superheroines, and \\"Ladies Comics\\" (in Japanese, redisu „É¨„Éá„Ç£„Éº„Çπ, redikomi „É¨„Éá„Ç£„Ç≥„Éü, and josei Â•≥ÊÄß „Åò„Çá„Åõ„ÅÑ), whose boundaries are sometimes indistinguishable from each other and from sh≈çnen manga. In modern sh≈çjo manga romance, love is a major theme set into emotionally intense narratives of self-realization.Drazen, Patrick 2003. Anime Explosion!: the What? Why? & Wow! of Japanese Animation. Berkeley, CA: Stone Bridge. Japanese manga/anime critic Eri Izawa defines romance as symbolizing \\"the emotional, the grand, the epic; the taste of heroism, fantastic adventure, and the melancholy; passionate love, personal struggle, and eternal longing\\" set into imaginative, individualistic, and passionate narrative frameworks.Izawa, Eri 2000. \\"√óThe romantic, passionate Japanese in anime: A look at the hidden Japanese soul\\". In: Timothy J. Craig (editor) Japan Pop! Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe. pp. 138-153. . Accessed 2007-09-23. These romances are sometimes long narratives that can deal with distinguishing between false and true love, coping with sexual intercourse, and growing up in an ambivalent world, themes inherited by subsequent animated versions of the story. These \\"coming of age\\" or Bildungsroman themes occur in both sh≈çjo and sh≈çnen manga.In German, Bildung means \\"education\\" and Roman means \\"novel,\\" hence a Bildungsroman is a novel about the education of the protagonist in \\"the ways of the world.\\"Moretti, Franco 1987. The Way of the World: The Bildungsroman in European Culture. London: Verso. . In the Bildungsroman, the protagonist must deal with adversity and conflict, and examples in sh≈çjo manga of romantic conflict are common. They include Miwa Ueda's Peach Girl, Fuyumi Soryo's Mars, and, for older readers, Moyoco Anno's Happy Mania, Yayoi Ogawa's Tramps Like Us, and Ai Yazawa's Nana. In another sh≈çjo manga Bildungsroman narrative device, the young heroine is transported to an alien place or time where she meets strangers and must survive on her own (including Hagio Moto's They Were Eleven, Kyoko Hikawa's From Far Away, Y√ª Watase's Fushigi Y√ªgi: The Mysterious Play, and Chiho Saito's The World Exists For Me). Yet another such device involves meeting unusual or strange people and beings, for example, Natsuki Takaya's Fruits Basket‚Äîone of the most popular sh≈çjo manga in the United States\\"Top 50 Manga Properties for Spring 2007: Fruits Basket.\\" ICv2 Guide to Manga, Number 45, pp. 6, 8.‚Äîwhose orphaned heroine Tohru must survive living in the woods in a house filled with people who can transform into the animals of the Chinese zodiac. In Harako Iida's Crescent Moon, heroine Mahiru meets a group of supernatural beings, finally to discover that she herself too has a supernatural ancestry when she and a young tengu demon fall in love. With the superheroines, sh≈çjo manga continued to break away from neo-Confucianist norms of female meekness and obedience. Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon (Bish≈çjo Senshi Sƒìram≈´n: \\"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon\\") is a sustained, 18-volume narrative about a group of young heroines simultaneously heroic and introspective, active and emotional, dutiful and ambitious.Allison, Anne 2000. \\"Sailor Moon: Japanese superheroes for global girls.\\" In: Timothy J. Craig (editor) Japan Pop! Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe. pp. 259-278. .Grigsby, Mary 1999 \\"The social production of gender as reflected in two Japanese culture industry products: Sailormoon and Crayon Shinchan.\\" In: John A. Lent, editor Themes and Issues in Asian Cartooning: Cute, Cheap, Mad, and Sexy. Bowling Green, OH: Bowling Green State University Popular Press. pp. 183-210. . The combination proved extremely successful, and Sailor Moon became internationally popular in both manga and anime formats. Another example is CLAMP's Magic Knight Rayearth, whose three young heroines, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu, are magically transported to the world of Cefiro to become armed magical warriors in the service of saving Cefiro from internal and external enemies. The superheroine subgenre also extensively developed the notion of teams (sentai) of girls working together,Poitras, Gilles 2001. Anime Essentials: Everything a Fan Needs to Know. Berkeley, CA: Stone Bridge. . like the \\"Sailor Senshi\\" in Sailor Moon, the Magic Knights in Magic Knight Rayearth, and the Mew Mew girls from Mia Ikumi's Tokyo Mew Mew. By today, the superheroine narrative template has been widely used and parodied within the sh≈çjo manga tradition (e.g., Nao Yazawa's Wedding Peach and Hyper Rune by Tamayo Akiyama) and outside that tradition, e.g., in bish≈çjo comedies like Kanan's Galaxy Angel. In the mid-1980s and thereafter, as girls who had read sh≈çjo manga as teenagers matured and entered the job market, sh≈çjo manga elaborated subgenres directed at women in their 20s and 30s. This \\"Ladies Comic\\" or redisu-josei subgenre has dealt with themes of young adulthood: jobs, the emotions and problems of sexual intercourse, and friendships or love among women.Ito, Kinko 2002. \\"The world of Japanese 'Ladies Comics': From romantic fantasy to lustful perversion.\\" Journal of Popular Culture, 36(1):68-85.Ito, Kinko 2003. \\"Japanese Ladies' Comics as agents of socialization: The lessons they teach.\\" International Journal of Comic Art, 5(2):425-436.Jones, Gretchen 2002. \\"'Ladies' Comics': Japan's not-so- underground market in pornography for women.\\" U.S.-Japan Women's Journal (English Supplement), Number 22, pp. 3-31.Shamoon, Deborah. 2004. \\"Office slut and rebel flowers: The pleasures of Japanese pornographic comics for women.\\" In: Linda Williams (editor) Porn Studies.

Accessed 2007-12-28. Sh≈çnen, seinen, and seijin manga share a number of features in common. Boys and young men were among the earliest readers of manga after World War II. From the 1950s on, sh≈çnen manga focused on topics thought to interest the archetypical boy: sci-tech subjects like robots and space travel, and heroic action-adventure. Early sh≈çnen and seinen manga narratives often portrayed challenges to the protagonist‚Äôs abilities, skills, and maturity, stressing self-perfection, austere self-discipline, sacrifice in the cause of duty, and honorable service to society, community, family, and friends. Manga with solitary costumed superheroes like Superman, Batman, and Spider-Man did not become popular as a sh≈çnen genre. An exception is Kia Asamiya's Batman: Child of Dreams, released in the US by DC Comics and in Japan by Kodansha. However, lone antiheroes occur in Takao Saito's Golgo 13 and Koike and Kojima's Lone Wolf and Cub. Golgo 13 is about an assassin who puts his skills to the service of world peace and other social goals,Golgo: http://www.viz.com/products/products.php?series_id=411. review: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/golgo-13-gn-4. Accessed 2007-12-28. and Ogami Itto, the swordsman-hero of Lone Wolf and Cub, is a widower caring for his son Daigoro while he seeks vengeance against his wife's murderers. However, Golgo and Itto remain men throughout and neither of them ever displays superpowers. Instead, these stories \\"journey into the hearts and minds of men\\" by remaining on the plane of human psychology and motivation.See http://www.darkhorse.com/reviews/archive.php?theid=215 for the quoted phrase. Accessed 2007-12-28. Many sh≈çnen manga have science fiction and technology themes. Early examples in the robot subgenre included Tezuka‚Äôs Astro Boy (see above) and Fujiko F. Fujio's 1969 Doraemon, about a robot cat and the boy he lives with, which was aimed at younger boys. The robot theme evolved extensively, from Mitsuteru Yokoyama's 1956 Tetsujin 28-go to later, more complex stories where the protagonist must not only defeat enemies, but learn to master himself and cooperate with the mecha he controls.Schodt, Frederik L. 1988. \\"Robots of the Imagination\\". In Inside the Robot Kingdom: Japan, Mechatronics, and the Coming Robotopia. Chapter 4, pp. 73‚Äì90. Tokyo:Kodansha International. Thus, in Neon Genesis Evangelion by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Shinji struggles against the enemy and against his father, and in Vision of Escaflowne by Katsu Aki, Van not only makes war against Dornkirk‚Äôs empire but must deal with his complex feelings for Hitomi, the heroine. Sports themes are also popular in manga for male readers. These stories stress self-discipline, depicting not only the excitement of sports competition but also character traits the hero needs to transcend his limitations and to triumph. Examples include boxing (Tetsuya Chiba's 1968-1973 Tomorrow's Joe and Rumiko Takahashi's 1987 One-Pound Gospel) and basketball (Takehiko Inoue‚Äôs 1990 Slam DunkMasanao Amano, editor. 2004. Manga Design. K√∂ln:Taschen. pp. 92-95. . ; http://comipress.com/article/2006/12/15/1160. Accessed 2007-12-24.). Supernatural settings have been another source of action-adventure plots in sh≈çnen and some sh≈çjo manga in which the hero must master challenges. Sometimes the protagonist fails, as in Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata's Death Note, where protagonist Light Yagami receives a notebook from a Death God (shinigami) that kills anyone whose name is written in it, and, in a sh≈çjo manga example, Hakase Mizuki's The Demon Ororon, whose protagonist abandons his demonic kingship of Hell to live and die on earth. Sometimes the protagonist himself is supernatural, like Kohta Hirano's Hellsing, whose vampire hero Alucard battles reborn Nazis hellbent on conquering England, but the hero may also be (or was) human, battling an ever-escalating series of supernatural enemies (Hiromu Arakawa's Fullmetal Alchemist, Nobuyuki Anzai's Flame of Recca, and Tite Kubo's Bleach). Military action-adventure stories set in the modern world, for example, about WWII, remained under suspicion of glorifying Japan‚Äôs Imperial history and have not become a significant part of the sh≈çnen manga repertoire. Nonetheless, stories about fantasy or historical military adventure were not stigmatized, and manga about heroic warriors and martial artists have been extremely popular. Some are serious dramas, like Sanpei Shirato's The Legend of Kamui and Rurouni Kenshin by Nobuhiro Watsuki, but others contain strongly humorous elements, like Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball. Although stories about modern war and its weapons do exist, they deal as much or more with the psychological and moral problems of war as they do with sheer shoot-'em-up adventure. Examples include Seiho Takizawa's Who Fighter, a retelling of Joseph Conrad's story Heart of Darkness about a renegade Japanese colonel set in WWII Burma, Kaiji Kawaguchi's The Silent Service, about a Japanese nuclear submarine, and Motofumi Kobayashi's Apocalypse Meow, about the Vietnam War told in talking animal format. Other battle and fight-oriented manga sometimes focus on criminal and espionage conspiracies to be overcome by the protagonist, such as in Crying Freeman by Kazuo Koike and Ryoichi Ikegami, City Hunter by Hojo Tsukasa, and the sh≈çjo series From Eroica with Love by Yasuko Aoike, a long-running crime-espionage story combining adventure, action, and humor (and another example of how these themes occur across demographics). For manga critics Koji Aihara and Kentaro Takekuma, such battle stories endlessly repeat the same mindless themes of violence, which they sardonically label the \\"Shonen Manga Plot Shish Kebob\\", where fights follow fights like meat skewered on a stick. Other commentators suggest that fight sequences and violence in comics serve as a social outlet for otherwise dangerous impulses.Berek-Lewis, Jason. July 13, 2005. Comics in an Age of Terror.

Sex and women's roles in manga for males In early sh≈çnen manga, men and boys played all the major roles, with women and girls having only auxiliary places as sisters, mothers, and occasionally girlfriends. Of the nine cyborgs in Shotaro Ishinomori's 1964 Cyborg 009, only one is female, and she soon vanishes from the action. Some recent sh≈çnen manga virtually omit women, e.g., the martial arts story Baki the Grappler by Itagaki Keisuke and the supernatural fantasy Sand Land by Akira Toriyama. However, by the 1980s, girls and women began to play increasingly important roles in sh≈çnen manga, for example, Toriyama's 1980 Dr. Slump, whose main character is the mischievous and powerful girl robot Arale Norimaki. The role of girls and women in manga for male readers has evolved considerably since Arale. One class is the pretty girl (bish≈çjo).For multiple meanings of bish≈çjo, see . Sometimes the woman is unattainable, but she is generally an object of the hero's emotional and sexual interest, like Belldandy from Oh My Goddess! by K≈çsuke Fujishima and Shao-lin from Guardian Angel Getten by Minene Sakurano.Guardian Angel Getten, by Sakurano Minene. Raijin Graphic Novels/Gutsoon! Entertainment, Vols. 1‚Äì4, 2003-2004. In other stories, the hero is surrounded by such girls and women, as in Negima by Ken Akamatsu and Hanaukyo Maid Team by Morishige.Negima, by Ken Akamatsu. Del Rey/Random House, Vols. 1‚Äì15, 2004‚Äì2007; Hanaukyo Maid Team, by Morishige. Studio Ironcat, Vols. 1-3, 2003-2004. The male protagonist does not always succeed in forming a relationship with the woman, for example when Bright Honda and Aimi Komori fail to bond in Shadow Lady by Masakazu Katsura. In other cases, a successful couple's sexual activities are depicted or implied, like Outlanders by Johji Manabe.Outlanders: http://www.angelfire.com/anime/mangatemple/outlanders.html. Other stories feature an initially naive hero subsequently learning how to deal and live with women emotionally and sexually, like Yota in Video Girl Ai by Masakazu Katsura, Train Man in Train Man: Densha Otoko by Hidenori Hara, and Makoto in Futari Ecchi by Katsu Aki.Train Man: Densha Otoko, Hidenori Hara.

Accessed 2007-12-28. As of 2013 national censorship laws and local ordinances remain in Japan and the public response to the publication of manga with sexual content or the depiction of nudity has been mixed. Series have an audience and sell well but their publication also encounters opposition. In the early 1990s the opposition resulted in the creation of Harmful manga lists and a shift in the publishing industry. By this time large publishers had created a general manga demand but the corollary is that they were also susceptible to public opinion in their markets. Faced with criticism from certain segments of the population and under pressure from industry groups to self-regulate, major publishing houses discontinued series, such as Angel and 1+2=Paradise, while smaller publication companies, not as susceptible to these forces, were able to fill the void. With the relaxation of censorship in Japan after the early 1990s, various forms of graphically drawn sexual content appeared in manga intended for male readers that correspondingly occurred in English translations. These depictions ranged from partial to total nudity through implied and explicit sexual intercourse through sadomasochism (SM), incest, rape, and sometimes zoophilia (bestiality).Perper, Timothy and Martha Cornog 2003 \\"Sex, love, and women in Japanese comics.\\" In Robert T.

The Comics Journal, No. 143, pp. 111‚Äì115. = Gekiga = Gekiga literally means \\"drama pictures\\" and refers to a form of aesthetic realism in manga. Gekiga style storytelling tends to be emotionally dark, adult-oriented, and sometimes deeply violent, focusing on the day-in, day-out realities of life, often drawn in gritty fashion. Gekiga arose in the late 1950s and 1960s partly from left-wing student and working class political activism and partly from the aesthetic dissatisfaction of young manga artists like Yoshihiro Tatsumi with existing manga. Examples include Sanpei Shirato's 1959‚Äì1962 Chronicles of a Ninja's Military Accomplishments (Ninja Bugeich≈ç), the story of Kagemaru, the leader of a peasant rebellion in the 16th century, which dealt directly with oppression and class struggle, and Hiroshi Hirata's Satsuma Gishiden, about uprisings against the Tokugawa shogunate.Hirata: http://www.darkhorse.com/search/search.php?frompage=userinput&sstring;=Hirata&x;=11&y;=9 Accessed 2007-12-19. Gekiga can be seen as the Japanese equivalent of the graphic novel culture happening in Europe (Hugo Pratt, Didier Comes, Jacques Tardi) and in the U.S. (Will Eisners A Contract with God, Art Spiegelmans Maus, Robert Crumbs autobiographical works) and in South America (Alberto Breccia, Hector Oesterheld). For that reason typical graphic novel publishers as Drawn & Quarterly and Fantagraphics started publishing many English version of Japanese Gekiga highlights in more recent years. As the social protest of these early years waned, gekiga shifted in meaning towards socially conscious, mature drama and towards the avant-garde. Examples include Koike and Kojima's Lone Wolf and Cub and Akira, an apocalyptic tale of motorcycle gangs, street war, and inexplicable transformations of the children of a future Tokyo. Another example is Osamu Tezuka's 1976 manga MW, a bitter story of the aftermath of the storage and possibly deliberate release of poison gas by U.S. armed forces based in Okinawa years after World War II. Gekiga and the social consciousness it embodies remain alive in modern-day manga. An example is Ikebukuro West Gate Park from 2001 by Ira Ishida and Sena Aritou, a story of street thugs, rape, and vengeance set on the social margins of the wealthy Ikebukuro district of Tokyo.

He performed on stage and television. His comedy records sold over a quarter of a million copies. His stage shows are most closely associated with the Group Theatre, where his one man show gained a listing in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest running in the world. He also toured extensively across Ireland, Canada and the United States. He is best remembered for the characters in his sketches, which uniquely reflected the character of the people of Belfast. These included \\"Orange Lily\\", \\"The Lady from Cherryvalley\\", and \\"Derek the Window Cleaner\\" from the BBC Radio Ulster series The McCooeys. He was also one of the first comedians to confront the Troubles in his material, while still appealing to both sides of the divided community. A blue plaque in his memory is displayed at his birthplace in Union Street, Ballymoney and at his family's home in Fernwood Street, Ormeau Road, Belfast.  Life  James Alexander Young was born on 23 May 1918 at 33 Union Street Ballymoney, the fourth child of Alexander Young, a bread server, and Grace Woodrow. In the economic uncertainty following World War I, the Youngs moved to the industrial Belfast where Alexander found work as a stable hand for a local bakery. Until the age of 14, Young attended the Cooke Church School off the Ravenhill Road. Even at this early stage Youngs natural talent for humour was evident. His mother would often tell \\"stop impersonating the visitors. Because after you do, I find it impossible to take them seriously.\\" During his youth, Young's mother would frequently take him to the theatres around Belfast. At the age of 6 Young went with his mother to see a show starring Jimmy O'Dea. O'Dea would be a massive influence on Young who, like Young, was a highly skilled comic and female impersonator. He would also be influenced by many visiting English music hall acts. At the age of 14 Young left school and found work as a rent collector for a local estate agent. Young collected rent from some of the toughest districts in Belfast. Young visited homes in the Falls Road, Shankill Road and Crumlin Road areas of the town. It was during these visits he would find the inspiration for many of his future comedy characters. After two years, Young tired of collecting rent and volunteered for the Savoy Players, an English company based at the Grand Opera House during World War II. Young performed the odd jobs backstage for the company but soon wanted to appear on stage. He joined the Youth Hostel Association Drama Group in 1943 and in the first year he won the award for best actor for his performance in A Story For Today by Jack Loudan. Due in part to the praise for his performance in A Story For Today, Young was offered a role in the Ulster Group Theatre's production of Joseph Tomelty's Right Again, Barnum. Young appeared in further Group Theatre productions and productions for other companies in Belfast but in 1944 Young left Northern Ireland to seek greater success in England. He found work in a repertory company based at the Stockport Hippodrome near Manchester appearing in over a hundred productions across different genres. He soon left the company and joined the West End production of Se√°n O'Casey's Red Roses for Me. The play ran for seven months and was a great success. Following this, Young got to work with his hero Jimmy O'Dea in his production of Phil the Flutter's Ball. However, following an accident with a member of the audience, Young was let go from the show. Young then joined a show that was being arranged by ENSA and was due to tour the Middle East. Whilst on the tour Young was to meet Jack Hudson who would become a major part of his personal and professional life until his death. At the end of the tour Young started to feel home sick for Northern Ireland and he, along with Hudson, returned to Belfast. They moved into a flat on the Newtownards Road above a butcher's shop. Young returned to the Ulster Group Theatre while Hudson became a manager of a local ballroom. Success was not forthcoming and for a time Young and Hudson considered emigrating to Australia. Young's luck was to change, however, when he was cast in Joseph Tomelty's BBC Radio Ulster series The McCooeys. Tomelty devised a character called Derek loosely based on the character Young played in Right Again, Barnum. Derek was the camp window cleaner of the title characters. Derek appeared in only five episodes of the series but was a massive hit with the public and made Young a household name. Young soon began to receive lucrative offers to make appearances that were the equivalent of several months work at the Group. Driven by this success Young and Hudson formed James Young Productions and were soon making appearances across the country. The shows featured Young and Hudson in sketches interspersed with musical and dance numbers. In 1951 Young was offered his own BBC Radio series. The Young Idea was another success and spawned several series in the following years. The series continued to raise Young's profile and in 1954 he realised his dream of appearing in his own show at the Grand Opera House. Young established a lucrative pattern of Spring and Autumn shows in the Empire Theatre, Belfast, summer shows in Bangor, a radio series and shows in London. However the Empire's owners decided to sell the venue and it eventually became a Littlewoods store. Following the withdrawal of Sam Thompson's play Over The Bridge from Ulster Group Theatre, Young was invited to bring his unique comedy talents to the venue. Young asked one of his popular sketch writers Sam Cree to adapt Glenn Melvyn's The Love Match for an Ulster audience. The play premiered on 8 March 1960 and ran for ten weeks. The play was a success and Young and Hudson were invited to become joint managing directors of the Group Theatre in Autumn 1960. Around this time Young and Hudson's relationship moved from a personal to a more business based arrangement. However, the two would remain firm friends and colleagues for the rest of Young's life. The Group Theatre became Young's theatrical home for the next decade and he would premiere hit play after hit play. Young would function as director and star of these plays which he would alternate with a string of successful one man shows. Recordings of these one man shows would form the basis for a series of comic records released by Emerald Records. He was listed in the Guinness Book of Records for having the longest running one man show ever and it was also claimed that he sold more albums in Northern Ireland than The Beatles. Young also toured his one-man shows in Canada and America playing in the Wilshire Ebell Theatre. In 1972 Young was at the height of his career and BBC Northern Ireland offered him the chance to appear in this own television series. The first episode of the show, Saturday Night, aired on 14 October 1972. In 1974 Young telephoned Hudson to inform him that there had been mysterious enquiries into his date of birth. Hudson's suspicion that Young was to be nominated in the New Year's honours list were apparently correct. Young was due to be awarded an MBE at the start of 1975. However, Young was never to receive his award. While driving home on the afternoon of 5 July 1974 Young suffered a massive heart attack and was pronounced dead at the scene. In 2013 a biographical play about Young was shelved after the Sunday World, a sensationalist Belfast tabloid, published unsubstantiated allegations that he had been involved in child abuse.Eithne Shortall, \\"The show won't go on for Our Jimmy\\", The Sunday Times, 13 January 2013 Theatre credits The following is a list of plays in which Young performed in the premiere production. =As actor and director= *The Love Match (1960) - By Glenn Melvyn, Adapted for a Northern Irish setting by Sam Cree (As Alec Galbraith) *Wedding Fever (1960) - By Sam Cree (As Alec Galbraith) *All the King's Horses (1961) - By John McDonnell (As William MacStay) *Friends and Neighbours (1962) - By Austin Steele, Adapted for a Northern Irish setting by Young & John McDonnell (As Alec Galbraith) *Love Locked Out (1963) - By David Kirk, Adapted for a Northern Irish setting by Young & John McDonnell (As Charlie Doherty) *An Apple a Day (1963) - By John McDonnell (As Andy Adams) *Wish You Were Here (1964) By John McDonnell (As Albert McFetridge) *Silver Wedding (1964) By John McDonnell (As Alec Galbraith) *Holiday Spirit (1965) By John McDonnell (As Harold Swann and Female Ghost) *Sticks and Stones (1965) By John McDonnell (As William Thompson) *Lucky Break (1966) - By John McDonnell (As Lucky Gallaher) *The Wrong Fut (1966) By John McDonnell (As Alec Galbraith) *Up the Long Ladder (1967) By John McDonnell (As Billy Bothwell) *The Cat and the Fiddle (1971) By John McDonnell =As actor= *Right Again, Barnum (1943) By Joseph Tomelty (As Willie John Marley) *Stars of Brickfield Street By John Coulter *Mountain Post (1948) - By George Shiels (As Albert Magellan) *Bannister's Cafe (1949) - By Harry Sinton Gibson (As William McNinch) *Master Adams By Patricia O'Connor (As John the Post) *All Soul's Night (1949) - By Joseph Tomelty (As A Figure) *A Title for Buxey (1949) - By Cecil Cree (Percy Todd) *Arty (1951) - By J.R.

While the game initially drew positive attention for its unique gameplay concepts, such as black-and-white graphics and emphasis on psychological horror over violence, Sadness became notorious when no evidence of a playable build was ever publicly released during the four years it spent in development. It was revealed that Sadness had entered development hell due to problems with deadlines and relationships with external developers, leading to its eventual cancellation by 2010,https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/25/composer-says-wiis- sadness-was-cancelled-releases-soundtrack/ along with the permanent closure of the company. Concept Sadness was promoted as a unique and realistic survival horror game that would \\"surprise players,\\" focusing on psychological horror rather than violence, containing \\"associations with narcolepsy, nyctophobia and paranoid schizophrenia.\\" More notable was the announcement that the game would sport black-and-white visuals stylized as gothic horror. Nibris promised that Sadness would provide \\"extremely innovative game play,\\" fully utilizing the motion sensing capabilities of both the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk. For example, it was suggested that players would use the Wii Remote to wield a torch and wave it to scare off rats; swinging the controller like a lasso in order to throw a rope over a wall; or picking up items by reaching out with the Wii Remote and grabbing them. Sadness was also planned to have open-ended interactivity between the player and the game's objects, being able to use any available item as a weapon. Suggestions included breaking a glass bottle and using the shards as a knife, or breaking the leg off a chair and using it as a club. The game would also not utilize in-game menus (all game saves would be done in the background) nor a HUD in favor of greater immersion. =Story= Set in pre-World War I Russian Empire (modern Ukraine), Sadness was to follow the player character Maria Lengyel, a Victorian era aristocrat of Polish-Hungarian descent who has to protect her son Alexander after their train to Lviv derails in the countryside. Alexander, who is struck blind by the accident, begins to exhibit strange behavior that progressively worsens. The game's scenarios and enemies, such as those based on the werewolf and the likho, are inspired by Slavic mythology. In order to \\"make the player feel that he is participating in events [and] not merely playing a game,\\" the game was planned to feature a branching storyline, influenced by the player's actions and concluding with one out of ten possible endings. History Sadness was announced by Nibris on March 7, 2006 as a title for Nintendo's Revolution (before its final name \\"Wii\\" was announced), later releasing a live action concept trailer which demonstrated potential Wii Remote control in gameplay.Sadness E3 Trailer at IGN. 10 May 2006. Nibris partnered with Frontline Studios, who would be in charge of the game programming, and Digital Amigos, who would develop the game visuals, and it was reported that the game would be released by the fourth quarter of 2007. From 2007 onward, Nibris drew criticism from various websites and blogs for lack of evidence of the game in action, such as playable demos, trailers, or screenshots. Speculation that Sadness was vaporware intensified following a number of events, particularly the announcement that Frontline Studios was no longer working on the project (citing \\"artistic differences\\") and the game's delay to 2009. Several Nibris announcements were never realized, such as a new trailer by late 2007 or an appearance at the 2008 Game Developer's Conference. Joystiq labeled Sadness as both a \\"comedy of errors\\" and a \\"public embarrassment.\\" Fog Studios, Nibris' marketing partner, responded to the accusations on vaporware on at least two occasions, once in June 2008 and again in September 2009, insisting that Sadness development was still underway, but was in need of a publisher. In May 2009, N-Europe interviewed Adam Artur Antolski, a former Nibris employee and scriptwriter for Sadness, who revealed that the game's delays were caused by prolonged dispute over the game design, which led to constant failures to meet deadlines. Antolski asserted that because no consensus could be made among the staff and with Frontline, the only progress made during the first year was completion of the script, concept design, and \\"only one 3D object - some minecart I believe.\\" When asked regarding an announcement that Nibris would be present at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, Antolski responded \\"Nibris always was better in promoting than making anything.\\" Nibris was later absent from E3 2009, and the game silently missed the projected 2009 release date. Nibris' official website, which had not been updated since its announcement of appearing at GDC 2008, closed in February 2010. On April 5, N-Europe reported that Arkadiusz Reikowski, one of the game's music composers, released some of his unfinished work to the public and confirmed that Sadness had been abandoned by Nibris and was no longer in the works. In October Nibris itself transformed into a coordinator for the European Center of Games, ceasing game development permanently, and remaining staff and projects were also reported to have been handed over to Bloober Team, another game developer.

Including khoms tax, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, defense and relations with Christians and Jews.\\"Traditionally\\" they were not part of public law, such questions either came under the heading of worship (\`ebadat) or were considered to be in the domain of private law, in so far as they were applied in courts convened outside the state apparatus by clerics at the request of the contending parties.\\" A sort of mediation/conciliation operation, not command of the state. (Schirazi, The Constitution of Iran, p.166-7) Author Baqer Moin noted Khomeini dealt with the question of Islamic government, stating that the Imam, or leader of the Muslim community, has the right to fix prices and otherwise regulate commerce if he feels it is \\"in the interest of Islamic society\\". He also dealt with the issue of foreign policy and the necessity of preventing \\"the Muslim community from falling under the influence of foreigners\\". At least as of April 2013 a text of the book (or much of it) translated into English and organized with an index divided the book into 120 or so links can be found online. The book is divided into 20 sections, each which may have between one and thirty links depending on its length.Index (TAHRIR AL-WASILAH in English) Excerpts from the book translated into English can also be found in the book A Clarification of Questions: an Unabridged Translation of Resaleh Towzih al-Masael by Ayatollah Sayyed Ruhollah Mousavi Khomeini, Translated by J. Borujerdi, with a Foreword by Michael M. J. Fischer and Mehdi Abedi, Westview Press/ Boulder and London, c1984. =\\"New occurrences\\"= According to author Asghar Schirazi, Khomeini attempted to update shari‚Äôah law in his Tahrir al-Vasileh with 105 legal rulings (fatawa) for the modern world on mostahdasat or \\"new occurrences\\": *10 on insurance, *6 on foreign exchange bureaux, *8 on paying indemnity, *12 on banks, *7 on lotteries, *10 on artificial insemination, *7 on autopsy and organ transplantation, *10 on sex change, *11 on radio, television, etc., *18 on prayer and fasting in aeroplane or at the earth's poles, and *6 on outer space.Schirazi, The Constitution of Iran, p. 169-170 =Apostasy= Khomeini deals with the different kinds of apostates from Islam (innate-apostate and national apostates), the appropriate punishment for leaving Islam (death for men, imprisonment for women). What constitutes evidence (the witnessing of two just men and by confession). Children of apostates may be considered apostates themselves, even if they never accepted Islam because: \\"The child of a Moslem or that of an apostate, whether national or innate, is considered Moslem before the father's apostasy, and therefore, if the child reached puberty and chose infidelity he will be asked to repent (and to return to Islam), else he will be executed.\\"Tahrir al- Vasileh, volume 2, p.494-496, Quoted in Resaleh Towzih al-Masael translation, circa p.429 =\\"Blood money\\"= \\"Blood money\\", (Diyya) ‚Äî the amount paid in compensation to the family of a murder victim ‚Äî varies according to the religion and gender of the victim. *The fine for the premeditated killing of a Muslim man should be \\"10,000 derhams, 1,000 dinars, or 100 camels\\";Dinars and derham are traditional Islamic currency. Dinar was gold and traditionally worth ten time the silver derham. (source: Middle East, a Brief History by Bernard Lewis, pp. 153-4 *8,000 derhams, 800 dinars, or 80 camels for a non- Muslim man (known as a \\"tributary,\\" i.e. a Jew, Christian, or Zoroastrians who pays tribute to the Muslim government and \\"lives under the protection of Islam,\\"); *5,000 derhams, 500 dinars, etc. for killing a Muslim woman; and *4,000 derhams, etc. for a non-Muslim woman.Tahrir al-Vasileh, volume 2, pp. 533-557. Quoted in Resaleh Towzih al-Masael translation, pp. 429-30 =Restrictions on non-Muslims= Approximately 1% of the questions in Tahrir‚Äî44 fatawa‚Äîare on \\"adherents of religions of the Book\\" (ahl-e zemmeh) according to Asghar Schirazi, in The Constitution of Iran. Tahrir al-Vasileh states that if followers of the Jewish, Christianity and Zoroastrian religions \\"undertake and guarantee the conditions of tribute\\", \\"their religions will be recognized and an amount of poll tax (Jizyah) will be accepted from them\\". The \\"poll tax\\" on these non-Muslims is not necessarily a tax per individual, but depends on the \\"expediencies of time and place and the situation at hand,‚Äù and may be a tax on people, land, income, \\"beasts of burden and trees and real estate\\", set at whatever rate the Muslim government finds appropriate.Tahrir al-Vasileh, volume 2, pp. 497-507; quoted in Resaleh Towzih al-Masael translation, p.432 Tahrir al-Vasileh also lists 15 \\"Tributary Conditions‚Äù‚Äînon- financial regulations on non-Muslims‚Äîthese include some outside the bounds of equal rights for minorities: *(#6) \\"They must not establish synagogues or ring church bells.‚Äù *(#10) \\"Any building erected by the Tributary People must not stand higher than those of its neighboring Moslems.‚Äù *(#15) \\"Infidels, whether tributary or non-tributary, do not have the right to promote their religions and publish their books in Islamic countries, or to invite the Moslems and Moslem children to their religions ...‚Äù =Music= Ghena (a kind of music) is forbidden. > Performing and listening to singing (ghena'), as well as making money from > it, are forbidden.

When the Ministry of Justice declared sex reassignment surgery to be legal in 1987, it did so based completely on Tahrir al-Wasilah rather than on any law. Khomeini's ruling on the subject appears under a subsection titled \\"The Changing of Sex\\" within the section on \\"The Examination of Contemporary Questions (al-masa‚Äôil al-mustahdithah)\\". Controversies The book has been the target of some polemics by some critics of Khomeini, owing to certain passages which seem to sanction sexual practices with minors, including toddlers. While Tahrir al-Wassilah has been called \\"substantial\\" and responsible for raising Khomeini's \\"status as a jurist\\", one critic alleges the book was actually of poor quality. Amir Taheri claims the \\"book's Arabic was so ungrammatical and peppered with Persian words no Arab would understand that it had to be almost entirely rewritten by a group of Lebanese Shi'ites before its eventual publication in Tehran in 1984.\\"Taheri, Amir, The Spirit of Allah : Khomeini and the Islamic Revolution, p.112 Another criticism is that as Khomeini's major work on Islamic law, the book's contents belie the author's later claims for the potential of government based purely on Sharia ‚Äî Islamic law. Namely that: > The entire system of government and administration, together with necessary > laws, lies ready for you. If the administration of the country calls for > taxes, Islam has made the necessary provision; and if laws are needed, Islam > has established them all. There is no need for you, after establishing a > government, to sit down and draw up laws, or, like rulers who worship > foreigners and are infatuated with the west, run after others to borrow > their laws. Everything is ready and waiting.Governance of the Jurist by Imam > Khomeini (see section 4, Program for the Establishment of an Islamic > Government) According to author Asghar Schirazi, even when the Khomeini attempts to update fiqh with a section on \\"new occurrences\\", \\"the solutions offered would be too primitive and meager to meet the needs of a 20th-century society.\\" According to the fatawa of Tahrir al-Wassilah, > Listening to the radio or watching television is frequently forbidden or > only allowed provided it does not contradict the shari‚Äôa. The use of > exchange bureaux or banks is only permitted if interest is renounced. > Lotteries are forbidden, artificial insemination is only allowed if the > sperm donor is the husband of the female recipient.

Interestingly, many of > these reservations and prohibitions have been dropped in the Islamic > Republic.\\"Schirazi, Constitution of Iran, p.169 The fatawa on modern activities like banking and insurance policies have nothing to say about their proper functioning. They only deal with whether or when the activities violate Islam law; nothing on issues such as the minimum reserve requirements to make sure withdrawals can be paid if there is a run on a bank, or regulations to guarantee the solvency of an insurer.

After building up a substantial retail business with his brother Bernard Lyons (1913-2008), he was charged in 1987 in the Guinness share-trading fraud. He was convicted and was heavily fined. Subsequent judgments from the European Court of Human Rights held that his trial was not fair. However, the convictions of Lyons and the other members of the Guinness Four were upheld by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and the House of Lords. Lyons was a significant philanthropist to the arts in Britain for many decades, donating to the London Symphony Orchestra, the University of York, the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal Opera House among others. Lyons had been awarded the CBE in 1967 and knighted in 1973 for public and charitable services and services to the arts, but both these honours were rescinded in 1991 in the wake of his conviction. The British Prime Minister John Major wrote him a letter of consolation following the removal of his honours. Success in business Lyons was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, the fifth of six children born to businessman Samuel Henry Lyons (1883/4-1959) and his wife Sophie (n√©e Niman; 1885-1971), both Orthodox Jews. Samuel Lyons had emigrated to England from Poland when still a child. Samuel Lyons had established a men's clothing business, Alexandre. The company had a factory and retail shops. Lyons attended Leeds Grammar School, leaving school at the age of 16, and later moved to the United States to study business at Columbia University. While there, war was declared and Lyons could not return to the UK so he enlisted in the Canadian army but because of his poor eyesight, he was confined to working in the Board of Trade. He met his future wife, singer Roslyn Rosenbaum, in Canada, and, in 1944, he became an assistant director of the country's Prices and Trade Board.Obituary, Scotsman.com; accessed 5 May 2016. Returning to Leeds in 1945 he and his brother Bernard contributed considerably to the growth of the family business with the expansion of branches and the development of a lucrative export division during the early post-war period. This enabled the business to grow rapidly into a large conglomerate of companies called United Drapery Stores, or UDS. By the 1960s, UDS Group had succeeded in taking the lead as the United Kingdom's top retailer, with a 1,300-strong empire of retail shops. Businesses within the UDS conglomerate included: Richard Shops, Allders of Croydon, John Collier, Timpsons, Alexandre Stores, John Blundell Credit Company, John Myers catalogue mail order business, Brooks Brothers, Peter Pell, Arding & Hobbs and Whiteleys department stores, Fifty Shilling Tailors and other department and duty-free stores. The number of men's suits sold in all UDS menswear shops in the year ending January 1967 was 1,119,000. Within Allders alone growth continued throughout the 1970s to such an extent that in 1976 it became the third largest department store in the country, beaten only by Harrods and Selfridges. Meanwhile, the UDS Group had entered a new retail arena, that of the duty-free shop, when it acquired the licence to open and operate the shop at London's Heathrow airport. Attached to its Allders department store division, and later operated as Allders International, the UDS Group rapidly built up its network of duty-free shops around the world. In 1983, the UDS Group was sold to Hanson plc. With a mutual interest in musical endeavours, Lyons became acquainted with the Conservative Party Prime Minister Edward Heath, and remained close to his successor as Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher. Lyons campaigned politically for lower rates of taxation and for continued state support of the arts. In 1980 Lyons resigned from UDS and became a senior advisor to Bain & Company, the American management consultants. Lyons political connections were valuable to Bain, and he worked as a business consultant and lobbyist in the early 1980s. Guinness case and appeals Lyons was accused of having used his personal friendship with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to ensure the Guinness brewing group's offer for Distillers in 1986 was approved by the Office of Fair Trading. Thatcher replied to a letter from Lyons saying the matter would be passed to the minister then responsible, Paul Channon. The bid was subsequently unblocked. Lyons also bought a substantial block of Distillers and Guinness shares in the lead-up to the bid, with a personal guarantee from Saunders that any future losses in the value of his shares would be paid by Guinness. He was charged in 1987 in the Guinness share- trading fraud, along with Ernest Saunders, Gerald Ronson, and Anthony Parnes, and the four men became known as \\"the Guinness Four\\". He was convicted but not sent to prison because he was suffering from ill-health. However, he lost his knighthoodRichard Duce. \\"Loss of Knighthood the final indignity for Lyons.\\", The Times, London, 28 March 1991. and was fined ¬£3 million plus ¬£1 million prosecution costs.\\"Life and high-flying times of four partners in crime\\", scotsman.com; accessed 5 May 2016. British prime minister John Major wrote to Lyons after revoking Lyons' knighthood in 1991: \\"It was painful for me to have to recommend that this be done, and I would not have inflicted this on you lightly. But the rules on forfeiture and the precedents left me, I regret, no alternative. May I assure you that the service which won you the honours in the first place is still appreciated and will never be forgotten.\\" In 1995, on appeal, one count of conspiracy was quashed and his fine was cut to ¬£2.5 million. (The refund cheque of ¬£500,000 was inadvertently made out to 'Sir Jack Lyons', although by then he had lost his title). Lawyers for the Guinness Four said their clients had lost their right to silence because they were compelled to give evidence to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. A third appeal in 2001 held by the European Court of Human Rights had ruled that the defendants were denied a fair trial by being compelled in law to provide potentially self-incriminatory information to Department of Trade and Industry inspectors which was then used as primary evidence against them. This breached their right to silence. At the time of the court of human rights verdict, Lyons said: \\"I welcome this judgment so that I may yet be able to enjoy a little of my retirement without the cloud of injustice hanging over me.\\" The House of Lords finally ruled in 2002 that the convictions should stand. Philanthropy Lyons was a generous philanthropist, and was especially noted for his support of artistic causes. In 1963 Lyons established 'The Sir Jack Lyons Charitable Trust' which continues to make donations in his name. In his native Leeds, Lyons became the chairman of the Leeds Musical Festival in 1955 at the behest of his wife, after it was threatened with closure in 1953 and brought George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood in as the festival's musical director. Lyons chaired the festival's centenary festival in 1958 at which Duke Ellington and his orchestra performed and which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Lyons remained chairman of the Leeds Musical Festival for 17 years. Lyons funded the University of York's music department and a concert hall that was named for him. Lyons became a trustee of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in 1970 and the chairman of the orchestra's trust in 1974. The LSO honoured him by making Lyons their first honorary member who was not a musician in 1973. Lyons was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music and was the principal financial benefactor of a 300-seat theatre at the academy which was named after him. Lyons also funded a recording of the Anthem of Europe (the final movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's 9th Symphony) in 1972 under conductor Carlo Maria Giulini. Lyons also served as deputy chairman of the Fanfare for Europe cultural programme that marked the United Kingdom's membership of the European Economic Community in 1973. Lyons was chairman of the Shakespeare Exhibition at Stratford-upon-Avon that marked the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth. Lyons was the chairman of the commemorations for the tenth anniversary of Britain's accession to the European Economic Community in 1983 and served as the chairman of the British Bicentennial liaison committee that staged cultural celebrations to mark the United States Bicentennial in 1976. Personal life In 1943 Lyons married Roslyn Rosenbaum (1923-2014), the daughter of a Canadian eye surgeon. Rosenbaum was a singer and had trained under the Canadian opera singer Pauline Donalda.Dominic Kennedy. \\"I Just Told a White Lie.\\", The Times, London, 30 January 2001. The couple's first child was born in Canada, and they moved to England at the end of World War II; they later had two sons and two daughters.

Like its compatriot 'San Zanobi', the tree is not possessed of striking autumn colours, the leaves remaining green almost until they fall in late November.

In trials conducted by the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante, Florence, 'Plinio' sustained 7.8% defoliation and 3.9% dieback when inoculated with unnaturally high concentrations of the fungal pathogen, compared with 50% / 35.5% resp. for 'Lobel', and 95% / 100% for 'CNR118', a Field Elm (Ulmus minor) native to Italy. Cultivation Fast growing (though slower than its stablemate 'San Zanobi') in Italy, where it commences flowering in its third year. The tree is only commercially available outside Italy by mail order. It was introduced to the UK by Butterfly Conservation in 2003 and is being evaluated at several sites in Hampshire, where it has been found to be particularly successful on thin dry rendzinas. However, on more fertile soils, the relatively sparse and splaying top growth often exceeds stem and root development, necessitating judicious pruning and stake support for up to five years. As of 1 January 2018, the import of 'Plinio' to the UK from Italy is prohibited, the plant unable to qualify for a phytopassport owing to the prevalence of Elm Yellows in the region of cultivation.

The son of a London gown manufacturer, Parnes started his working life as an office boy with a stockbroker. Parnes started at the bottom, working in the Stock Exchange as a 'blue button' at A. J. Bekhor. He established a reputation for dealing with the big players of the fringe banking world. Because of his success his colleagues nicknamed him \\"The Animal\\". Parnes built up the strategic shareholding in Debenhams for Ronson and Sir Philip Harris during Burton's fiercely contested bid for the department store group. That stake helped win the bid for Sir Ralph Halpern, Burton's chairman, in a cliffhanging finish. The vote went in favour of Burton after the bid had been extended from the 3 pm Friday deadline to the following Sunday in a special dispensation by the Takeover Panel. Parnes was a big dealer who acted for some of the biggest names in the share dealing business. After working at stockbrokers A.J. Bekhor, Rowe Rudd and McNally, he became a \\"half commission\\" man (that is, an introducing broker) with Alexander Laing and Cruickshank. As well as having dealt for various clients, Parnes' relations include the former chief executive of the major British jewellery company Ratners Group Gerald Ratner and the restaurateur and club-owner Richard Caring. Anthony Parnes' son, Michael Parnes, also became a stock broker. Michael Parnes was chief executive of natural resource focused brokerage Old Park Lane Capital. The Guinness Case Parnes and others had supported the Guinness share price to enable it to merge favourably with Distillers. Described as \\"flamboyant\\" by The Scotsman, he was sentenced to two-and-a-half years on charges of false accounting and theft, but had his sentence reduced to 21 months on appeal. Parnes' case was that a reasonable man with experience in the City would not at the time have regarded what he did as dishonest. Guinness shares did not reach a price higher than was justified. He did not accept he had any responsibility to make disclosure to the Stock Exchange. The payments he received were for lawful and valuable services. He was not told that the arrangements he made for Guinness plc had not been sanctioned by its board of directors. Appeals by the Guinness four in 1991 and 1995 ended in partial success, as sentences were reduced. In 1995 Michael Heseltine, the then President of the Board of Trade, lifted a government \\"gagging order\\" preventing disclosure of evidence in the appeals of defendants in the Guinness case. While this procedure was unjust, the court felt that it did not outweigh the prosecution's arguments. The now deceased Patrick Spens, 3rd Baron Spens, a defendant in the second, Guinness II, trial, who campaigned for compensation after the charges against him were dropped, said: \\"We have tried for years to get the certificate lifted.\\" He said that the Guinness appeal would make \\"Matrix Churchill look amateurish. In Matrix Churchill three men did not go to prison; in Guinness I, they did.\\" He insisted that there was nothing wrong with the Guinness deal and says the DTI inspectors did not understand the rules of the takeover \\"game.\\" Lord Spens said that the difference between winning and losing a takeover bid could easily be an executive's job and he said: \\"Takeovers are not genteel affairs, as the inspectors would have it. They are very, very serious, life and death businesses. Little has changed in the last 10 years. They are just called different names, the practices that went on in the 1980s.\\" Personal life Parnes was married to Denise Ratner, sister of jewellery businessman Gerald Ratner.

It is popular with mountain climbers, its ascent being technically straightforward, although strenuous. From Arinsal to Camp de Refuge (650m climb) is being considered moderate meanwhile the last 862m is considered to be difficult. Several mountain lakes and tarns are found on the slopes, notably Estanys de Baiau, which lies on the western slopes, across the Spanish border. The nearest town is Arinsal, La Massana. Historically, the mountain provided ample security from invasions into Andorra. In present day, the mountain is part of the Parc Natural Comunal de les Valls del Comapedrosa national park. Geography Snow-covered Andorra mountains Coma Pedrosa, shaped like a pyramid, is situated at the northwestern border with France and Spain. It has in the past acted as a barrier between Andorra and France. The mountainous terrain of Andorra, a landlocked country, contains 65 peaks that rise to an elevation of greater than , and of the 65 peaks, Coma Pedrosa has the highest one at . Its recent exposure to tourism has attracted millions to enjoy the unique scenic beauty of its hills and valleys. The higher reaches of the mountain are covered with forests while the lower reaches have some arable lands. The mountain gets fully covered with snow during the winter months which provides opportunities for skiing and mountaineering, ice climbing and scrambling. During the summer season, the mountain provides many easy routes for trekking through the Arinsal valley covering neighbouring areas of Vall Ferrera in Spain after crossing Baiau, the mountain pass. The town of Arinsal is in the narrow valley below the mountain. The Coma Pedrosa's Estany Negre, the Torta Coma, Coma's Gaspedrosa, the Puestode las Erolas, Cape dels Croes, and Puig dels Emborts in the Sierra del Aguiro surround the parish of La Massana. The local area is known as Comapedrosa. The mountain is in a natural park called Parque Natural Comunal de los Valles del Comapedrosa (Communal natural park of the Comapedrosa valleys). =Vegetation= The forest vegetation in the mountain and its valleys are of pines, birch and firs. There are many glacier lakes formed within the valley created by the mountains and also vast meadows. Consequent to the popularity of skiing in and around this mountain valley near Arinsal and close to the Andorra la Vella and other valleys in Andorra, the pristine ambiance of the valley has been inundated with tourist resorts, hotels, restaurants and business establishments catering to tourists. This has created an awareness to preserve virgin mountains and forests, and put restrictions on further proliferation of ski resorts and urban activities by introducing a national network of parks as preserves.  Climate  Tourism Way to the top of Andorra Cable car station at Arinsal The trek or the mountain climb starts from Arinsal, which is considered an easy route, from the picnic area at the base of the Ribal Warefall at . It takes about 4 to 4 hours to reach the highest point of Pic de Coma Pedrosa. The first part of the climb, taking just under half an hour, is along a wide, long foot track through a sign post to Aigues Juntes, which is the confluence of the Coma Pedrosa River and Pla de l'Estany River rising from the mountains and arriving at Grau. The ascent continues along a steep hill slope of the Coma Pedrosa River valley and arrives at the Coma Pedrosa refuge or camping site at an elevation , which is located near the l'Estany de les Truites (Trout Lake). A further hour's walk leads to the Estany Negre (Black Lake), named on account of its colour. The last stretch is for about one hour from Estany Negre to the highest peak in Andorra at elevation, and this trek, passing through rocky terrain, is difficult. The return trek follows the same route. A diversion through Malhiverns pass instead of Estany Negre is more enjoyable. In the Arinsal valley below the Coma Pedrosa, winter season offers skiing and snowboarding. The first ski lifts were installed in Arinsal in 1973. It is northwest of Andorra la Vella and northwest of Massana, providing a pleasant apr√®s-ski sight. At an altitude of lies Refugi de Coma Pedrosa, a mountain hut. It was inaugurated in 1992.

He was the son of William Lovelace of Hurst, Berkshire. He was the grandson of Francis Lovelace, son of Richard Lovelace, 1st Baron Lovelace. Despite being born into an aristocratic family, the 3rd Baron Lovelace had weakened the family's fortunes through gambling, leaving John heavily in debt. He therefore served in the military following the inheritance of his peerage. In 1701, Lord Lovelace married Charlotte, the daughter of Sir John Clayton, but her poor dowry little improved his financial situation. The couple had six children: John Lovelace, 5th Baron Lovelace (d.1705), Charlotte (d.1705), Charles (d.1707), Wentworth (d.1709), Neville Lovelace, 6th Baron Lovelace (d.1736) and Martha (d.1788), who married Lord Henry Beauclerk in 1739. No portraits of the 4th Baron Lovelace have surfaced to date. However, in 1705 he was described by an English writer named John Macky as follows: \\"Lieutenant Colonel of the Horse Guards; a very pretty gentleman of good sense and well at court; a short, fat brown man, not forty years old.\\" John Macky.

Well-received by the Assemblies of both colonies, he proceeded to convict several of Cornbury's supporters, members of the corrupt Cornbury Ring, including former Governor Jeremiah Basse. Lord Lovelace was granted ¬£1600 by a revenue bill on 5 May 1709.

It stars Justin Fletcher and Sarah-Jane Honeywell, as two adolescent friends who share a house and whose eccentric exploits are the subject of the show. The BBC described the show as \\"comedy, learning, and fun for pre school children.\\" Format \\"Higgledy House\\" was filmed in a house in Fortis Green, London, which provides the main and only setting for each episode. (The only exception is the episode of Camcorder, which was filmed in a different garden in London.) Sarah-Jane and Justin never speak in the episodes, instead using visual movement, grunts, and sound to communicate. Each episode is narrated by usually two children, whereas they would interact with the characters and explain what is happening. The show started out as a segment on the series Tikkabilla; later it became a standalone series on CBeebies. Original episodes are five minutes long, but the show was later edited to combine two episodes together, introduced by a set of children (similar to the style of Teletubbies). The two episode segments were separated by a \\"Higgle Giggle\\", a brief scene of children acting out a concept or scene together.

The following year Nazi Germany occupied Latvia during the offensive of Army Group North. The German Einsatzgruppen were aided by a group known as Arajs Kommando in the killing of Latvian Jews as part of the Holocaust. Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict against their will, and in 1943 180,000 Latvian men were drafted into the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS and other German auxiliary forces. In the Baltic Offensive of autumn 1944 the Soviet Union recaptured much of its Baltic coastline, leaving 200,000 troops of Army Group North cut off in the Courland Pocket. Formed into Army Group Courland, this force held out until the end of the war in May 1945, when it surrendered to the Soviet forces and the troops were sent to prison camps. Latvia and neighbouring countries before World War II. Coup KƒÅrlis Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup d'√©tat on May 15, 1934, establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940. Most of the Baltic Germans left Latvia by agreement between Ulmanis' government and Nazi Germany after the conclusion of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. On October 5, 1939, Latvia was forced to accept a \\"mutual assistance\\" pact with the Soviet Union, granting the Soviets the right to station 25,000 troops on Latvian territory. On June 16, 1940, Vyacheslav Molotov presented the Latvian representative in Moscow with an ultimatum accusing Latvia of violations of that pact. Soviet annexation On June 17 the Red Army occupied the country. Rigged elections for a \\"People's Saeima\\" were held, and a puppet government headed by Augusts Kirhen≈°teins led Latvia into the USSR. The annexation was formalized on August 5, 1940. The ensuing months would become known in Latvia as Baigais Gads, the Year of Horror. Mass arrests, disappearances, and deportations culminated on the night of June 14, 1941. Prior to the German invasion, in less than a year, at least 27,586 persons were arrested; most were deported, and about 945 persons were shot. After the occupation of Latvia in June 1940 the annihilation of the Latvian army began. The army was renamed People‚Äôs Army, and in September‚ÄìNovember 1940, the Red Army‚Äôs 24th Territorial Rifle Corps. In September the corps contained 24,416 men but in autumn more than 800 officers and about 10,000 instructors and soldiers were discharged. The arresting of soldiers continued in the following months. In June 1940, the entire Territorial Corps was sent to Litene camp. Before leaving the camp, Latvians drafted in 1939 were demobilised, and replaced by about 4,000 Russian soldiers from area around Moscow. On June 10, the corps senior officers were sent to Russia where they were arrested and most of them shot. On June 14 at least 430 officers were arrested and sent to Gulag camps. After the German attack on the Soviet Union, from June 29 to July 1 more than 2,080 Latvian soldiers were demobilised, fearing that they might turn their weapons against the Russian commissars and officers. Simultaneously, many soldiers and officers deserted and when the corps crossed the Latvian border only about 3,000 Latvian soldiers remained. German occupation Operation Barbarossa: the German invasion of the Soviet Union, 21 June 1941 to 5 December 1941 Army Group North's objective was Leningrad via the Baltic States. Comprising the 16th and 18th Armies and 4th Panzer Group, this formation drove through Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the cities of Russian SFSR of Pskov and Novgorod. While under German occupation, Latvia was administered as part of Reichskommissariat Ostland. In 1941 empowered by the Einsatzgruppen and Nazi war criminal Franz Walter Stahlecker the far-right-wing extremist group of 500 Arajs Kommando led by Viktors ArƒÅjs participated in the Holocaust. 80,000 to 100,000 Latvian citizens were killed during the Nazi occupation, including ca. 70,000 Latvian Jews; about 20,000 Jews brought from Central and Eastern Europe were also murdered in Latvia. Nearly three years later in 1943, forced conscription of 180,000 Latvian men into the German auxiliary forces was ordered by Hitler. Latvian soldiers fought on both sides of the conflict against their will, including in the Latvian Legion of the Waffen-SS, most of them conscripted by the occupying authorities. thumb300pxSoviet advances from 1 August 1943 to 31 December 1944 While the Army Group North held back the Soviet Estonian Operation, the Soviet Operation Bagration achieved unbelievable success. Army Group Centre was in tatters, and the northern edge of the Soviet assault threatened to trap Army Group North in a pocket in Courland. Panzers of Hyazinth Graf Strachwitz von Gross-Zauche und Camminetz had been sent back to the capital of Ostland, Riga and in ferocious defensive battles had halted the Soviet advance in late April, 1944. Strachwitz had been needed elsewhere, and was soon back to acting as the Army Group's fire brigade. Strachwitz's Panzerverband was broken up in late July. By early August, the Soviets were again ready to attempt to cut off Army Group North from Army Group Centre. Battle of the Baltic Soviet operations 19 August 1944 to 31 December 1944. A massive Soviet assault sliced through the German lines and Army Group North was completely isolated from its neighbour. Strachwitz was trapped outside the pocket, and Panzerverband von Strachwitz was reformed, this time from elements of the 101st Panzer Brigade of panzer- ace Oberst Meinrad von Lauchert and the newly formed SS Panzer Brigade Gross under SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Gross. Inside the trapped pocket, the remaining panzers and StuG IIIs of the Hermann von Salza and the last of J√§hde's Tigers were formed into another Kampfgruppe to attack from the inside of the trap. On 19 August 1944, the assault, which had been dubbed Unternehmen Doppelkopf (Operation Doppelkopf) got underway. It was preceded by a bombardment by the Cruiser Prinz Eugen's 380mm guns, which destroyed forty-eight T-34s assembling in the square at Tukums. Contact was restored between the army groups. The 101.Panzerbrigade was now assigned to the army detachment \\"Narwa at the Emaj√µgi River Front in Estonia, bolstering the defenders' armour strength. Disaster had been averted, but the warning was clear. Army Group North was extremely vulnerable to being cut off. In 1944, the Red Army lifted the siege of Leningrad and re-conquered the Baltic area along with much of Ukraine and Belarus. However, some 200,000 German troops held out in Courland. They were besieged with their backs to the Baltic Sea. They were senselessly stuck there; the Red Army naturally did not pay much attention while concentrating its men and weapons on the attacks on East Prussia, Silesia, Pomerania, and ultimately Berlin. Colonel-General Heinz Guderian, the Chief of the German General Staff, insisted to Adolf Hitler that the troops in Courland should be evacuated by sea and used for the defense of the Reich. However, Hitler refused and ordered the German forces in Courland to hold out. He believed them necessary to protect German submarine bases along the Baltic coast. Soviet advances from 1 January 1945 to 7 May 1945 On January 15, 1945, Army Group Courland (Heeresgruppe Kurland) was formed under Colonel-General Dr. Lothar Rendulic. Until the end of the war, Army Group Courland (including divisions such as the Latvian Freiwiliger SS Legion) successfully defended the Courland Peninsula. It held out until May 8, 1945, when it surrendered under Colonel-General Carl Hilpert, the army group's last commander. He surrendered to Marshal Leonid Govorov, the commander of opposing Soviet forces on the Courland perimeter. At this time the group still consisted of some 31 divisions of varying strength. After May 9, 1945 approximately 203,000 troops of Army Group Courland began moving to Soviet prison camps in the East. Many soldiers evaded capture and joined the Forest Brothers resistance that waged unsuccessful guerilla warfare for several years.

MS-DOS on Amiga via Sidecar or Bridgeboard MS-DOS compatibility was a major issue during the early years of the Amiga's lifespan in order to promote the machine as a serious business machine. In order to run the MS-DOS operating system, Commodore released the Sidecar for the Amiga 1000, basically an 8088 board in a closed case that connected to the side of the Amiga. Clever programming (a library named Janus, after the two-faced Roman god of doorways) made it possible to run PC software in an Amiga window without use of emulation. At the introduction of the Sidecar the crowd was stunned to see the MS-DOS version of Microsoft Flight Simulator running at full speed in an Amiga window on the Workbench. Later the Sidecar was implemented on an expansion card named \\"Bridgeboard\\" for Amiga 2000+ models. Bridgeboard cards appeared up to 486 processor variants. The Bridgeboard card and the Janus library made the use of PC expansion cards and harddisk/floppydisk drives possible. The bridgeboard card was manufactured by Commodore, later third party cards also appeared for the Amiga 500 and Amiga 600 expansion slot such as the KCS Powerboard. Eventually, full-software emulators, such as PC-Task and PCx allowed Amigas to run MS-DOS programs, including Microsoft Windows, without additional hardware, at the costs of speed and compatibility. Amiga Transformer When Commodore introduced the Amiga 1000 in July 1985 it also unexpectedly announced a software-based IBM PC emulator for it. The company demonstrated the emulator by booting IBM PC DOS and running Lotus 1-2-3. Some who attended the demonstration were skeptical that the emulator, while impressive technically, could run with acceptable performance. The application, called Transformer, was indeed extremely slow; The 'Landmark' benchmark rated it as a 300 kHz 286, far slower than the 4.7 MHz of IBM's oldest and slowest PC. In addition, it would only run on Amigas using the 68000 microprocessor, and would not run if the Amiga had more than 512K of RAM. PCTask PCTask is a software PC emulator emulating PC Intel hardware with 8088 processor and CGA graphic modes. The latest version of it (4.4) was capable to emulate an 80386 clocked at 12 MHz and features include support for up to 16 MiB RAM (15 MB extended) under MS-DOS, up to two floppy drives and 2 hard drives. The emulator could make use of hardfile devices and then it could handle multiple hard disk files and hard disk partitions. It supported high Density floppies and CD-ROM if the Amiga hardware had mounted those devices. The graphics mode available were MDA, CGA, EGA, VGA and SVGA emulating Hercules graphic cards with 512 KiB to 2 MiB RAM, and up to 256 colors on Amiga AGA machines, and could make use of Amiga graphic boards (e.g. Cybergraphics, EGS Spectrum, Picasso). Parallel, Serial and PC speaker emulation, and mouse support, including serial mouse emulation were also granted. If the Amiga hardware is fast enough (68060 or PPC) and has enough RAM, there could be also the possibility to run multiple PC-Task processes on the same machine, run MS-DOS applications in an Amiga window on a public screen (e.g. on Amiga Workbench GUI). PCTask could also transfer files between Amiga side and the emulated MS-DOS machine; it could make use of GoldenGate bridge cards which allow the Amiga equipped with expansion slots to get complete control of its silent ISA slots and use PC-ISA cards. And latest version of it (4.4) could run even Microsoft Windows up to 95. PcTask has an 8088/80286/80486 JITM (Just in Time Machine) capable to map all instructions of these processors, but require 4 megabytes extra of RAM for activating this feature. Mac OS on Amiga History Also introduced for the Amiga were two products, A-Max (both internal and external models) and the Emplant expansion card. Both allowed the Amiga to emulate an Apple Macintosh and run the classic Mac OS. It required an Apple Macintosh ROM image, or actual ROMs in the case of A-Max, which needed to be obtained from a real Macintosh. The user needed to own the real Macintosh or Mac ROMs to legally run the emulator. In 1988 the first Apple Mac emulator, A-Max, was released as an external device for any Amiga. It needed Mac ROMs to function, and could read Mac disks when used with a Mac floppy drive (Amiga floppy drives are unable to read Mac disks. Unlike Amiga disks Mac floppy disks spin at variable speeds, much like CD-ROM drives). It wasn't a particularly elegant solution, but it did provide an affordable and usable Mac experience. ReadySoft, makers of A-Max, followed up with A-Max II in the early 1990s. A-Max II was contained on a Zorro-compatible card and allowed the user, again using actual Mac ROMs, to emulate a color Macintosh. In fact, an Amiga 3000 emulating a Mac via A-Max II was significantly faster than the first consumer color Mac, the LC. Over time full-software virtualization was available, but a ROM image was still necessary. Example virtualization software include ShapeShifter (not to be confused with the third party preference pane ShapeShifter), later superseded by Basilisk II (both by the same programmer who conceived SheepShaver, Christian Bauer), Fusion and iFusion (the latter ran classic Mac OS by using a PowerPC \\"coprocessor\\" accelerator card). Virtual machines provide equal or faster speed than a Macintosh with the same processor, especially with respect to the m68k series due to real Macs running in MMU trap mode, hampering performance. Also, immediately after the 68k to PowerPC transition in 1994, there was a dearth of native PowerPC Mac software: Amiga computers with 68060 CPUs running ShapeShifter or Fusion were able to run 68k Macintosh code faster than real Macs. One should note that although Amigas were very successful at emulating Macintoshes, it was never considered to be a Macintosh clone as it could not use Mac OS as a primary operating system. Modern Amigas like AmigaOne and Pegasos can emulate Macintosh Machines by using Basilisk II or Mac-on-Linux. 8-bit Commodore computers Various Commodore 64 emulators were produced for the Amiga. In 1988 Compute! reviewed ReadySoft's The 64 Emulator and Software Insight Systems' GO-64 and reported mixed results with both. Although the magazine used copies of the genuine 64 ROMs, it found that some software such as SpeedScript did not run, and both emulators' performance was inferior to the real computer. Others included MagiC64 and A64. Amigas have their own version of VICE and Frodo software emulators. VICE emulates the 8-bit machines made by Commodore, including C64, C128, PET, and VIC-20.  Atari ST Atari ST emulation on Amiga is very easy because the two machine share the same model of processor (68000) and more or less feature the same hardware characteristics. In the past there were produced various software based Atari emulators for the Amiga such as Amtari, or Medusa emulator. AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS can emulate Atari ST and Atari STE platforms by using Hatari free software emulator which was released under GPL. Amiga emulation PowerPC-equipped computers running AmigaOS 4 can run UAE to emulate a Motorola 68000-equipped Amiga. Original Kickstart 3.1 ROM images are included with AmigaOS 4.1 Update 4.

History Mozart wrote the trio on 10 sheets (19 pages) in Vienna and dated the manuscript on 5 August 1786. According to Karoline Pichler, a 17-year-old student of Mozart at this time, the work was dedicated to Franziska von Jacquin (1769‚Äì1850), another student of his. Mozart and the von Jacquin family‚Äîfather Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin and his youngest son, Gottfried Jacquin‚Äîwere quite close friends. They performed house concerts together where Nikolaus played the flute and Franziska the piano. In a letter to Gottfried from 15 January 1787, Mozart praises Franziska's studiousness and diligence. Mozart dedicated a number of works to the von Jacquin family, including this trio. One year later, Mozart wrote two Lieder, \\"\\" (K. 520) and \\"\\" (K. 530) for the explicit purpose of Gottfried von Jacquin using them under his own name. The German word ' means \\"a place where skittles are played\\", akin to a duckpin bowling alley. Mozart wrote that he composed the 12 Duos for Two (French) Horns (not basset horns as is commonly thought), K. 487, \\"while playing skittles;\\" on the first page of the autograph manuscript of K. 487, Mozart inscribed the following: \\"\\" (Vienna, 27 July 1786 while playing skittles).NMA VII/22/Abt. 2, p. XI A week and a half later, Mozart composed and dated the trio E K. 498. He entered this work into his list of compositions simply as: \\"\\"NMA, KV 498, Critical Report, p. 43 (A trio for piano, clarinet and viola). There is no evidence that Mozart gave any nickname to the K. 498 trio; the moniker Kegelstatt first appears ascribed to the K. 498 trio in Ludwig von K√∂chel's 1862 thematic catalogue of Mozart's music. This clarinet-viola-piano trio was first played in the von Jacquin's house; Anton Stadler played clarinet, Mozart the viola, and Franziska von Jacquin the piano. The clarinet was still a relatively new instrument in Mozart's time, and this trio, along with his Clarinet Quintet and Clarinet Concerto (the latter two for basset clarinets in A), helped increase the instrument's popularity. The trio was published in 1788 by Artaria, transcribed‚Äîprobably with Mozart's consent‚Äîfor violin, viola and piano, and the original clarinet part was described as an \\"alternative part\\": '. Due to this unusual scoring, the piece is sometimes adapted to fit other types of trios; e.g. a clarinet-violin-piano trio, a violin-cello-piano trio, a clarinet-cello-piano trio, or a violin-viola-piano trio, as in that first publication by Artaria. No composer before Mozart had written for this combination of instruments. In the 19th century Robert Schumann wrote M√§rchenerz√§hlungen (Op. 132), Max Bruch in 1910 \\"Eight pieces for clarinet, viola, and piano\\" (Op. 83) and Carl Reinecke \\"Trio for piano, clarinet and viola\\" (Op. 246). In March 1894 the manuscript came into the possession of the musicologist and composer Charles Th√©odore Malherbe when he bought it from Leo Sachs, a banker in Paris, who had bought it from Johann Anton Andr√© who bought it as part of a large purchase of manuscripts from Mozart's widow Constanze (the ') in 1841. In 1912 it was donated to the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, D√©partement de la Musique, Malherbe collection, Ms 222. Analysis The manuscript notes the clarinet part as \\"Clarinetto in B\\" and uses the written pitch. The viola part uses the C-clef in the alto position. The labelling of the piano part shows a correction by Mozart where he started to write \\"Ce\\" (for \\"cembalo\\", the Italian word for the harpsichord) and then replaced it with \\"Piano forte\\". However, this part is labelled \\"Cembalo\\" for the second and third movements. The key signature of E major in Mozart's late chamber music indicates close friendship.Einstein, Alfred: Mozart. Sein Charakter, sein Werk. Z√ºrich, Stuttgart 1953 The trio consists of three movements: The first movement is not the more traditional Allegro as an opening movement, but a more contemplative Andante. Following on from this, the second movement is of course not the traditional slow movement, but a moderate Menuetto, and the last movement, while lively, is not the standard Allegro. In short, the contrasts in this trio are not as stark as in most classical sonatas. =I. Andante= The Andante is written in the time signature of time and consists of 129 bars; a typical performance would last just over six minutes. It repeats neither its exposition nor the remainder of the movement, which is unusual for Mozart's mature chamber music.Hugh Macdonald, To Repeat or Not to Repeat? in \\"Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association\\", Vol. 111, (1984‚Äì1985), p. 130 A particularly recognizable feature of this movement's principal theme is the gruppetto (turn) which appears throughout. =II. Menuetto= The second movement is written in time and consists of 158 bars, almost all of which are repeated; a typical performance would last about six minutes. The key signature of this movement is B major, the dominant key to E from the first movement. The opening menuetto of this movement consists of the exposition of a four-bar theme (bars 1‚Äì12, repeated), and its development (bars 13‚Äì41, also repeated). The piano's pounding bass line and sharp dynamic contrasts set the mood of this theme apart from any conventional light and frilly notions of a Minuet. During the development, the dialogue between the instruments becomes intensified, and Mozart shows his grasp of counterpoint without ever sounding academic or \\"learned\\". The following trio opens with a chromatic four-note phrase, to which the viola responds with a run of lively triplets, accompanied by chromatic chords from the piano (bars 42‚Äì62, repeated). In the development of that theme, the four-note phrase and the lively triplets are then taken up by the piano, and clarinet and viola present some chromatically rising lines, before all three instruments start a concerto-like conversation where the 4-note phrase is only heard twice in the piano left hand (bars 63‚Äì94, repeated). The final part of the trio starts with a variation of the trio's four-note phrase, which is briefly developed (bars 95‚Äì102) before returning to the brighter theme of the Menuetto whose treatment ends the movement without repeats. =III. Rondeaux: Allegretto= The last movement is written in the time signature of cut common time (or alla breve, similar to )\\"Rondeaux\\", Neue Mozart-Ausgabe VIII/22/Abt.2 (Plath, Rehm, 1966), p. 117 \\"Rondeaux\\", autograph, p. 6r and consists of 222 bars; a typical performance would last eight and one-half minutes. The key signature, as is conventional, is the same as the opening movement, E major. The musical format of this movement is a seven-part rondo, a rarity in Mozart's work; this seven-part structure also explains the title Rondeaux, the French plural form of Rondeau. The structure is AB‚ÄìAC‚ÄìAD‚ÄìA. Theme A is an eight-bar cantabile melody in two parts, drawn from the first movement and presented first by the clarinet, then taken up as a variation by the piano (bars 1‚Äì16). The melody of theme B ‚Äì in B major ‚Äì is played once by the clarinet (bars 17‚Äì24) before the piano plays an intermezzo of several bars. From bar 36 onwards, all three instruments play short phrases of that theme in turn, followed by a piano solo until bar 50. Theme C ‚Äì in C minor ‚Äì is presented by the viola and repeated (bars 67‚Äì76); all three instruments develop that theme in bars 77‚Äì90 (repeated). This development visits the subdominant minor scale (vi) of F minor before ending in the relative key of C minor. Theme D ‚Äì in A major ‚Äì is introduced in bar 116 by all three instruments almost in unison, and elaborately developed in bars 132‚Äì153 (repeated). In contrast to the previous development, this goes through the subdominant major scale (VI) of A major.James Arnold Hepokoski, Warren Darcy: Elements of Sonata Theory, p. 401, Oxford University Press US, The movement ends with a flowery, operatic coda (bars 185‚Äì222).\\"La Fenice\\" (program notes) Newtown Friends of Music (10 April 2005).

He and his wife Catherine Barmby (died 1853/1854) were influential supporters of Robert Owen in the late 1830s and early 1840s before moving into the radical Unitarian stream of Christianity in the 1840s. Both had established reputations as staunch feminists and proposed the addition of women's suffrage to the demands of the Chartist movement. Barmby was involved as an editor, writer, and organiser of communitarian ventures around London from 1838 to 1848. He is often associated with the growth of socialist and utopian projects during the rise of Chartism. He founded a utopian community on the Channel Islands and at times corresponded with radicals including William James Linton and Friedrich Engels. Barmby is also known as the person who claimed to have introduced the word communist into the English language as a translation of the French word communiste during a visit to Paris in 1840 in conversation with some followers of Gracchus Babeuf.\\"Sons of Liberty, Socioeconomics, Sovereignty, and Freedom\\". He introduced Engels to the French communiste movement.Engels, F., Letter to editor They founded the London Communist Propaganda Society in 1841 and in the same year the Universal Communitarian Association.

Career Lost Bayou Ramblers was born deep in South Louisiana performing old style, predominantly acoustic Cajun music at clubs and festivals across the US, Europe, and Canada. They were formed in 1999 by Louis Michot (fiddle and vocals) and his brother Andre Michot (cajun accordion and lap steel guitar) and grew to include producer Korey Richey (electric bass), Johnny Campos (electric guitar) and Eric Heigle (drums). With 15 years of touring, recording, and collaborating under their belt, the band has continually integrated new sonic elements to its live performances, always experimenting and growing the show to what it's become today, an eclectic mix of modern sounds and rhythms with ancient Cajun melodies and lyrics. The Lost Bayou Ramblers have toured through much of the United States and Canada, including performances at the (Celebrate Brooklyn) in Brooklyn, New York, the Vancouver Folk Music Festival, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and at the historic Preservation Hall. The Ramblers had their first international performance in Lyon, France in November 2004, and have since toured through France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Sweden. Their debut release, Pilette Breakdown (Swallow Records) received critical acclaim across North America and Europe. In 2008, the Ramblers was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Zydeco or Cajun Music category (a new category for that year) for their album Live: A La Blue Moon. Lost Bayou Ramblers have also played a series of shows with Violent Femmes vocalist and fiddle player Gordon Gano and collaborated with him on Bastille, a song written by Louis Michot looking back 221 years from the Gulf Oil Spill in Louisiana to the Bastille. Lost Bayou Ramblers and Gordon Gano met at d.b.a. one night about five years ago, \\"we had been doing 'O Bye' from our first album (Pilette Breakdown). When we'd get to the breakdown part we'd do different songs, like this one White Stripes song and sometimes 'Blister in the Sun'. We were doin' that, and suddenly this guy climbs up on stage and he's like, 'You mind?' and I said, 'I guess not.' Enter Gordon Gano. Gordon Gano was also featured on the Lost Bayou Ramblers' 2012 release, Mammoth Waltz, along with guest artists Scarlett Johansson and Dr. John. Besides the diverse list of guests, Mammoth Waltz was a musical breakthrough for LBR and the genre as a whole, drawing on influences from the modern soundscape beyond the genre. The result was a passport to play for audiences who may not have known Cajun music, but who appreciated Lost Bayou Ramblers for their music, not their genre. Although Mammoth Waltz is 100% in Cajun French, it acted as an invitation for all music lovers to tune in to the hypnotic Cajun rhythms Lost Bayou Ramblers have been known for since their inception in 1999. 2012 also brought the Ramblers' musical collaboration with the film Beasts of the Southern Wild in which the band laid down the base track to \\"Bathtub\\" and other parts of the score. The film went on to win the Cam√©ra d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Lost Bayou Ramblers have been performing the score to live screenings of the film with Wordless Music Orchestra. 2014 presented Lost Bayou Ramblers with the chance to play on their biggest bill to date, opening for Arcade Fire on two dates of their Reflektor tour. The invitation came after the Montreal-based band saw Lost Bayou Ramblers perform to 30,000 fans at the Montreal Jazz Festival in 2013, at a rare performance in which most of the audience understood the depth of the Cajun French lyrics which make up almost their entire repertoire. The release of the Ramblers' second live album also came in 2014, with Gasa Gasa Live, which was recorded at the club on Freret St in New Orleans, and released in September and accompanied by a tour from New York to Chicago. In 2017, the band appeared in the documentary film The American Epic Sessions, directed by Bernard MacMahon. They recorded Joe Falcon and Cleoma Breaux's 1928 song \\"Allons √† Lafayette\\" (the first commercial Cajun recording) on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s - the same machine that would have originally recorded the Falcon and Breaux performance. Louis Michot said \\"It's such a significant part of music that it gets a place in this documentary.

His first patrons were the Griffiths family, of the Cefn Amwlch estate at Bryn Cynan on Pen Ll≈∑n, who provided the young Parry with a Welsh triple harp. He later became harpist to Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn at Wynnstay, Ruabon and became a master of the High Baroque.

The highway extends from the White Horse Circle, in Hamilton Township to Middlesex CR 607 on the border of Bound Brook and Middlesex Borough. CR 533 shares a long concurrency with U.S. Route 206 (US 206) through Princeton and Montgomery Township, while portions of the roadway in Somerset County are part of the Millstone River Valley Scenic Byway. It also has a key historic importance, as George Washington used the road during his march from Trenton to Princeton during the American Revolution. This is commemorated by several small stone pillars at various points along the road. Route description =White Horse to Princeton= View north at the south end of CR 533 at US 206 and CR 524 in Hamilton Township The southern third of CR 533 serves as a shorter, more direct route between two parts of US 206, connecting the southern portion as it travels north from Bordentown and the northern portion as moves through Princeton and into Somerset County. The U.S. highway turns west down Broad Street at the circle and winds confusingly through the city of Trenton before moving through Lawrence, the county route continues nearly due north through Hamilton and along the Lawrence/West Windsor boundary into Princeton. CR 524 also begins at the circle, following Broad in the other direction toward Yardville and Allentown. For its first in southern Hamilton, the route is White Horse-Mercerville Road, as it connects the two census- designated places of White Horse and Mercerville. Along the way, it accesses both Interstates 295 (exit 61) and 195 (exit 2) via Arena Drive, just from the southern terminus. In Mercerville, it intersects Route 33, providing access to downtown Trenton and the business-laden stretch of Hamilton Square. Less than later, CR 533 meets CR 535 and Nottingham Way at a five-point intersection, and continues north as Quaker Bridge Road. CR 533 southbound past the US 1 interchange on the border of West Windsor Township and Lawrence Township At this point, the route picks up the trail followed by Washington. It passes Sloan Avenue, which again provides access to I-295 at exit 65 and widens to four lanes wide. From here, it continues on to the northern border of Hamilton and follows the border between Lawrence to the west and West Windsor on the east (the Keith line). It crosses Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and passes the Quaker Bridge Mall complex to the left as it approaches US 1. After the US 1 cloverleaf interchange, the road name briefly changes to Province Line Road and intersects an access road to Mercer Mall. At the next traffic light, it intersects the access to the Nassau Park shopping center and Province Line Road, unsigned CR 569. North of this intersection, CR 533 becomes unsigned and is known as Quaker Road. After crossing the Delaware and Raritan Canal at Port Mercer, Quaker Road becomes under the jurisdiction of Princeton, turns off the Keith line into the borough, and crosses Stony Brook on Quaker Bridge. Paralleling Stony Brook and adjacent to farmland, CR 533 intersects Princeton Pike, also known as CR 583, before winding its way through a small residential area, narrows such that it becomes traversable for northbound traffic only, and reaches its intersection with US 206. =Concurrency with Route 206= During its concurrency with Route 206, CR 533 passes Drumthwacket, Nassau Street (Route 27's southern terminus) in downtown Princeton and Princeton Airport near an intersection with Route 518 in Montgomery Township, just beyond the county line between Mercer and Somerset. Just before the end of the concurrency, the road passes over Beden Brook. CR 533 is not signed anywhere along its concurrency with US 206. =Montgomery to Bound Brook= CR 533 northbound past CR 533 Bypass in Hillsborough Township CR 533 finally splits off of US 206 in northern Montgomery, breaking off to the right and running along the western bank of the Millstone River, which is itself parallel to the Delaware and Raritan Canal for this stretch. It is now known as River Road, and there is a Canal Road that also mirrors CR 533 on the far side of the two waterways in Franklin Township. CR 533 meets Township Line Road from the left, marking the move from Montgomery into Hillsborough. It later enters the borough of Millstone for about . Here, it intersects Amwell Road (CR 514), which provides access to a short bypass of the borough to the west. Upon reentering Hillsborough Township, CR 533 meets the northern terminus of the aforementioned bypass, signed as CR 533 Bypass. CR 533 passes by the Central Jersey Regional Airport, then turns away from the river as it becomes Main Street in the borough of Manville. After , CR 533 crosses the Raritan River over Van Veghten's Bridge and enters Bridgewater. CR 533 reaches CDP Of Finderne, and turns right down Main Street, traveling almost due east for its remaining . In its busy final mile, it passes by TD Bank Ballpark, the Bridgewater Train Station and Interstate 287, enters Bound Brook. There is no direct access to I-287, but Promenade Boulevard does carry traffic to Route 28 at exit 13 off the freeway. Traveling through Bound Brook, reaches an intersection with Route 527 (Mountain Avenue) and forms a concurrency through the downtown area. After a roundabout, CR 527 heads to the south while CR 533 continues east along East Main Street. On a bridge connecting Bound Brook and the Middlesex County borough of Middlesex, CR 533 ends while Middlesex CR 607 continues east as Lincoln Boulevard.

He took over the Trussardi fashion line in 1970 and built the small glove-maker into an international brand. He also led the restoration of the Marino alla Scala in Milan. The Nicola Trussardi Foundation was named in his honor. Early life Trussardi was born in Bergamo, Lombardy. In 1968 Trussardi graduated from the Catholic University of Milan in Commerce and Economics. Career In 1970, he started working in his family's glove-making business, which was founded in 1910 by his grandfather Dante Trussardi, following the death of his older brother. Near the end of the 1970s he took the business over entirely after the death of his father. Trussardi turned it into a major company that helped contribute to the popularity of the made-in-Italy label throughout the world. He expanded Trussardi's product line beyond gloves to include luxury accessories, and in 1973 he created Trussardi's spiky greyhound logo. A few years later, Trussardi launched a line of leather jackets, the first step toward a ready-to-wear line which, by the 1980s, encompassed womenswear, menswear, sportswear and children's wear. In 1985 the once small family business was now worth $182 million, and he had opened about 120 stores and franchises around the world, with Trussardi owning ten of them himself. Trussardi personally took on some of the special projects the company was hired to do, such as designing airplane and helicopter interiors. In 1988, Trussardi outfitted the Italian athletes competing in the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. Then in 1989, Trussardi used his collection to protest both the deforestation of the world's rainforests, and the use of real animal fur by his contemporaries. He used exclusively faux- fur, and included letters of protest against deforestation in the entrance bags given to the attendees of that year's fashion shows. Throughout his career, Trussardi spent time promoting the marketing phrase \\"Made in Italy\\" and Italian fashion in general. By the time of Trussardi's death in 1999, his business was worth about $480 million. He was also a costume designer for play productions staged in both Europe and the United States. Trussardi also designed costumes for the stage, including a November 1985 production at Teatro Valle, Rome, of ‚ÄúBestia da Stile‚Äù by Pier Paolo Pasolini, a September 1986 production at Verona Arena, Verona, of ‚ÄúMacbeth‚Äù by Giuseppe Verdi, and a September 1987 International Ballet Gala at the Piazza dei Miracoli, Pisa. Marino alla Scala Marino alla Scala In 1996 Trussardi restored the Marino alla Scala, located beside the La Scala opera house in Milan, which now contains several different establishments, including a Trussardi boutique and showroom. He originally purchased the building in 1989, and spent about $67 million over seven years to have the complex completed. During the construction, the municipal government attempted to extort money from Trussardi through major fines and slow bureaucratic responses. The property was originally built in 1876, and was restored by Dutch artists Ben Van Os and Rainer Van Brummelen in the neo-mannerist style. The first exhibition to be held in the gallery was a series of 105 sketches by Pablo Picasso. Initiatives Fondazione Trussardi Trussardi has undertaken many other initiatives, including the creation of the Palatrussardi in Milan, which has hosted a number of pop and rock concerts, including that of Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, and Sammy Davis, Jr.. Other projects included a specially fitted-out Mini, produced by Innocenti. The Nicola Trussardi Foundation is a non-profit institution for the promotion of contemporary art and culture under the direction of president Beatrice Trussardi. Since 2003 the Foundation has decided to concentrate its resources on the realization of contemporary art events in the public spaces of the city of Milano. In 2009 the foundation sponsored an art exhibition at the Venice Biennale curated by Daniel Birnbaum, featuring a sound installation by Roberto Cuoghi. It celebrated its tenth anniversary at the Venice Biennale as well in 2013. Trussardi himself also advocated for an area of Milan to be demarcated the \\"Citta della Moda\\", where all Milanese designers would have boutiques and which would house all future fashion shows for the city's fashion companies and labels. The project was abandoned after Trussardi's death, and several Milanese designers have since constructed their own private showcase spaces. Personal life Trussardi was a supporter of the arts in Milan, and a collector of fine sculpture. Trussardi owned a villa on the island of Elba, where he frequently entertained. Trussardi had four children, two daughters and two sons with his wife Marialuisa, who worked alongside Nicola his whole professional life as the company's creative director. His hobbies included racing speed boats and flying his Citation II aircraft as a licensed amateur pilot. Trussardi was killed when he lost control of his Mercedes-Benz on Tangenziale Est of Milan and hit a lamp post in the early hours of the 13th of April, 1999. He died the following day in Milan.

The system was developed largely from the experimental studies of Atwater and his colleagues in the later part of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Its use has frequently been the cause of dispute, but no real alternatives have been proposed. As with the calculation of protein from total nitrogen, the Atwater system is a convention and its limitations can be seen in its derivation. Derivation Available energy (as used by Atwater) is equivalent to the modern usage of the term metabolisable energy (ME). {text{Metabolisable Energy}} = left(text{Gross Energy in Food}right) - left(text{Energy lost in Faeces, Urine, Secretions and Gases}right). In most studies on humans, losses in secretions and gases are ignored. The gross energy (GE) of a food, as measured by bomb calorimetry is equal to the sum of the heats of combustion of the components ‚Äì protein (GEp), fat (GEf) and carbohydrate (GEcho) (by difference) in the proximate system. {GE} = {{GE}_p + {GE}_f + {GE}_{cho}} , Atwater considered the energy value of feces in the same way. {GE}^F = {{GE}_p^F + {GE}_f^F + {GE}_{cho}^F} , By measuring coefficients of availability or in modern terminology apparent digestibility, Atwater derived a system for calculating faecal energy losses. text{Digestible energy} = {{GE}_p(D_p)} + {{GE}_f(D_f)} + {{GE}_{cho}(D_{cho})}, where Dp, Df, and Dcho are respectively the digestibility coefficients of protein, fat and carbohydrate calculated as frac {text{intake}-text{faecal excretion}}{text{intake}} for the constituent in question. Urinary losses were calculated from the energy to nitrogen ratio in urine. Experimentally this was 7.9 kcal/g (33 kJ/g) urinary nitrogen and thus his equation for metabolisable energy became {ME} = left ( {GE}_p - frac {7.9} {6.25} right ) D_p + {GE}_f D_f + {GE}_{cho} D_{cho}, =Gross energy values= Atwater collected values from the literature and also measured the heat of combustion of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. These vary slightly depending on sources and Atwater derived weighted values for the gross heat of combustion of the protein, fat and carbohydrate in the typical mixed diet of his time. It has been argued that these weighted values are invalid for individual foods and for diets whose composition in terms of foodstuffs is different from those eaten in the US in the early 20th century. =Apparent digestibility coefficients= Atwater measured a large number of digestibility coefficients for simple mixtures, and in substitution experiments derived values for individual foods. These he combined in a weighted fashion to derive values for mixed diets. When these were tested experimentally with mixed diets they did not give a good prediction, and Atwater adjusted the coefficients for mixed diets. =Urinary correction= The energy/nitrogen ratio in urine shows considerable variation and the energy/organic matter is less variable, but the energy/nitrogen value provided Atwater with a workable approach although this has caused some confusion and only applies for subjects in nitrogen balance. Modified system Based on the work of Atwater, it became common practice to calculate energy content of foods using 4 kcal/g for carbohydrates and proteins and 9 kcal/g for lipids. The system was later improved by Annabel Merrill and Bernice Watt of the USDA, who derived a system whereby specific calorie conversion factors for different foods were proposed. This takes cognizance of the fact that first the gross energy values of the protein, fats and carbohydrates from different food sources are different, and second, that the apparent digestibility of the components of different foods is different. This system relies on having measured heats of combustion of a wide range of isolated proteins, fats and carbohydrates. It also depends on data from digestibility studies, where individual foods have been substituted for basal diets in order to measure the apparent digestibility coefficients for those foods. This approach is based on the assumption that there are no interactions between foods in a mixture in the intestine, and from a practical view point, such studies with humans are difficult to control with the required accuracy. Assumptions based on the use of carbohydrates by difference and the effects of dietary fibre The carbohydrate by difference approach presents several problems. First, it does not distinguish between sugars, starch and the unavailable carbohydrates (roughage, or \\"dietary fibre\\"). This affects first the gross energy that is assigned to carbohydrate‚Äîsucrose has a heat of combustion of 3.95 kcal/g (16.53 kJ/g) and starch 4.15 kcal/g (17.36 kJ/g). Secondly it does not provide for the fact that sugars and starch are virtually completely digested and absorbed, and thus provide metabolisable energy equivalent to their heat of combustion. The unavailable carbohydrates (dietary fibre) are degraded to a variable extent in the large bowel. The products of this microbial digestion are fatty acids, CO2 (carbon dioxide), methane and hydrogen. The fatty acids (acetate, butyrate and propionate) are absorbed in the large intestine and provide some metabolisable energy. The extent of degradation depends on the source of the dietary fibre (its composition and state of division), and the individual consuming the dietary fibre. There is insufficient data to give firm guidance on the energy available from this source. Finally dietary fibre affects faecal losses of nitrogen and fat. Whether the increased fat loss is due to an effect on small intestinal absorption is not clear. The increased faecal nitrogen losses on high fibre diets are probably due to an increased bacterial nitrogen content of the faeces. Both these effects however lead to reductions in apparent digestibility, and therefore the Atwater system warrants small changes in the proper energy conversion factors for those diets. Theoretical and practical considerations relating to the calculation of energy values =Variations in heats of combustion of food constituents= Proteins The experimental evidence for the magnitude of this variation is very limited, but as the heats of combustion of the individual amino-acids are different it is reasonable to expect variations between different proteins. An observed range of from 5.48 for conglutin (from blue lupin) to 5.92 for Hordein (barley) was reported, which compares with Atwaters' range of 5.27 for gelatin to 5.95 for wheat gluten. It is difficult to calculate expected values for a protein from amino-acid data, as some of the heats of combustion are not known accurately. Preliminary calculations on cow's milk suggest a value of around 5.5 kcal/g (23.0 kJ/g). Fats Analogously the experimental evidence is limited, but since the fatty acids differ in their heats of combustion one should expect fats to vary in heats of combustion. These differences are, however, relatively small ‚Äì for example, breast milk fat has a calculated heat of combustion of 9.37 kcal/g (39.2 kJ/g) compared with that of cow milk fat of 9.19 kcal/g (38.5 kJ/g). Carbohydrates Monosaccharides have heats of combustion of around 3.75 kcal/g (15.7 kJ/g), disaccharides 3.95 kcal/g (16.5 kJ/g) and polysaccharides 4.15 to 4.20 kcal/g (17.4 to 17.6 kJ/g). The heat of hydrolysis is very small and these values are essentially equivalent when calculated on a monosaccharide basis. Thus 100 g sucrose gives on hydrolysis 105.6 g monosaccharide and 100 g starch gives on hydrolysis 110 g glucose. =Apparent digestibility coefficients= The human digestive tract is a very efficient organ, and the faecal excretion of nitrogenous material and fats is a small proportion (usually less than 10%) of the intake. Atwater recognised that the faecal excretion was a complex mixture of unabsorbed intestinal secretions, bacterial material and metabolites, sloughed mucosal cells, mucus, and only to a small extent, unabsorbed dietary components. This might be one reason why he chose to use availability rather than digestibility. His view was that these faecal constituents were truly unavailable and that his apparent disregard of the nature of faecal excretion was justifiable in a practical context. The ratio frac {text{intake}-text{faecal excretion}}{ text{intake}}, wherever faecal excretion is small, will approximate to unity and thus these coefficients have a low variance and have the appearance of constants. This is spurious since faecal excretion is variable even on a constant diet, and there is no evidence to suggest that faecal excretion is in fact related to intake in the way implied by these coefficients. =Practical considerations in calculations of energy value of foods and diets= The calculation of energy values must be regarded as an alternative to direct measurement, and therefore is likely to be associated with some inaccuracy when compared with direct assessment. These inaccuracies arise for a number of reasons * Variations in food composition: Foods are biological mixtures and as such show considerable variation in composition, particularly in respect of water and fat content. This means that compositional values quoted for representative samples of foods in food composition tables do not necessarily apply to individual samples of foods. In studies where great accuracy is required, samples of the food consumed must be analysed. * Measurements of food intake: In estimating energy intakes, measurements of food intake are made, and these are known to be subject to considerable uncertainty. Even in studies under very close supervision the errors in weighing individual food items are rarely less than ¬±5%. A certain degree of pragmatism must therefore be used when assessing procedures for calculating energy intakes, and many authors impute greater accuracy to quoted calculated energy intakes than is justifiable. * Individual variation: Variations in individuals are seen in all human studies, and these variations are not allowed for in most calculations. The theoretical and physiological objections to the assumptions inherent in the Atwater system are likely to result in errors much smaller than these practical matters. Conversion factors were derived from experimental studies with young infants, but these produced values for metabolisable energy intake that were insignificantly different from those obtained by direct application of the modified Atwater factors.

The film was Borowczyk's most sexually explicit at the time. The film is split into four erotic-themed stories that involve the loss of virginity, masturbation, bloodlust, and incest. After the release of Immoral Tales, Borowczyk began to fall out of favor with film critics. Modern critical reception to the film is that it is not one of Borowczyk's strongest works. Plot The film is separated into four stories: * The first story involves Andr√© (Fabrice Luchini), who takes his 16-year-old cousin (played by Lise Danvers) to the beach to perform fellatio on him in tune to the waves of the incoming tide. * The second story is titled Th√©r√©se the Philosopher, an adaptation of the novel of the same name. It involves a teenage country girl (Charlotte Alexandra) who intermingles sexual desires in her imagination with her dedication to Christ after being locked in her room. * The third story features Elizabeth B√°thory (Paloma Picasso) as a countess who murders young girls in order to gain eternal youth by bathing in their blood and a girl (Marie Fors√•) putting pearls inside her vagina.Walerian Borowczyk‚Äôs Heroines of Desire - Endnotes no.26. sensesofcinema.com * The final story involves the daughter of Pope Alexander VI, Lucrezia Borgia (Florence Bellamy), having sex with her male relatives. Production By 1972, Walerian Borowczyk was known predominantly for his various short films which were made to support feature- length releases. Borowczyk's feature films had made very little income from their theatrical releases while short films were not in demand as much as supporting features in cinemas. At this time, Borowczyk met with producer Anatole Dauman, who suggested that because France's film censors had relaxed the laws concerning censorship, Borowczyk should make an erotic feature to gain an audience. The film's stories are taken from various sources, including surrealist writers and poets. The first story in the film is taken from surrealist writer Andr√© Pieyre de Mandiargues. The title of the second story is taken from an anonymous sacrilegious novel from the 18th century. The third story is a re-telling of the case of Elizabeth B√°thory from the study of surrealist poet Valentine Penrose.Richardson, 2006. p. 114 A fifth story in the Immoral Tales was originally planned, but was taken out of the film and developed into the feature film La B√™te (1975). Release Immoral Tales was screened in Britain in September 1973 as an incomplete work. This version included the short film A Private Collection, The Tide and The Beast of G√©vaudan. Immoral Tales was released in French theaters in 1974. The French film magazine Le Film fran√ßais stated in 1974, 128 films that were classified as \\"erotic\\" were screened in Paris. This accounted for 16% of the total French box office. Immoral Tales sold 359,748 tickets, making it the second most popular release of these films, the most popular being Emmanuelle. It was shown at the 17th Regus London Film Festival held in November and December 1973. The film won the London Festival Choice award at the festival. Immoral Tales was shown at the 12th Kinoteka Polish Film Festival in London in May 2014. Reception In 1974, Immoral Tales won the Prix de L'√Çge d'or, an award intended to commemorate the spirit of surrealism. After the release of Immoral Tales, Borowczyk began to fall out of favor with film critics. New York Magazine wrote an unfavourable review, referring to the film as \\"episodic and disjointed, but also written with a great deal of stupidity\\" and describing the story-telling, directing, acting and photography in the film as \\"wretched.\\" Among modern reviews, AllMovie gave the film three stars out of five, feeling that first two stories did not work as well as the second two as well as saying that it was Borowczyk's move from \\"art house material and toward softcore; as such, the material displays its director's characteristic intelligence but lapses into exploitation a little too often.\\" In an overview of Borowczyk's work in the film magazine Senses of Cinema, Immoral Tales is referred to as his weakest amongst his first five feature films and that \\"an unsensational approach to the material and detached gaze of the camera make it closer to a surrealist text than a pornographic movie.\\" Dave Kehr wrote a review for the Chicago Reader praising that the film \\"contains some very elegant images\\" but compared it negatively to Borowczyk's followup The Story of Sin, which Kehr proclaimed \\"avoided the trap of superficiality by adopting an ironic mode. Here, he seems entirely too sincere‚Äîand more than a little dull.\\" In his 2014 review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw praises the film, citing the influence of Ken Russell and Pier Paolo Pasolini.

It has a four combustion chambers that provide thrust vector control by gimbaling each of the nozzles in a single axis ¬±33¬∞. It was designed in Dnipropetrovsk by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau as the vernier thruster of the Zenit (GRAU: 11K77) second stage. As such, it has always been paired with the RD-120 engine for main propulsion. It can only be started once, and as a high altitude engine it has a thrust of and a specific impulse of . It is the first ever steering engine to use the staged combustion cycle, and as such is the basis for a family of planned engines for the Mayak launch vehicle family. The engine itself is built like a hollow cylinder, with a cylindrical space in the center so the RD-120 nozzle can pass through. Derivatives Whilst Yuzhnoye's propulsion experience had been mostly on hypergolic propellants engines, like RD-855 or RD-861, they are considered too toxic for current ecological standards. While Yuzhnoye still offer to develop hypergolic propulsion, such as RD-843 for the Vega's AVUM stage or the Tsyklon-4 project, Yuzhnoye selected a more environmentally friendly LOX and kerosene propellant for the Mayak launch vehicle family. Not only had Yuzhnoye mastered the most complex cycle for the propellant (oxidizer rich staged combustion cycle) with the RD-8, but they had worked closely with NPO Energomash during the RD-120 program. The manufacturing is done at its sister company of Yuzhmash in Dnipropetrovsk, and the RD-120 thrust augmentation project of 2001 to 2003 had been a mixed project between the three companies. On the base of this experience, a family of derivatives engines were proposed. While the RD-801 and RD-810 are really just based on the general technology, the other members of the family are related enough that they reuse many components of the RD-8. One characteristic of this family is the limitation of keeping the preburner output temperature below . * RD-805 (or RD-802): A proposed upper stage engine of just of thrust, it would use a single chamber of the RD-8. While many new components would be required, it is considered a low technological risk since it only needs smaller versions of already developed component. * RD-809 (sometimes identified as RD-809M): It is an RD-8 re arranged to minimize its diameter. It would use practically every single component of the RD-8, but arranged without the big hollow section in the middle. It was a proposed engine for a proposed liquid upper stage of the Antares rocket, then named Taurus II. It would be capable of five engine burns in a single mission. * RD-809K: A proposed single nozzle version of the RD-8. It would mix most principal elements of the RD-8 like the turbopumps with a main combustion chamber and nozzle adapted from the RD-861K. It would be capable of 4 starts in a single mission. It is expected to be used in a dual engine configuration in the Mayak upper stage.

The Museum retains its Soviet-era characteristics. Organization The museum has three sections, all located in the town's central square. It was officially dedicated to Stalin in 1957. With the downfall of the Soviet Union and independence movement of Georgia, the museum was closed in 1989, but has since been reopened, and is a popular tourist attraction. =Stalin's house= Stalin's house Enshrined within a Greco-Italianate pavilion is a small wooden hut, in which Stalin was born in 1878 and spent his first four years. The small hut has two rooms on the ground floor. Stalin's father Vissarion Jughashvili, a local shoemaker, rented the one room on the left hand side of the building and maintained a workshop in the basement. The landlord lived in the other room. The hut originally formed part of a line of similar dwellings, but the others have been demolished. =Stalin Museum= Stalin Museum The main corpus of the complex is a large palazzo in Stalinist Gothic style, begun in 1951 ostensibly as a museum of the history of socialism, but clearly intended to become a memorial to Stalin, who died in 1953. The exhibits are divided into six halls in roughly chronological order, and contain many items actually or allegedly owned by Stalin, including some of his office furniture, his personal effects and gifts made to him over the years. There is also much illustration by way of documentation, photographs, paintings and newspaper articles. The display concludes with one of twelve copies of the death mask of Stalin taken shortly after his death. The overall impression is that of a shrine to a secular saint. =Stalin's railway carriage= Stalin's personal railway carriage, located outside the museum To one side of the museum is Stalin's personal railway carriage.

Ascension Convent, known as the Starodevichy Convent or Old Maidens' Convent until 1817 (, Voznesensky monastyr), was an Orthodox nunnery in the Moscow Kremlin which contained the burials of grand princesses, tsarinas, and other noble ladies from the Muscovite royal court. It is believed that Ascension Convent was founded in 1389 next to the Saviour Gates of the Kremlin by Dmitry Donskoy's widow, Eudoxia Dmitriyevna, who would take the veil there. The foundation stone for the cathedral was laid in 1407, just before her death. Eight years later, the cathedral was gutted by fire and then rebuilt in 1467 by princess Maria of Borovsk, wife of Vasili II of Russia. Sixteen years later the convent was again damaged by fire and then restored in 1518‚Äì1519 to a design by Aloisio the New. This church was completely rebuilt in 1587‚Äì1588, when a new five-domed structure, mirroring the nearby Archangel Cathedral, was erected. It was a major monument to embody the conservative architectural approach of Boris Godunov's circle (illustrated, to the right). Among those buried in the cathedral vault were Sophia Vitovtovna (wife of Vasili I), Sophia Paleologue (wife of Ivan III), several wives of Ivan the Terrible, Grand Duchess Eudoxia Alexeyevna (daughter of Alexei Mikhailovich), and tsarina Maria Vladimirovna (first wife of Mikhail Feodorovich). The convent was also used as a residence for royal fiancees prior to the wedding. It was there that Ivan IV's widow, Maria Nagaya, greeted Marina Mnishek, who would spend there a few days before her wedding with Nagaya's purported son, False Dmitry I. In 1634, Michael I of Russia commissioned a new convent church to be built and dedicated to his patron saint, Michael Maleinos. A belltower next to this church was constructed in the late 17th century. The Church of Michael Maleinos used to be home to a rare sculpture of St George, made by Vasili Yermolin and installed there in 1808. St Catherine Church of Ascension Convent. In 1721, the convent was renovated on behest of Peter the Great. In 1737, it was damaged by fire and again renovated by the order of Anna Ioannovna. During the Patriotic War of 1812, the sacristy of Ascension Convent, with the Icon of the Virgin Hodegetria, painted by Dionisius in 1482, was moved to Vologda. A two-storey almshouse was added in 1823. But the most important 19th-century addition was the Church of Saint Catherine, built to a fanciful Neo-Gothic design by Carlo Rossi (illustrated, to the right). By 1907, the monastery had a mother superior, 62 nuns and 45 lay sisters. Ten years later, the ancient buildings were damaged by artillery fire during the October Revolution. In 1929, the convent complex - including the majestic 16th-century cathedral - was dismantled by the Soviets in order to make room for the Red Commanders School, named after the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. Some of the icons of Ascension Convent were made over to the State Tretyakov Gallery and State museums of the Moscow Kremlin. The iconostasis of the Ascension Cathedral was moved into the Cathedral of Twelve Apostles (also in the Kremlin), while the tombs of the Muscovite royalty were transferred into an annex of the Archangel Cathedral, where they reside to this day. Possible restoration On August 2014, Russian president Vladimir Putin suggested an idea for restoring Ascension Convent and Chudov Monastery. However, due to archaeological work which began in December 2015 and the lack of UNESCO's approval of the restoration, the restoration of Ascension Convent is currently unplanned.

The station is located on Station Road, with an entrance on Whyte Melville Road. There are car parks on either side with an extension on the Whyte Melville Road side for Edinburgh commuter traffic. The station building is situated on the Edinburgh platform. In the building is a ticket office (at street level), toilets, public phone, photo booth and shop.Kirkaldy station facilities National Rail Enquiries Platforms are adjoined by a connecting subway and a flight of stairs. Two lifts have recently been installed for north and south platform access. There are waiting rooms on both platforms and CCTV is in operation. Train running information is provided via CIS displays, automatic announcements and customer help points. There are three main railway station bus stops located on Bennochy Road (off Station Road) with access to the car park. A further two bus stops are located on Whyte Melville Road, one of which is adjacent to the entrance and the other opposite University of Dundee Nursing Kirkcaldy Campus.  History  A proposal to bring two railway lines to the town had been suggested as far back as 1836, but neither plan succeeded. This led for pressure to support a new line from Burntisland to Newport-on-Tay and Tayport via Kinghorn, Kirkcaldy, Markinch and Cupar in 1840. However, it was three years before Parliament even acknowledged this essential plan. A unanimous decision was passed in favour by both the House of Lords and Commons.Eunson: Old Kirkcaldy (1998) p33 Kirkcaldy railway station, along with now defunct stations in Sinclairtown and Dysart, finally opened on 20 June 1847Eunson: Old Dysart (1998) p24 as part of the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, which terminated at Cupar. Train services were later taken over by the North British Railway, which was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. The nationalised British Railways took over in 1948. Originally, only the south platform was covered, until a re-fit of the station was undertaken towards the end of the 19th century. The station buildings survived intact until they were re-built in 1964, probably as part of the controversial town centre redevelopment plan. A fire in the late 1980s led to the destruction of the south platform. A new south platform had to be built again from scratch, and this was officially re-opened again to the public in 1991.Kirkcaldy Civic Society (2000), Page 3  Services  =Southbound= * 4 trains per hour to Edinburgh Waverley * 2 trains per hour express service.

The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Fife Circle Line, north of . History The station is situated on the Dunfermline Branch of the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, just west of its divergence from the E&NR; main line via a triangular junction. It is a completely new structure, having been built by British Rail with the support of Fife Regional Council to serve the two communities that it is named after. Glenrothes (as a post-war new town) had never previously had its own station (though station is nearby) whilst Thornton had lost its station (Thornton Junction) on the main line in October 1969 in the aftermath of the Beeching Axe (services on the line westwards to and on the Leven branch had ended at the same time). The successful inauguration of the Fife Circle Line service in 1989 had seen the Cardenden to Thornton Jn section reopened to passengers and this provided the catalyst for the construction of the station. It was completed in the spring of 1992 and it was opened to traffic on 11 May that year, at the summer timetable change. Though it has the appearance of a standard two platform station on a double track line, it is actually sited east of Thornton West Junction, where the double line from Cardenden splits into two parallel single lines that diverge after passing through the station to join the main line. One of these runs southwards to Thornton South Junction and is used by all trains to and from Edinburgh via the coast, whilst the other curves to the north and is used by trains heading for Markinch and thence to Perth or . As a consequence of this, both platforms are bi- directional (a similar layout exists at in Lancashire) but the southern one (platform 1) is much busier than the northern one (2) due to the service pattern in use on the Fife Circle.  Services  On Mondays to Saturdays, there are three trains per hour to Edinburgh. The majority of services in either direction depart from Platform 1 as noted. 2 of these services run via Kirkcaldy(One of which starts and terminates here) whilst the other runs via Dumfermline, In the evenings, Trains to Edinburgh only run via Dumfermline and on Sundays, An hourly service runs to Edinburgh both via Kirkcaldy and Dunfermline, These trains use Platform 1.

Photo taken in July 1998 after a rainy season following a period of El Ni√±o. The Crystal Lake Recreation Area is located in the San Gabriel Mountains of Southern California, administered by the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument (formally the San Gabriel River Ranger District) of the United States Forest Service. The Recreation Area consists of a small lake, an open-air amphitheater, a large public campground containing approximately 120 camp sites grouped into \\"loops,\\" and a group campground called Deer Flats which consists of approximately 25 camp sites. The Recreation Area contains a United States Forest Service visitor center and a cafe which is open to the public from dawn to dusk except for Tuesdays when the cafe is closed. Within the Recreation Area are 16 hiking and nature trails which are well-maintained by volunteers who work under the direction of the Forest Service. The Recreation Area is located approximately 26 miles (42 km) north on Hwy. 39 heading out of Azusa, California at the headwaters of the north fork of the San Gabriel River at an elevation approximately 5,539 feet (1,688 m) above sea level. Crystal Lake is the only naturally occurring lake in the San Gabriel Mountains. CURRENTLY OPEN As of 06/Sep/20 in the aftermath of the Bobcat Fire, Highway 39 is open once again all the way to the Recreation area, and the Cafe is open once again at its normal operation hours. The fire burned some of the West side around the lake itself however the camp spaces themselves were saved. Wawona Trail a.k.a. Islip Trail was burned about 30% of its length, from the lower lake parking lot up toward the North to the edge of the burn footprint. Little Jimmy Trail Camp burned, Little Jimmy Spring was saved, Windy Gap Saddle was saved, though about 9 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail overlooking the Recreation Area burned. The extent of the burn removed much of the chaparral and damaged pine and oak trees however tree death around the Recreation Area has been fairly minimal.  History  The area around Crystal Lake, before there was a campground and resort, was referred to as Pine Flat.A Celebrated Trail in Angeles National Forest The lake was called Sycamore LakeSycamore Lake by R. W. Dawson who lived at Sycamore Flats located down the hill from the lake. The lake has no sycamore trees, so the name was derived from Dawson's place. The area was a great draw for grizzly bearsKCET, Grizzly Bears as they seemed to prefer the lake waters to the stream waters. It was a dangerous place for a human to be without a firearm of some sort. Frightful grizzly bear stories abound from the middle 1860s. In 1887, Judge Benjamin Eaton, an early Pasadenan for whom Eaton Canyon is named, visited the pristine little lake and said, \\"The water is clear as crystal and the [visitors] found it good to drink.\\" The lake soon became known as Crystal Lake. Historic Photographs of Crystal Lake and the surrounding area from 1907 through the mid-1970s show that the campgrounds have been used by \\"Singing cowboys\\" during the era of black-and-white television, which used to feature cowboy shows. Because the campgrounds could be accessed from Angeles Crest Highway prior to the 1978 landslide,Highway 39 Landslide which demolished a half-mile section of California State Route 39 four miles (6 km) from Crystal Lake, Hollywood performers and other Los Angeles celebrities and politicians used to frequent the campgrounds because of the easy access across the San Gabriel Mountains. Crystal Lake Crystal Lake is a naturally formed lake, a rarity in Southern California. It is snow and spring fed and has no other artificial means of being replenished. Geographically it sits in a bed of decomposed granite. There is a fissure located at the bottom of the lake that depletes its water during and after the rain and snow season. Because of this, the lake's depths vary dramatically from a mean low of 35 feet (10.7 m) to a probable high of 150 feet (45.7 m), depending on seasonal precipitation. The Lake is settled neatly in a bowl below the granite crags surrounding Mount Hawkins. In the past, the lake had amenities for picnickers, anglers, and swimmers. In 1969, a severe rainy season flooded the restrooms on the shoreline, and the water became contaminated to the point that the swimming facilities were closed. Subsequent rainy seasons flooded the small cabin that served as a summer residence for concessionaires who operated a snack stand from the lower level and patio, and by 1990 the facility was demolished. Over the past four decades, budgeting has limited the Forest Service's ability to maintain the lake and its feeder pipeline. Then years of drought reduced the lake's water levels which continued microbiological contamination of the water, putting it off limits to any type of swimming at all. Following a good rainy season, the lake may be stocked with fish, typically rainbow trout from the government hatcheries. Despite high or low water levels, flocks of people line the lake to fish each summer. In the past the concessionaires provided boat rentals from a small dock that was attached to cables that ran onto shore. The dock could be raised and lowered during the year with the varying levels of the water. It was removed after the 1969 rains. As of July 2018 severe drought in California has nearly dried out Crystal Lake. It would take several years of El Nino type weather to add any significant amount of water to the lake. Swimming in the lake has been banned due to environmental and health issues involved with stagnant water. Campground Crystal Lake Campground goes back to the 1920s as a privately leased concession until 1946 when it was permanently taken over by the U.S. Forest Service. It served as the largest campground in the Angeles National Forest, and at its height had 232 campsites. The campground is upslope from the lake about and a one-way paved road provides easy automobile access to and from the lake. There is also a foot trail that provides a gentle walk through the forest to the lake site. The campground was always run by some sort of leased or contracted concession. The main facilities consist of a general store which grew from a small tackle house in the 1950s, to a fast food snack stand by the 1970s, rental cabins from the olden days, a residence for the concessionaires, service sheds and garages, an ice cream stand which opened in the summer, and a ranger station, which by 1990 had become a visitors center managed by forestry volunteers. Camping is $12 for first car, $5 for second, paid in a fee envelope. Away from the main campground are located the ruins of an old dance hall. In later years as the building deteriorated, the floor was left in open air, and a small shed was put up to house a juke box. By the 1960s this was all but abandoned. Just past the old dance floor is the amphitheater where campfire programs were used to gather the campers in the evening for group sing-alongs and maybe a nature film. Due to budget constraints, the remoteness of the area and other maintenance and logistics problems, the campground has faced closures of several camp sites reducing the number by nearly 100. In some cases the campground was completely closed. This forced the concessionaires to vacate, leaving campers and anglers no place to shop or eat if they didn't pack it in themselves. Management contractors were brought in to help run the facility, but in 2002 the Curve Fire burned through the canyons and the basin which forms the Recreation Area, prompting the campgrounds to be closed altogether for health and safety reasons. Due to extensive fire damage to the main highway (Highway 39) Caltrans has had the highway closed while repairs have been budgeted and scheduled and currently Caltrans has been completing the repairs needed on the last remaining bridge and will be installing new safety railing along a six-mile (10 km) section of the highway that was destroyed. Caltrans and the United States Forest Service are hoping to have the highway reopened late in 2009 and concessionaires are being solicited to bid on running and maintaining the campgrounds once the Recreation Area is reopened. In March 2011, it was reopened. Amphitheater Amphitheater One of the most interesting features of the Crystal Lake Recreation Areas is the amphitheater which was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and other agencies and was fully restored after the damage to the facility caused by the Curve Fire of 2002 by contractors. This open facility is often used by U. S. Forest Service volunteers and employees to give lectures to individuals, Boy Scouts, hikers, campers, and picnickers during the day and often at night. The amphitheater area is surrounded by electric lights and there are numerous electrical outlets along the walkway to the amphitheater itself. Drinking water is piped in to the facility through underground pipes fed from an underground water cistern which is in turn fed from Soldier Creek. The theater can seat about 200 individuals and there is a central ring where large fires can be had. A drinking fountain located on the walkway to the facility provides water taken from an underground cistern fed by Soldier Creek. Above the theater are the ruins of the large bandstand / dance floor that used to play host to Big Band Era music groups such as Benny Goodman and, on rare occasion, Elvis Presley‚Äîamong many other groups. The dance floor ruins continue to crumble however there is some hope that volunteers will restore the facility so that music groups will once again play, allowing visitors to enjoy Summer music in the open air of the campgrounds. USFS Visitor Center Visitor Center The United States Forest Service maintains a Visitor Center at the campgrounds, offering printed maps of available hiking and nature trails in the area as well as offering information about any questions that visitors may have. The Visitor Center is located across the parking lot from the kitchen and general store (which is run by a private individual and not by the USFS.) In many cases the Visitor Center will be staffed by highly knowledgeable individuals from the Angeles Volunteer Association or by other volunteers which can answer questions about the flora and fauna of the area as well as answer questions about the history of Crystal Lake. The hours of operation are posted on the bulletin board located at the front of the Center and if the Forest Ranger or Forestry volunteer has stepped out of the Center for a period of time, a sign is provided to alert visitors of when the person is expected to return to re- open the Center. Summertime hours limited to Saturday and Sunday only. There is no public telephone access available at the Recreation Area. The USFS employees and volunteers have radio communications capabilities with medical assistance, rescue, law enforcement, and other agencies in the event a visitor requires assistance, however the Visitor Center hours of operation are limited to weekends and some holidays, and emergency assistance may not always be available. There is drinking water located at many of the camp sites within the campground system, however there is also water available at the Visitor Center and the Cafe. The Visitor Center can be reached by telephone at (626) 910-1149 Saturdays and Sundays between the hours of 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  Cafe and store  Snack bar, store and kitchen There is a cafe that features a potbelly stove and an open patio with a number of tables next to an array of gas and charcoal grills for outdoor cooking. Crystal Lake page The cafe opens at dawn and closes after dark all days of the week except for Tuesdays when the cafe is closed. There are menus posted inside the cafe with specials listed on post boards outside of the cafe. Drinking water is available at a faucet outside the cafe, and trash bags are handed out to people to collect trash. The cafe has an ongoing policy that if you fill a trash bag and bring it back to them, the cafe will give you a free brownie or cup of coffee to encourage people to collect, bag, and dispose of litter. The cafe also provides plastic buckets for visitors to use to extinguish their camp fires with. The cafe's telephone number is (626) 910-1029. Cabin rentals can be acquired through using that telephone number. Hiking and nature trails Crystal Lake in Winter As a recreation area the campground had many nature trails for visitors which provided scenic and educational walks through various parts of the canyon: Pinion Ridge, Soldier Creek, Knob Hill, Golden Cup, Tototgna to name a few. The Lake Trail provides a one-mile (1.6 km) walk to the lake. The Windy Gap Trail ascends the south slope of Mount Hawkins to the saddle between Hawkins and Mount Islip, known as \\"Windy Gap\\", where it connects to the Pacific Crest Trail. * Half Knob Trail : ‚ÄîThis is a short hike trail which begins and ends at points along the main paved roadway leading to the Visitor Center.

The tax exempt volunteer Trailbuilders organization works closely with the USFS to perform maintenance on the trails in the region even when the region is periodically closed to the general public so that once the region is re-opened the trails are constantly in a reasonably safe condition for hikers to use. Most of the hiking trails receive maintenance according to the availability of volunteers, weather, and other factors however some trails require a two-day restoration effort and as such require an overnight stay which makes maintenance performed on those trails less frequent. The maintenance of trails within the Crystal Lake campgrounds consists mostly of repairing the tread upon which hikers walk, removing accumulated rocks, sand, and gravel, and reworking the tread to provide a gentle slope from which rain water can flow off the side of the trail (rather than down the trail which causes erosion and a difficult, uncomfortable hike). For some of the nature trails‚Äîsuch as Golden Cup and Lake Trail‚Äîmaintenance and repair has consisted of volunteers hauling in many thousands of pounds of rock, gravel, and sand using buckets to fill in sections of the trails which have been damaged by rainfall. When such efforts are performed, surveys of the lay of the trail and the surrounding land is performed to design rain water runoff schemes so that future rains won't damage the repair work which is being performed. Volunteer worker For most of the trails bark beetle infestation of pine trees has killed many trees, and the Curve Fire of 2002 also destroyed many trees along some of the most popular trails‚Äîsuch as Windy Gap, Soldier Creek, and Sunset Ridge. Trail restoration, repair, and maintenance for such areas consists of bucking up fallen trees with chainsaws or crosscut saws as needed and hauling the bucked up sections of the trees off of the trail. In some instances where hanging safety hazards exists, proactive maintenance is performed by safely pulling dead and hanging trees and tree limbs down to the ground where the hazards can be bucked up and removed. Less frequent repairs and maintenance involves the building of rock retaining walls to hold back rock and dirt slides which can flood sections of the campground's hiking trails. Additionally rock walkways across gullies are built to afford safer hiking across otherwise unsafe sections of trails. The San Gabriel Mountains Trailbuilders provide the tools, equipment and planning required for maintenance of the trails, soliciting and coordinating additional volunteers from organizations such as Buddhist Youth Groups, Boy Scouts of America, church groups, hiking, biking, and climbing clubs, High School students, and court-ordered Community Service individuals. Trail maintenance within the Crystal Lake Recreation Area never ends and because of the dedicated efforts of volunteers, the campgrounds boast of many enjoyable and reasonably safe hikes.  Reporting Trail And Other Problems  As of July 2018, obstructions, erosion, and other problems with hiking trails and nature trails located within the Recreation Area may be reported to the San Gabriel Mountains Trailbuilders web page created specifically to inform work crews of the need for maintenance. GPS coordinates of problems as well as photographs are helpful in coordinating trail repairs within the Recreation Area, so the trail crews appreciate as much information as visitors can provide. Other Recreation Area problems such as spray paint vandalism, leaking water outlets, overflowing camp sites or BBQ boxes may also be reported to the Trailbuilders as well as to the U. S. Forest Service Glendora, California offices at (626) 335-1251, Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Deer Flats Deer Flats is a group campground about one mile (1600 m) up the South Hawkins Road from the main campground. It has nine sites for groups of eight to fourteen. It provides an even more remote location for Scouting, church groups, retreats, etc. It too has been affected by the closing. The Group Campgrounds generally require a permit from the San Gabriel River Ranger District's offices before groups may utilize the group campgrounds. This is because individuals are encouraged to use the smaller camp sites located in the main grounds so that large groups may utilize the larger camp sites. Deer Flats Group Campground contains 25 very large camp sites, most of them with four large fire rings, many of them with concrete-and-stone ovens, and most of them with at least two large concrete tables upon which campers may cook and have picnics. Because Deer Flats is intended for large groups, downed trees are situated around the larger fire rings in most of the camp sites for seating. There is drinking water at Deer Flats, fed from water taken from a large water tank located at the Northern edge of the campgrounds. Water is distributed to the camp sites through a system of underground pipes, through a number of distribution valves and boxes, and then to individual drinking and outflow facilities located around the campgrounds. There are several toilet buildings located toward the Southern end of Deer Flats Group Campgrounds which have been installed after the Curve Fire swept through the area. The existing older stone toilet facilities are currently closed and will likely remain closed in favor of the newer, more environmentally friendly toilet facilities.

Expressing a pessimistic view of women, the novel suggests that, with disastrous effect, women, who are emotional and illogical, dominate men, the creative, rational force within humanity, who represent the builders of civilization. The males, known as bullpops, are of small stature. They spend their time building and rebuilding tall, complex, rather phallic towers that the gigantic women destroy as quickly as these structures are erected. Meanwhile, the females engage in sexual adventures, surviving by eating the brains of the miniature men, who have become little more than personified male genitals. The undersea kingdom is mentioned in the comic book version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

History The summer of 1886 had been unusually hot and dry, with numerous prairie fires, and water sources often dried up. In the fall, signs of a harsh winter ahead began to appear. Birds began flying south earlier than usual, beavers were seen collecting more wood than normal for the winter ahead, and some cattle grew thicker and shaggier coats. The first snows fell earlier than usual, in November, and were reported as some of the worst in memory. Extreme cold killed humans and animals. Some people got lost near their houses and froze to death very near their front doors. The winter weather even reached the West Coast, with snowfall of 3.7 inches in downtown San Francisco setting an all-time record on February 5, 1887. The loss of livestock was not discovered until spring, when many cattle carcasses were spread across the fields and washed down streams. The few remaining cattle were in poor health, emaciated and suffering from frostbite. This resulted in the cattle being sold for much less, in some cases leading to bankruptcy. Future president Theodore Roosevelt's cattle ranch near Medora, Dakota Territory was among those hit hard by that winter. In a letter to his friend, Henry Cabot Lodge, Roosevelt remarked \\"Well, we have had a perfect smashup all through the cattle country of the northwest. The losses are crippling. For the first time I have been utterly unable to enjoy a visit to my ranch. I shall be glad to get home.\\" See also * Drift fence * Overgrazing * Pastoral farming References  External links  * Briggs, Harold Edward, Ph. D. Frontiers of the Northwest.

Oslo, 11 January 1964) is a Norwegian composer.  Life  Aagaard-Nilsen grew up in Kabelv√•g on Lofoten in northern Norway. From 1986 to 1990 he studied at the Bergen Conservatory of Music (now known as the Grieg Academy) and at the University of Bergen.[ Biography], Allmusic From 1990 to 1994 he worked at the Bergen Conservatory as a teacher of contemporary classical music. Furthermore, he was leader of the Autunnale-festivalen - (Music Factory and Autunnale), also in Bergen. In 1992 and 1993 he arranged and composed for the Forsvarets Stabsmusikkorps Vestlandet - Norwegian Army Band, Bergen (NABB), writing, among other works, Arctic Landscape. In this period Aagaard-Nilsen wrote many works for wind band and brass band. Aagaard- Nilsen works as conductor of various school and amateur orchestras, and also as a teacher at the Manger Folkeh√∏gskule. He founded the forum Av garde together with Ketil Hvoslef, Jostein Stalheim and Knut Vaage. As a composer he has written for orchestra, chamber ensemble, choir, wind band and brass band. Works that exemplify Aagard-Nilsen's focus on narrative and visual aspects in a nearly impulsive form include Fabula I and Fabula II (1996), Sinfonietta (1998) and The Season of Blue Lights (2008) commissioned by BIT20 Ensemble. A stronger focus on expressive elements in Aagard-Nilsen's output is evident in works such as Pierrot's Lament (Concerto for Euphonium and Orchestra), premiered in 2001 with the Lahti Symphony Orchestra. The trumpet concerto Blue Phrases (2007), the sinfonietta The Season of Blue Light and quartet Blue Fragments (2008) are additional examples of Aagard-Nilsen's expressive focus; while the orchestral work Boreas Sings (2012) represents a new direction in which a spectrum of colours and dancing rhythms become evident. 2014 saw his orchestral work Boreas Bl√¶s (2014) premiered by the Norwegian Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra at the opening ceremony of Stormen, Bod√∏'s concert hall. March 2016 saw Aagard-Nilsen being bestowed with the Norwegian Music Publishing Association's Annual Award for his work Dirty Dancing, commissioned and premiered by the Christiania Bl√•seensemble in 2015.

He was Nara Narayan's commander-in-chief and got his name Chilarai because, as a general, he executed troop movements that were as fast as a chila (kite/Eagle). Biography Chilaray was the third son of Maharaja Biswa Singha (1523‚Äì1554 A.D.). It was only due to his Royal Patronage that Sankardeva was able to establish the Ek Saran Naam Dharma in Assam and bring about his cultural renaissance. Several kings, namely the then Raja of Manipur and the Khasi chief (Viryyavanta), submitted to the Koch army. Chilaray and his army also vanquished and killed the Jaintia Raja, and Rajas of Tippera (Tripura) and Sylhet. Chilaray is said to have never committed brutalities on unarmed common people, and even those kings who surrendered were treated with respect. They were harsh to kings and soldiers who refused to surrender, but the brothers never annexed conquered territories nor oppressed the people. They only collected tributes from the vanquished kings. They even treated enemy prisoners kindly, and gave them land-grants to settle. Chilaray also adopted guerrilla warfare successfully, even before Shivaji, the Maharaja of Maratha Empire did. The duo (Chilaray and Nara Narayan) turned towards Bengal, but unforeseen circumstances led to Chilaray's capture by the Afghan Sultan Sulaiman Khan Karrani, while Naranarayan retreated to his capital. Much of the Koch kingdom was then captured by the Afghans. Chilaray died in 1577 of small pox on the bank of Ganges.

Blair pursued a career in entertainment from the age of eight, and as a child worked as an amateur dancer, performed on radio, and worked as a model, before joining the chorus of Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe in 1940. There she met Gene Kelly; they were married the following year, when she was seventeen years old, and divorced sixteen years later in 1957. After work in the theatre, Blair began her film career playing supporting roles in films such as A Double Life (1947) and Another Part of the Forest (1948). Her interest in Marxism led to an investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee and Blair was blacklisted for some time, but resumed her career with a critically acclaimed performance in Marty (1955) for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She continued her career with regular theatre, film and television, mainly in Europe, work until the mid-1990s. Early life and education Blair was born in Cliffside Park, New Jersey. Her father, William Kidd Boger, was a partner in a small insurance brokerage firm; her mother, Frederica Ammon, was a schoolteacher. Both were Episcopalians. At the age of eight, she was enrolled in the Swift Sisters School of Dance, and recalled performing before Eleanor Roosevelt in 1933, winning an amateur contest shortly thereafter, joining a touring amateur show and performing on local radio, as motivating influences in her desire to pursue a dance career. She joined the John Robert Powers modeling agency and by the age of twelve was in regular demand. She enrolled in the Professional Children's School but, as it was not accredited, her mother returned her to her local school so that she might eventually attend college. She graduated at fifteen, securing a scholarship to Sarah Lawrence College. However, the Board of Admission considered her too immature for entry and requested she wait one year. Career =Stage= Blair with Ernest Borgnine in the trailer for Marty, 1955 In the interim, Blair joined the chorus at the International Casino in Times Square, and when it closed down, worked in the chorus of Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe from January 1940 where Gene Kelly was working as choreographer. \\"Gene fought for me. He said I could dance, and he needed some good dancers,\\" she wrote in her autobiography.Blair, p. 12. Blair and Kelly's relationship blossomed, culminating in their marriage in October 1941. She and Kelly remained married for sixteen years and had one daughter, Kerry Kelly Novick (b. 1942), together before divorcing in 1957. Blair left Rose's show to accept an offer from choreographer Robert Alton to join the chorus of Panama Hattie, an illustrious line-up which included June Allyson, Doris and Constance Dowling, and Vera-Ellen. Alton‚Äîwho had previously discovered Gene Kelly‚Äîhad spotted her when she unsuccessfully auditioned for a part in Louisiana Purchase.Blair, pp. 20‚Äì21. During this period she developed a strong interest in Marxism, having been introduced to Lloyd Gough by Kelly, and attended Gough's weekly Marxist study group, which Kelly did not attend. \\"And it was very serious. Our textbook was The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union... I was completely enthralled by the ideas.\\"Blair, p. 20. In early 1941, Blair secured her first role in a stage play when Kelly's friend William Saroyan chose her to play the female lead role of St. Agnes of the Mice in his play The Beautiful People at the Lyceum Theatre, playing opposite Eugene Loring, and securing excellent reviews from leading critics George Jean Nathan and Richard Watts, Jr.. Watts commented, \\"The gently sweetly sincere and completely moving gravity and innocence of Miss Blair's utterly right performance is so infinitely touching and beautiful than any studied portrayal could be, that her contribution to the work is gracefully enchanting.\\"Quoted in Blair, p. 33. =Film= Blair with her husband Karel Reisz in 1966 Blair was featured in such films as A Double Life (1947), Another Part of the Forest (1948), and The Snake Pit (1948). She continued to hold left-wing political views and admittedly attempted to join the Communist Party. In her autobiography, she revealed her application was rejected as the Party felt she would be more valuable as the wife of the progressive Kelly. Kelly himself was not a Communist and his status as a valuable star provided the couple some protection. In the 1950s, Blair was under investigation from HUAC and blacklisted for several years. She almost lost one of her signature roles, that of Marty's girlfriend in Marty (1955), but was restored to the role after Kelly threatened to pull out of It's Always Fair Weather. For her performance, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and prizes from the Cannes Film Festival. Her film career, nonetheless, was damaged during the \\"red scare\\" era and she had to seek work on stage in New York and in Europe. Following her divorce from Kelly, Blair moved permanently to Europe where she paired off with French actor and director Roger Pigaut, and continued to appear in films, including Juan Antonio Bardem's Calle Mayor (1956) and Michelangelo Antonioni's Il Grido (1957). By those years she self- confessedly became a conspicuous member of the avant la lettre European gauche caviar.Blair, p. 352. Blair married Czech-born director/ producer Karel Reisz in 1963, and would perform sporadically in later years working with Costa- Gavras' (Betrayed, 1988) and on the mini-series Scarlett in 1994. Reisz died in 2002. In 1980, she was a member of the jury at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival. Blair filmed scenes for Stephen Daldry's The Hours (2002), initially playing the older version of Julianne Moore's character. It is unclear if she was dropped or if she withdrew from the project. In 2003 she published her autobiography, The Memory of All That. Death Blair died of cancer in London on March 13, 2009. She is survived by a daughter, three stepchildren and several grandchildren.

The trail ascends Mount Le Conte, the sixth highest mountain east of the Mississippi River, and passes by many notable landmarks, such as Arch Rock, Inspiration Point, the Duckhawk Peaks, and Cliff Top, before merging with Rainbow Falls Trail near the summit. History The first recorded account of Alum Cave goes back to 1837 when three farmers, Ephraim Mingus, Robert Collins, and George W. Hayes from the Oconaluftee Indian Village in the Great Smoky Mountains applied at the Sevier County (Tennessee) Land Office for a grant of a tract of land that would include Alum Cave and its salt deposits. Tennessee sold the tract of land to the three men on December 6, 1838. The Epsom Salts Manufacturing Company was formed to mine the deposit. The materials mined were alum, magnesium sulfate, saltpeter, magnesia, and copperas. The easily accessible salts were depleted by the mid-1840s, but mining resumed during the Civil War. There is no report on any mining after the Civil War.T. Dennis Coskren and Robert J. Lauf, The Minerals of Alum, Cave Bluff: Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee., Mineralological Record. March/April 2000 Trail synopsis The Alum Cave Trail is the shortest and steepest of the five trails leading to the Le Conte massif, which contains four separate peaks in all, the highest of which has an elevation of . Due to its short length and scenery (it is often considered Le Conte's most scenic route) it is the most common footpath for hikers seeking to reach the summit of Le Conte. The entire trail is within Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The trailhead is about from the town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, off Newfound Gap Road (U.S. Highway 441) =Trailhead to Arch Rock= The Alum Cave Trail provides many scenic overlooks The Alum Cave Trail begins its ascent at by quickly crossing two streams: Walker Camp Prong and Alum Cave Creek, the latter of which flanks the trail for the first of its length. This first leg of the trail leads the hiker through an old-growth forest, consisting largely of hemlock and yellow birch and is relatively easy, as the climb is gradual and the footpath is well-maintained due to its heavy traffic. The first notable landmark comes into the hike at what is known as Arch Rock, which is a large black slate rock that has, over millennia, come to create, as the name indicates, a large natural arch. Hikers maneuver easily through the cold, moist rock via stairs and steel cables acting as handrails which are placed at numerous points along the footpath. =Arch Rock to Alum Cave Bluff= A hiker who ascends beyond Arch Rock will gradually hear the shift from the powerful company of Alum Cave Creek to the smaller Styx Branch, which accompanies the path for a short distance. Inspiration Point is the next landmark along this less trafficked, though still popular, portion of the trail. Upon this outcropping of rocks about in elevation, a hiker can, on a clear day, get an unobscured view of the surrounding landscape, most notably Little Duck Hawk Ridge. Not far from Inspiration Point, the Eye of the Needle (a round, see-through hole cut into the side of Little Duck Hawk Ridge) can be seen to the left as the hiker continues along the now rocky trail. Not far from there, at from the trail head, the hiker finds the ubiquitous orange clay of Alum Cave Bluff. The bluff is at in elevation, and is in height. The bluff is the final destination along the trail for many hikers. In winter, massive icicles often form and crash down onto the trail, making the bluff dangerous; in other seasons, the bluff forms a shelter from the frequent rainstorms in these mountains. =Alum Cave Bluff to the LeConte Lodge= The Alum Cave Trail is very rocky and can be dangerous in wet weather Once the hiker reaches this final section of the trail (over half of the path's total distance) most of the company has been left behind, leaving only hikers headed for Le Conte's pinnacle. The first half mile or so beyond the bluffs is the single steepest portion of the hike, and included in this section is Gracie's Pulpit. Named for the matron of the mountain, Gracie McNichol, who famously hiked the trail on her 92nd birthday (among very many other times), the pulpit marks the halfway point of the Alum Cave Bluff Trail. From here the onlooker can get as clear a view as any other along the trail of the four peaks of Le Conte (West Point, Cliff Tops, High Top, and Myrtle Point). After Gracie's Pulpit, the trail is a scenic, peaceful hike through highland Appalachia toward the end of the trail, with many small water crossings and overlooks along the way. Once the plateau is reached, what once was a beautiful Fraser fir zone, which due to the ravages of the balsam wooly adelgid and acid rain, now is dominated with dead trees. A prolific crop of healthy young Fraser firs grows in the place of the old dead ones in many areas, giving hope for the future of the species.

The lodge provides the only commercial lodging in the national park, as it operates about ten rustic cabins with no electricity or appliances.

He later became the vice president of Newsweek magazine. Career Born in Chicago, Illinois, Truitt was raised in a prominent family in Baltimore, Maryland. He served as a Naval officer in the Pacific theatre of World War II, then returned to work for the US State Department. He married his first wife, Anne, in September 1947 in Washington, D.C.. In spring 1948 he went to work for Life magazine in New York, then became their Washington correspondent. He spent three years with Life in San Francisco, then he returned to Washington, D.C. in May 1960 to become the personal assistant to Philip Graham at the Washington Post, where he rose to become vice president. He also worked for Time, served as publisher of Art News, and became vice president of Newsweek in 1964. Later in 1963, Truitt left the Post and moved to Tokyo as the Japan bureau chief for Newsweek. The Truitts later returned to Washington and to the Post. Allegations about Mary Pinchot Meyer in the National Enquirer The March 2, 1976 issue of the National Enquirer quoted Truitt as stating Mary Pinchot Meyer, the ex-wife of Cord Meyer, had a two-year affair with John F. Kennedy and that they smoked marijuana in a White House bedroom. According to Truitt, their first rendezvous occurred after Meyer was chauffeured to the White House in a limousine driven by a Secret Service agent where she was met by Kennedy and taken to a bedroom. He stated that Meyer and Kennedy regularly met in that manner, sometimes two or three times each week, until his assassination. Truitt said the two would \\"usually have drinks or dinner alone or sometimes with one of the aides\\", and claimed that Meyer offered marijuana cigarettes to Kennedy after one such meeting on April 16, 1962. He said after they smoked three joints she commented, \\"This isn't like cocaine. I'll get you some of that.\\" According to the Enquirer, Meyer also kept a diary of the affair. The paper quoted Tony Bradlee ‚Äî Meyer's sister ‚Äî as confirming the existence of the affair and the diary, stating that Bradlee found the diary in Meyer's studio after her death, then turned it over to James Jesus Angleton who subsequently burned it at CIA headquarters. In an interview with a correspondent from The Washington Post, Truitt confirmed the Enquirer's account, stated that Meyer had told him of the affair, and that he had kept notes about what he had been told. According to Truitt, Meyer and Kennedy met approximately 30 times ‚Äî frequently when Jackie Kennedy was out of town ‚Äî from January 1962 until the time of the President's death in November 1963. Truitt stated that the two would occasionally have drinks or dinner with one of Kennedy's aides, whom he identified as David Powers and Timothy J. Reardon Jr.. Contradicting his earlier account with the Enquirer, Truitt said Kennedy gave the marijuana to Meyer. Truitt acknowledged that he received payment from the Enquirer, but did not disclose the amount of payment. Reardon subsequently denied Truitt's account, and Powers was reported to have been unavailable for comment. Kennedy's appointments secretary Kenneth O'Donnell also denied Truitt's allegations of a love affair, stating that Meyer \\"knew Jackie as well as she knew Jack.\\" He said Meyer made infrequent visits to the White House through his office, but that none of them were ever arranged privately. When the Associated Press asked Tony Bradlee about the affair, she responded: \\"I knew nothing about it when Mary was alive. I have no further comment.\\" She also told The Washington Post: \\"The National Enquirer quoted my words out of context to make it appear as though I corroborated their story.\\" Angleton acknowledged that Meyer had been a \\"cherished friend\\" to him and his wife and that he had assisted her family after her death in a \\"purely private capacity\\", but refused to say whether there had been a diary. According to the Post, an unidentified source said that Meyer's diary was found, primarily discussing art along with a vague reference to an unnamed friend, then destroyed in keeping with her wishes. While reporting on the allegations, the AP, UPI and The Washington Post cited records from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that indicated Truitt's former wife had sought a conservatorship for Truitt as part of their 1969 divorce and support proceedings. Given that a physician certified that Truitt had been suffering from a mental illness that was \\"such as to impair his judgment and cause him to be irresponsible\\", a court-appointed conservator was named to manage his financial matters. According to the Post: \\"Washington attorneys familiar with the matter said he has written many rambling and bitter letters in recent years to Ben Bradlee and others threatening exposure of alleged scandals.\\" Later years and death In the years that followed, Truitt's mental health allegedly declined. In 1969, Ben Bradlee forced him to resign from the Post, with accusations of mental incompetence. Truitt accepted a settlement in exchange for a signed statement that he would not write anything that was \\"in any way derogatory\\" of the Washington Post. Truitt and Anne divorced in 1971, and he moved to Mexico where he married Evelyn Patterson. Truitt committed suicide on November 18, 1981 in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. He had been described by his first wife, Anne, as being \\"so ill\\".

The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Fife Circle Line, north of .  History  The station was opened by the Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway on 1 November 1877, named Dunfermline, Comely Park. It was rebuilt in 1889, the Down (northbound) platform being extended eastwards with a new booking office building and a new Up (southbound platform) being provided; the extended facilities were brought into use on 5 March 1890, from which date the station was known as Dunfermline Lower in contradistinction to Dunfermline Upper on the line to Stirling. After the latter station was closed in 1968, the suffix was dropped and it became known as plain Dunfermline. During the 1970s and 1980s British Rail only ran a regular daytime service on the Dunfermline line between Edinburgh and as far as Cowdenbeath; Lochgelly & Cardenden were only served during the weekday business peaks, whilst the remainder of the route to Thornton Junction was freight-only (having been closed to passengers in 1969). In 1989 though, BR decided to restore the Fife circular . In March 1998, Dalgety Bay opened, while two years later in 2000, a new station was opened in the expanding eastern suburbs of Dunfermline and given the name of Dunfermline Queen Margaret, after the nearby Queen Margaret hospital. To prevent confusion following the opening of the nearby Dunfermline Queen Margaret in 2000, the station was again renamed to Dunfermline Town. Around the same time the frequency was improved to every 30mins to Edinburgh.  Station facilities  The station can be accessed from St. Margaret's Drive. The station building is on the northbound platform. In the building is a ticket office, a toilet (accessed by key) and a kiosk. There is also a CCTV monitoring centre for stations in the east of Scotland and a taxi ordering office. There is a public phone at the entrance and there are waiting rooms on both platforms. The platforms are connected by a ramped subway, this providing an alternative access to the station from Woodmill Street on the south side. There is a taxi rank at the main entrance and station car parks on both sides of the railway. CCTV is in operation.  Train services  On Mondays to Saturdays during the daytime, there is generally a half-hourly service southbound to , and a half- hourly service northbound round the Fife Circle as far as , with one service continuing through , eventually coming back to . In the evenings the service is hourly (and terminates at Glenrothes with Thornton) There is also a daily service to and from Perth via Markinch.

It is best known for its \\"cart ruts\\", a complex network of tracks carved in the rock. The age and purpose of the tracks is uncertain. In general, most archaeologists presume that the site developed about 2000 BC after new settlers came over from Sicily, starting the Bronze Age in Malta. It is reported that the \\"Clapham Junction\\" nickname was given by an Englishman, who later reported that it reminded him of the busy railway station Clapham Junction in London. Origin of the tracks Similar tracks (known and signposted in Malta as Cart Ruts) can be found in a number of sites on both the major islands. Busewdien in St Paul's Bay, Naxxar, San Gwann and Bidnija are good examples on the main Island. Gozo's best are on the Ta‚Äô ƒäenƒã plateau, Sannat. Those at Misra—õ G—õar il-Kbir are up to deep and have an average distance between them of . Some cross while others form junctions, creating the illusion of a great railway station switching yard. A cart ruts junction at Ghar il-Kbir Research published in 2008 describes them as caused by wooden-wheeled carts eroding soft limestone. An analysis was made of the stresses that would have been caused by a cart which would fit the ruts. Professor Mottershead of Portsmouth University said \\"The underlying rock in Malta is weak and when it‚Äôs wet it loses about 80 per cent of its strength. The carts would have first made tracks in the soil but when that eroded, the cartwheels ran directly on the bedrock, making it easier for other carts to follow the same tracks.Mottershead, Derek; Alastair Pearson & Martin Schaefer \\"The cart ruts of Malta: an applied geomorphology approach\\" (Abstract + References) Antiquity Vol 82:318, 2008 pp 1065-1079 References External links http://www.gozo.gov.mt/pages.aspx?page=747 Archaeological sites in Malta History of Malta Siƒ°ƒ°iewi Out-of- place artifacts hu:Ker√©knyomok (M√°lta) ","title":"Misraƒß Gƒßar il-Kbir"},{"id":"4331175","text":":Not to be confused with his father, Mather Byles I or his son Mather Byles III Mather Byles II (12 January 1734/1735 - 12 March 1814), was a Congregational clergyman at New London, Connecticut Colony until 1768.

A French-trained Sara officer, his first prominent assignment came in 1966 when, still a lieutenant, he was made by President Fran√ßois Tombalbaye prefect of the key Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti (BET) region, which France, Chad's former colonial power, had evacuated only in 1964, four years after the independence of the country. He was among those accused of misrule by the French Administrative Reform Mission (MRA) in 1969, for his contempt of Muslim traditions and especially of the dia, the blood wealth. All the same, under Tombalbaye Djogo made a fast career and became general and Chief of Staff of the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT), when he was arrested by the President on March 23, 1975 in what was yet another of many purges in the army. He did not remain long in jail: on April 13 a military coup removed Tombalbaye. Immediately freed from jail, the coupists offered him the presidency of the new military junta, but when he declined they asked F√©lix Malloum, who on April 15 assumed the position of new head of state of the country. Malloum's military government crumbled in 1979 when the Prime Minister Hiss√®ne Habr√©, a former Muslim warlord, broke with the President on February 12 and attacked the capital N'Djamena with his militia, the Armed Forces of the North (FAN). The army's Head of staff, general Nguemourou, reacted weakly and finally resigned the command to Djogo on February 14. His authority was early contested by the colonel Wadel Abdelkader Kamougu√©, the head of the gendarmerie, the military police, which was the sole unit of the army that did not disintegrate in the battle; and when the FAT, defeated, left the capital for Southern Chad on April 15, Kamougu√© was in command while Djogo remained at N'Djamena. The rift was becoming evident already in the second peace conference held at Kano in Nigeria between April 3 and April 11, when all factions were invited to form a Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT). Djogo was able to eclipse here Kamougu√©, and as a result Djogo was nominated Vice President of the new government sworn in on April 29, as representative of the FAT. President became Lol Mohamed Shawa, a proteg√© of Nigeria, Habr√© Defense Minister and Goukouni Oueddei Interior Minister. Djogo was also proclaimed commander-in- chief of the new armed forces that were to unite the old FAT and the militias. The government did not live long, principally for the exclusion from the GUNT of important Libya-supported militias, which promptly formed a counter- government, the Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR), led by Ahmat Acyl. Also, many countries refused to recognize the new government: Djogo experimented this personally at the 6th Franco-African Summit held at Kigali on May 21 and May 22. Djogo had been entrusted with leading the Chadian delegation at the summit, when doubt on the GUNT's representativity voiced by a number of delegates brought to the abrupt departure of the Chadians. Bye mid-summer it was clear that the end of Shawa's government was at hand. Nigeria opened new rounds of negotiation for the formation of a more comprehensive government; after a first failure, the second conference held at Lagos was more successful, and all factions, including the CDR, signed the Lagos Accord on August 21. As a result, o new GUNT was formed on September 3, with Goukouni as new President and Kamougu√© as vice president. Djogo tried to politically reemerge by attacking Kamougu√©. The occasion came on March 1, 1980, when he promoted in N'Djamena a manifesto for the formation a unitarian decentralized state, but he obtained little support for it, mainly some officers that had not followed Kamougu√© in 1979 and also some functionaries tied to the former Tombalbaye Regime. When Habr√©, who had broken with the GUNT in 1980, conquered N'Djamena in 1982 and made himself new President, the other northern factions of the GUNT refused to surrender and reunited their forces in the BET Prefecture. While Goukouni remained its president, its military forces were united under the command of Djogo, who proved himself an able general defeating Habr√©'s forces at Gouro and Ounianga in 1982. He was also the nominal commander of the GUNT's new army, the National Liberation Army (Arm√©e de Lib√©ration National or ALN), which with massive Libyan man support inflicted a crushing blow to Habr√©'s forces between June and August 1983. In 1984 Djogo broke with the GUNT, unhappy of its internal disputes. He formed in Paris in 1985 the Democratic Front of Chad (Front D√©mocratique du Tchad or FDT), a coalition of groups that opposed both Goukouni and Habr√©. But Habr√© was able to win over the party in peace talks held at Libreville in Gabon under the patronage of the President Omar Bongo, which included also Alphonse Kotiga's Codos and Acheikh ibn Oumar's CAC-CDR. Djogo signed for his party on December 23, 1985. In exchange Djogo became Minister of Justice, but Habr√© remains in full control with his National Union for Independence and Revolution (UNIR) sole legal party. And even if Djogo insisted in a press conference held on March 4, 1986 that the FDT's goal was to restore democratic liberties, he remained unsurprisingly vague. In mid-1988 he was shifted to the Ministry of transportation and civil aviation, and finally entered in 1989 in the Central Committee of the UNIR with other former opposition leaders. His downfall came in 1990 with the ruin of Habr√©, who was overthrown by Idriss D√©by; from then he lost any political importance.

It concerned the legality of abortion in the Australian state of Victoria. The ruling was not the end of the case, but rather answered certain questions of law about the admissibility of evidence, so as to allow the trial to proceed. In the ruling, Justice Menhennitt ruled that abortion might be lawful if necessary to protect the physical or mental health of the woman, provided that the danger involved in the abortion did not outweigh the danger which the abortion was designed to prevent. It was the first ruling on the legality of abortion in any part of Australia. The principles put forward by Justice Menhennitt have since been drawn upon in other parts of the country. Background to the ruling Charles Davidson, a medical doctor, was charged with four counts of unlawfully using an instrument to procure the miscarriage of a woman, and one count of conspiring to do the same, offences prohibited in the Victorian Crimes Act 1958. When Justice Menhennitt gave this ruling, the trial had been going for eight days. The prosecution was about to call expert medical testimony, and Menhennitt anticipated that the admissibility of that evidence might be challenged, so he decided to rule on certain questions of law in advance. The relevant section of the Crimes Act, section 65, stated that: > Whosoever... with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman whether she > is or is not with child unlawfully administers to her or causes to be taken > by her any poison or other noxious thing, or unlawfully uses any instrument > or other means with the like intent, shall be guilty of a felony, and shall > be liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than fifteen years. , the only subsequent change to this law is in the classification of the crime, from felony to indictable offence. The remainder of the wording remains the same. Menhennitt discussed the background of the section, saying that it was drawn from an 1861 English law, the Offences against the Person Act 1861, which in turn derived from English laws from 1837, 1828 and 1803. Arguments The main issue to be considered was what the word \\"unlawfully\\" meant in this context. Justice Menhennitt noted that the inclusion of the word implied that some abortions might be lawful. The word \\"unlawfully\\" had also appeared in the earlier English legislation from which the Victorian law had derived, and the same word was also used in earlier common law indictments. The word was not defined in any of those statutes, although in the United Kingdom the Abortion Act 1967 had been passed in the meantime, which provided a definition of when abortions were lawful. That legislation had no equivalent in Victoria however, and \\"unlawfully\\" remained undefined. =English precedent= The only case that had specifically considered what \\"unlawfully\\" meant in the context of abortion was a 1938 English case heard in the Courts of Assize, R v Bourne. In that case, Dr Bourne was charged with the crime of abortion under section 58 of the Offences Against The Person Act 1861 (the same section on which the Victorian law drew). During his summing up, the trial judge instructed the jury that \\"no person ought to be convicted [of the crime of abortion] unless the jury are satisfied the act was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother.\\"R v Bourne [1938] 3 All ER 615 The trial judge said that first this was the appropriate definition of abortion at common law, and secondly that although particular wording did not appear in the definition of the crime of abortion, it did appear in the definition of the crime of child destruction (which applies when a person kills a child during childbirth), and that the word \\"unlawfully\\" in the definition of abortion implied that the wording should also apply to abortion. The trial judge continued, saying: > I think those words ought to be construed in a reasonable sense, and, if the > doctor is of opinion, on reasonable grounds and with adequate knowledge, > that the probable consequence of the continuance of the pregnancy will be to > make the woman a physical or mental wreck, the jury are quite entitled to > take the view that the doctor who, under those circumstances and in that > honest belief, operates, is operating for the purpose of preserving the life > of the mother. Justice Menhennitt described why the proviso from the definition of child destruction in the English legislation should also apply to the definition of abortion, by pointing out that under another provision of the same law, abortion was an alternative charge to child destruction and vice versa (that is, the jury could choose to substitute one charge for the other). As such, there was a strong argument to say that the same proviso should apply to both. However, as Justice Menhennitt pointed out, the Victorian definition of child destruction (in section 10 of the Crimes Act) does not include the proviso in the English legislation; instead, it simply says \\"unlawfully\\". As such, that argument would not apply in Victoria, and \\"what is lawful and what is unlawful must be determined by other legal principles.\\" =Necessity= Justice Menhennitt then considered a discussion of R v Bourne by Glanville Williams, in his book The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law, in which Williams said: > The judge's direction to the jury, which resulted in Mr. Bourne's acquittal, > is a striking vindication of the legal view that the defence of necessity > applies not only to common law but even to statutory crimes. It is true that > the direction proceeded in some slight degree on the analogy of the child > destruction statute, which contains an express exemption for the > preservation of the life of the mother; but the exception in the one statute > was not in itself a ground for reading a similar exception into the other. On this basis, although there were differences in the Victorian legislation, the definition in R v Bourne of \\"unlawfully\\" in the context of abortion could indeed be useful in Victoria, if recognised as an expression of the common law defence of necessity. Justice Menhennitt discussed various definitions of necessity, noting that the concepts of necessity and proportion are usually present. He also quoted a test for necessity laid down by a previous decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in R v MacKay, a case about the killing of an escaping prisoner: > ...the test laid down by the law today for determining whether the homicide > is justifiable or not is a twofold test which may be stated in this form: > (1) Did the accused honestly believe on reasonable grounds that it was > necessary to do what he did in order to prevent the completion of the felony > or the escape of the felon? and (2) Would a reasonable man in his position > have considered that what he did was not out of proportion to the mischief > to be prevented?. In the context of abortion under Victorian law, this principle of necessity would mean that anyone performing a termination would have to have an honest and reasonable belief that conducting the termination was necessary to prevent some serious harm from occurring to the woman. Thus the test would be a subjective one, with the requirement that the beliefs be held reasonably. Judgment Justice Menhennitt decided in favour of using the principle of necessity to give substance to \\"unlawfulness\\" in this context. He expressed a test for deciding whether a termination would be unlawful or not in this way: > For the use of an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage to be > lawful the accused must have honestly believed on reasonable grounds that > the act done by him was (a) necessary to preserve the woman from a serious > danger to her life or her physical or mental health (not being merely the > normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth) which the continuance of the > pregnancy would entail; and (b) in the circumstances not out of proportion > to the danger to be averted. Consequences The trial proceeded, and Davidson was found not guilty by the jury on all five charges, on 3 June 1969. The primary significance of the decision was that it referred to both physical and mental health of the mother as a factor in a lawful abortion. The principles in the ruling were largely adopted in the state of New South Wales by the District Court of New South Wales in 1971 in the case of R v Wald,R v Wald (1971) 3 25. Confirmed in . which also involved the prosecution of a doctor for performing a termination. That case expanded the definition slightly, by pointing out that \\"it would be for the jury to decide whether there existed in the case of each woman any economic, social or medical ground or reason which in their view could constitute reasonable grounds upon which an accused could honestly and reasonably believe there would result a serious danger to her physical or mental health\\". In the state of Queensland, the principles in the Menhennitt ruling were cited in the 1986 case of R v Bayliss & Cullen.R v Bayliss & Cullen (1986) 9 Queensland Lawyer Reports 8. In the other states, and in the Northern Territory (but not the Australian Capital Territory), legislation has been adopted to define which abortions are legal and which are not. In 1974, the Whitlam government provided that Medibank (now called Medicare) benefits could be paid to women who underwent a termination procedure. In 1979, however, there was a motion in the Australian House of Representatives from Stephen Lusher to end medical benefits for terminations, and the debate spilled over to the legality of abortion. Although the decisions in Davidson and Wald were fiercely criticised by some members of parliament, who insisted that abortion was still illegal, others defended the validity of the decisions. Former Prime Minister Billy McMahon said \\"it has been stated rather foolishly, by a member not very closely attuned to the law - that there has been no appeals. But there could have been an appeal. There was no restriction in either State, Liberal Country Party or Labor government as to appeal.\\" Despite some disquiet from the anti-abortion lobby, no appeals have been lodged against the Menhennitt ruling or the other decisions, and in most states there have been no successful prosecutions for consensual abortion since those decisions. Anti-abortion writers contend that most abortions remain illegal, and that the courts and the prosecutors are lax in protecting the rights of unborn children. Other commentators argue that calling abortion technically illegal is incorrect, or otherwise pointless, since that is \\"a meaningless category in law.\\" In 2008, after a conscience vote in the Victorian parliament, legislation reforming abortion laws was passed. The new law legalizes abortion on request up to 24 weeks pregnancy; after that time, two doctors must certify that they \\"reasonably believe that the abortion is appropriate in all the circumstances\\", with those circumstances encompassing \\"all relevant medical circumstances; and the woman's current and future physical, psychological and social circumstances.\\"Abortion Law Reform Bill 2008 See also * Abortion in Australia * Australian criminal law References * R v Davidson (Australia) R v Davidson Australian criminal law Supreme Court of Victoria cases 1969 in Australian law R v Davidson (Australia) ","title":"R v Davidson"},{"id":"4331268","text":"The Palletized Load System (PLS) is a truck-based logistics system that entered service in the United States Army in 1993. It performs long and short distance freight transport, unit resupply, and other missions in the tactical environment to support modernized and highly mobile combat units. It provides rapid movement of combat configured loads of ammunition and all classes of supply, shelters and intermodal containers. It is similar to systems such as the British Demountable Rack Offload and Pickup System (DROPS). History In January 1989, the United States Army Tank Automotive Command awarded prototype PLS contracts to Oshkosh Truck Corporation, the PACCAR Government Group and General Motors, Military Vehicle Operations, with each contractor to deliver nine trucks, six trailers, and 30 flatracks for prototype hardware testing which began in September 1989. Oshkosh Truck Corporation was awarded a five- year contract for PLS in September 1990, with production commencing in 1992. The original contract award was for 2626 PLS trucks, 1050 M1076 PLS trailers, and 11,030 M1077 PLS flat racks. Under the initial PLS contract, between 1992‚Äì1997 Oshkosh delivered 2905 PLS trucks and 1534 PLS trailers. Around half of the PLS trucks were fitted with a Grove material handling crane and were designated M1074. PLS without the crane are designated M1075. Between 1997 and 2001, Oshkosh Truck delivered a further 595 PLS trucks and 800 PLS trailers, increasing fleet size to 3,500 trucks and 2,334 trailers. In March 2001, Oshkosh Truck was awarded the Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (FHTV) contract. FHTV included provision for up to 740 PLS trucks and 1060 PLS trailers. The FHTV contract was extended twice, following which FHTV2 was awarded to Oshkosh Truck. In October 2008 FHTV 3 was awarded to Oshkosh Defense. In addition to PLS and PLS trailers, FHTV covers deliveries of Oshkosh Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) and Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET). As part of the FHTV 3 contract, Oshkosh commenced deliveries of PLS in A1 configuration. The last of 6,288 production PLS A0 was delivered in December 2009. Oshkosh announced in January 2012 that it had been awarded a bridge contract by the U.S. Army to continue FHTV production. Under this extended contract, the government could place orders through October 2013 and Oshkosh Defense could deliver through September 2014. By mid-2013 more than 2,150 PLS A1 and nearly 15,000 PLS trailers had been built. On 27 June 2018, Oshkosh announced that the United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) had awarded the company a $49 million contract to integrate existing PLS trucks with scalable autonomous technology as part of the U.S. Army's Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) program. Under the contract, Oshkosh will integrate an initial 70 autonomy kits for Program Development and Operational Technical Demonstrations (OTD). The contract holds an option to procure up to 150 autonomy kits. The ExLF program addresses the needs of the Leader Follower Directed Requirement and Program of Record by removing soldiers from the vehicle while operating in highly contested areas. =Recapitalization program= Through recapitalization, used vehicles are returned to the manufacturer, rebuilt and returned to the user with a new warranty and the latest configuration. On 19 June 2015, Oshkosh Defense announced the company had been awarded a five-year requirements contract by the U.S. Army to recapitalize its Family of Heavy Tactical Vehicles (FHTV). The potential value of the contract is $780 million and it covers an estimated 1,800 FHTVs. All work performed under the contract will be completed in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, with deliveries occurring from 2015 to 2019. The contract also includes the production of approximately 1,000 PLS trailers. In March 2016, Oshkosh received another FHTV-4 contract valued at $430 million and covering the recapitalization of 1212 HEMTTs and PLS, plus the production of 345 new-build PLS trailers. Deliveries are slated for 2016‚Äî2017. In April 2017, Oshkosh announced further FHTV-4 awards valued at more than $258 million for the Recap of 670 FHTVs plus the production of 356 PLS trailers. Deliveries commenced in December 2017. On 23 May 2018, Oshkosh announced a further FHTV-4 order valued at $235.2 million for the recapitalization of 410 FHTVs and the manufacture of 680 new PLS trailers, with deliveries to commence in 2019. On 8 February 2019, Oshkosh announced another FHTV-4 contract valued at $225.7 million for the recapitalisation of 407 FHTVs and the manufacture of 601 new PLS trailers, with deliveries to commence in 2019. The total number of PLS covered by this and previous FHTV-4 delivery orders is unknown but in total Oshkosh has recapitalized over 12,500 HEMTTs and 3,000 PLS trucks since 1995. Components An early Oshkosh M1075A0 PLS truck The Palletized Load System (PLS) is based around two variants of prime mover truck (M1074 and M1075) fitted with an integral self- loading and unloading capability, a trailer (M1076), and demountable cargo beds, referred to as flatracks. PLS trucks and trailers are air-transportable in C-5A and C-17 cargo aircraft. =Truck= The PLS prime mover truck carries its payloads on its demountable flatrack cargo beds, or inside 8√ó8√ó20 foot International Organization for Standardization (ISO) intermodal containers, or shelters. The M1074 is equipped with a variable reach material handling crane (MHC), the M1075 is not. A dp Manufacturing PLS-22K self-recovery winch with a capacity of 9,072 kg is an option on both the M1074 and M1075. The Oshkosh PLS truck is based on a C-section chassis formed of 356 √ó 89 √ó 9.5 mm SAE 1027 modified heat-treated carbon manganese steel with a yield strength of 758 Mpa. Bolted construction with Grade 8 bolts is used throughout. PLS is unusual in that it is a five-axle truck, with two front and three rear axles, and with steering on the rear (5th) and front axle pair. A five-axle (10 √ó 10) configuration was selected by Oshkosh as it provides optimum turning capability and good weight distribution between all axles providing mobility and capability above the desired level of the U.S. Army specification. Competing PLS designs were both four-axle (8x8s), the Paccar offering having a single front axle and rear tridem, the General Motors offering was an Americanised MAN KAT1 (8√ó8). Current PLS A1 variants are powered by a Caterpillar C-15 four-stroke diesel developing 600 hp, this coupled to an Allison 4500SP six-speed automatic transmission, and Oshkosh 36000 Series two- speed transfer case. The original PLS was powered by a Detroit Diesel 8V92TA V-8 two-stroke diesel developing 500 hp, with later production examples having the electronically-controlled DDECIV version of this engine. Original PLS were fitted with an Allison CLT-755 ATEC 5F/1R automatic transmission and Oshkosh 55000 two-speed transfer box. After October 2005, an Allison HD-4500 Generation 4 six-speed automatic transmission was fitted. All PLS variants have the same rear tridem unit which consists of a single Hendrickson-Turner air-sprung drive axle (3rd axle) and a Hendrickson RT-400 leaf-sprung AxleTech tandem (4th and 5th axles) on which the rearmost axle contra-steers. On PLS A1 variants the front AxleTech/Oshkosh axles are sprung using Oshkosh's TAK-4 fully independent coil spring suspension. The original PLS had a pair of rigid AxleTech front axles, these with leaf springs. Tires are Michelin 1600R 20. Current fit is Michelin XZL, earlier PLS were fitted Michelin XL. A central tire inflation system (CTIS) is fitted, this having four settings - HWY (highway) ‚Ä¢ CC (cross-country) ‚Ä¢ MSS (mud sand snow) ‚Ä¢ EMERG (emergency). A spare wheel and tire is mounted behind the cab on A0 variants. On A1 variants the spare wheel and tire is located on the right-hand side of the vehicle, on the top of the engine/cooling compartments. The two-seat forward control cab is a development of the original Oshkosh M977 HEMTT cab. The PLS A1 (and HEMTT A4)has a visually similar, but slightly larger, revised cab. An add-on armor kit has been developed for the M1074/M1075 by Armor Holdings Inc. PLS A1's cab is compliant with the U.S. Army's Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) requirements of an A- and B-kit armoring philosophy. Additionally, it comes as standard with integrated floor armor. =Trailer= The M1076 is a three-axle dolly- type trailer. It is capable of carrying the same 16.5 short ton payload as the prime mover. Flatracks can be on- and off-loaded from the trailer by the prime mover's load handling system. Without leaving the cab, the driver can load or unload the truck in less than one minute, and both truck and trailer in less than five minutes. The M1076 can be towed by M1074 and M1075 PLS trucks. =Flatrack= Three types of flatrack have been procured as part of the system, the M1077/M1077A1, the M3/M3A1 and the M1 ISO Compatible Flatrack. The M1077 and M1077A1 General Purpose A-frame flatracks are sideless flatracks used to transport pallets of ammunition and other classes of supplies. On the ISO-compatible Palletized Flatrack (IPF) Type M1 there are two end walls, one incorporating the A-frame. Both walls can fold down inwardly for stacking when empty. The M3/M3A1 Container Roll-in/Out Platform (CROP) is, a flatrack that fits inside a ISO container. =Container Handling Unit= The Container Handling Unit (CHU) is an add-on kit that allows for the loading/unloading and transport of standard ISO containers without the need for an intermediate flatrack. M1075 PLS trucks (with or without winch) can have an integral CHU stowage facility between the LHS hook arm and engine. CHUs were procured as part of the original FHTV contract. Weight of the complete CHU is 1746 kg. Installation time is 80 man hours. Oshkosh produced the original CHU, the current E-CHU (E - Enhanced) is manufactured by GT Machining & Fabricating Ltd of Canada. By September 2010 over 1,000 E-CHUs had been produced. Current orders increase totals to 6300 units, with production running until September 2016. PLS M1075A0 truck laden with Engineer Mission Modules (EMM); M5 Concrete Mobile Mixer (EMM-CMM) on the truck, and M6 Dump Body (EMM-DB) on the M1076 trailer =Engineer Mission Modules= Engineer Mission Modules (EMM) components are flatrack-based and designed to be used on M1075 PLS trucks fitted with the Universal Power Interface Kit (UPIK). Three EMMs were procured under the initial FHTV contract, the M4 Bituminous Distributor (EMM-BD), the M5 Concrete Mobile Mixer (EMM-CMM), and the M6 Dump Body (EMM-DB). The M4 EMM- BD provides the capability to spread measured amounts of bituminous material for road preparation, repair, and other engineer applications. The M5 EMM CMM transports raw concrete materials, mixes concrete as needed, and emplaces the mixed concrete. The M6 EMM-DB transports and spreads engineering construction material such as rocks, gravel, sand, and soil. A water Distributor also now in service, this placed under contract in 2009. Flat racks and CHU/E-CHU are interchangeable between PLS and the HEMTT-LHS. Also interchangeable between PLS and HEMTT LHS are Modular Fuel System (MFS) and Hippo (water) tankracks, and the Forward Repair System (FRS). a PLS version optimized for the transport and handling of WFEL Heavy Dry Support Bridge (HDSB) components is also in service. The DSB launch vehicle is a modified PLS truck. PLS is a major enabler of the Army's drive to achieve a distribution-based logistics system. The PLS-Enhanced (PLS-E) program procures the Movement Tracking System, which provides a multitude of tactical wheeled vehicles with Global Positioning System capability and two-way digital messaging. The MTS enables the commander to track logistics assets over the range of the battle space. The two-way messaging allows redirection of logistics assets as needs develop.

From March 2017 to October 2019, the PLS was used to resupply 100-300 U.S. Army Rangers who were deployed near the city of Manbij in the north of Syria after counter-ISIL operations.https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/withdrawing-us-forces-leave- messages-for-russian-military-in-northern-aleppo-video/ Operators  Gallery File:M1075A0 PLS with Oshkosh CHU 2.jpgOshkosh M1075A0 PLS with Oshkosh CHU File:Rear tridem and LHS detail of M1075 PLSA0.jpgRear tridem and LHS detail of M1075A0 PLS File:Palletized Loading System 430107.jpgOshkosh M1075A0 PLS truck showing the LHS and CHU File:M1075A0 PLS.jpgOshkosh M1075A0 PLS with the current E-CHU File:Palletized Loading System 185796.jpgOshkosh M1075A0 PLS truck fitted with the Armor Holdings developed protection package File:M1075A0 PLS with M1076 PLS trailer (early armored cab).jpgOshkosh M1075A0 PLS truck with M1076 PLS trailer (Armor Holdings developed protection package) File:M1075A1 PLS with armored cab.jpgOshkosh M1075A1 PLS with armored cab (A-kit); the truck behind is B-kit - unarmored File:M1076 PLS trailer.jpgOshkosh-produced M1076 PLS trailer See also * Demountable Rack Offload and Pickup System * Unit load * List of U.S. military vehicles by model number * M939 Truck * Oshkosh L-ATV * Oshkosh M-ATV * Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck * Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement * Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles ‚Äî M1148 8.8-ton LHS truck, and M1147 LHS trailer * Plasan Sand Cat * TerraMax (vehicle) * Heavy Equipment Transport System * Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) * Logistics Vehicle System * US Army tactical truck engines References =Bibliography= * Modern U.S. Military Vehicles by Fred Crismon * 2013 US Army Weapon Systems Handbook (pages 266-267) * Brothers of HEMTT - PLS-LVS by Carl Schulze (published by Tankograd) Tankograd * Jane's Land Warfare Platforms 2014/2015: Logistics, Support & Unmanned Jane‚Äôs Land Warfare Platforms: Logistics, Support & Unmanned * Jane's Land Warfare Platforms 2015-2016: Logistics, Support & Unmanned * Jane's Military Vehicles & Logistics 2004-2005 Jane‚Äôs Land Warfare Platforms: Logistics, Support & Unmanned * Oshkosh Trucks: 75 Years of Specialty Truck Production Paperback ‚Äì November 1992 () *  External links  * PLS - Oshkosh Defense Military transport Military logistics Shipping containers Oshkosh vehicles Military trucks of the United States Military vehicles introduced in the 1980s United States Army vehicles Off-road vehicles All-wheel-drive vehicles ","title":"Palletized Load System"},{"id":"4331282","text":"InterPro is a database of protein families, domains and functional sites in which identifiable features found in known proteins can be applied to new protein sequences in order to functionally characterise them. The contents of InterPro consist of diagnostic signatures and the proteins that they significantly match. The signatures consist of models (simple types, such as regular expressions or more complex ones, such as Hidden Markov models) which describe protein families, domains or sites. Models are built from the amino acid sequences of known families or domains and they are subsequently used to search unknown sequences (such as those arising from novel genome sequencing) in order to classify them.

The proteins in UniProtKB are also the central protein entities in InterPro. Information regarding which signatures significantly match these proteins are calculated as the sequences are released by UniProtKB and these results are made available to the public (see below). The matches of signatures to proteins are what determine how signatures are integrated together into InterPro entries: comparative overlap of matched protein sets and the location of the signatures' matches on the sequences are used as indicators of relatedness. Only signatures deemed to be of sufficient quality are integrated into InterPro. InterPro also includes data for splice variants and the proteins contained in the UniParc and UniMES databases. = InterPro member databases = The signatures from InterPro come from 14 \\"member databases\\", which are listed below. ;CATH-Gene3D : describes protein families and domain architectures in complete genomes. Protein families are formed using a Markov clustering algorithm, followed by multi-linkage clustering according to sequence identity. Mapping of predicted structure and sequence domains is undertaken using hidden Markov models libraries representing CATH and Pfam domains. Functional annotation is provided to proteins from multiple resources. Functional prediction and analysis of domain architectures is available from the Gene3D website. ;CDD: Conserved_Domain_Database is a protein annotation resource that consists of a collection of annotated multiple sequence alignment models for ancient domains and full-length proteins. These are available as position-specific score matrices (PSSMs) for fast identification of conserved domains in protein sequences via RPS-BLAST. ;HAMAP : stands for High-quality Automated and Manual Annotation of microbial Proteomes. HAMAP profiles are manually created by expert curators they identify proteins that are part of well-conserved bacterial, archaeal and plastid-encoded (i.e. chloroplasts, cyanelles, apicoplasts, non-photosynthetic plastids) proteins families or subfamilies. ; MobiDB : is a database annotating intrinsic disorder in proteins. ;PANTHER : is a large collection of protein families that have been subdivided into functionally related subfamilies, using human expertise. These subfamilies model the divergence of specific functions within protein families, allowing more accurate association with function (human-curated molecular function and biological process classifications and pathway diagrams), as well as inference of amino acids important for functional specificity. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are built for each family and subfamily for classifying additional protein sequences. ;Pfam : is a large collection of multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models covering many common protein domains and families. ;PIRSF : protein classification system is a network with multiple levels of sequence diversity from superfamilies to subfamilies that reflects the evolutionary relationship of full-length proteins and domains. The primary PIRSF classification unit is the homeomorphic family, whose members are both homologous (evolved from a common ancestor) and homeomorphic (sharing full- length sequence similarity and a common domain architecture). ;PRINTS : is a compendium of protein fingerprints. A fingerprint is a group of conserved motifs used to characterise a protein family; its diagnostic power is refined by iterative scanning of UniProt. Usually the motifs do not overlap, but are separated along a sequence, though they may be contiguous in 3D-space. Fingerprints can encode protein folds and functionalities more flexibly and powerfully than can single motifs, their full diagnostic potency deriving from the mutual context afforded by motif neighbours. ;ProDom : domain database consists of an automatic compilation of homologous domains. Current versions of ProDom are built using a novel procedure based on recursive PSI-BLAST searches. ;PROSITE : is a database of protein families and domains. It consists of biologically significant sites, patterns and profiles that help to reliably identify to which known protein family (if any) a new sequence belongs. ;SMART : allows the identification and annotation of genetically mobile domains and the analysis of domain architectures. More than 800 domain families found in signalling, extracellular and chromatin-associated proteins are detectable. These domains are extensively annotated with respect to phyletic distributions, functional class, tertiary structures and functionally important residues. ;SUPERFAMILY : is a library of profile hidden Markov models that represent all proteins of known structure. The library is based on the SCOP classification of proteins: each model corresponds to a SCOP domain and aims to represent the entire SCOP superfamily that the domain belongs to. SUPERFAMILY has been used to carry out structural assignments to all completely sequenced genomes. ;SFLD ;TIGRFAMs : is a collection of protein families, featuring curated multiple sequence alignments, hidden Markov models (HMMs) and annotation, which provides a tool for identifying functionally related proteins based on sequence homology. Those entries which are \\"equivalogs\\" group homologous proteins which are conserved with respect to function.  Access  The database is available for text- and sequence-based searches via a webserver, and for download via anonymous FTP. Like other EBI databases, it is in the public domain, since its content can be used \\"by any individual and for any purpose\\". Users can also use the signature scanning software, InterProScan, if they have novel sequences that require characterisation. InterProScan is frequently used in genome projects in order to obtain a \\"first-pass\\" characterisation of the genome of interest. , the public version of InterProScan (v4.x) is Perl-based, however, a new Java-based architecture is under development which will form the core of InterProScan v5. InterPro aims to release data to the public every 8 weeks, typically within a day of the UniProtKB release of the same proteins.

It was first conceived by author Shunr≈ç Oshikawa in his 1899 novel Kaitei Gunkan (\\"Undersea Battleship\\"), of which Atragon was an adaptation produced by Toho Studios. The submarine is heavily armed and armored, but its trademark tactic is to ram and sink enemy ships. In cinema, the submarine is easily identifiable by the enormous drill on its bow; it is also notable for being able to burrow underground and fly. The Gotengo also makes an appearance in the film for Toho's The War in Space and Chousei Kantai Sazer-X, Chousei Kantai Sazer-X: Fight! Warriors of the Stars. While the name of the ship is recited as \\"Goten-g≈ç\\" in Japanese, it should be rendered as \\"Goten\\" in English; as the suffix, Âè∑ (g≈ç), simply denotes the object as a ship.

For instance, in the first sequence it is battling the monster Godzilla in the 1960s, resulting in Godzilla's burial under hundreds of feet of ice. Immediately after the opening credits, the upgraded and futuristic version of it known as the New Gotengo is locked in battle against the sea dragon Manda in the 2000s, which the ship defeats with an emergency maneuver through an underwater volcano and a combination of the Absolute Zero Cannon and drill. Later on, during the Xilien-induced monster attacks on major cities, the New Gotengo is dispatched to destroy them. However, the only weapon that truly works to destroy the alien threat is Godzilla himself. =Video games= * Godzilla: Monster of Monsters (NES - 1988) - In this game, one of the hyperspace areas that can be encountered is a battle against a giant alien spaceship that resembles the Gotengo. Smaller versions of the Gotengo can also be encountered as stage enemies. They fly at the top of the screen, but attack slowly by dropping bombs onto the player.

Other minor neighbours of the √ågb√≥m√¨n√† are the Ibolo sub- group of the cities of Offa, Oyan and Okuku in the west. Archaeological chronology and ancient history Over 800 carved stones, mostly representing human figures, have been found around Esie in western Igbomina, Iji-Isin, Ijara and Ofaro villages. It is not known who created the sculptures, but they appear to have been created around 1100 AD. Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggest that the √ågb√≥m√¨n√† people may have predated the surrounding peoples except perhaps the Nupe and the Yagba. √ågb√≥m√¨n√†land definitely predated the Oduduwa era as evidenced by oral traditions of royal and non- royal migrations from Oduduwa‚Äôs Ile-Ife which met existing dynasties in place but displaced, subsumed or subjugated them. It appears that aside from more recent conflicts in the last two centuries, the Oyo, Ijesha, and the Ekiti may have in more ancient times, pressured the √ågb√≥m√¨n√†, captured territory in the plains and restricted them into the more rugged and lower-quality land of the Yoruba hills. The √ågb√≥m√¨n√†, on the other hand, appear to have pressured the Nupe and the Yagba and taken territory away from them in places, but also losing territory to them in other places. Major upheavals, conflicts and wars as well as epidemics have resulted in major ancient dispersals and migrations such as the √íb√† diasporas documented in the oral history, oral poetry and lineage praise songs of several √ågb√≥m√¨n√† clans. Some of the towns in Igbomina are known for historical events or things, an example is the Gegele hill in igbaja. Recent history The Ilorin Provincial Gazetteer (1918) dates the settlement of Igbaja, one of the Igbomina towns, as late 17th or early 18th century, while the Igbaja District Gazetteer (1933‚Äì35) puts it about 1750 AD. By 1800, the Alafin (supreme ruler of Yoruba) had consolidated his power over the Igbomina and placed an Ajele (Governor) in Ilorin to safeguard his interests. The Sudan Interior Mission came to Oro Ago in 1911, to Agunjin before 1918, and to Oke Oyan, Igbaja, and Oke Aba in the 1920s. Starting in the 1930s, primary and secondary schools were established, resulting in changes to the traditional ways of life.

It was directed and written by Carlos Vander Tolosa, and starred Mila del Sol, Fernando Poe, Sr., Ely Ramos and Fleur de Lis. Synopsis The film tells the tale of Guia, a country girl played by Mila del Sol, who begins to sing American songs on the radio, after being infatuated with images of Hollywood and the attention lavished on her by the son of the wealthy hacienda owner. Actor Ely Ramos plays the son who is also the bandleader of the orchestra. She finds fame, and moves to Manila. Eventually, she becomes disillusioned, and returns to the province, singing Filipino music. She also returns to the arms of her childhood sweetheart (played by Fernando Poe, Sr).

The latter branch was subsequently extended to Hilton Junction, near Perth the following year.Railscot - Edinburgh and Northern Railway On 6 June 1857, the Fife and Kinross Railway opened, providing a link to Kinross. This line was closed to passengers on 6 June 1950,Railscot - Fife and Kinross Railway with the line between Auchtermuchty and Ladybank closing to freight on 29 January 1957. Passenger trains were also withdrawn on the Perth branch (as far as ) on 19 September 1955 by the British Transport Commission, the route having been reduced to single track (with a loop at ) by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1933. The line was retained for freight traffic and was subsequently reopened to passengers in 1975 to provide a shorter route between Perth & Edinburgh than that via Stirling (the direct route from via Kinross having been closed in 1970 to free up part of the alignment for the planned M90 motorway). Facilities The station has a ticket office on platform 2, but this is only manned on a limited basis (mornings only, Mondays to Saturdays). At other times tickets must be purchased on board the train. The main building on platform 1 is now used as an art studio. Standard shelters are available on both platforms, along with a waiting room on platform 1. Train running information is provided via CIS displays, automatic announcements and customer help points. The station subway has steps and is not therefore accessible to wheelchair or mobility-impaired users, but there are step-free access routes to each side via public roads.Ladybank station facilities National Rail Enquiries All trains on the route to and from Perth use platform 1 in both directions, so this should be taken into account if changing trains here.  Services  In the current (summer 2017) timetable, the station is served by two trains per hour to/from Edinburgh - one of these is the hourly semi-fast service to and the other runs to Perth. The single track nature of this line limits the frequency of services possible to and from Perth, though track upgrades & replacement work has improved matters somewhat by reducing the end- to-end journey time between here and Hilton Junction.

The massacre took place on Calle de los Negros (Street of the Blacks/Blacks Street) also referred to as \\"Negro Alley\\". The mob gathered after hearing that a policeman had been shot and a rancher killed by Chinese. A few 21st-century sources have described this as the largest mass lynching in American history.Erika Lee, \\"Review of The Chinatown War: Chinese Los Angeles and the Massacre of 1871 (2012), by Scott Zesch\\", Journal of American History, vol. 100, no. 1 (June 2013), pg. 217. An estimated 17 to 20 Chinese immigrants were hanged by the mob in the course of the riot, but most had already been shot to death. At least one was mutilated, when someone cut off a finger to get his diamond ring. Ten men of the mob were prosecuted and eight were convicted of manslaughter in these deaths. The convictions were overturned on appeal due to technicalities. Summary The Chinese Massacre of 1871 was an unprecedented progression of violence and deaths in Los Angele, a city of fewer than 100,000 people at the time.Tinsman, Heidi. \\"Narrating Chinese Massacre in the South American War of the Pacific\\" (Journal of Asian American Studies 22, no. 3, 2019), 277.A dispute internal to the Chinese community spilled out, leading to the ‚Äúdeath of an American bystander and the wounding of a city policeman.‚Äù This unfortunate incident sparked a frenzy of hatred and violent destruction centered in Calle de Los Negros, one of the city‚Äôs old areas. All but one of the eighteen Chinese killed in the hateful act of vengeance were innocent of the original violence leading to the tragedy. After all, the confusion had settled, at least a hundred and fifty individuals were identified and directly linked to the violence ‚Äúafter an exhaustive coroner‚Äôs inquest and the convening of a grand jury.‚Äù Blew, Robert W. \\"Vigilantism in Los Angeles, 1835-1874\\" (Southern California Quarterly 54, no. 1, 1972),18. The jury ultimately identified seven men for trial for their direct involvement in the death of one of the violence victims. Judge Robert M. Widney secured convictions for lesser charges of manslaughter, ranging between two and nine years. However, an appeal to the California Supreme Court reversed the convictions and remitted the cases back to Widney‚Äôs court. However, District Attorney Cameron M. Tom decided against retrying the cases and freed in late spring of 1873. This blight in the history of Los Angeles has been referenced multiple times. Newspaper coverage and court coverage papers offer a comprehensive perspective regarding the criminal justice system‚Äôs role on the backdrop of this unfortunate part of the city‚Äôs history. The Massacre‚Äôs immediate cause traces to a fight between rival tongs, the Nin Yung, and Hong Chow. The rival factions fought over the alleged abduction of Yut Ho. While Ho was reported as married, prostitution was rampant, and there were many cases of women sold into sexual slavery. The police had previously helped either side to capture and return escapee women in exchange for a fee. However, in the case of Ho, things had gotten out of control. For two days, the conflict escalated, leading to the death of Jesus Bilderrain and Robert Thompson, a police officer and a bystander, respectively. Not long after the fateful events, a crowd gathered around Coronel Block, the events‚Äô location. Indiscriminate shooting and hanging ensued, leading to hundreds of deaths and replicated in at least three other areas. Amid the melee, a few individuals, including a would-be District Judge, Robert M. Widney, tried to calm the situation. The Los Angeles Stars reported that a Vigilance Committee addressed crowds at the point where Los Angeles Street, Negro Alley, and Main Street met. The police, led by Sheriff James F. Burns, were only able to arrest the situation hours later. After that, the criminal justice administration system began to piece together factual details to punish those responsible for the heinous acts. The Massacre‚Äôs primary basis is viewed mainly as the escalation of fights amidst the associates of two Chinese tongs over the possession woman called Yit Ho. The two groups‚Äô enemies ragged gunshots from 23rd to October 24, 1871, which caused a police officer from Los Angeles named Jesus Birderrain and Robert Thomson, the passer-by. Reports presented disparities; impetus then being the murder of the city police and bystander. A few minutes after the dusk, a large gathering assembled everywhere in Coronel Block, where the undertaking was spotlighted. According to the reports, some persons tried to calm the group and preclude the Chinese slayings. Inclusive was Robert M. Widney; the contestant intended to be a victor in the elections as the District Judge and chair the cases of the seven murders involved in the Massacre. The last killing occurred at 9:30 pm, the basis of the news report. Zesch, Scott. \\"Chinese Los Angeles in 1870-1871: The Makings of a Massacre\\" (Southern California Quarterly 90, no. 2, 2008), 112.At the time, Sheriff James, with further community associates, had gained sufficient reinforcement; besides, it was four hours from the Massacre‚Äôs commencement, scattering the crowd and guarding them throughout the night. The criminal justice dispensation structure, which was utterly defective in stopping the massive killing, started its investigations to seek facts to administer justice on the unprecedented inhuman act. Background Discrimination had been rising against the increasing number of Chinese immigrants living in California. It has been described as a root cause of the massacre.Loewen, J. W. (2008). Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong. The New Press. White and mestizo residents of Los Angeles resented the expansion of the Chinese population, considering them an alien group. In 1863 the state legislature had passed a law that Asians (defined as Chinese, Mongolian, Indian, etc.) could not testify in court against whites, making them vulnerable to abuse and injustice, and putting them beyond reach of the law.Paul M. De Falla, \\"Lantern in the Western Sky\\", The Historical Society of Southern California Quarterly, 42 (March 1960), 57‚Äì88 (Part I), and 42 (June 1960), 161‚Äì185 (Part II); via JSTOR; accessed 3 February 2018. In 1868 the United States had signed the Burlingame Treaty with the Chinese Empire, setting conditions for immigration. In this period, most Chinese workers who immigrated to the United States were men, intending to stay only temporarily. The small Chinese community in Los Angeles numbered fewer than 200, and 80% were men. Another factor was the rough frontier nature of Los Angeles, which in the 1850s had a disproportionately high number of lynchings for its size, and an attachment to \\"popular justice\\" (this was also a period of violence across the country).Paul R. Spitzzeri, \\"Judge Lynch in Session: Popular Justice in Los Angeles, 1850-1875\\", Southern California Quarterly Vol. 87, No. 2 (Summer 2005), pp. 83-122; via JSTOR; accessed 3 February 2018 It attracted transients from across the country, and alcohol use was high among the predominately male population. In Los Angeles in the few days preceding the riot, two Chinese Tong factions, known as the Hong Chow and Nin Yung companies, had started a confrontation from a feud over the alleged abduction of a Chinese woman named Yut Ho (also documented as Ya Hit), who was announced in the paper as having married. Most women in the community served as prostitutes and had essentially been sold into sexual slavery. Previously the police department had assisted the Tongs in keeping their confrontations over the women internal to the community, and sometimes capturing and returning women who had escaped, in exchange for payment by the Tongs, but in this case, things got out of hand. Two Chinese men were arrested for shooting at each other, and were released on bail, but the police kept watch on the Chinatown neighborhood. It had developed along Calle de los Negros, which was named in the colonial period.Scott Zesch, \\"Chinese Los Angeles in 1870‚Äî1871: The Makings of a Massacre\\", Southern California Quarterly, 90 (Summer 2008), 109‚Äì158; via JSTOR; accessed 3 February 2018 Calle de los Negros was situated immediately northeast of Los Angeles's principal business district, running from the intersection of Arcadia Street to the plaza. The unpaved street was named by Spanish colonists for Californios (pre-annexation, Spanish-speaking Californians) of darker complexion (most likely of multiracial ancestry: Spanish, Native American, and African) who had originally lived there. The neighborhood had deteriorated into a slum by the time the first Chinatown of Los Angeles developed there in the 1860s. Early 20th-century Los Angeles merchant Harris Newmark recalled in his memoir that Calle de los Negros was \\"as tough a neighborhood, in fact, as could be found anywhere.\\"Harris Newmark, Sixty Years in Southern California, 1853‚Äî1913 (1916; 4th ed., Los Angeles: Dawson's Book Shop, 1984), 31. Los Angeles historian Morrow Mayo described it in 1933 as > a dreadful thoroughfare, forty feet wide, running one whole block, filled > entirely with saloons, gambling-houses, dance-halls, and cribs. It was > crowded night and day with people of many races, male and female, all > rushing and crowding along from one joint to another, from bar to bar, from > table to table. There was a band in every joint, with harps, guitars, and > other stringed instruments predominating.Morrow Mayo, Los Angeles (New York: > Alfred A. Knopf, 1933), 38. October 24 As Los Angeles police officer Jesus Bilderrain was patrolling Calle de los Negros, an altercation broke out in which he was wounded and so he blew his whistle for reinforcements. Some civilians came to his aid, including rancher Robert Thompson, an ex-saloon keeper who pursued a Chinese man up to the door of a house in the alley, despite warnings from others. He was fatally shot there, dying about an hour later at 6 pm at a nearby drugstore. Lawmen, including chief of police Francis Baker, came and went as a larger crowd gathered along the edges of Chinatown, acting as a guard to prevent any Chinese from escaping. Informed of the growing crowd, three-term Mayor Cristobal Aguilar, a longtime politician in the city, also surveyed the situation and then left. When news of Thompson's death passed through the city, along with the rumor that the Chinese in Negro Alley \\"were killing whites wholesale\\", more men gathered around the boundaries of Negro Alley. Events By the end of the riot > The dead Chinese in Los Angeles were hanging at three places near the heart > of the downtown business section of the city; from the wooden awning over > the sidewalk in front of a carriage shop; from the sides of two \\"prairie > schooners\\" parked on the street around the corner from the carriage shop; > and from the cross-beam of a wide gate leading into a lumberyard a few > blocks away from the other two locations. One of the victims was hanged > without his trousers and minus a finger on his left hand. Historian Paul de Falla wrote that the trousers were taken to get to his money, and his finger was cut to take a diamond ring. The mob ransacked practically every Chinese-occupied building on the block and attacked or robbed nearly every resident. A total of 17 to 20 Chinese immigrant men were hanged by the mob. =Victims= The following people were lynched: * Ah Wing * Dr. Chee Long \\"Gene\\" Tong, physician * Chang Wan * Leong Quai, laundryman * Ah Long, cigar maker * Wan Foo, cook * Tong Won, cook and musician * Ah Loo * Day Kee, cook * Ah Waa, cook * Ho Hing, cook * Lo Hey, cook * Ah Won, cook * Wing Chee, cook * Wong Chin, storekeeper The following people were shot and killed at the Coronel Adobe building: * Johnny Burrow * Ah Cut, liquor maker * Wa Sin Quai The Associated Press sent a report that night at 9 pm to the San Francisco Daily Examiner, detailing an on-the-spot account. It estimated the mob was about 500 persons, which would have constituted eight percent of the city's population of nearly 6,000 persons, including all men, women and children. The Coroner‚Äôs Inquest The inquest covered an entire four days and encompassed interviewing of various range of eyewitnesses. Disappointedly, no data from the inquest was ascertained, known hitherto, and newspaper feedbacks serving as the sole source of information. Firstly, the two interviews involving Robert Thomson, which took two hours, emerged to be broad and elaborate. Still, only a single observer, Constable Bilderrain, was examined. His description of the event was reliant on facts and was apprehensive that Thompson got shot in the process of assisting him. In the process of pursuing justice for the killed Chinese, utterly innocent of the Massacre, seven men were sentenced in the law court, whether unquestionably guilt-ridden or not. The Supreme Court omitted the prosecution on Gene killings. Further, it is crystal clear that there was no basis in the High court verdict that compelled them to trust the sentenced demonstrators were blameless. The District Attorney and Judge felt in 1873 that t was becoming unrealistic and illogical to pursue new trials; the issue was called off. Since then, the Chinese have to perform an exceptional prayer at the city in honor of the carnage misfortune Grand Jury and Indictments Following the coroner‚Äôs inquest, Tong Yu, widow to Dr. Gene Tong, fled a complaint in the Justice Court, accusing Yo Hing, one of the tong leaders, of ‚Äúinciting and participating‚Äù the Massacre that led to her husband‚Äôs death. While Yo was initially held following the November 4 complaint, the Grand Jury could not link him directly with the events, and he was later released. Four days after this complaint, ‚ÄúCounty Court Judge Ygnacio Sepulveda convened a special Grand Jury to investigate the events around to the Massacre.‚Äù A jury composed of individuals of diverse backgrounds, Juan Jose (long-time resident), William Perry (building contractor), Kaspare Cohn (building contractor), William Henry (saddle maker and councilman), and Martin Sanchez (farmer), was constituted. Judge Sepulveda condemned the violence pattern in the strongest terms possible and challenged the jury to stand up to the occasion.Zesch, Scott. \\"Chinese Los Angeles in 1870-1871: The Makings of a Massacre\\" (Southern California Quarterly 90, no. 2, 2008), 123. The jury‚Äôs report noted forty-nine indictments for felonies and murders (almost split halfway). The report highlighted full statements of the events leading to the Massacre. Immediately after the report‚Äôs publication, A.R. Thompson, Charles Austin, and Charles Crawford (official records Edmund Crawford) was held. Another set of five individuals, Louis Mendel, Jesus Martinez, Andreas Soeur, Patrick McDonald, and D.W. Moody, were arrested and held. Three Chinese and two whites were held, but for lesser charges, an additional five unnamed individuals were held. Trials The most famous case was People v. Kerren, in which the defendant was accused of shooting at two Chinese women, Cha Cha and Fan Cho, with a deadly assault weapon. Kerren was released on a $1000 bail.Jew, Victor. \\"The Anti-Chinese Massacre in Los Angeles as a Reconstruction-era Event\\" In (Oxford Research Encyclopedia of American History, 2016). Several other witness statements were full of objections by District Attorney Thom and defense counsels based on irrelevant leading questions. In People v. Quong Wan and Ah Yeng, Wan and Yeng were accused of being the originators of the riots and subsequently charged with the murder of Ah Coy. Coupled with these charges were rumors that the Chinese had been on a gun-buying spree days before the Massacre and that some Chinese were also expected in from San Francisco in readiness for a fight. In People v. Crenshaw, the case pursued the murder of Gene Tong. Later, all the cases were combined into one and attracted interest from both the public and the press. While the convicted rioters were sentenced and taken to the San Quentin, a few other cases remained. Such cases included Fong Yen Ling, Sam Yuen, Yin Tuck, and Ah Ying v. The Mayor and Common Council of the City of Los Angeles, in which the merchants sued for damages to their stores during the Massacre. The Judge held that the city was not liable for the destruction of businesses and noted that such liability would only hold if the business owner had notified the city before the collapse. Several other cases were declined on the ground of lacking evidence. Thus, a review of the legal provisions was imperative to understand the court‚Äôs decision despite the destruction of property and deaths. Freeing of the Rioters In People v Sam Yuen, Yuen was charged for shooting Jesus Bilderrain before Justice Trafford. The constable charged Yuen with ‚Äúwillfully, deliberately, feloniously and of malice aforethought, aiding, abetting, assisting, counseling and encouraging a Chinaman, identified as John Doe, to kill and murder. While an arrest warrant was issued for Bilderrain, Yuen could not be traced. When he returned in 1872, no warrant was served. Complications further arose when a second warrant was issued.Dorland, Chester P. \\"Chinese massacre at Los Angeles in 1871\\" (Annual Publication of the Historical Society of Southern California, Los Angeles 3, no. 2, 1894), 24. However, reports indicated that a post-Massacre addition to the force, Constable Frank Hurtley, arrested Yuen. Adolfo Celis testified that he had seen Yuen running behind another Chinese man as both entered the Coronel Block at the time of the violence.Jew, Victor. \\"The Anti-Chinese Massacre in Los Angeles as a Reconstruction-era Event.\\" In Oxford Research Encyclopedia of American History. 2016. He narrated details that placed Yuen at the scene of the Massacre and confirmed his playing an active role. The Massacre brought to fore the protection of the minority through the laws of Los Angeles. At the same time, there was open prejudice against minorities. The judicial process, such as in the case of Sam Yuen, went on smoothly. A jury that determined its case based on race would have found Yuen liable. However, the court followed all the due process of the law, relied on witness testimonies, including the reversal of misleading accounts by Jesus Bilderrain. It can thus be concluded that due process of the law was followed. There is, however, no clarity on whether the Massacre led to any positive advancements towards the fight against crime. Anti-Chinee hate flared n the weeks that followed. Overt anti-Chinese violence died naturally after the proceedings. This notwithstanding, however, anti-Chinese feelings persisted and was expressed more subtly. Aftermath Authorities arrested and prosecuted ten rioters. Eight were convicted of manslaughter at trial and sentenced to prison terms at San Quentin. Their convictions were overturned on appeal due to a legal technicality. The eight men convicted were:Paul R Spitzzeri, \\"Judge Lynch in session: Popular justice in Los Angeles, 1850‚Äì1875\\", Historical Society of Southern California Quarterly 87, No. 2 (Summer 2005), 108; via JSTOR; accessed 3 February 2018 * Alvarado, Esteban * Austin, Charles * Botello, Refugio * Crenshaw, L.

Alternative spellings are \\"Cermand Celstach\\", \\"Cermaed Celsetacht\\", \\"Kermand Kelstach\\", \\"Kerman Kelstach\\" and the Giant Ermand Kelstach. Historical references The earliest reference to Cermand Cestach is in the Life of Saint Macartan of Clogher (C.430-505 A.D.): The 6th-century saint Tigernach was patron saint of Clones. His mother was Dervail or Derfraich, daughter of a King of Airgialla (Oriel) and his father was Cairpre Mac Fergusa from Leinster. The implication is that the idol originally came from Leinster. In a gloss on the word \\"clochar\\" in the 15 August entry of the 8th-century manuscript F√©lire √ìengusso (Martyrology of Oengus) for the Feastday of the Assumption of Mary, the gloss states The annalist Cathal Maguire, who died in 1498, stated that this stone- idol was still preserved as a curiosity in the porch of the Cathedral of Clogher in his time, so he was probably the glossator mentioned above as the gloss occurs in the copy of the Martyrology which was transcribed for him by Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Luin√≠n.Nollaig O.

The oracle advised him to proceed to the Isle of Man and get Culann to make these weapons for him. Conchobar did so, and prevailed on Culann to begin his task; but, while awaiting its completion, he sauntered one morning along the shore, and in the course of his walk met with a mermaid fast asleep on the beach. He promptly bound the syren, but she, on waking and perceiving what had happened, besought him to liberate her; and to induce him to yield to her petition, she informed him that she was Teeval, the Princess of the Ocean; and promised that if he caused Culann to form her representation on the shield surrounded with this inscription, 'Teeval, Princess¬∑of the Ocean,' it would possess such extraordinary powers that when ever he was about engaging his enemy in battle, and looked upon her figure on the shield, read the legend, and invoked her name, his enemies would diminish in strength, while he and his people would acquire a proportionate increase in theirs. Conchobar had the shield made according to the advice of Teeval, and, on his return to Ireland, such extraordinary success attended his arms, that he won the kingdom of Ulster. Culann accepted Conchobar's offer, referred to above, and settled on the plain of Murthemne, which was fabled to have been formerly situated beneath the sea. It was here that he was visited by Conchobar, accompanied by his Court and Cuchulainn.\\" In a book entitled \\"Omagh: Paintings and Stories from the Seat of the Chiefs\\" by Dr Haldane Mitchell, there is a local Tyrone folk-tale about a giant called \\"Ermand Kelstach\\" and Muckabaw who fought for the hand of Fionn mac Cumhaill's daughter Granua. They held a shoulder-stone throwing contest with stones the size and weight of a young mountain. One struck the top of Bessie Bell, where the mark is still seen to the present day. An old 18th century or earlier ballad entitled \\"The Death of Leury\\" tells of the worshipping of the stone by King Laoghaire. William Hamilton Drummond wrote a poem in 1826 entitled \\"Bruce's Invasion of Ireland\\" in which are found the following lines:- \\"Clogher stone, like the statue of Memnon renowned, Was heard to give forth an oracular sound.\\" Local tradition cherishes the conviction that the Cloch-Oir itself can be identified with a large stone that once stood against the north wall of St.Macartan's Cathedral and is now housed in the porch. The stone is decorated on both sides with raised plain borders. It is unworked on the reverse as though it originally formed part of an architectural feature like a doorway lintel. It is 1.67 metres in height. 0.44 metres across its front face and 0.57 metres on the broad side. Oracle interpretation It seems Cermand Cestach was the name of the Oracle of Clogher, a stone which spoke through the Druids, somewhat like the Oracle of Delphi. The Dictionary of Celtic Mythology by James MacKillop gives 'Kerman Kelstach' as a variation of the god Crom Cr√∫aich. They share several characteristics, e.g. 1. being oracle stones 2. being covered in gold 3. having the same initials CC 4. St. Patrick fights with them 5. The last day of the double-octave feast of Crom Cr√∫aich was 15 August, which is the date on which Cermand Cestach is mentioned in the Calendar of Oengus gloss above. The website http://www.irishmegaliths.org.uk states: The reason the L√≠a F√°il was called \\"The Stone of Destiny\\" was because it told your destiny. All three stones were modelled on the Navel Stone or Omphalos of Delphi at the Delphi Oracle in Greece and closely resemble it. Other Irish oracle stones =Druim Tairleime= There is another oracle mentioned in The Metrical Dindshenchas, poem 102 on Druim Tairleime: Hogan's Onomasticon gives the following entry:- Druim Tairl√©me:- Sa. 87 a; ¬∂ v. D. Tuirl√©ime; ¬∂ \\"Drumtorlingy, Drumhurling, Drumhurlin, in Taghmon parish, Barony of Corkaree, County of Westmeath. Mis. 244(?).\\" But it is more likely to be in County Meath, close to Tara, as Cath Maighe L√©na states that the name of the hill where Conn of the Hundred Battles was killed was Druim Tuirl√©ime. =Scarva= The old name for Scarva townland, County Down was Clonknaverly. The Ordnance Survey Namebooks of 1834 state there was \\"a pagan oracle or speaking pillar\\" there. It was said to have some connection or purpose with a large stone in County Armagh on the opposite side of the morass which divides the counties.

From 1908 to 1937 he was director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. Life Sydney Cockerell made his way initially as clerk in the family coal business, George J. Cockerell & Co, until he met John Ruskin. Around 1887, Cockerell sent Ruskin some sea shells, which he collected. Tim Hilton, John Ruskin p. 816 At that time he had already met William Morris. Cockerell tried to patch up a quarrel between Ruskin and Octavia Hill,Hilton, p. 832, who had been a friend of his late father Sydney John Cockerell, and godmother to his sister Olive. From 1891, Cockerell gained a more solid entry to intellectual circles, working for the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. The architect Detmar Blow was a friend. Hilton, p. 843 He acted as private secretary to William Morris, becoming a major collector of Kelmscott Press books; was secretary also to Wilfrid Scawen Blunt; and was Thomas Hardy's executor. From 1908 to 1937 Cockerell was Director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, in Cambridge. He built up the Museum's collections of private-press books and manuscripts, prints, drawings, paintings (including Titian's Tarquin and Lucretia), ceramics and antiquities. It was he who secured the Museum's rich holdings of works by William Blake and who bought its first Picasso print. He raised funds for building extensions, set up the first 'Friends' scheme in Britain and introduced Sunday opening. Cockerell appears as one of a circle of three figures in the book by Dame Felicitas Corrigan, The Nun, the Infidel, and the Superman, with Dame Laurentia McLachlan and George Bernard Shaw. It was later dramatised by Hugh Whitemore as The Best of Friends, which was produced on stage at the Hampstead Theatre in 2006 and on television in 1991.. According to Penelope Fitzgerald's biography of Charlotte Mew, Charlotte Mew and Her Friends (1984), \\"Cockerell was one of the six children of a Brighton coal merchant who died quite young. This meant a hard start, but, as he told his biographer, Wilfred Blunt, 'I was protected by poverty from marriage until I was forty.' During that time he was able to develop his two ruling passions - the arts (or rather the classification and collecting of them), and the cultivating of great men. When he became Director of the Fitzwilliam in 1908 he identified the Museum entirely with himself, and heroic indeed were his efforts to tap bequests, endowments, and death-bed legacies which would enrich it in every department. He calculated that during his lifetime he had made a quarter of a million pounds for the Fitzwilliam, and about a dozen enemies.\\" He was a leading figure in the revival of italic handwriting as an artistic craft. Family He was the son of Sydney John Cockerell (1842‚Äì1877) and Alice Elizabeth Bennett. The bee expert Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell (1866‚Äì1948), who settled in the United States, was his brother, as was the bookbinder Douglas Bennett Cockerell (1870‚Äì1945). The bookbinder Sandy Cockerell (Sydney Morris Cockerell) was his nephew. He was married to the illuminator and designer Florence Kate Kingsford, who in 1916 was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. They had two daughters, Margaret and Katharine, and a son, Sir Christopher Cockerell, who invented the hovercraft. Sources *Online Archive of California References Further reading * D.

The scientific name of the species commemorates Johann Georg Wagler, who established Psarocolius, the oropendola genus. Description The male is long and weighs ; the smaller female is long and weighs . The wings are very long. Adult males are mainly black with a chestnut head and rump and a tail which is bright yellow apart from two dark central feathers. The iris is blue and the long bill is whitish. Females are similar, but smaller and duller than males. Young birds are duller than adults and have brown eyes. The populations south of an area around the border of Honduras and Nicaragua are sometimes separated as a subspecies P. w. ridgwayi, but the separation of this form has been questioned. The distinctive songs of the male include a gurgle followed by a crash guu-guu-PHRRRRTTT. Both sexes have loud chek and chuk calls. left Range and ecology It is a resident breeder in the Caribbean coastal lowlands from southern Mexico to central Costa Rica, both slopes of southern Costa Rica and Panama, and the Pacific lowlands of Colombia and north-eastern Ecuador. Though it usually stays below ASL, it has also been recorded as much as ASL, for example in the Serran√≠a de las Quinchas of Colombia. It may in fact be more common at such high altitudes at particular times or in particular places, but its altitudinal movements are insufficiently understood. The species is common across its large range and not considered threatened by the IUCN. The chestnut-headed oropendola inhabits forest canopy, edges and old plantations. It is a quite common bird in parts of its range, seen in small flocks foraging in trees for large insects, fruit and berries. Nests near El Valle de Ant√≥n, Panama It is a colonial breeder which builds a hanging woven nest of fibres and vines, long, high in a tree. There may be 40‚Äì50 females and only 4‚Äì5 males in a colony. The female lays two dark-marked pale blue eggs which hatch in 17 days and fledge in 30. Botflies (Oestridae) are the main cause of nestling mortality, but brood parasitism by giant cowbirds (Molothrus oryzivorus) also occurs, and the young cowbirds will feed on the fly larvae.

As per his wishes the contract for construction of the Kothi was undertaken by Major General Claude Martin. Major General Claude Martin made the Kothi his residence and he used this building for his safety guards and also for the safety of his armory. Before India's independence Kothi Hayat Baksh was declared as a Government House, the official residence of the Governor of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. After independence its name was changed to Raj Bhavan Building The two storied palatial building of Lucknow city was constructed in the eastern side of the city surrounded by greenery. Hayat Baksh means, life giving. The buildings constructed under influence of East India Company were different from traditional Indian style of architecture and these buildings were called Kothis. In Indian style of architecture, it was essential to have courtyard in the house, for which no provision has been made in Kothis. Kothis normally were two storied, with long straight plain wall without any design. The only place for artistic work were the doors and windows, decorated in the Gothic style. Kothi Hayat Baksh is an airy palatial building with all four sides surrounded with high roofed varandas. Only Raj darbar inside the Kothi is made as per Indian art and sculpture, whereas remaining portion of the Bhavan is completely influenced by western style. The mehrab of Dewan khanas are decorated with flower strips and are painted beautifully with golden colour. In 1873 under the direction of Sir George Cooper beautiful lawns, fountains and also beautiful sitting rooms were attached In 1907, one portion of this Kothi was demolished and a ballroom was also added.

History =Founder= Vitasoy was founded by Dr. Lo Kwee-seong (1910‚Äì1995) on 9 March 1940 in Hong Kong with door-to-door delivery of soy milk, selected as a product because many Chinese people are lactose intolerant.History of Vitasoy The company ceased operations from 1941 to 1945 during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. It re-emerged after the war ended. The soy milk was first delivered to people's homes on bicycle, but then began selling through retail outlets. By 1950, with sales increasing, Vitasoy established a new factory. In 1953, it adopted a sterilisation technology enabling the drinks to be stored without refrigeration. In 1975, Vitasoy became the first Hong Kong company to introduce Tetra Pak packaging technology for drinks production. This involves UHT (ultra-heat treatment) sterilisation of the product and packaging in aseptic cartons so the drink could be kept for months without refrigeration. https://valueinvestasia.com/what-investor-must-know-about-vitasoy- international-holdings-limited/ Vitasoy started to expand into overseas markets in the 80s and 90s. Yvonne Lo, the daughter of Dr. Kwee Seong Lo, introduced their soy milks to the U.S. in 1979. Today, its products are sold in approximately 40 markets around the world, including Macau, Mainland China, Australia and New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, Europe, Singapore and South East Asia. =Development of other brands= In 1976, Vitasoy launched a series of juice drinks, and subsequently launched lemon tea, chrysanthemum tea and other drinks in 1978 and 1979. In 1994, the firm established a new factory in Shenzhen City as the first Hong Kong foreign plant. Four years later, it established new factories in Shanghai and Ayer, Massachusetts in the United States. In 2001, it opened a manufacturing plant in Australia. In 2008, it acquired Unicurd Food Co.
