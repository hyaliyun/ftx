Mental health professionals who treat trauma survivors must incorporate specific ethical considerations when working with clients who have a history of trauma. Within the field of psychology, ethics define the standards of professional conduct. The American Psychological Association (APA) describes their Ethics Code as a ‚Äúcommon set of principles and standards upon which psychologists build their professional and scientific work‚Äù (p. 8). Ethics help clinicians to think through and critically analyze situations, while also serving as aspirations and virtues that clinicians should strive towards. When working with trauma survivors, oftentimes a client's traumatic experiences can be so overwhelming for both the patient and the clinician that professional and ethical boundaries may become endangered.  Guidelines  The following ethical guidelines should be considered when working with clients who have survived a traumatic experience: = Informed consent = The APA ethics code outlines many professional guidelines for clinicians including the maintenance of confidentiality, minimizing intrusions to privacy, and obtaining informed consent. Informed consent ensures the client has an adequate understanding of the techniques and procedures that will be used during therapy, expected timeline for treatment, and possible consequences for engaging in specific tasks and goals. When clinicians work with trauma survivors their informed consent should emphasize diagnosis and treatment of trauma and include clear guidelines for maintaining secure and firm boundaries. Some research suggests that clients who have experienced complex trauma may deliberately or unconsciously test clinician's boundaries by missing or arriving late for appointments, bringing the clinician gifts, attempting to photograph the therapist, calling during non-office hours, or trying to extend the session either in person or with a follow-up phone call. = Risk management = Research suggests that trauma survivors are more likely than those without a history of trauma to report suicidal ideation and to engage in self-harming behaviors. Furthermore, research also indicates that suicide attempts are correlated with both childhood maltreatment and PTSD symptom severity. Clinicians who treat trauma survivors should continuously monitor their client's suicidal ideation, means, and plans especially surrounding anniversary dates and triggering experiences. Client safety should be prioritized when working with trauma survivors, and should include immediately assessing client safety following intense sessions and frequent follow-ups with clients between sessions. = Establishing and maintaining a strong therapeutic alliance = The APA outlines General Principles that clinicians should use in order to aspire towards the very highest ethical ideals. Among these General Principles are Principle A: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence and Principle C: Integrity. Beneficence and Nonmaleficence describes that clinicians strive to benefit those with whom they work, and make efforts to do no harm. Fidelity and Responsibility includes establishing relationships of trust and being aware of one's professional responsibilities. Both of these principles should be considered when a clinician attempts to establish and maintain a strong therapeutic alliance with trauma survivors. For clients with a history of trauma, particularly those who have experienced betrayal trauma, forging close and trusting relationships with others may be difficult. In addition, during the course of therapy clients may discuss terrifying, horrific, or disturbing experiences, which may elicit strong reactions from the therapist. Some of the possible negative reactions could include distancing and emotional detachment, which may reinforce clients‚Äô often negative schemas and self-image. Clinicians may also contribute to the challenges of establishing a strong therapeutic alliance by becoming overly inquisitive about the client's traumatic experience, which, in turn, may lead to a lack of accurate empathy. For these reasons, clinicians treating those with a history of trauma may encounter unique challenges when attempting to develop a strong therapeutic alliance.  Addressing transference and countertransference  Within the course of traditional therapy it is possible for transference and counter transference to interfere with treatment. For clinicians treating those with a history of trauma it is possible to experience ‚Äúa priori counter-transference‚Äù. A priori counter- transference includes the thoughts, feelings, and prejudices that may arise before meeting with a potential client as a result of knowing that the client has gone through a certain traumatic event. These initial reactions may create ethical dilemmas as the clinician's personal attitudes, beliefs, and values may become compromised, thereby increasing the amount of counter-transference the clinician may have towards the client. The APA ethics code 2.06(b) describes a clinician's ethical responsibility should personal situations interfere with a clinician's ability to perform their duties adequately. Clinicians experiencing a priori counter-transference should consider utilizing more frequent consultations, receive increased levels of personal therapy, or consider limiting, suspending, or terminating their work-related duties.  Traumatic bonding  Dutton and Painter originally coined the term ‚Äútraumatic bonding‚Äù to describe the relationship bond that occurs between the perpetrator and victim of abusive relationships. As a result of ongoing cycles of positive and traumatic experiences powerful emotional bonds are created that are resistant to change. The term can also be borrowed to describe the relationship between a trauma clinician and the client. As the client describes their traumatic memories and re-experiences the accompanying powerful emotions and sensations they are prone to form a remarkably intense bond with their clinician. These emotionally driven experiences present ethical challenges and pitfalls for the clinician including behaving in extremes such as acting in an overprotective manner or distancing themselves from the client. The clinician may also feel triggered by their own similar trauma history, causing unnecessary discloses or the need to share the client's story in order to seek revenge or justice. The APA ethics code 2.06(a) describes that clinicians should refrain from practicing if they know there is a substantial likelihood that their personal problems will prevent them from being objective or competent. Clinicians who recognize that traumatic bonding might be occurring should increase consultations or consider limiting, suspending, or terminating their work-related duties.

(6 August 2019). \\"Beulah aims high for BMW site in Southbank\\". Australian Financial Review. Retrieved 10 August 2019. History =Southbank competition= Beulah International conducted a contest to determine the architect for the project, and dubbed the competition \\"Southbank by Beulah\\". All six solicited bids involved two architectural firms, and partnerships included BIG Architects and Fender Katsalidis, MAD Studio and Elenberg Fraser, and Woods Bagot and MVRDV. The collaborative bid by UNStudio and Cox Architecture ultimately secured the commission. The winning design was announced in August 2018. =Project= The structure is part of the larger development on Melbourne's Southbank, estimated to cost AUD$2 billion. The development is planned to begin breaking ground in 2020. Green Spine is composed of two skyscrapers; Tower 1 will comprise 102 storeys and reach a height of 354 metres, surpassing the height of the current tallest building in Australia, Q1, which stands at 322 metres. The second tower will comprise 59 storeys and reach a height of 251 metres; as with Tower 1, the second building will include hotel rooms, residential apartments, and offices. Both skyscrapers will seem to curve in a twist and will have foliage and trees growing on balconies along their exteriors. =Approval= In March 2020, the plan received approval by the City of Melbourne. Planning Minister Richard Wynne approved the project on 23 April 2020; like other developments, Southbank by Beulah was identified by the Victorian Government as a project needing to be \\"fast-tracked\\", amid the impact of COVID‚Äì19 to the Victorian economy.

Reception Anime News Network had four editors review the first episode of the anime: Theron Martin was unsure of the \\"cute girls do games\\" premise following a pre-established formula, but gave it a \\"tepid recommendation\\" on the assumption that it will lead to \\"good character development\\" and give the board games a more dramatic presentation; Rebecca Silverman felt underwhelmed by the game scenes but said that it could get better in future episodes along with exploring Miki's social anxiety problems; James Beckett was critical of both Miki and Aya's characteristics being overly familiar but was intrigued by the board game of the week template that will build the ensemble's chemistry and individual development, saying \\"[T]hat might not exactly be a glowing recommendation, but it means the show is just good enough to avoid the seasonal chopping block, at least for the time being.\\" The fourth reviewer, Nick Creamer, found \\"an engaging relational dynamic\\" among the three main leads towards the end but found the journey lacking with Miki's \\"incisive characterization\\" being centered by a \\"generally weak script\\" propping it up, concluding that \\"All in all, After School Dice Club certainly isn't breaking any new ground, but it's a reasonable example of its genre centered on a very appropriate gimmick. If you're a slice of life fan, I'd definitely give it a try.\\" Fellow ANN editor Caitlin Moore reviewed the complete anime series in 2020. She was initially put off by the generic first episode displaying the typical all-girls hobby show tropes, but was won over by both the main cast's camaraderie and exploration of their lives outside the club, and having thorough understanding of the various games they played each episode, concluding that \\"After School Dice Club offers the best of both worlds in terms of narrative and iyashikei anime. It takes the emphasis on friendship and good times and adds just enough development and structure to keep the tension and interest of people who normally don't care for storyless series.\\" Notes References External links  Anime series based on manga Liden Films Shogakukan manga Sh≈çnen manga Slice of life anime and manga ","title":"After School Dice Club"},{"id":"58460514","text":"John Komnenos (; August/September 1159 ‚Äì September 1185) was the second son of the Byzantine aristocrat, and emperor in 1183‚Äì1185, Andronikos I Komnenos. His father appointed him co-emperor over his older brother Manuel, but when Andronikos was deposed on 12 September 1185, John was also seized and probably killed. Early life John was born to the future Andronikos I Komnenos and his first wife, whose name is unknown, in August or September 1159. He was conceived in early 1159, when his mother was in prison, and Andronikos visited her secretly one night. The young John probably accompanied his father when the latter was named military governor (doux) of Cilicia in 1166, as he definitely was with his father during his subsequent exile and long wanderings across the principalities of the Near East, while his older brother Manuel and his sister Maria remained in Constantinople. It was not until late 1178 or early 1179 that Andronikos was allowed back to the Byzantine capital, bringing John, along with his niece and mistress Theodora Komnene and their children, with him. At this point, John may have received the title of sebastos from his uncle, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (). After Manuel I died, John and his older brother Manuel sided with Manuel I's daughter, the Caesarissa Maria Komnene, against the regency of the young Alexios II Komnenos (), headed by Empress- dowager Maria of Antioch and another cousin, the protosebastos Alexios Komnenos. The conspiracy was uncovered, however, and both John and Manuel were imprisoned until the regency was overthrown by their father in April 1182. Co-emperor 15th-century codex When his father assumed the regency, John received an unspecified high title, but in November 1183, after Andronikos was crowned emperor and Alexios II was deposed and murdered, John was also named as co-emperor and heir apparent to his father. Andronikos' choice fell on John, rather than the older Manuel, because Manuel was known to object to his father's policies. John was considered more loyal, while furthermore his elevation to the throne adhered to the AIMA prophecy by having an emperor whose name started with \\"A\\" followed by one whose name (in Greek) started with \\"I\\". While Manuel never made secret his disapproval for Andronikos' policies, John supported or tolerated them initially. When at last he criticized his father for his persecution of the aristocracy, according to Eustathius of Thessalonica, he received the rebuke that he and Manuel were \\"women\\", who could not rule securely until all the leading men of the state were eliminated, so that only the common people remained. According to the scholar Konstantinos Varzos, it is \\"without a doubt that the younger son was a much lesser man than the older Manuel\\". According to Niketas Choniates, one of Andronikos' leading ministers, the megas hetaireiarches Constantine Tripsychos, was accused by his bitter rival the logothetes tou dromou Stephen Hagiochristophorites of uttering disparaging remarks on John's character and qualities, comparing him with the jester Zintziphitzes, a common and vulgar man known in the taverns and streets of the capital. Though clearly slanderous, these accusations must have contained a kernel of truth, according to Varzos, for Tripsychos was duly demoted and imprisoned. In 1185, the Italo- Norman King of Sicily William II launched an invasion of the Byzantine Empire, and his troops laid siege to the Empire's second city, Thessalonica. John was one of the commanders sent out by Andronikos to assist the city and confront the Normans, giving him command of troops in Philippopolis. Rather than face the hazards of war, John preferred to stay at Philippopolis hunting. According to the eyewitness account of Eustathius of Thessalonica, the besieged called and prayed upon \\"Good John\\" to come and save them, but in vain; after the city fell, the Normans mockingly repeated these pleas to the captive Thessalonians. Finally, on 12 September 1185, a popular uprising in Constantinople overthrew Andronikos, who fled the city. On the same day, Manuel was captured and blinded. Shortly after, the news of Andronikos' fall reached Philippopolis. The army at once rose up, and John was seized and blinded, before he was killed.

She was the official mistress of Orl√©ans, Duke of Orl√©ans, during his tenure as regent of France during the minority of the infant King Louis XV of France. That role made her a well known public figure during the French regency years (1715-1723). Life =Early life= Marie-Th√©r√®se de Parab√®re was the only child of Ren√© Francois de La Vieuville and Marie Louise de La Chaussee d'Eu (d. 1715). Her mother was a lady-in-waiting to Marie Louise √âlisabeth d'Orl√©ans, Duchess of Berry. In 1711, she married Caesar Alexandre de Baud√©an, Marquis of Parab√®re (d. 1716). The marriage was not happy, but resulted in three children. Her husband had no position at court, but she was able to attend the royal court because of her mother, who was a lady-in-waiting. She was courted by the Duke of Orleans, but her mother was determined to prevent her from becoming his mistress. After the death of her mother, and the death of her husband the following year, she was able to live an independent life and become the lover of the Duke of Orleans, who was by then regent. =Mistress of the Regent= In 1716, she became the official mistress of the regent. She presided in his famous private parties and pleasure life. While she was the regent's principal mistress, he had numerous temporary lovers, as did she. She shared her place as his lover with Madame d'Argenton, Madame de Sabran, Madame d'Averne and Madame de Phalaris, but she was referred to as his main mistress. Among her own additional lovers were Thomas Goyon de Matignon, Jacques-Louis de Beringhen and Armand de Vignerot du Plessis. Many scandalous stories were told about her, as they were about the regent, and she was a central figure in the scandal press of the time. She was described as bold and beautiful, with great will power and a taste for the pleasures of life, and the Regent reportedly loved her because he found her to be an equal partner, which whom he could indulge in pleasure and forget his work. She had no influence in state affairs, simply because she had no interest in them and lacked political ambition. The regent's mother once remarked that her son appreciated her because she distracted him from political affairs and helped him indulge in pleasure instead, something they both preferred to politics. =Later life= In 1720, she successfully defeated Marie-Th√©r√®se Blonel de Phalaris, who attempted to replace her as official mistress. However, in January 1721, she herself ended the relationship with the regent after an argument when she discovered him being unfaithful with two girls from the Opera. The regent, who did not wish to loose her, continued to visit her, and a couple of months later, she retired to a convent claiming that she wished to make amends for past sins. She did not become a nun, but simply lived in the convent as a guest, which was common in this period. Later, she had a relationship with M. le Premier and M. de La Mothe-Houdancourt. Legacy Madame de Parab√®re appears in many paintings of the regent.

Career  Hopf studied botany from 1941‚Äì44, receiving her doctorate in 1947 on the subject of soil microbes. She then worked in phytopathology and plant physiology. From 1952‚Äì56 she studied glume wheat grain and glume anatomy at the Max Planck institute for Zuchtungsforschung in Berli-Dahlem. Hopf was introduced to the study of the history of cultivated plants by Elisabeth Schiemann. She then moved to the Romisch Germanisches Zentral Museum in Main, working first as a scientific assistant, before being appointed as the head of the newly founded division of archaeobotany in 1961. The archaeobotanist Gordon Hillman studied archaeobotany for a year in Mainz with Hopf. In 1966 Hopf was one of the founders of the IWGP along with Maria Follieri, and Jane Renfrew. During her career, Hopf received scholarships to study at the Israel Museum and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Hopf retired in 1979. A Festschrift for Maria Hopf was published in 1979, edited by K√∂rber-Grohne. Hopf's work spanned the regions of Europe and Asia, and all time periods, with a particular focus on Germany, Spain and the Balkans. She published over 100 works, with a key work being the co-authored volume Domestication of Plants in the Old World, first published in 1988. Hopf studied plant remains from Kathleen Kenyon's excavations in Jericho. In Iberia, Hopf studied plant remains from Neolithic sites in the Pais Valenciano and Andalucia.

She is known for her films Sugar Sweet (2001), Floored by Love (2005), and The House (2011). Lim tends to work within the realm of family drama and comedy, and highlights themes of lesbianism, multiculturalism, and body positivity. She now works in Canada and Japan. Early life and education Born in Malaysia in 1971, Lim grew up speaking Cantonese and Mandarin. Her parents are Chinese and had moved to her birthplace from mainland China and Hong Kong. In school, she became a skilled kendo practitioner. Upon graduating from high school, she moved to Tokyo to study at Sophia University, where she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism. After finishing university, she began working on news and documentary films with the broadcasting company Asahi Broadcasting Network in Tokyo as an associate producer and director. She did not move back to Malaysia after her education, due to the lack of freedom of the press there. Career Lim made her first independent short film, Closet is for Clothes, in Tokyo, where it was shown at the 1995 Tokyo Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. This festival provided Lim with the opportunity to jump-start her career, as she received an award for her film. This was the beginning of her career as an independent filmmaker. Six years later she created her first feature-length film, Sugar Sweet, in which she described her coming out as a queer filmmaker. Following the release of this film, she moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, having been frustrated by the production company's marketing of Sugar Sweet and inspired by the positive reaction it received in North America, particularly by Vancouver's artistic community. Her films have been highly successful at film festivals, where showings have frequently sold out. Her latest film, a psychological thriller set in Vancouver and featuring Vancouver actors, called The House (2011), received the Best Canadian Feature Film award at the 2012 Female Eye Film Festival. =Notable films= Sugar Sweet (2001) Perhaps Lim's most popular work, Sugar Sweet is an erotic comedy that plays with the straight male ideas of what lesbian porn looks like. It is the first erotic film in Japan that was both made for and by queer women. Starring Saori Kitagawa as Naomi, this film follows the story of a lesbian filmmaker who is hired by a straight porn company to create authentic lesbian films, only to have them deemed \\"too artistic\\". She is instructed to take a more conventional pornographic route. The film takes on techniques such as the full‚Äìbody shot and blur to appeal to the \\"lesbian gaze\\" rather than the male gaze. Sugar Sweet was originally released in Japan and was meant to be marketed as having been created by a queer woman for other queer women. Despite this, advertising for the film switched to target heterosexual men, using fetishistic images of lesbians, as there was thought to be a bigger market for the film in this demographic. The film was well-received in North America, where screenings of up to 600 people were sold out. It was shown in various cities with prolific queer film festivals, and was also featured in over 50 film festivals in North America. The marketing gimmicks and the film's success in North America were both significant factors in Lim's decision to move to Vancouver in 2002. Floored By Love (2005) This work by Lim was a part of the Eight Stories About Love series on the Canadian television network Citytv. A comedic family drama, it tells the story of a multicultural queer relationship between two women, and the issues they face when the parents of the protagonist, Cara, visit, and later when they come out as a couple. Written after the legalization of same-sex marriage, it deals with issues of marriage, Asian diaspora, gender performance, and coming out. The House (2011) The House is inspired by former Wall Street worker Nomi Prins, who exposed the fraudulence and failings of Wall Street. It looks at how working in the world of Wall Street has affected the protagonist, a woman named Jean. It is a cross-genre of drama, thriller, and the paranormal, as Jean must go on a journey of self-discovery. Upon quitting her high-level investment job, a friend lends her an empty house in Vancouver, where she encounters and interacts with the spirits who inhabit there. The House won Best Screenwriting and Best Performance at the Vancouver Women in Film Festival and was awarded Best Canadian Feature at the Female Eye Film Festival. Inspiration From birth, Lim's identity as a transmigrant Asian woman influenced the way she saw the world. Though she was born and had lived in Malaysia, then later Japan, she seldom saw Asian faces represented in media during her childhood, declaring that all the faces on her TV screen were those of white people. This drove her to create her own representation of people like herself. Lim's goal with her works is to create more positive and diverse representations of Asian women, and to tell the stories of those with intersecting queer-Asian identities. Her inspiration is not derived from a role model, but rather the lack thereof in her life. The aim of her work is to challenge taboo topics and to empower her audience; in this regard, she considers her films to be forms of activism. Personal life Lim is fluent in English, Japanese, Mandarin, Cantonese and Malay.

In the early 1840s the business was acquired by the Cork Steamship Company.Journal of The Manx Museum, Monday, June 01, 1942; Page: 18Journal of The Manx Museum, Friday, January 01, 1971; Page: 32 Company operations =Establishment= The St George Steam Packet Company commenced operations in 1822. Formed the previous year, the company secured the services of the shipbuilders Thomas Wilson of Liverpool who constructed several powerful steamers for the company, one of which was the RMS St George. Further additions to the fleet followed, however the St George rapidly won a reputation for comfort and speed. For a time the St George was placed on the company's Liverpool - Douglas schedule, but was subsequently transferred to the Liverpool - Dublin operation. The best known of the early steamer concerns operating to the Isle of Man was the St George Company. Whilst it is important in relation to the foundation of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, it had little to do with the early development of Manx services and compared with David Napier and the Mersey and Clyde Steam Navigation Company. The St George Steam Packet Company could best be described as a group of companies. At this time individual steamers tended to have different owners and often had their own operating titles; however some shareholders owned shares in numerous steamers and in such a manner and by using the same shipping agents in each port a group was built up. =Operation & rivalries= The brand new steamer St George was placed on the Liverpool - Douglas - Greenock station on Tuesday 25 June 1822, in direct competition with Napier's City of Glasgow. Each ship sailed on the same days at the same time. A month of furious racing ensued: both ships were equally matched. However, as David Napier had two other ships on the station and was the established operator, the two concerns soon came to an agreement whereby the St George was transferred to the Liverpool - Dublin - Tenby - Bristol route in agreement that Napier would not place a steamer on that route. Apart from one call in 1827, the St George did not reappear at Douglas again until 1830. The Company still maintained their operation to the Isle of Man and from April 1825 a thrice weekly service was being operated by either the Prince Llewellyn or the St David in addition to a service which was operated to North Wales. From July 26, 1826, the Kingstown operated a service from Dublin to Douglas; in advertisements this ship actually operated under the name of the St George War Office Steam Packet. The service ceased at the end of September which at that time, with the onset of winter gales, was normal practice. The Kingstown resumed operations to the Isle of Man from July 1827 when she was placed on the main Liverpool - Douglas thrice weekly schedule. The Company were trying to obtain the mail contract between the two ports and in addition to this advertised a service for light cargo. The St David which was fairly small and slower than her rivals was offered for sale in the spring of 1828, however no interest was expressed in a purchase and she resumed plying to Douglas in April of that year. Although she was operated by the St George Group (see establishment) at this time her sailing notices appear under the name of John Watson, 19 Water Street, Liverpool, and the St George Steam Packet Offices are listed as being at 21, Water Street. This fact is important as it may be seen as a reason as to why the vessel came into disrepute, due to subsequent lack of investment and poor maintenance, this being one of the primary factors which would lead to the establishment of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company in 1830. Advert for passage between Liverpool and Douglas on the St David In 1828 the St David operating under the agency of John Watson on behalf of the St George Company secured the mail contract to the Isle of Man. The St David was able to tailor its service as opposed to the Scottish packets which called at Douglas en route from the Mersey to the Clyde and thereby provided only an indifferent winter service. The St David, because Douglas was her destination, not merely a port of call, could therefore suit her sailing times to the tides and so enter Douglas Harbour and therefore did not have to ferry her mail and passengers ashore - which in rough winter conditions could be an arduous and exhausting undertaking. Thus the St David became highly popular on the Island, as all winter she provided a regular, reliable weekly service, except for one week in October 1828, when the Company replaced her with the unsuitable Satellite. In the spring of 1829 the St David increased her service to thrice weekly. However, by this time no investment was being made in the vessel and maintenance on her was poor, with the Company showing a reluctance to have her overhauled. By August the lack of regular maintenance could no longer be ignored and complaints began to be made about her unreliability and the irregularity of the mail service. During a spell of bad weather some work was undertaken, but by the end of September things had become so bad that the St David had to be withdrawn from service in order to undergo a complete overhaul. No steamer was available to replace the St David and consequently the Company resorted to chartering Mersey Ferries in order to operate the schedule, which were highly unsuitable to such an undertaking. The ferry Abbey caused particular discomfort, a contemporary report stating: \\"She'd not even a bed or pan, or bucket for the sick.\\" The St David arrived back on station on 24 November, and once more began to provide a reliable although slow service in all weather, however this was to no avail. The hiatus as a consequence of her overhaul, coupled to the unreliable service offered by the replacements, had driven the Manx population to despair. The autumn of 1829 marked a turning point in sea operations between Liverpool and Douglas. If the Company had of obtained a suitable relief steamer from another part of the St George Group and given the St David a thorough overhaul the trouble with the service would not of arisen, and it is possible that the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company would not of been formed. By the early part of 1830 it was widely known that a rival company was being formed to undertake competition. In late May the Prince Llewellyn replaced the St David for a week - no chances were being taken this time, now that a rival boat (the Mona's Isle) was under construction. By early June the main St George Company seems to of taken over the service, as notices appeared asking debtors of the St David to settle up; the affairs of her company were being cleared up. The St George again started operating on 21 June 1830, and continued on the schedule until replaced by the Sophia Jane which arrived from Portsmouth on 1 July and operated the usual thrice weekly schedule. =Isle of Man Steam Packet Company= With the formation of the Mona's Isle Company in 1830, which would later become the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, stern competition was offered to the St George Company who at the time were operating their steamer Sophia Jane between Liverpool and the Isle of Man. Unlike previous ships which served the Isle of Man the new company's vessel, Mona's Isle, was not constructed primarily to carry cargoShips of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry, 1977) p.7 and was very well appointed for the carriage of passengers. With their vessel Mona's Isle, the remit of the new company was to open up the Liverpool - Douglas service and to beat the opposition. On Monday 16 August Mona's Isle sailed for Liverpool. The Sophia Jane under the command of Lieutenant John Tudor, R.N., sailed at the same time and reached Liverpool one and a half minutes ahead. On Wednesday 18 August a similar race took place back to Douglas with a similar result. But on Friday 20 August, returning from Liverpool, Mona's Isle came in 40 minutes ahead. The pattern was established and Sophia Jane was regularly beaten, on one occasion in a gale, by over three hours. The early defeats were probably caused by the fact that Mona's Isle's new engine took time to run in and full speed was not attainable at first. Mona's Isle, however, had proved herself capable of travelling between Liverpool and Douglas in eight hours at a speed of .http://www.isle-of- man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/sp1904/ch03.htm The St. George Company engaged in a price-cutting war, offering single steerage fares for as low as 6d one way. So fierce had become the rivalry that when it became known that the Mona's Isle had gone on a trip to Bangor, the Sophia Jane was sent there to race her back to Douglas. The mail was put on the Ormrod which was so unskillfully navigated that her first landfall was St Bees Head. She finally reached Douglas in pouring rain with 200 people, nearly all on deck, after 22 hours at sea. The St George Company withdrew the Sophia Jane and re-introduced their largest and fastest steamer, the St. George on 22 September 1830. However, Mona's Isle won the first race largely because of the astuteness of Capt. William Gill. Seeing a south-westerly gale developing, he had the coal and cargo moved to the windward side of the vessel, to prevent the windward paddle lifting out of the water. By October 1830, Mona's Isle had established herself as the principle steamer between Liverpool and Douglas. A letter to the Editor of the Liverpool Mercury stated:- http://www.isle-of- man.com/manxnotebook/mxman/v04p005.htm =Loss of the St George= On Friday 19 November 1830, under the command of Lieutenant John Tudor R.N., the St George arrived in Douglas from Liverpool with mail and passengers.The Manks Advertiser. Tuesday, November 30, 1830 Once her passengers and mail were unloaded, the St George proceeded to take her anchorage in the vicinity of Conister Rock using the fixed chain cable which had been secured for the task. The night was stormy, with strong gusts of wind from the southwest which increased in ferocity as the wind backed to the southeast on the morning of 20 November. At 05:00hrs the chain cable holding the St George began to give way and she began to drive in between the Pollock and Conister rocks. Steam had been kept up during the night, with the crew at their stations, but the force of the sea together with the ship's proximity to the Conister Rock meant she struck the rock before any attempt to back her out could prove successful. The St George struck the rock violently, immediately filled and settled down forward, with her head to the land and lying almost broadside to the most ruggered part of the rock. Lieutenant Tudor immediately ordered distress signals to be made as well as the foremast to be cut away with a view to forming a raft so as that when the dawn came they might be rescued by boats from the lee side of the vessel, but this was found to be impractical. From his home at the Fort Anne Sir William Hillary observed the disaster taking place and immediately made for the pier in order to initiate a rescue. Together with Lt Robinson (RN), William Corlett (agent for the St George Steamship Company), Issac Vondy his coxswain, and a volunteer crew of 14 Sir William set out to render assistance. On approaching the St George the lifeboat's anchor was let go to the windward, and by veering down upon the wreck an attempt was made to take off the people from the weather quarter, but the surf would not enable this to be carried out. The lifeboat was then backed between the St George and the rocks, and despite warnings from Lt Tudor of the dangers this would present to the lifeboat, the crew of the lifeboat persevered and were initially successful. The lifeboat had now got into a situation where the rolling sea was causing it to become swamped and began to sustain damage with the rudder being disabled and six out of the ten oars either broken or lost. Coupled to this, Sir William, Corlett and two boatmen had been washed overboard. Memorial erected along the Loch Promenade in Douglas Corlett and the two boatmen were swiftly got back into the boat, but Sir William, unable to swim, seized a rope which was hung from the vessel's side by which he was able to support himself until Lt Tudor assisted by Lt Robinson managed to get a badly injured Sir William aboard. From the disabled state of the boat and the loss of the oars it became impossible to take off the people and proceed windward by hauling up her anchor, as was originally intended. Any route to the leeward was blocked by the rigging of the mast which had been cut away and this left the lifeboat hemmed in between the wreck, the Conister Rock and by a point of rock which ran out beyond it. The situation of the crews of the St George and the lifeboat remained perilous for two hours, a critical situation, but after time the rigging of the fallen mast was cut away with knives and an axe which were fortunately in the boat. The size of the swell increased as the tide rose and now swept the decks of the St George nearly burying the lifeboat, and one last effort was made to extricate themselves from a situation which at any time could have proved fatal. The crew of the St George consisted of 22 and the lifeboat 18. They finally all managed to get into the lifeboat, by now taking a large quantity of water which had to be constantly bailed out by the use of buckets which had been taken from the St George. With the use of the remaining oars the lifeboat was cast off and the cable cast away, but she struck violently on the low ridge of the rock, filled, and striking again was washed over, leaving her occupants holding on by ropes. The cable was then cut, and the sea coming round the bow of the St George drove the lifeboat broadside on, upon the sheltered side of the Conister Rock thus avoiding the potential catastrophe, and they were then able to proceed towards the shore a quarter of a mile away. They were met by two boats which had put out from the pier and proceeded through the sound to approach them under the shelter of the lee of the rock. Some of the St George's crew were transferred into the first boat, and the other boat, commanded by Lt Sleigh R.N. was able to get a line to the lifeboat and thus take it successfully in tow to the beach. None of the forty men involved were lost. Following the rescue, Sir William Hillary received the following letter from Lieutenant John Tudor: '''' At a Meeting of the Committee of the Isle of Man District Association of the Royal National Institution, for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck, held at the Courthouse, Douglas, 27 November 1830, presided over by the Chairman, High Bailiff James Quirk Esq, it was agreed unanimously that the following report be transmitted to the Secretary of the Royal National Institution:Manks Advetiser. Tuesday November 30th, 1830. '''' A memorial depicting the rescue can now be seen in the sunken garden on Loch Promenade, Douglas. =Subsequent operations= The St George Company determined to continue its operations between Liverpool and Douglas however the vessels tasked with operating the schedule, the Prince Llewellyn and the Orinoco were deemed to be well below the standard which had been set by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. The Prince Llewellyn when running for Peel in a gale was almost wrecked off the Calf of Man, and on 13 December 1830 she collided with the Mona's Isle in Douglas Harbour and badly damaged herself resulting in repairs having to be undertaken. Consequently, transportation of the mail was undertaken by the Mona's Isle until the end of January 1831 when the Vale of Clywd or the St Winifred resumed the contract for the St George Steam Packet Company. This however was terminated at the end of February 1831 due to deteriorating financial returns as it was considered that undertaking a sailing with mail only was not worth while, as by this time passengers had given up using this unreliable service. It was cheaper to pay the Mona's Isle to bring the mail and the St George Steam Packet Company ceased its operations to the Isle of Man. So ended the St George Steam Packet's Douglas - Liverpool service. However, these were not the last call at the Isle of Man by the Group's ships, as in subsequent years other steamers made occasional calls. As can be seen the story of operations of the St George Steam Packet to the Isle of Man is very complicated, more so than any other operator. The winter boat employed by the Company between Liverpool and Douglas was the St David and not the Prince Llewellyn, and the events concerning the St David are important but ultimately had little direct influence on the early developments. Certainly the St George Company did not pioneer steamship services to the Isle of Man, as numerous services, such as those offered by George Langtry between 1822-1824 and from 1828-1830, the Mersey and Clyde Steam Navigation Company 1824-1831 and the Carlisle and Liverpool Steam Navigation Company 1826-1831 were also available during the period. The St George Steam Packet Company continued operations until 1843, when it was reconstructed, the Cork Steamship Company taking over its various operations and seven of its steam ships.

The work was inspired by a sketch completed on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park. The completed canvas is large, measuring 72.0 √ó 102.3 cm (28‚Öú √ó 40¬º in). Painted over the winter of 1915‚Äì16, it was completed in Thomson's shack behind the Studio Building in Toronto. The painting was produced as he was in the peak of his short art career and is considered one of his most notable works. While exhibited in a show put on by the Ontario Society of Artists, the work received mixed to positive reviews. In 1916 it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and has remained in the collection ever since. Background River, March‚ÄìApril 1915. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa =1915 sketching season= In the spring of 1915 Thomson returned to Algonquin Park earlier than he had in any previous year. In a letter to James MacCallum, he reported that he had already painted twenty-eight sketches by 22 April., quoted in He became fascinated with the \\"opening of the waters\\" as the ice on the lakes began to melt. This ice is apparent in the sketch River, which was likely painted early in the season and preceding Spring Ice. The close of the day is indicated by the turquoise, yellow and lavender sky. The year overall was particularly productive for Thomson, himself reporting that he had painted 128 sketches by September. He began to more consistently use hard wood-pulp board for sketching, something he picked up from J. E. H. MacDonald. From April through July, he spent much of his time fishing, assisting groups on several different lakes. He spent much of his summer travelling across the province, hunting and sketching. From the end of September to mid-October, Thomson spent his time at Mowat, a village on the north end of Canoe Lake. By November he was at Round Lake with Tom Wattie and Dr. Robert McComb. In late November Thomson returned to Toronto and moved into a shack behind the Studio Building that Harris and MacCallum fixed up for him, renting it for $1 a month (). Description Spring Ice is among the dozen or so paintings expanded from a small sketch into a larger canvas work. The smaller sketches were done en plein air‚Äîin this case likely painted a little north of Hayhurst's Point on Canoe Lake‚Äîthrough the spring, summer and fall. The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio‚Äîan old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in Rosedale, Toronto. =Sketch (spring 1915)= Curator Charles Hill has written that the Sketch for Spring Ice was almost certainly done with A. Y. Jackson's 1914 canvas A Frozen Lake in mind. Thomson likely saw the painting in November 1914 before Jackson took it away in December to be exhibited. The composition recalls Thomson's earlier work from his design career, using a group of trees in the foreground to establish a lake and low-lying hills in the background. By 1914 Thomson was displaying an increasing interest in the motifs of both ice breaking up on a river as well as rock in the lower foreground. In these earlier examples, the foreground tends to cut a diagonal across the painting while the trees subtly obscure the far shore. A. Y. Jackson experimented with this idea in his own 1914 painting, Lake Shore, Canoe Lake. In the Sketch for Spring Ice, a gentler rise to the left instead establishes the foreground with only a few brushstrokes used to paint the brown ground. Charles Hill has further written that, \\"the relationship of foreground, middle and distance is more fluid than in Northern River, opening the view of the water and far shore.\\" =Canvas (winter 1915‚Äì16)= The final canvas for Spring Ice shares similarities to In the Northland, another work produced over the same winter. A key difference is that Spring Ice emphasizes the horizontal, seen with both the foreground, lake and hills existing in bands stacked on top of one another, and further emphasized by the open space and the trees being placed on the far left and right of the foreground. While the sketch utilizes \\"muddy, warm tones,\\" the canvas instead uses brighter, more highly keyed colours. The brighter greens, pinks, yellows, blues and whites are not too striking, with a pale blue lightly put on top of the final work to lower the overall contrast. The different regions of colour are readily apparent within the foreground. In the background, terra cotta is painted over with blue.

Private collection Provenance and exhibition In March and April 1916 Thomson exhibited Spring Ice and three canvases with the Ontario Society of Artists (OSA). The other paintings were In the Northland (at that time, titled The Birches), Moonlight and October (then titled The Hardwoods), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915‚Äì16. Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase In the Northland, but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to instead purchase Spring Ice. They bought it for $300 (). Reception to Thomson's paintings at this time were mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the Toronto Daily Star wrote, \\"Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.\\" A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in The Christian Science Monitor: In The Canadian Courier, painter Estelle Kerr similarly spoke positively, describing Thomson as \\"one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects.

It was led by James Coterel‚Äîafter whom the gang is named‚Äîsupported by his brothers Nicholas and John. It was one of several such groups that roamed across the English countryside in the late 1320s and early 1330s, a period of political upheaval with an associated increase in lawlessness in the provinces. Coterel and his immediate supporters were members of the gentry, and according to the tenets of the day were expected to assist the crown in the maintenance of law and order, rather than encourage its collapse. Basing themselves in the peaks of Derbyshire and the heavily wooded areas of north Nottinghamshire (such as Sherwood Forest) the Coterels frequently cooperated with other groups, including the Folvilles. Membership of the Coterel gang increased as its exploits became more widely known; most of the new members were recruited locally, but others came from as far away as Shropshire. Despite repeated attempts by the crown to suppress the Coterels, their criminal activities increased; by 1330 they had committed murder, extortion, kidnap, and ran protection rackets across the Peak District. They do not seem to have ever been particularly unpopular with the populace, and the secular and ecclesiastical communities provided them with supplies, provisions and logistical support. Possibly their most famous offence took place in 1332. A royal justice, Richard Willoughby, was despatched to Derbyshire to bring the Coterels to justice, but before he could do so, he was kidnapped by a consortium composed of both the Coterels' and the Folvilles' men. Each gang had encountered him in his professional capacity on previous occasions, and probably wanted revenge on him as much as they wanted his money. This they also received, as Willoughby paid 1,300 marks for his freedom. This outrage against a representative of the crown led King Edward III to launch a royal commission into the troubled area to bring the Coterels to justice and restore the King's peace. In the event, many gang members were arraigned, but all but one were acquitted; the Coterel brothers themselves ignored their summonses and did not even attend. The King was politically distracted by the outbreak of the Second War of Scottish Independence; this provided him with the opportunity to recruit seasoned men to his army while appearing to solve the local disorder. As a result, most of the Coterel band received royal pardons following service abroad or in Scotland, and James, Nicholas and John Coterel all eventually had profitable careers. Modern scholars tend to agree that the activities and members of 14th-century groups such as the Coterels provided the basis for many of the stories later woven around Robin Hood in the 15th century. Background = Political context = The Coterel gang was active during a period of political factionalism within central government. The king, Edward II, was extremely unpopular with his nobility, because of reliance on favourites, such as Hugh Despenser the Younger, on whom he lavished royal patronage at the expense of other barons. Despenser was hated by the English nobility, particularly those gathered around the King's cousin, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. In 1322 Lancaster had rebelled against Edward and his favourites, but had been defeated and executed. One of the Coterel brothers and their later allies from the Bradbourne family were also involved, so it is likely, says the historian J. R. Maddicott, that there was a political dimension to the band's activities as part of general opposition to the King. The gang at least thrived on the political chaos of the last years of Edward II's reign and the early years of that of Edward III. This was an exceptionally lawless and violent period, says the historian Michael Prestwich, \\"where a quarrel over a badly cooked herring could end in violent death, as happened in Lincoln in 1353\\". Members of their own family were \\"contrariants\\"‚Äîopposed to the Despensers and Edward II‚Äîbut this did not prevent the Coterel brothers stealing from members of that party whenever the opportunity arose. For example, after the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322‚Äîwhen the contrariant nobles fought Edward II and lost‚Äîthe Coterels ambushed fleeing survivors of the losing side, and robbed them of horses and armour. On another occasion they stole \\"a quantity of silver plate\\", only to be ambushed themselves by a small force of Welsh who in turn relieved them of their loot. =The Coterel family= The Coterel family has been described as \\"not only numerous, but also litigious\\". Nicholas, James and John were the sons of a major Derbyshire landowner, Ralph Coterel. Nicholas had been involved‚Äîhow deeply is unknown‚Äîin Lancaster's rebellion in 1322, for which he had received a pardon. James Coterel, in his youth, has been described as a 14th-century juvenile delinquent. He was the eldest‚Äîand, says the medievalist Barbara Hanawalt, the dominant personality‚Äîamong the brothers, (\\"young men of prys\\", as they were later called) and was the acknowledged leader of the gang, which was later recorded as the \\"Society of James Coterel\\". He became of particularly high standing in the local community. His group has been described as something like a \\"federation of gangs\\", due to its fluid membership and interconnectivity with similar groups in the Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland area. =Origins= There is no firm evidence as to James Coterel's precise motives for embarking on his career in crime. Perhaps, suggests the medievalist J. G. Bellamy, having started off in a small way, he discovered that he was good at it and that it provided an easy source of income in what was a relatively wealthy area. The Coterel gang was a combination of \\"criminal gentry\\", the class on whom‚Äî\\"paradoxically\\"‚Äîthe upkeep of law and order usually devolved to in the localities. They were joined by men of lower class, with a few local men forming the kernel of the gang. The group is first mentioned in official records on 2 August 1328, when the three Coterel brothers, allying with Roger le Sauvage and others, attacked the vicar of Bakewell, Walter Can, in his church, evicted him from it and stole ten shillings from his collection plate. The offence was committed at the instigation of Robert Bernard, who had held several important positions: he had been a clerk for the Westminster chancery, had taught at Oxford University and was, at the time of the offence, registrar of Lichfield Cathedral. Brother Bernard had himself been vicar of Bakewell in 1328 and had been forcibly ejected by his parishioners for embezzling church funds. He was, says Bellamy, \\"an unsavoury individual\\" and may have personally participated in the assault on Walter Can. Activities The Coterels and their associates were a \\"greenwood gang\\", as they favoured making their hide- outs in the local woods. They cooperated with similar groups, most notably with the Folvilles, and when Eustace Folville hid out in Derbyshire‚Äî\\"during his enforced absences\\" from Leicestershire‚ÄîJames Coterel was later described as his leader, although strictly the Coterels were of a lower social status (Maurice Keen wrote that James Coterel \\"might have ranked as a minor gentleman\\", while Folville was a knight). Either way, the Coterels did not merely have contacts within the gentry class; they were members of it. They were known to hide out on the \\"wild forests of the High Peak\\"‚ÄîJames Coterel was called \\"the king of the Peak\\"‚Äîwith spies keeping a look-out for the sheriff's men; they avoided capture this way on at least one occasion. The Coterels had a strategy of never staying more than a month in the same place; they did return, intermittently, to various safe houses. One of the areas they concentrated on was around the village of Stainsby, where the Sauvage family was based and on whose manor the Coterels often made their headquarters.Meanwhile, King Edward II had continued alienating his nobility, and by 1326 both his wife, Queen Isabella, and his eldest son, Edward, Earl of Chester, had gone into French exile. Isabella soon became the focus of opposition to the King, and, with Roger Mortimer, invaded England, deposed King Edward and ruled in his stead. The Coterel gang's continuing violence‚Äîand the authorities' failure to suppress it‚Äîmotivated Mortimer and Isabella to take a robust approach to law and order. This had little effect. James Coterel committed murders in Derby in 1329 and 1330, on the latter occasion killing Sir William Knyveton; in 1330 he also murdered John Matkynson in Bradley. James Coterel was attached at the Derbyshire Eyre for the crime that year, but escaped arrest. Both he and Laurence were accused of ravaging the Derbyshire estates of the dead Earl of Lancaster's brother and heir, Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster. Lancaster later brought suit against the three Coterel brothers for the damage they had done to his park and chase in Duffield, where, he said, they had \\"hunted and carried away deer and did many other wrongs\\". The Coterels did not deign to appear in court, but in their absence judgement was given against them and the damage estimated at ¬£60: the cattle that the Coterels stole may have been worth as much as ¬£5,200. Most of the gang against whom proceedings had been attempted were found to be legally vagabonds, and the sheriff postponed the hearings three times before giving up. Sir Roger de Wennesley, Lord of Mappleton, was then dispatched to arrest them on 18 December that year. De Wennesley was a \\"sworn enemy\\" of the Coterels, having stabbed one of their relations‚Äîand Coterel gang associate‚ÄîLaurence Coterel to death in March the same year. De Wennesley was, supposedly unable to locate the gang, who were then declared outlawed in March 1331. One commentator says their outlawry \\"seems to have inspired them to expand the range of their criminal behaviour\\". Soon after de Wennesley's failed commission, the Coterels kidnapped John Staniclyf, a tenant of de Wennesley's. They refused to release Staniclyf until he swore an oath never to oppose the Coterels again, and he was forced to pay a bond of ¬£20 to ensure his compliance.High Peak panorama, Derbyshire, where the band headquartered occasionally while on the run = Peak of activity = The high point of the gang's activity was between March 1331 and September 1332. By this time Edward, Earl of Chester (later Edward III), had launched a coup d'√©tat against Mortimer at Nottingham Castle. In November 1330 Mortimer was hanged at Tyburn a month later and Edward III's personal reign began. The Coterels' activities continued unabated. Roaming between the Peak District and Sherwood Forest, where they often sheltered, the group was continually joined by new recruits until it numbered at least fifty. James Coterel was later personally accused of recruiting 20 men in the Peak and Sherwood areas, but recruits could also come from afar: Sir John de Legh, for example, was from Shropshire. Many men‚Äîsuch as Roger le Sauvage‚Äîjoined after getting into debt and being outlawed when they were unable to pay their creditors. Like Sauvage, some members were already outlawed when they sought membership; many were not, and seem not to have had any previous criminal record. Increased numbers allowed the gang to expand its operations, both geographically and by type. In 1331 they were joined by Sir William Chetulton of Staffordshire (already, says Bellamy, an \\"infamous gang leader\\" himself by this point), who had previously operated in Sir James Stafford's gang in Lancashire. In December 1331, the group was joined by John Boson, an esquire from Nottingham who held land off William, Lord Ros; Bosun's father not only had been an outlaw himself but had been an early associate of James Coterel. The Coterel gang were the subject of multiple presentments throughout their short career, and committed at least two murders as well as extortions and kidnappings around the Peak District, running protection rackets, and generally involving themselves in the feuds of their neighbours. Until mid-1331 the group had made a name for themselves by committing extreme acts of violence; it seems that from then they made it a policy to avoid violence where possible and concentrate on more financially profitable schemes. They became particularly involved in extortion, and Hanawalt has described their technique as being refined: they possessed \\"such an evil reputation for extortion that they only had to send a letter threatening damage to life, limb, and property in order to extort money\\". This was the gang's method with the mayor of Nottingham, to whom they wrote demanding ¬£20‚Äî\\"or else\\". They used the indenture system: one half of the indentured contract was sent to the victim with the demand, and the sum demanded was to be paid to whoever arrived at the appointed time bearing the other half of the indenture. This seems to have been a particular speciality of two members, William Pymme of Sutton Bonington and Roger Sauvage, and one of the bearers they used in 1332 to carry such a letter to William Amyas, a wealthy Nottingham ship owner, was Pymme's mother. In direct imitation of royal justice, they demanded tribute from the local populace; William Amyas was told that, if he failed to comply, \\"everything he held outside of Nottingham would be burned\\". On another occasion they went, mob-handed, to the house of Robert Franceys, where they forced him to hand over ¬£2; Fraunceys, so a chronicler wrote, was sufficiently scared by his experience that \\"he left his house and did not return for a long time\\". A Bakewell man, Ralph Murimouth, was forced to hand over ¬£5. They did all this with apparent immunity. In 1331 the gang kidnapped Robert Foucher of Osmaston (whom they knew would soon be wealthy, as he was due to be granted some local parkland). One of their most notorious acts was not extortion, but another kidnapping‚Äîthat of Sir Richard Willoughby, a royal justice, whom they captured in 1332. = Kidnapping of Richard Willoughby = Victorian illustration reconstructing Nottingham castle and environs in the later medieval period The kidnap of Richard Willoughby has been described by historians Anthony Musson and Mark Ormrod as a \\"daring and very high-profile event\\". He was captured in Melton Mowbray on 14 January 1332 and spirited away while on a judicial commission in the East Midlands. The Coterels, accompanied by members of the Folville gang, numbered between 20 and 30 men. In exchange for Willougby's life, they demanded 1,300 marks for his release. Willoughby was a wealthy man, and raised the necessary amount by the following day. Clearly, says Hanawalt, the risks associated with attacking such a prominent individual were deemed to be acceptable in expectation of such large amounts. The Folvilles received 300 marks of the ransom. It is likely that the Coterels and their associates were motivated at least in part by the fact that many of them would have come up against Willoughby on previous occasions in his capacity as a puisne judge who was regularly active on commissions of oyer and terminer in the region. It is known that in June 1329 he investigated the pillaging of the Earl of Lancaster's lands by the Coterels, and in 1331 he heard the complaint of the vicar of Bakewell over his eviction by the gang. Willoughby was notoriously corrupt‚Äîthe royal yearbooks would later report Willoughby as selling the laws of the land \\"as if they were cattle or oxen\\"‚Äîand according to the near-contemporary Knighton's Chronicon, the Coterel associates had much to feel aggrieved about: Willoughby had been the judge in several cases against members of the group. He was, says Bellamy, \\"thus a fit subject for humiliation\\". His kidnap was almost certainly the chance for revenge \\"for some wrong or imagined wrong once suffered\\" as much as, if not more than, financial gain. The distribution of the ransom took place in one of Sir Robert Touchet's manors at Markeaton Park; Touchet was a prominent Midlands landowner, and was probably the Coterels' chief patron. With his brother, Edmund Touchet‚Äîwho was parson of nearby Mackworth‚Äîhe knew and approved of the Coterel scheme. These men, who provided the gang with material assistance when it was required, were an exemplar of the kind of support the Coterels enjoyed locally. The kidnapping of Willoughby was not merely a local outrage, but, says the historian John Aberth, for the crown it was \\"an unprecedented assault on the dignity of its bench and the authority of its law\\". In Derbyshire, there was a \\"widespread lack of sympathy\\" for the judge.  Royal response  King Edward III, as represented in an early 15th- century illuminated manuscript In response to Willoughby's kidnapping, the King despatched a \\"powerful\\" judicial commission to the north Midlands in March 1332. Fifty men were brought before the bench. In the event, many indictments were presented and heard, but \\"hardly any of the principals were brought into court, much less convicted\\", even though King Edward personally attended the sessions held at Stamford, Lincolnshire. Some of those arrested were bailed; for example, Roger de Wennesley‚Äîwho by now had joined the gang he had been sent to arrest the previous year‚Äîwhile on bail became a forger and wrote \\"pretended letters to arrest certain persons ... by means of which he extorted money daily\\". Of the fifty brought to the bench, only one‚Äîde Uston‚Äîwas convicted. This was William de Uston, who was acquitted of a charge of assault but then sentenced to death for robbery. It may be that, in spite of recent provisions strengthening the powers of a town's night watch and gaol delivery, juries composed of local people were unwilling to accuse men who were their neighbours; in 1332 the majority of accusations the presentment juries made were against men in other towns. The lack of convictions may not have been only due to fear of reprisals among the jurors. They may also reflect sympathy for the group, and perhaps a general unwillingness to condemn anyone who, as Bellamy put it, was \\"not of notorious record\\". A jury of presentment, composed of men from the hundreds of Wirksworth and Appeltree, sat in September 1332, and claimed that the gang was known to collaborate with Robert Bernard, backed by the Chapter of Lichfield Cathedral. This commission documented the Coterels' activities minutely, and, Anthony Musson says, it is \\"a tribute to the functioning of the judicial machinery\\" of the county in the midst of a severe break down in order that it was able to do so. = Support for the gang = The Coterels received a strong degree of support from among the regional public generally and the gentry and churchmen particularly. Within Lichfield Cathedral, apart from Robert Bernard, there were seven canons including John Kinnersley, who were all later accused of being supporters of the Coterels and of providing James with \\"protection, succour and provisions\\". There was, comments Bellamy, \\"no lack of worldly knowledge in the Lichfield cloisters\\": Kinnersley was James Coterel's legal receiver on multiple occasions. The Cathedral chapter supported the gang even after its activities had become the subject of an official investigation. It seems probable that the chapter directly employed them several times, for instance, for the robbing of the vicar of Bakewell, and to collect tithes. The Cathedral chapter's support for Coterel was instrumental in protecting him from arrest. Also among the Coterel's local supporters was the Cluniac prior of Lenton, Nottinghamshire, who on at least one occasion gave them advance warning of an intended trailbaston commission led by Richard de Grey. Similar support was received from the Cistercian house at Haverholme. While on the run, local people kept the men supplied with material support as well as information. Such peripheral supporters were always far more numerous than the gang itself, and it has been estimated that the Coterels could rely on around 150 such supporters (57 of whom were from the villages of Bakewell and Mackworth alone). Such support was not wholly based on fear, but neither did people believe that outlaws were romantic figures out to help the community; perhaps, says Hanawalt, \\"respect and a reluctant admiration\\" was the prevailing attitude of the populace. For example, Walter Aune delivered a quantity of food to them in the woods on one occasion. On another he delivered the rents from Richard le Sauvage's Stainsby manor to Sauvage while the latter was hiding out with the Coterels. When the gang was hiding out in Bakewell they were brought sustenance by local man Nicholas Taddington; Taddington also showed them secret paths around the countryside. Occasionally they had to actively forage for food, and Pymme is known to have sent his servants and members of his household out for this purpose. The Coterel gang enjoyed support within local officialdom as well, including at least six bailiffs in the High Peak area. They were supporters but not necessarily active members, and included at least seven local men who attended parliament during the decade. Another \\"clandestine ally\\" was Sir Robert Ingram, whom the Coterels had personally recruited. Ingram was a man of some importance; he was High Sheriff of Nottingham and Derbyshire between 1322 and 1323 and then from 1327 to 1328 as well as mayor of Nottingham for two terms, 1314‚Äì1316 and 1320‚Äì1324; It was Ingram who wrote to a Coterel spy (or explorator) in Nottingham Castle, William de Usfton, who was not only lord of the manor of Radmanthwaite in Nottinghamshire but also a counterfeiter. Ingram's letter informed the Coterels that their base in the High Peak forest had just been discovered, and thus enabled their escape. Not everyone supported them; in 1331, a petition was presented to parliament which complained about members of the gentry uniting to kidnap and kill the king's loyal officials‚Äîalmost certainly an oblique reference to the Coterel gang. A jury later reported how the band \\"rode armed publicly and secretly in manner of war by day and night\\".  Later events  The Coterels and their men received few, if any, legal penalties, and James Coterel was eventually pardoned of all \\"extortions, oppressions, receivings of felons, usurpations, and ransoms\\" in 1351, probably at the instigation of Queen Philippa, whose patronage he seems to have enjoyed even during his days of criminality. The few members of the gang who were eventually brought before the King's Bench in 1333 were acquitted, and the three Coterel brothers seem to have continued receiving the patronage of Lichfield Cathedral, while Barnard retained both his employment at Oxford University and his church living until his death in 1341. West front of Lichfield Cathedral; the Dean and Chapter hired the Coterel gang from the beginning, protected them during their crime wave, and then supported them in later years. Many members of the band appear to have undertaken royal service in Scotland and in the Hundred Years' War in France in the latter years of the decade, which led directly to the end of the gang's activities. This included de Legh in 1330, and both James' and Nicholas Coterel's names are on the 1338 summons to join the royal army in Flanders. The crown, for its part, withdrew its commissions from the region claiming that the king's peace had been restored; in reality, it had been distracted by the renewal of war with Scotland the previous year, and, writes E. L. G. Stones, \\"the impetus of the general attack on disorder, which had seemed so strong in March 1332, rapidly declined\\". Bellamy notes how usual this was: \\"expenditure of royal energy meant temporary success\\"; but, with the King preoccupied with projects abroad, the status quo ante soon returned. For their part, those who fought for the King were pardoned by him on their return for the offences they had previously committed. There were rewards too: in May 1332, James Coterel was granted the wardship of Elizabeth Meverel. Coterel's ally Chetulton was sentenced to hang, but produced a pardon obtained for him by Ralph, Lord Neville; when it looked as though a second murder could be laid at his door, he was able to produce a second pardon. By July, Chetulton was back in royal favour, and commissioned to capture robbers in Nottingham. In 1334, Sir William Aune was appointed surveyor of the King's Welsh castles, and that same year, William de Uston‚Äîthe only member of the gang to have been convicted, and, indeed, sentenced to death‚Äîwas commissioned to investigate some murders in Leicester that were believed to have been carried out by Sir Richard Willoughby's servants. One of the last occurrences of James Coterel's name in official records indicates that he too regained the King's trust, as in November 1336, \\"he was on the right side of law\\", having been commissioned to arrest a \\"miscreant Leicestershire parson\\". They were, says Bellamy, reformed characters, and the Coterel brothers would never again ride armata potentia‚Äîarmed and in power. Scholarship The Coterel gang has been described by a late 20th-century historian as being the locus of an \\"apparent disregard for the law which has been shown as emanating from the Midlands\\", demonstrating the degree to which the crown lacked control over the provinces. They have also been identified as accelerating the legal concept of conspiracy, which was in its infancy. Royal authority had been weakened by its appearance of powerlessness in the face of the Coterels' widespread and systematic lawlessness. The Coterels' activities show how \\"interwoven the criminal, the military, and the royal administrative\\" could be; sometimes, says Carter Revard, \\"the outlaw of one year could be the brave soldier of the next\\". The Coterels were \\"unique to th[eir] time and location\\", and, suggests one scholar, symptomatic of a changing system of retaining, in which once-firm ties to a supporting lord had become much more fluid and uncertain, with the result that some men effectively chose to operate outside the feudal system. While much of the gang warfare that plagued England in the early 14th century can be put down to the return of unemployed soldiery from the north, as contemporary chroniclers were prone to assume, organised crime such as that of the Coterels'‚Äîwhich does not seem to have contained this element of demobilization‚Äîwere, suggest the historians Musson and Ormrod, \\"the product more of the disturbed state of domestic politics in the 1320s than of the crown's war policies\\". = Fictional connections = The medievalist John Bellamy has drawn attention to the degree to which the tales of Robin Hood and Gamelyn intersect in detail with known historical events such as those the Coterels were involved in; he also notes that there are probably an equal number of points on which the stories diverge from history. A comparison to Gamelyn shows how, even while that lord was a fugitive, his tenants \\"maintain their deference and loyalty to him ... they go down on their knees, doff their hoods, and greet him as 'here lord, all the while keeping him fully abreast of the state of legal proceedings against him. Gamelyn as \\"king of the outlaws\\" was also reflected in the fame of the Coterel gang in local society. Likewise, the Coterels' propensity for attacking royal officials is \\"very much Gamelyn style\\", says T. A. Shippey, as was the King's willingness to pardon them in return for military service. Similarities have been noticed between the tales of Robin Hood and the activities of such armed groups as the Coterels, particularly in their attacks upon authority figures; the pavage imposed by Hood's gang is similar to the tribute extorted by the Coterels. The tale of Adam Bell was similarly shaped by the Coterels' and Folvilles' activities. R. B. Dobson and John Taylor suggested that there was only a limited connection between the invention of Robin Hood and the criminal activities of the Coterels, who do not, summarises Maurice Keen, \\"seem to offer very promising matter for romanticization\\". However, contemporaries were aware of such a link: in 1439 a petition against another Derbyshire gangster, Piers Venables, complained that he robbed and stole with many others and then disappeared into the woods \\"like as it had been Robin Hood and his meiny\\". John Maddicott, on the other hand, notes an \\"accumulation of coincidences\\" between the Coterel and Folville gangs and the exploits recounted of Hood. These he lists principally as Maddicott describes the capture of Willoughby as very much \\"a feat reminiscent of the world of ballads\\" and the gang's popularity as \\"close to the standing of Robin Hood and his men as folk heroes\\". The people who actively supported and aided the Coterels in Derbyshire, says Maddicott, were also those who, another time, were the audience of the Hood ballads. After all, he says, they did take from the rich, \\"even if they did not give to the poor, and if the rich were also royal officials, like Willoughby, such retribution may have seemed well deserved\\". David Feldman likewise describes the Coterels and their supporters as \\"disgruntled gentry with an eye for the main chance\\" who set themselves up as Robin Hood types, except, like Maddicott, Feldman reiterates that what they \\"robbed from the rich never reached the poor\\". They possessed a certain \\"gentrified behaviour\\", as it has been called, along with the more usual brutality of the gangs, which dovetail in the ballads. Coterel's ally Robert Ingram has been proposed as the original inspiration for the sheriff of Nottingham in the Gest of Robin Hood, a late 15th-century re-telling of the tale. The close association with criminally-minded ecclesiastics and blatant outlaws such as the Coterels have also been linked to the fiction of Friar Tuck, who, whilst being a \\"large, merry body\\" was also the leader of his own \\"merry gang of murderers and thieves\\". John Maddicot has concluded that while the links between fiction and reality are strong, it is See also * :History of Derbyshire  Notes   References  = Bibliography =                 Medieval English criminals English outlaws Recipients of English royal pardons History of Derbyshire Medieval thieves History of Nottinghamshire Gangs in England 14th-century criminals ","title":"Coterel gang"},{"id":"58461313","text":"Henrik Schneider (born 5 February 1969) is a Hungarian rower.

The hospital is located in a 47-acre site in South Belfast. It is managed by Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Also located within the hospital grounds is the regional child and adolescent mental health inpatients unit Beechcroft - this opened in 2010. Knockbreda Wellbeing and Treatment centre is also located within the grounds of Forster Green and this opened in 2009. This has been described as a \\"one stop approach\\" to healthcare which offers a wide range of healthcare services to the local community from general practitioners to physiotherapists all in the same location.  History  The hospital was founded by Forster Green, a tea and coffee merchant who purchased Fortbreda House and the surrounding grounds for a total sum of ¬£11,000 in 1895 with the plan to build a hospital specifically for the treatment of consumption and chest complaints. Green was aware of the challenges posed by the setting up and running of a hospital as he was a life governor of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. At the time one of the only treatments for tuberculosis was access to fresh air, this was one of the reasons why the Fortbreda site, with its location at the time being outside the city in relative countryside, was a perfect location for a consumption unit. Over the subsequent two years the site was developed and on 30 September 1897 Forster Green Hospital for Consumption and Chest Diseases opened. In the early years the main purpose of the hospital was to function as a sanatorium. This meant that most of the patients in the hospital were long term patients who had tuberculosis (TB) or related respiratory illnesses. Before the discovery of antibiotics the main methods used to treat TB were; exposure to fresh air, rest and surgery to remove infected parts of the lung- this was seen as a last effort to control the disease. The large amount of open space on the Forster Green site, and the fact it was located outside of the city centre meant that it was the ideal location for the desired non- interventional treatment options. Over the next 20 years, the hospital steadily grew in size and in 1925 the first x-ray machine was acquired for the hospital- this was used for the diagnosis of thoracic disease and also to help guide treatment. In 1933 the hospital opened a new wing, this increased bed numbers but more notable was that the new wing had operating theatres, this allowed surgical treatment of chest diseases to occur on site. In 1945 the x-ray machinery was upgraded, this boosted the hospitals diagnostic repertoire. Upon the nationwide introduction of the National Health Service in 1948, the hospital name was officially changed to Forster Green Hospital. A new thoracic surgery unit was approved for development in 1953 and was finished and operational in 1955, this increased number of surgeries than could be performed in the hospital. Three years later in 1958 a newly built administration unit was opened, this helped better organise the daily workings of the hospital- this building was acquired by the Belfast Trust Dietetics Service in 2008. Also in 1958 laboratory services were added to the site along with a mortuary, the mortuary was taken over by the Belfast Trust in 1973 and became the Belfast City Mortuary, this was relocated to the Royal Victoria Hospital in the 2008 to a new forensic mortuary building costing ¬£4.5 million. A change of direction in the hospital's history occurred in 1983 with the closure of the respiratory medicine wards with these wards being moved to the recently opened Belfast City Hospital tower block along with the radiology department. The thoracic surgery unit was also closed this year and relocated to the Royal Victoria Hospital. Upon the closure of wards specific to the care of older people in Belvoir Park Hospital, Musgrave Park Hospital and Ulster Hospital, new facilities for care of older people was opened in the hospital in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1997 a specialist rehabilitation unit was opened in the hospital, this unit dealt exclusively with patients with serious brain injuries. This unit was moved to a newly built specialist centre in 2006 - the Regional Acquired Brain Injury Unit which is located in Musgrave Park Hospital.  Services  = Current services = The hospital today is significantly smaller than it was in the past. The hospital has two wards for neurology patients- wards 3 and 4. Wards 5 and 6 are used for care of older patients and ward 7 is the child and family centre. = Beechcroft = Also located within the Forster Green Hospital site is Beechcroft- the regional child and adolescent mental health inpatient unit, the only unit of its type in Northern Ireland. This unit opened in early 2010 and was built at a cost of ¬£9 million. It deals with patients with complex needs and offers a range of assessment and treatment options that cannot be done within the community.

The Lowndes County Courthouse in downtown Columbus, Mississippi, is the seat of government for Lowndes County, in the northeastern part of the state. It was initially built in 1847 to designs of local architect James Lull and then remodeled in 1901-05 by Chattanooga-based architect Reuben H. Hunt, who also completed buildings for the Mississippi University for Women nearby at almost the same time. An addition was constructed in 1976.Lowndes County Courthouse Visit Columbus MississippiColumbus Central Commercial Historic District National Register nomination form, https://www.apps.mdah.ms.gov/nom/dist/99.pdf  History  The area of Lowndes County has historically been agriculturally based, mostly on the production of cotton, since European settlement began in the early 1800s. Together with Starkville in Oktibbeha County and West Point in Clay County, it has anchored a region in northeast Mississippi known since the 1990s as the Golden Triangle. In the twentieth century, industry gradually began to overtake agriculture as the primary economic activity. Until the early twenty-first century, Columbus was the largest and most economically robust of the three cities, though Starkville is now slightly larger in population. The courthouse is located at the northern edge of Columbus' downtown commercial district, occupying most of a block bounded on the east and west by N 6th Street and N 5th Street, respectively; and on the north and south by 3rd and 2nd Avenues, North, respectively. It faces south onto 2nd Avenue North towards a row of storefronts, which also front the block on the west. The District Attorney's offices are located in a building immediately behind it. To the north is Franklin Academy, while the buildings on both the east and south sides of the courthouse square are occupied by law offices. Parking is located on the northern half of the block on which the courthouse stands.  Design  The two-story courthouse was initially built in 1847. Its current state uses an asymmetrical design. The original pedimented block at the western end has a main fa√ßade that steps forward twice from the outer walls' plane, terminating near the center in a portico supported by monumental Ionic columns in pairs on either side. Three round-arched fan-light doorways form the main entrances under and on either side of the portico, which is approached by a wide stairway from ground level. To the west of the original portico rises a square clock tower that tapers to an octagonal plan as it approaches the belfry. It is capped by a dome above the four clock faces that is in turn crowned by a small open lantern. The tower uses an Italianate style, but much of the rest of the building is solidly neoclassical. A large addition steps forward from this original portion, fronted by a flat-roofed monumental portico supported by Corinthian columns; to the east of this block, a smaller newer wing forms an L-shape, giving the entire courthouse a plan much like a blocky W-shape. Like most of the buildings in the surrounding district, the courthouse is primarily constructed of a light orange brick.Columbus Central Commercial Historic District National Register nomination form, References Columbus, Mississippi Courthouses in Mississippi Buildings and structures in Lowndes County, Mississippi Government buildings completed in 1847 ","title":"Lowndes County Courthouse (Mississippi)"},{"id":"58461555","text":"The Water Tower in Fabric is an industrial monument from Timi»ôoara, Samuil Micu Street, no. 16.

Waterwitch flying the colors of the USRC in her early days The launch was built in 1900 by Peter Swanson, of Belvedere, California for Archie Young of the Von Hamm-Young company. She was 13 tons, and fifty feet in length, with a beam of nine feet, she drew five feet of water. Powered with a forty housepower Union gas engine, she had electric lighting. She could carry twenty five to fifty passengers and crew. She was brought to Hawaii as deck cargo to Oahu, Hawaii in 1903 on the schooner Rosamond arriving on 3 October 1900. Her maiden voyage took place on 6 October under the command of Commodore Archie Young, crewed by the Young Brothers, William and Herb, (no relation to Archie). On the trip the Waterwitch cruised round the Honolulu harbor and the southeast coast of the island, before making for Pearl and back, at speeds up to 12 knots. The Young brothers, William and Herb, had arrived on the island in January 1900 and were immediately put into quarantine for three months, due to an outbreak of the Bubonic plague in Honolulu Unable to land they immediately took on jobs as crew freighting supplies among the islands. They put their hands to any task that presented itself including salvage and repair work while waiting clearance to land. Once allowed access to Honolulu, they took on employment by Archie in April 1900 .. They continued moonlighting with their various small ventures, mainly salvage and repair, towing garbage, delivering supplies to ships; by August that year they gained a passenger license and started a bumboat service using a small five horsepower launch the Billy around the harbor, for pleasure trips, and ferrying sailors back to their ships after shore leave. All these small jobs together would form the basis of the Young Bothers company founded that year, 1900. The business proved successful enough to bring two more brothers from San Diego into the business that year and the next. The brothers went onto buy the Waterwitch in 1902, and soon won a contract for to leasing her out as the official Customs and Immigration boarding boat for the island. They completely overhauled her for the job, taking out the six pullman berths on board. In 1900 Honolulu boasted a population of 45,000, her harbor was only capable of servicing launches. Large vessels were obliged to anchor offshore and transfer passengers and goods by small launches and boats. On 16 May 1901 the Waterwitch and the Fearless contested  Customs servce  The contract with the Customs Service began in May 1903 when she began to operate as a revenue and patrol boat taking officers out to arriving ships. She first flew the revenue flag in on 25 May, with Captain Herb Young at the helm. She would serve in this capacity for the next 28 years, often meeting up to 8 or 10 ships every day. Her crew wore coats with two sets of buttons, one row for each, of the customs service and the other for the Immigration department. Over the years her engine got upgraded several times, first to forty horsepower, later to fifty, and finally to one hundred.

The climate is subtropical/tropical and has three seasons, a \\"cool winter from November to February, a hot summer season in March and April and a rainy season from May to October, dominated by the southwest monsoon.\\" A large portion of the country lies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator and the entirety of the country lies in the monsoon region of Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over of rain annually. Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately , while average annual rainfall in the Dry Zone in central Myanmar is less than . The higher elevations of the highlands are predisposed to heavy snowfall, especially in the North. The Northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of . Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of . The Climate of Myanmar has a significant impact on tourist arrivals. Tourists tend to avoid the rainy season and travel in the dry season which runs between November and April with peak inflows occurring between December and February.  Regions  Myanmar has three agro-ecological zones and eight physiographic regions. = Agro- ecological zones = * Coastal zone * Central dry zone * Hilly zone = Physiographic regions = * Rakhine Coastal * Ayeyarwadv Delta * Yangon Deltaic * Southern Myanmar Coastal * Central Dry Zone * Western Hilly * Northern Hilly * Eastern Hilly  Disasters  = Droughts = Rising temperatures and increased drought in Myanmar have caused diminished village water sources across the country, destroyed agricultural yields of peas, sugar cane, tomatoes and rice, and are expected to continue having negative effects on agricultural production and food security by further destruction of cultivation and erosion on soils in the long term. There is a large dependence on rain fed agriculture, as over 70% percent of it people's livelihood dependent on natural capital, and 40% of GDP reliant on agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and forestry. In Myanmar's Dry Zone, longer more extreme droughts and losses of natural ecosystem services which play a role in retaining sediment force those in more rural areas to travel miles for water where lakes have not dried posing considerable livelihood challenges. = Monsoons = In August 2015, extreme flooding caused by monsoon rains killed 27 people and affected over 150,000 in the Sagaing region and in July of 2018 over 120,000 people over seven regions were displaced from their homes also due to heavy monsoon rains, with the death toll hitting at least 10.

Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI). Report commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. To combat any potential hardships, the government of Myanmar has displayed interest in expanding its use of renewable energy and lowering its level of carbon emissions. Groups involved in helping Myanmar with the transition and move forward include the UN Environment Programme, Myanmar Climate Change Alliance (MCCA), and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation. In April of 2015, it was announced that the World Bank and Myanmar would enter a full partnership framework aimed to better access to electricity and other basic services for about six million people and expected to benefit three million pregnant woman and children through improved health services. Myanmar has also acquired funding and proper planning, which is intended to better prepare the country for the impacts of climate change by enacting programs which teach its people new farming methods, rebuild its infrastructure with materials resilient to natural disasters, and transition various sectors towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To this end the country has also entered the United Nation's Paris Agreement in 2016, created the Myanmar National Climate Change Policy in 2017, submitted its new climate action plan to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and developed the Myanmar Climate Change Strategy & Action Plan. At the same time, Myanmar's state technical capacity to conduct international climate change negotiations and implement environmental agreements remains limited and the country requires external assistance in improving its technical capacities. = Adjusting in the Dry Zone = The government of Myanmar, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Adaptation Fund, are carrying out programs to provide farmers the resources, knowledge and tools needed to support good harvests, despite changing weather patterns. Anticipated to reduce food insecurity and losses from extreme climate events in 42,000 households, the \\"Addressing Climate Change Risks on Water Resources and Food Security in the Dry Zone of Myanmar\\" project provides specially developed climate resistant pulses and other crops, as well as special heat resistant breeds of pigs, goats, and poultry to farmers and laborers. In the past, poverty stricken communities cut down trees for fuels and timber, so now communities are being actively involved in establishing and managing forests in order to improve soil conditions, reduce surface runoff, and slow erosion. Nearly 30,000 households in the region have benefited from enhanced water capture and storage capacity in the forms of expanded community ponds, construction on diversion canals, and rehabilitation and protection of over 4,000 hectares of micro-watersheds. To help Myanmar meet its 2030 Water Sanitation and Hygiene Goals, Lien Aid also continues to partner with local governments and community leaders to improve safe water access in villages throughout Myanmar.

This is in part due to 21st century globalization and the advent of music videos on social media, in particular YouTube. K-pop was adopted by the Japanese idol system in the 90s, which brought with it the western male gaze and Lolita culture which eventually morphed into a global phenomenon over a twenty-year time frame. Currently, K-pop idols are \\"manufactured\\" to optimize profit by catering to fan desires. In general, male and female idols follow normative feminine and masculine traits, respectively, as defined by the South Korean patriarchal system and in conjunction with a globally desired fa√ßade. Femininity is often defined by a suppressed doll state conforming to [Lolita ideals. These ideals consist of a slim figure, long legs and a perfect face. Korean masculinity requires a soft or cosmopolitan masculinity. That males are expected to be strong and virile, but also possess soft features such as a sweet personality and a cute face. The manifestation of sexualization is represented in every part of the idol republic, but is most commonly found among modern music videos, which have become increasingly sexualized over the last decade. Female idols are often objectified more than male idols, something complementary to the patriarchal Korean culture.  Historical context  The advent of modern K-pop arguably started in 1992, the genre gained significant foothold by 1996 during the industrialization of K-pop, matured through the mid 2000s, and flourished by 2010. Though beauty is an ever-present ideal for Korean popular culture, these time periods represent shifts in beauty norms and K-pop ideals. The early 1990s brought a young, individualistic cuteness to the scene with stocky builds and chubby faces, following the Korean beauty norms of the 1980s. Following the 1980s Japanese idol system, idol groups were generated in the late 1990s, often mimicking western boy bands with innocence and sunny dispositions, a product directed domestically. During this time a review committee censored all Korean music and music videos for sexual and explicit content. The committee was disbanded in June 1996. After an economic crisis in 1997 and success of this domestic product outside South Korea, the innocence morphed into a more romantic and hipper image in the early 2000s. This presented the first major signs of sexualization. This transformation was aided by the increased use of music videos. By 2004, a new generation of K-pop was born, sex became prevalent in K-pop and idol-worshiping adolescents came into being. Within a decade, maturation of K-pop driven by hyper-popularized music videos, propelled idols into a visual medium, thus transforming K-pop into the modern beauty standard of low body fat, well-toned muscles, and perfected body features. = Globalization = The late 2000s brought K-pop into its modern era and introduced it to the international stage with the Korean wave in Asia. The early 2010s bolstered K-pop to an international powerhouse with the global Korean wave. K-pop has always been influenced by western musical styles; however, many link its international success to the globalization caused by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout period (during the 1997 South Korean economic crash) in South Korea's neo-liberalization. Post-IMF South Korea has incorporated more Westernized (specifically, Americanized) culture into their products (i.e. exports) in order to prosper in international sales, thus pressing the popular music industry to become more westernized. Integration of westernization brought the western male gaze and the hyper- sexualization of products, especially in the popular music scene. Not only was the music itself altered to enhance exportability, but given the modern age of the music video, the performer was also altered. Combining this with Korea's male-dominated society, one that currently ranks the near the bottom of the Global Gender Gap list for modernized societies (presenting the largest gender wage and working condition gaps), produces an overtly sexualized popular music market. Additionally, the proliferation of K-pop allows for South Korea to enter and even dominate the global \\"cultural war,\\" a concept tied to a battle for attention between the globalized cultures in the modern era. Thus, the government of South Korea encourages the use of K-pop to promote global recognition. However, because of the turbulence of popular culture which is largely due to sexualization, the government maintains no official backing of K-pop but restrains limiting what are allowable K-pop activities. Ergo, without official sponsorship of K-pop, the government unofficially helps it by reducing governmental constraints on it, especially for exported products. This allows the idols to become an unofficial representation of the South Korean culture, promoting cultural pride and building the nation into an \\"idol republic,\\" meaning that their image (i.e. bodies) belong to the state and represent the state's people.  Critical issues  Sexualization in K-pop is mainly driven by economic reasoning and forces females into a globalized normative femininity and males into a globalized normative masculinity. = Economic reasoning = Entering the world market to help globalize marketable Korean culture was only a byproduct of the economic conditions behind K-pop's evolution. Early K-pop was not well received critically, but its catchiness and localization enamoured the masses. The success was noticed by a few business-oriented musicians that soon capitalized on the situation. Industrialization of K-pop occurred around the mid 1990s and its popularity just continued to grow. Maintaining localization while hybridizing (not assimilating) with Japan's idol methodology and American popular music stylings helped bolster success internally and as an export, albeit initially limited. The promising external success in conjunction with the diverse extant musical acts drove the music industry to facilitate portfolio diversification of their performing groups to maximize success and profits. This meant optimized pandering to the most consumers. Such optimization lead to increasing numbers of performers per group, each individualized to suit different consumers‚Äô tastes, perfecting the performances, and increasing attractiveness of the group to the different consuming cultures. Therefore, in the group itself there could be a proverbial \\"good,\\" \\"bad,\\" cute, or sexy member, while the whole group increased in attractiveness. Also, combining the desires of American culture for blatant sexiness, Korean culture for aegyo (a compound of cute and lovable), and Japanese proclivity for kawaii and patriarchal Lolita ideas made a complex interplay of diverse satisfaction of fantastical desires. Following this logic, the music companies substantially invested monetarily and temporally in each performer in an effort to tailor them. A base level of attractiveness and skill is required to be considered as a performer. Years of subsequent training and discipline mold performers into what the public wants to see. They are disallowed from dating to maintain innocence, have a directed public life and persona and shamed for gaining weight or not keeping their appearance up. They may also be required to go through plastic surgery for beautification, and are required to interact with fans in a desirable manner. All-in-all, K-pop is an industry driven by profit; subsequently, it treats its performers like well-molded commodities in order to adhere to consumer desires, often sexual in nature as in the westernized male gaze, and Lolita ideals. = Femininity = As the flagship cultural commodities of South Korea, female K-pop singers are expected to be sexy, strong, and independent, in conjunction with being a product for the patriarchal South Korean capitalist society, which wants them to be submissive, innocent, cute, and lovable. To maximize profit and success, the female stars must have the guise of ambiguity. Ultimately, the ambiguity results as a clash between a virgin and a whore, which nearly all groups have. However, some of them may be more biased to one side than the other. South Korean ideals nominally press an aegyo image, or one that is \\"attractive and desirable beyond limits of intimate relations,\\" providing vulnerability to the idols but keeping them whimsical. To conform to the westernized male gaze, females portray the part of an exotic sexual object, often under the dollified Asian motif, leading to thoughts of \\"convenient Asians.\\" Dollification is a construct of placing sexual desire upon a submissive and uncorrupted object of beauty, something common to Asia due to traditional gender roles and patriarchal structure. This applies exceptionally well to the surgically beautified K-pop females. Additionally, dolls are often associated with prostitution or sexual favors, something that idol singers can face when exploited by their employers. Dollification also plays into the Japanese desire for submissive kawaii: dolls are inherently cute and can be controlled at will, something that quenches the yearning for totally submissive females. Similarly, the concept of middle-aged Korean males seeing themselves as Samchon-fans (uncle-fans), or enduring uncles to the idols, has been argued as a facade to deny sexual desire when there is actually an underlying sexual gratification from the female bodies. This makes the female idol fill a Lolita role, one which fulfills a market need by supplying a male pedophilic fantasy of a young female with unconscious sexuality. Consequently, girl (female) bodies have become a commodity and given implicit subjugation in the patriarchal structure, the consumption of such is acceptable. The females may present \\"girl power\\" given their high popularity status, but their pawn-like nature under their parent companies keeps this a novelty, not a reality, via pacification. The justified objectification of girl bodies in such an idol republic, promoted economically and governmentally, makes it a Lolita republic, argued by Yeran Kim. More simply, the beauty of their bodies can belong to a national collective. This beauty and femininity in image is prominently described as that of long legs with \\"honey thighs\\", a perfect face and body, while showing ample skin. Breasts are often sexualized, but have only recently been presented as cleavage in K-pop due to the lack of cleavage shown in the general Korean culture. = Masculinity = Paralleling female idols, male idols are also commodities to be sexualized in an effort to maximize profit and success. Given the rigorous patriarchal gender roles existing in Korea, the males are normally subjected to the requirement of Korean masculinity. However, to optimize for diverse target audiences, they often present vulnerabilities, forming a non-Korean masculinity. Korean (hegemonic) masculinity can consist of patriarchal authority, traditional Confucian masculinity, and violence. Contradictorily, non-Korean masculinity contains a range of metrosexuality from charming to chic. This dichotomy forces bands to be muscular, potent, and appearing sexually virile, while injecting cuteness and innocence into their presentation. This creates a transnational \\"soft masculinity\\" and \\"global metrosexual masculinity.\\" Both a soft masculinity called \\"flower boys,\\" and a harder masculinity, called \\"beast idols,\\" appear in K-pop groups, but even the hardest K-pop masculinity maintains a globalized cuteness. The key features of K-pop masculinity are muscular (often nude) torsos and cute actions/personalities. Well-defined muscles, albeit a falsity, can be considered a sign of both individual phallic power in response to feministic movements and nationalistic female desires. This is exemplified by a \\"body price\\" (momgap) notion that equates the sexiness of a male body to its (and his) worth, with \\"chocolate abs\\" being the most desirable trait. Emasculated actions/personalities are often subtly employed to diversify the K-pop masculine act, as previously stated, but have occasionally been stressed by some to help break gender norms. However, removing masculinity as a whole is ineffective. As noted by a Korean studies professor Oh Ingyu of Korea University, Seoul, \\"[a] male star without well- defined muscles, six-pack abs and a handsome smile won't go far.\\" Stated by Sarah Leung, \\"[the K-pop industry's] ultimate goal? To sell an image to the screaming girls in the crowd.\\"  Manifestation  Sexualization of the popular Korean music market takes place in many forms: pushing sexy and attractive performers, conforming the performers to fan fantasies, and presenting sexualized songs or music videos. = Dollification = Dollification can be observed in a Japanese quote on the introduction to a performance by Girls‚Äô Generation, \\"I was shocked by their amazingly beautiful legs, the dance was as if dolls were dancing and it was wondrous.\\" Likewise, employers utilized doll images for advertisement. The idol G.NA‚Äôs body measurements were a hot topic with fans, so her employer promoted her, by juxtaposing her with mannequins during photoshoots while calling her body \\"the mannequin body\\". This was due to her small face, large breasts, and tiny waist. This representation of a dollified human parallels Girl's Generation's \\"Gee\\" music video, in which the members are acting as mannequins in a shop's window that soon come alive or Girl's Day‚Äôs music video for \\"Tilt my Head,\\" in which the members act like doll factory automata producing self-similar dolls that magically come alive (both also following the \\"coming alive\\" narrative). Countering the description of a perfect doll image is the group Piggy Dolls, consisting of three heavier set females, engendering diversity in body image. = Female idol bodies = In general, female K-pop idols' bodies are heavily regulated by their employers with the expectation that they conform to certain image norms, and their bodies are heavily sexualized by fans. A member of the popular all male K-pop group, Super Junior, has stated in reference to Girls' Generation, a popular all female group, \\"[the members] can't get hurt without permission. Their bodies aren't their own. They're treasures of the nation.\\" The members of Girls‚Äô Generation are known for their long legs, and as a result have been nicknamed \\"The Beautiful Legs Group\\" and a Japanese pornographic film has been made which focuses on their legs. Bodily perfection is a requirement of the profit-driven entertainment industry, consequently, female idols are expected to be thin and beautiful. K-pop idols that are not thin enough are expected to lose weight. The three members of The Piggy Dolls, who were originally larger than most female K-pop idols, were put through training to lose a total of 56 kg for a comeback. For K-pop trainees who's faces are not considered beautiful enough, their employer may enforce mandatory plastic surgery (with the exception of YG entertainment, which prohibits plastic surgery). Not getting a mandatory surgery can mean career failure. Although any surgery is dangerous and can have complications, it is very common for K-pop idols to have undergone small aesthetic plastic surgeries and moderately common to have undergone semi-reconstructive surgeries. Common modifications are a double-eyelid addition, rhinoplasty, chin shaving, and muscular reshaping (mainly of the legs). There are some idols who have openly admitted to aesthetic surgeries, such as Miryo of Brown Eyed Girls who had a double eyelid surgery, Goo Hara of KARA who had an eyelid alteration, and Jessi who had breast implants, rhinoplasty, and eyelid surgery. Some even act as spokespeople for plastic surgery offices, such as G.Na who advertises the services of Dr. Jong Phil. However, most artists keep enhancements private, so there is great conjecture of whether K-pop idols have had plastic surgery, including even the biggest names, such as members of Girls‚Äô Generation and Hyuna. With so much conjecture, some K-pop artists, such as Lee Hyori and Jang Yoon-Ju, have even gone so far as to medically prove they have had no breast augmentation. On the other hand, some artists openly embrace cosmetic surgery. The group Six Bomb has even made a song and music video called \\"Getting Pretty After\\" in reference to cosmetic surgery. In fact, their manager, Kim Il-woong, has openly admitted that all the members have had surgical augmentations to their faces and breasts. This candor, together with the idolization of K-pop artists, has influenced many young Korean's to desire plastic surgery in an effort to emulate their favorite stars. South Korea has the most cosmetic surgeries per capita out of anywhere in the world. = Male idol bodies = Males are likewise subjected to rigorous body standards, with a requirement to keep up their \\"body price\\" while balancing their soft masculinity. The singer Rain is the embodiment of effeminate hyper- masculinity. His well-defined abs and upper muscular body, often seen naked and oiled (or wet), is contrasted to his cute and young face. He is described as having \\"an angelic face and a killer body\\" or \\"a man's body with a boy's face.\\" Rain is an exemplary of the image required: shirtless, muscular male, with some grounding cute elements. To keep this image, rigorous training is required, normally employing trainers and intense daily workout routines. As with their female counterparts, there is sometimes a need for plastic surgery. Similarly, conjecture exists for those who had undergone surgery, but again, some idols have explicitly stated their surgical augmentations. For example, Kwanghee of ZE:A had eyelid, nose, and forehead alterations, Kim Heechul from Super Junior had eyelid alterations and fixed remnants of a past broken nose with surgery, and his co-star Kyuhyun (of Super Junior) had a double eyelid surgery following his parents example. It is important to note some of the gender norm challengers. Kim Heechul of Super Junior hosts a show \\"Lipstick Prince\\" to cover makeup for both genders, Ren from NU‚ÄôEST modeled dresses, skirts, and other similar clothing, Lee Hong Ki of FTISLAND both wears and promotes his nail art, Jo Kwon is a queer culture advocate and crossdresser, and Hansol enjoys makeup and has admitted to being non-heterosexual. = Sexualization in YouTube music videos = Given the popularization of K-pop through visual social media such as YouTube, many fans would most recognize sexualization in music videos or recorded performances. The advent of music videos to help brand recognition brought a survival-of-the-fittest attitude to the images of the artists; that is, the sexier artists survived. Therefore, sex was commercialized to capitalize on human reproductive nature, allowing sexualization to flourish. Given the liberalization of sex, sexual content has increased in K-pop music videos. Therefore, a video content analysis was performed by Bohye Song, by taking MelOn Hot 100 chart listings of the most popular Korean music videos of 2004, 2005, 2014, and 2015 to analyze their sexual content and increases over time. Content observed were sexual innuendos, sexual acts, and provocative clothing. The results were broken down into four parts of changes in physical affection, provocative dress, suggestiveness, and gender variance. It was found that displayed physical affections did not change on average, but implicit sex increased, sexual suggestiveness increased, provocative clothing increased, and female lead singers showed a significant increase in provocative display. This means that there is a significant increase in the display, mainly through clothing, of sexualized females and some males, but there is not much of an increase in sexual acts (two people in contact) depicted. This can be exemplified with modern music videos. Examples of K-pop music videos with revealing clothing on a female singer include \\"Marionette\\" by Stellar, \\"Roll Deep\\" by Hyuna, \\"Ring My Bell\\" by Girl's Day, \\"Wild\\" by Nine Muses, \\"Wiggle Wiggle\\" by Hello Venus, \\"Like a Cat\\" by AOA, \\"Butt\\" by I-Ren, and \\"Dr. Feel Good\\" by BP RaNia, among many others. The female singers sported short skirts, short shorts, cleavage, tight clothing...etc. Correspondingly, male singers have worn see-through shirts and pants, extremely short shorts, and even corsets or skimpy dresses (in drag). Complementary to these are banned-from-broadcast videos, which include, but are not limited to, \\"MOMMAE\\" by Jay Park, due to overtly sexualized females; \\"Abracadabra\\" by Brown Eyed Girls, for being sexually suggestive; \\"Mirotic\\" by TVXQ, for body exposure and explicit language; \\"One More\\" by FIESTAR, due to sexual imagery; both \\"Vibrato\\" and \\"Marionette\\" by Stellar, for sexually suggestive dancing and clothing; \\"Touch Me\\" by Ivy, for sexual imagery and suggestive lyrics; \\"Joker\\" by Dal Shabet, for sexual choreography; \\"Shower Later\\" by Gary, due to sexual innuendos and mature themes; and \\"Bae Bae\\" by BIGBANG, for sexual innuendos. Lastly, the transition from innocent to sexualized can be shown by Girls‚Äô Generation music videos. Their video for \\"Gee\\" in 2009 maintained schoolgirl innocence, then their video for \\"Oh!\\" in 2010 kept their innocence, but added on a prelude to their dark side at the end when it pitted the innocent schoolgirl cheerleaders against sexier, shadowy versions of themselves. Finally, their 2011 video for \\"The Boys\\" replaced innocence with mature sexiness.  Controversies  One key controversy of the sexualization and exploitation of K-pop artists involves the disproportionate objectification of female artists in comparison to male artists. = Criticism for showing feminist behavior = Female Korean pop stars have faced strong criticism for expressing feminist opinions. Female K-pop idols are expected to be cute and beautiful while being obedient to public reception. Even showing an interest in female empowerment is considered controversial. When K-pop stars have deviated and raised their voices have been publicly criticized and attacked. For example, Sulli, who was known for being outspoken about feminism and women‚Äôs rights, was a rarity among K-pop‚Äôs tightly image-controlled stars. Because of this, the star endured years of online harassment and abuse which eventually pushed her into depression and suicide. Both male and female K-pop artists face sexualization and objectification; however, female K-pop artists seem to experience a disproportionate amount. Women are subjected to the male gaze and being considered exotic and submissive for their fans. Femininity is desired to coincide with the social structure so as to maximize profit; idols are normally forced into this definition in conjunction with Korea's inherently well-defined roll for women.

She was a co-discoverer of Element 106, Seaborgium, with Nobel laureate Glenn Seaborg and other team members at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She received her B.S. degree from Allegheny College, and her Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Alonso worked on nuclear defense research and policy for 26 years at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), where she managed various research programs and contributed to government policy on the role of nuclear testing.[1] She co- authored a Report to Congress on stockpile reliability. She collaborated with NASA astronaut Taylor Wang in experiments on Space Shuttle Challenger. Her research led to a nationally broadcast interview on NBC's Today Show. She was awarded a Gold Citation by Allegheny College for her work in national security. Alonso was appointed Assistant Associate Director for National Security until her retirement from LLNL in 2001. She now trains horses to dance to music. She won a bronze medal from the United States Dressage Federation. She competed a freestyle to music by invitation in the U.S. Dressage Finals in Lexington, KY. Alonso and her horse El Gavilan exhibited a Century Club ride for The Dressage Foundation. She has recently published an historical novel, Sun Stallion.  Early life and education  Carol Travis Alonso was born in Montreal, Canada, on December 5, 1941, just two days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Her parents, Clifford Fergus Travis and Margaret Torrence Grafton Travis, had emigrated to Canada as children from England and Scotland respectively. Alonso grew up in Canada, living in Montreal, Merrickville (a small northern town on the Rideau River in Ontario), Hamilton, Toronto, Brantford, and Port Dover on Lake Erie. In 1952 Alonso's parents moved their family aboard Romana, a 52-foot old-style yacht moored in Port Dover. Her father, a self-made engineering designer from an English seafaring family, had always dreamed of living on a boat. For the next 6 years she would live on the yacht, rowing their dinghy Little Toot across the water to walk to school. Hard winters of maintaining a wooden boat in thick ice, along with her father's good job offer from General Electric Company, prompted the family to move to the United States in 1954 when Alonso was 13 years old. They sailed Romana to Erie, Pennsylvania, and later lived there on a 65-foot classic yacht named Water Sprite. From these years Alonso developed a lifelong love of sailing. She attended East High School, where she studied hard on her own and learned self-reliance. In 1959 Alonso proudly became a United States citizen at Erie County Courthouse. She graduated valedictorian of her high school class in 1959, having earned a Merit Scholarship used to attend a fine liberal arts school, Allegheny College, in Meadville, Pennsylvania. She was the first member of her family to go to college. In 1957 the Russians launched the first satellite Sputnik, and from the after-deck of her boat home Alonso watched it traversing the night sky. The space race was on. This inspired Alonso to become a scientist. At Allegheny she carried a double major in physics and mathematics with a minor in art. She was inducted to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior in 1962, and won the Academic Prize when graduating with honors from Allegheny in 1963. From 1963 through 1965, Alonso studied biophysics at Bryn Mawr College, where she researched the effect of x-radiation on the transmission of action potentials through live axons in crayfish. Her thesis resulted in an M.S. degree in BioPhysics. Pursuing her longtime goals, Alonso in 1965, having won a National Science Foundation Fellowship, obtained admission to the Physics Graduate School at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, MA. In those days very few of the Physics graduate students were women. In Francis Low's large quantum mechanics class of about a hundred students, for example, she was the only female. She completed her Ph.D. thesis Perturbed Angular Correlations in 1970 supervised by Lee Grodzins. While at MIT she chaired the Graduate Student Council, and was instrumental in initiating an annual review and ranking of faculty members that exists to this day. In 1970 Dr. Carol Travis Alonso graduated with a Ph.D. in Nuclear Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Research  Alonso joined Yale University as a postdoctoral fellow in 1970, working on heavy ion research at the Yale HILAC with John Rasmussen. She also taught basic physics to pre-medical students at Yale. In 1972 she moved to Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to work with Nobel Laureate Glenn T. Seaborg. Their team discovered element 106, which some years later was named seaborgium. Alonso, while attending a conference in Tennessee to present a nuclear hydrodynamics paper, got caught in the middle of a competition between the US and the Soviet Union to first announce the discovery of element 106. At Berkeley they used californium-249 as a target and eventually discovered seaborgium. The new nucleus had a 0.9 second half-life and underwent alpha decay to rutherfordium-259. In 1975 Dr. Alonso became a full staff research physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, doing nuclear research in A-Division. Her career at LLNL spanned many aspects of National Security research and management, from 1975 until her retirement in July 2001. National Security at LLNL includes nuclear defense research and development as well as anti-terrorist and non-proliferation research and analysis, and arms control issues. Alonso began her work at LLNL with research on inertially confined laser fusion and thermonuclear fusion physics. In 1980 she founded and was named manager of Rodeo Program, which studied innovative processes associated with thermonuclear fusion. She became Deputy A-Division Leader for Thermonuclear Design in 1984, with an additional year as Associate Program Leader for X-Ray Laser Design in 1986‚Äì87. During these years Alonso worked with national teams to provide technical input into the policy area of nuclear test thresholds, particularly with regard to arms control issues. She also collaborated on a computer simulation study of ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy atomic nuclei. In 1984-85 Carol collaborated with astronaut Taylor Wang of the Jet Propulsion Lab on a hydrodynamics experiment on space shuttle Challenger. NASA invited her to view the launch of STS-51-B as a VIP on April 29, 1985, at Cape Canaveral. An NBC film crew accompanied Carol on this trip, filming her for a Today Show special on Carol's work at LLNL. This show, with anchor Jane Pauley, was aired prime time on July 16, 1985. From 1982 to 1990 Dr. Alonso served as LLNL Chairman of the Joint US/UK Working Group, set up by federal statute to allow collaboration between the United States and the United Kingdom on certain aspects of nuclear defense. This position entailed frequent liaison trips to Aldermaston and Whitehall in the United Kingdom. During this period Alonso in 1987 co-authored, with George Miller and Paul Brown, the ‚ÄúReport to Congress on Stockpile Reliability, Weapon Remanufacture, and the Role of Nuclear Testing‚Äù in answer to a direct request from Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressmen Aspin, Dicks, Fascell, Markey and Spratt. In September 1990 Alonso was appointed Assistant to the Deputy Director, where she worked on a variety of Laboratory operational and policy administration issues, including chairing several complex incident analysis teams. Subsequently, as Special Assistant in the Director's Office, she served as Laboratory Coordinator for the first University of California Science and Technology Performance Review. In 1994 Alonso was named by the Director as LLNL's point-of-contact to DOE for the White House's National Science and Technology Council, and also as LLNL's policy representative on DOE's federal R&D; database team. In 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, initiating the Gulf War, Alonso chaired Project Desert Orchid, in which LLNL's intellectual resources were tapped to suggest solutions to the conflict's diverse technical problems. Alonso shared a patent on a device to cap burning oil wells. In 1993 she was awarded a medal from Washington, DC, \\"For Outstanding Service to the United States.\\" In 1995 Dr. Alonso was appointed Assistant Associate Director for National Security, a position she held until her retirement from LLNL in July 2001. In this capacity she administered various internal security programs at the Laboratory, chaired numerous DOE technical study teams, wrote several reports associated with stockpile stewardship, and generally managed internal security affairs at the Laboratory. Alonso was Executive Secretary of the LLNL National Security Council, composed of Laboratory Associate Directors. During these tumultuous years of change, the United States engaged in a voluntary test ban that altered the priorities of the Laboratory, inducing it to develop the Stockpile Stewardship Program in which nuclear testing at Nevada Test Site was replaced by very advanced simulation computer codes and high energy density laboratory experiments. During those years Alonso co-authored a historical paper entitled \\"The Road To Zero Yield.\\" In 2001, Alonso retired from the Laboratory after almost 30 years of service to the University of California and the United States Government. Her second career focused on a completely different long-term passion, the art of dressage - that is, the art of dancing horses. She became a horse trainer and competitor. She continues this avocation to this day, with a competition specialty in freestyle to music. In 2009, she won a bronze medal from the United States Dressage Federation. With several horses, competing as an amateur, she has garnered a variety of awards and championships over the years, culminating in an invitation in 2015 to compete a freestyle in the U.S. Dressage Finals at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, KY. In her Finals ride she and her 24-year old Andalusian horse, El Gavilan, were the oldest rider-horse pair among 400 competitors. In 2017 Alonso and El Gavilan qualified for the rare U.S. Century Ride, for which the sum of the ages of horse and rider must exceed 100. This ride took place on May 6, 2017, with much festivity and 70 invited guests. Alonso is on the editorial publication board of The Iberian Horse, the quarterly magazine of the International Andalusian and Lusitano Horse Association. In 2019 she published her first book, Sun Stallion, an historical novel of the Conquest of Peru. This novel was a finalist in the 2018 Blazing Lantern Fiction Contest, winning 3rd place among 123 entries.

Aspects China cabinets are typically placed against a wall, opposite the door or windows. They are often set in a conspicuous place where china, silverware, and glassware can easily be seen by guests and accessed by the host. There is an innumerous number of forms for china cabinets, as sizes, shapes, and construction methods may vary. Traditional china cabinets have shelves lined with silk or velvet, or can have glass shelves. History China cabinets are objects designed to meet a specific need: the collection and display of porcelain dinnerware from the Orient along with other items of interest, a pursuit that gained popularity in the late 17th century. China cabinets were introduced to England in the end of the 17th century, when china collection became popular. William and Mary's reign particularly popularized the furniture and porcelain, as Queen Mary was known for collecting Chinese pottery. Early cabinets were simply designed, often made of walnut. Dutch cabinets began being imported in the late 1600s and early 1700s, and thus English-made cabinets began being influenced by Dutch design.

Lateral violence has been defined as displaced anger, aggression, and hatred toward ones community and self, rather than those who are causing harm. The organization's purpose is to minimize lateral violence caused by colonization and structural oppression.  Origins  Teagyn Vallevand and Auroa Hardy, members of the Kwanlin Dun First Nation of Canada, founded Youth for Lateral Kindness in 2016 from an understanding that ‚ÄúLateral violence is the byproduct of colonization, oppression, intergenerational trauma and the continued experiences of racial discrimination.\\" Vallevand and Hardy were previously part of a group effort called Violence to Kindness(v2k) Project, initiated by the elders of their community. The elders noticed peer-to-peer violence, which they perceived to happen \\"when someone has been made to feel powerless through colonization and trauma, and the easiest way to take power is from those closest to [them].\\" This can also be understood as internalized racism and may manifest as hate within oneself and others and other within one's community. The elders' goal was to alleviate the pain within their community by directing their efforts toward the youth. V2K ended in the summer of 2016 and Vallevand and Hardy saw a continued need for this work, which resulted in their founding of Youth for Lateral Kindness. This organization provides workshops and outreach to educate people about lateral violence and history.  Services  The services offered by Youth for Lateral Kindness include \\"The Blanket Exercise\\" and 'Lateral Violence Workshops.\\" = The Blanket Exercise = As described by Vallevand and Hardy, The Blanket Exercise offers perspective \\"of the first peoples [lives] through pre-contact, treaty- making, colonization, and resistance.\\" According to their website, \\"In this two hour participatory workshop, blankets are laid out on the ground to represent the land; as the exercise progresses, participants gain a visual representation of our history.‚Äù Open to both native and non-native people, The Blanket Exercise broadens awareness about the history of Indigenous people and Canada. Once the exercise is completed there is a gathering of all the participants to process and investigate feelings that arose throughout the experience. = Workshops = The workshops encompass many different group activities and learning opportunities that are centered on and run by indigenous youth. The purpose of the workshops is to \\"really get into the core of why lateral violence exists.\\" The workshops are flexible in duration ranging from 2 hours to full days, and cater to twelve to thirty year olds.

During his term, the pro-slavery judge, who owned slaves himself, wrote the dissenting opinion on several important freedom suits, including Milly v. Smith, Julia v. McKinney and Marguerite v. Choteau. However, he did join in the unanimous finding for the plaintiff in the landmark Rachel v. Walker case. Judge Wash's decision to split up a family of slaves he owned was the impetus for Polly Berry's freedom suit and her daughter's famous memoir.edition=Electronic Early life Wash was born on November 29, 1790, in Louisa County, Virginia. His parents were wealthy enough to send him to William and Mary College. He graduated in 1808, at the age of 18, spent the following two years studying law, and was admitted to the bar. In 1810, he settled in St. Louis in the Louisiana Territory (renamed the Missouri Territory when Louisiana joined the Union) and set up a law practice. Early public service Acting Governor Frederick Bates appointed Wash to the position of Deputy Attorney General of the Louisiana Territory in November 1811. During the War of 1812, Wash served as a lieutenant in Alexander McNair's mounted regiment and then as aide de camp on the staff of Benjamin Howard. Wash traveled with Howard on an expedition up the Mississippi River from St. Louis to Peoria as part of a plan to strike the Fox and Sac Indians campaigning with the British. But, as the bulk of fighting was occurring further east, Howard's soldiers saw few of these warriors. When Missouri gained statehood in 1821 and St. Louis was incorporated, Wash was elected to its first nine-member board of aldermen. During his tenure, Wash worked to promote road structure and related improvements for the city, such as sidewalks and proper road surfacing and grading. He was also active in making upgrades to the harbor and levee. Wash was prescient in his thinking that unless proper dikes were built, the west side of the river channel would eventually be choked with sand bars, a situation that did come to pass. During his first term, President James Monroe appointed Wash U.S. District Attorney for the district of St. Louis. Missouri Supreme Court After the death of Judge Rufus Pettibone, Wash was appointed to the Supreme Court of Missouri. Taking his seat in September 1825, Judge Wash performed his duties until his resignation in May 1837. At the time, the state supreme court consisted of only three members. The head of the court was, and is, known by the honorific \\"Justice,\\" the others by the title \\"Judge.\\" A number of notable cases were decided during Judge Wash's term. Many of these were suits in which slaves petitioned for their freedom. At the end of 1824, the Missouri General Assembly passed a law providing a process for enslaved persons to sue for freedom and have some protections in the process. The years between 1824 and 1844 are considered the \\"golden age\\" of freedom suits since many slaves won their freedom in these years. Following the Dred Scott decision, in which the \\"once free, always free\\" precedent was overturned, very few slaves pressed successful suits. The following are important cases heard by Judge Wash. =Milly v. Smith (1829)= In 1826, bankrupt, elderly miller David Shipman's creditors seized and sold two of his slaves to satisfy a portion of his debt. Faced with further foreclosure, the Kentucky resident asked his adult nephew, Stephen Smith, to provide security for him. Shipman deeded him the mortgage on his land and other property, then fled to Indiana with his remaining seven slaves. In Jefferson County, he signed manumission papers for them, effectively freeing Milly, her three children and two young men. The entire group continued on to Illinois where they took up residence in a Quaker community. Shipman told his new neighbors the black persons in his household were free. They later testified the former slaves were permitted to come and go as they pleased. Meanwhile, Stephen Smith was unhappy with his uncle's departure and his obligation to settle Shipman's debt. Having plans himself to resettle in St. Louis, Smith hoped to discover his uncle's whereabouts and recover the slaves as ‚Äúportable wealth.‚Äù Catching up with Shipman in Illinois, Smith confronted his uncle, who acknowledged his debt, noting that he had left sufficient property in Kentucky to satisfy any foreclosure. Smith, however, wanted the slaves. In early 1827, he kidnapped five of the individuals and relocated them to St. Louis. Members of the Quaker community pursued Smith and reseized the group, intending to return them to Illinois. In the resulting dispute, the five freed people pressed suit to re-establish their freedom from Smith in the Circuit Court of St. Louis. Milly and her children spent much of the next five years in jail as the freedom suits moved through the courts. In late March 1828, when the combined cases came to trial, the jury found in Smith's favor. Two appeals reached the Missouri Supreme Court. In the final decision, Milly was freed. The court was split 2-1 with Judge Wash in the minority. Writing for majority, Justice McGirk stated: ‚Äú[T]he question submitted to us is, whether Milly is by law entitled to her freedom? When we only look to the facts in this case, we see on one side a man largely indebted, hiding his property, and in fact destroying it, to prevent his creditors from reaping any benefit there from, and in this case, Shipman has been base enough to emancipate the slave to injure and ruin his security. We feel disposed to view him in a light but little below that of a felon. But there are two sides to every question; here is also the case of a person claiming the benefit of the ordinance of Congress of 1787, for the government of the Northwestern Territory, which declares, that in that country there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude.‚Äù In his dissent, Wash asserted that ‚Äúthe mortgagee is the legal owner. Various authorities have been cited on both sides for and against the position. Most clearly the mortgagor is not the full owner, he is at most but the qualified owner. In this case Shipman was the qualified owner for specific purposes, and had no right to emancipate the plaintiff in Kentucky or elsewhere; indeed, it seems to be conceded on all hands, that Shipman could not have emancipated Milly by his express deed, and why give indirect and fraudulent efforts and implied assent for effect than his deed could have? I incline to consider the plaintiff in the light of a purchaser from Shipman, with a full knowledge of Smith‚Äôs lien.‚Äù =Julia v. McKinney (1833)= In Julia v. McKinney, the Supreme Court of Missouri was faced with the decision of whether it should declare a slave free based on the laws of a free territory or state. Lucinda Carrington, the owner of a slave named Julia, lived in Kentucky. When Carrington announced her plan to move to Illinois with Julia, a neighbor warned her ‚Äúthat if she took [Julia] there she would be free.‚Äù In an attempt to evade the law, Carrington arrived in Pike County, Illinois with the slave, but asserted her intentions to hire Julia out in Missouri. For a month, Julia stayed with Carrington in Pike County, then was hired out 30 miles away in Louisiana, Missouri. When Julia fell ill, Carrington had her return to Illinois. When she recovered, Carrington sent her to St. Louis, where she was sold to S. McKinney. Julia sued for her freedom in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, naming her new owner as defendant. She contended that she and Carrington had lived in Illinois from late October to early December 1829. To Julia's disadvantage, the court's instructions to the jury centered on Carrington's intent, rather than her actions. If they believed Julia ‚Äúwas taken into the State of Illinois by her owner without any intention on the part of such owner to make that State the residence of Julia, that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action.‚Äù The jury returned a verdict against Julia, who appealed to the Supreme Court of Missouri. The upper court found in Julia's favor, dividing 2-1 with Judge Wash dissenting. Writing for the majority, Justice McGirk opined that the 6th article of the State of Illinois' constitution supported Julia's claim and declared that slavery would not be introduced into the state ‚Äì \\"any violation of this article shall effect the emancipation of such person.‚Äù To distinguish individuals passing through the state from those residing there, he continued, \\"We are of opinion that it is the undoubted right of every citizen of the United States to pass freely through every other State with his property of every description, including negro slaves, without being in any way subject to forfeit his property for having done so, provided he does not subject his property by a residence to the action of the laws of the State in which he may so reside.‚Äù \\"In the case before us the owner of the slave was not an emigrant, but went into Illinois with an avowed view to make that State her home. She took up her residence there, with her slave in her possession, and kept the slave there for upwards of one month, and treated the slave in all respects as slaves are treated in States where slavery is allowed. These acts of the owner surely amounted to the introduction of slavery in Illinois.‚Äù Judge Wash agreed that the lower court's jury instructions had been given in error, but insisted that intent was an essential element of residence. ‚ÄúA bare removal into the State can form no ground on which to set up the claim; especially when it is shown that the removal is not made with a view to residence. The intention of the owner as previously declared, is the only evidence that can exist in such a case...The intention with which a thing is done gives color and character to almost every trans[ac]tion.‚Äù =Marguerite v. Choteau (1834)= Marguerite v. Choteau was one the last of several related freedom suits begun in about 1805 with a petition from a slave named Catiche. The granddaughter of a Natchez Indian woman, Catiche was nominally-owned by a member of St. Louis' founding family, the Choteaus. A territorial court found in Jean-Pierre Choteau, Sr.'s favor. The decision was then reversed by the Circuit Court of St. Louis. As Catiche's action moved forward, her sister Marguerite also sued Choteau for her freedom. The 1826 case hinged on the plaintiff's skin color, and whether she was red or black. Another important factor was whether the slave status of an Indian claimant, who had survived the transfer of Louisiana to Spain, continued under Spanish rule and remained under U.S. law. Enslavement of blacks was authorized under both French and Spanish law, whereas Indians were deemed free under the latter. The circuit court found for Choteau, leading to an appeal before the Missouri Supreme Court. On appeal, the lower court verdict held as the court split evenly with Judge Tompkins siding with the plaintiff, Judge Wash against, and Justice McGirk not sitting. With the agreement of all parties, the appeal was heard again in front of the full court. This time, McGirk and Tompkins found for Marguerite, on the basis the circuit court had erred in jury instruction, and ordered a new trial. In his dissent, Judge Wash asserted that regardless of territorial transfer, the rights of the owners of Indian slaves \\"are secured and protected as well by the law of nations as by the express stipulations of the cession to the United States.\\" The new trial was set for St. Charles County, but was transferred to Jefferson County, where after two trials, Marguerite was set free. The Supreme Court of Missouri reaffirmed the finding. The case is considered an official end to Indian slavery in Missouri. =Rachel v. Walker (1834)= This freedom suit by an enslaved woman of color hinged on the question of whether or not a slave was forfeited if taken into territory where slavery was prohibited. Rachel's claim was based on a legal clause from a decade earlier that allowed slaves to petition for freedom based on their status as \\"poor people\\" with \\"limited rights and privileges.\\" Rachel had accompanied her master Lt. Thomas Stockton to Fort Snelling and Fort Crawford, both of which lay in Michigan Territory where the officer was stationed. As mandated by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, slavery was outlawed in the region northwest of the Ohio River. At Fort Crawford, Rachel gave birth to a son, James Henry. Stockton later sold the pair to William Walker of St. Louis. Rachel sued Walker for her liberty in 1834, saying she had lived in a free territory and according to the ‚Äúonce free, always free‚Äù precedent, was no longer a slave. The St. Louis Circuit Court found against Rachel, asserting that Stockton had no say in where he lived since that was decided by the Army. It was not his choice to take Rachel to a free territory, they reasoned, so she had no claim to freedom. Rachel appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court in 1836. In a unanimous decision, the judges agreed with her claim. Speaking for the full court, Judge McGirk declared, Stockton's ‚Äúvoluntary act [was] done without any other reason than that of convenience,‚Äù not necessity... ‚Äúand those claiming under him must be holden to abide the consequences of introducing slavery both in Missouri territory and Michigan, contrary to law. The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed.‚Äù The ruling in Rachel v. Walker was referenced as a precedent in the Dred Scott trials. Polly Wash v. Joseph M. Magehan (1839) St. Louis Circuit Court Summons for Robert Wash in the case Polly Wash v. Joseph M. Magehan Judge Wash had retired from the bench when Wash v. Magehan was heard; however, he had provided the impetus for Polly's freedom suit and his testimony was critical to her daughter's successful petition. According to the case files, Polly Wash aka Polly Berry aka Polly Crockett was born into slavery in about 1805 in Wayne County, Kentucky. When she was seven or eight, she was sold to Joseph Crockett. On his trek westward, Crockett took then 14 year-old Polly to the free state of Illinois where he hired her out as a house servant. Crockett's son pressed him to continue on his journey to Missouri, lest his lingering in Illinois would entitle Polly to freedom. William Crockett alternately suggested she could be shuttled in and out of Missouri so as not to meet the residence threshold that would free her. When Joseph refused, William took her there himself. Polly's daughter Lucy's account differs greatly from that presented in the files. In her memoir, Delaney wrote that her mother was born free and later forcefully carried away. ‚ÄúPolly, with four other colored persons, were kidnapped, and, after being securely bound and gagged, were put into a skiff and carried across the Mississippi River to the city of St. Louis. Polly was next purchased by a farmer, Thomas Botts, with whom she stayed for a year. When he fell into debt, he sold all of his property, including his slaves. Both narratives agree on the subsequent events. Major Taylor Berry bought Polly as a servant girl for his wife. While residing with the Berrys, Polly met a mulatto slave whom she married with their consent. Polly bore two children, Nancy and Lucy. When Major Berry died in a duel, his widow married Judge Robert Wash. Mrs. Wash fell ill and died. ‚ÄúAfter Mrs. Wash's death,‚Äù wrote Lucy, ‚Äú the troubles of my parents and their children may be said to have really commenced. Though in direct opposition to the will of Major Berry, my father's quondam master and friend, Judge Wash tore my father from his wife and children and sold him 'way down South!‚Äô\\" Polly ended up as the property of slave trader Joseph Magehan. In 1839, she sued Magehan for freedom and $500 in damages to pay for her time as a slave in the free state of Illinois. Four years later, in the St. Louis Circuit Court, Polly Wash won her liberty and a single dollar in damages. By law, a slave's residence in a free state conferred freedom. According to the doctrine \\"once free, always free,\\" that liberty was permanent. The successful conclusion of Polly's suit did not automatically free her daughter, who was jailed for 17 months as Polly's trial progressed. In her initial petition, Polly had failed to mention her children, a fact opponents seized on to negate their relationship. In February 1844, Lucy's trial began. Judge Wash was a star witness in Lucy's case. He testified that, \\"the defendant, Lucy A. Berry was a mere infant when he came in possession of Mrs. Fannie Berry's estate, and that he often saw the child in the care of its reputed mother Polly, and to his best knowledge and belief, he thought Lucy A. Berry was Polly's child.\\" Harry Douglas, a former overseer on Wash's farm, corroborated the statement. In his closing argument, Judge Edward Bates, the attorney pleading Lucy's case, said, \\"Gentlemen of the jury, here I rest this case as I would not want any better evidence for one of my own children. The testimony of Judge Wash is alone sufficient to substantiate the claim of Polly Crockett Berry to the defendant a being her own child.\\" The case was submitted to the jury, which decided in Lucy's favor. Personal life Judge Wash married twice. His first wife Frances Christy Berry, the daughter of Major William Christy, bore him a daughter, Frances. His second wife, Eliza Catherine Lewis Taylor, the daughter of Colonel Nathaniel P. Taylor, bore him four sons: Robert, William, Clark and Pendleton, and five daughters: Elizabeth, Virginia, Julia, Medora and Edmonia. Wash was an Episcopalian who served on the vestry of Christ Church. He was also an indefatigable booster for the City of St. Louis, foreseeing a great future for the municipality. As soon as he was financially able, he began buying real estate. The properties laid the foundation for a considerable fortune, which enjoyed throughout his life. In May 1818, Judge Wash was part of a group entering into an agreement to build a theater. A lot on Chestnut St. was purchased for the purpose and a foundation was constructed. But when funds ran out, the project was abandoned. A wood-frame livery stable took over the site. Wash's colleagues noted he had a passion for hunting and kept a pack of hounds. One anecdote puts Wash on the bench when \\"an attorney who understood the judge's proclivity for sports of the field whispered to him that they had started three [foxes] at one time in the neighborhood of the judge's residence. He was immediately taken with severe cramps in the stomach, which rendered an adjournment of the court necessary. Within an hour he was in his saddle, following closely upon the heels of the hounds. These sudden attacks were of frequent occurrence...\\" After retiring from the court, Wash lived among family and friends at his St. Louis home for the rest of his life. He died on November 30, 1856. Wash is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery.

From 2018 to 2020, she served as minister of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare after the resignation of Carmen Mont√≥n. Previously, she also served as the first High Commissioner for the Fight against Child Poverty from June to September 2018, a position within the Office of the Prime Minister. In 2004, Carcedo was elected for the first time to represent Asturias in the Congress of Deputies. She was re-elected two more times, in 2008 and 2011. In 2015, she ran for a seat at the Senate, a seat that she got. She resigned from the Senate in 2018 when she was appointed High Commissioner and was elected again for Congress in 2019. Biography Carcedo has a degree in medicine and surgery from the University of Oviedo and a diploma in business medicine. She began her professional activity in Primary Health Care from 1978 to 1984, and since 1995 she has been working at the Natahoyo Health Center in Gij√≥n. =Political career= Related to the Socialist Party since young ages, she started to assume public offices in 1984 as director of the local health centres of the Nalon Valley an office where she worked until 1988 when she was appointed Regional Director of Public Health of the Regional Government of Asturias. In the regional elections of 1991 she was elected MP. Between 1991 and 1995 she was the Regional Minister of Environment and Town Planning. She was elected MP again in the regional elections of 1995, 1999 and 2003. Moreover, she was the spokesperson of the PSOE in the Parliament of Asturias between 1999 and 2003. It was expected she to continue as spokesperson in the period of 2003-2007 but she resigned in 2003 to participate in the 2004 general election where she was elected MP of the Spanish Parliament. She revalidated its seat in the 2008 general election but she resigned after the Public Administrations Minister, Elena Salgado, offered her to be the President of the Evaluation and Quality Agency, an office that she accepted and occupied until the 2011 general election, revalidating its seat again but losing the office of President of the Agency after the change of government. After the 2014 Extraordinary Congress of the Socialist Party she became member of the Federal Executive Committee (executive body of the party) as Secretary of Social Welfare, renouncing the Secretary of Economy, Employment and Sustainability that until then she held in the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party Federation of Asturias. In September 2015, she was appointed Senator by the Parliament of Asturias, renouncing to her seat at Congress and she was also appointed Secretary-General of the Socialist Party in Senate. She was appointed senator again after the 2015 general election and the 2016 general election. In February 2016, she was one of the chosen by the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Pedro S√°nchez to negotiate with other parliamentary groups in an effort to make a new government.

As well as Mont√≥n, Carcedo take a tough position over homeopathy and other pseudosciences saying that one of her main compromises is ¬´to fight against pseudosciences, and homeopathy is one of them¬ª. A few days after that affirmation, the Health Ministry ordered the withdrawal of thousands of homeopathic products from market, something that hundreds of scientists had asked a few months earlier. Continuing with this position, Minister Carcedo wants to stop the ¬´intrusiveness of the pseudosciences in the health assistance¬ª by forbidding by law the use of this products in ¬´prioritarian¬ª health centres. This would be done in coordination with the Ministry of Science and the Regional Health Departments. Other objective that Carcedo has is to continue with the objectives marked in her previous job as High Commissioner for the Fight against Child Poverty saying that her and her team aim was to finish with ¬´child poverty, that they [childs] can live with their families without having to worry if they are going to have enough resources for the most basic¬ª.

This framework aims at designing highly- parallelized algorithms for various balanced binary search trees. The algorithmic framework is based on a single operation join. Under this framework, the join operation captures all balancing criteria of different balancing schemes, and all other functions join have generic implementation across different balancing schemes. The join-based algorithms can be applied to at least four balancing schemes: AVL trees, red-black trees, weight- balanced trees and treaps. The join(L,k,R) operation takes as input two binary balanced trees L and R of the same balancing scheme, and a key k, and outputs a new balanced binary tree t whose in-order traversal is the in-order traversal of L, then k then the in-order traversal of R. In particular, if the trees are search trees, which means that the in-order of the trees maintain a total ordering on keys, it must satisfy the condition that all keys in L are smaller than k and all keys in R are greater than k. History The join operation was first defined by Tarjan on red-black trees, which runs in worst-case logarithmic time. Later Sleator and Tarjan described a join algorithm for splay trees which runs in amortized logarithmic time. Later Adams . extended join to weight-balanced trees and used it for fast set-set functions including union, intersection and set difference. In 1998, Blelloch and Reid-Miller extended join on treaps, and proved the bound of the set functions to be O(mlog (1+frac{n}{m})) for two trees of size m and n(ge m), which is optimal in the comparison model. They also brought up parallelism in Adams' algorithm by using a divide-and-conquer scheme. In 2016, Blelloch et al. formally proposed the join-based algorithms, and formalized the join algorithm for four different balancing schemes: AVL trees, red-black trees, weight-balanced trees and treaps. In the same work they proved that Adams' algorithms on union, intersection and difference are work-optimal on all the four balancing schemes. Join algorithms The function join(t_1,k,t_2) considers rebalancing the tree, and thus depends on the input balancing scheme. If the two trees are balanced, join simply creates a new node with left subtree , root and right subtree . Suppose that is heavier (this \\"heavier\\" depends on the balancing scheme) than (the other case is symmetric). Join follows the right spine of until a node which is balanced with . At this point a new node with left child , root and right child is created to replace c. The new node may invalidate the balancing invariant. This can be fixed with rotations. The following is the join algorithms on different balancing schemes. The join algorithm for AVL trees: function joinRightAVL(TL, k, TR) (l, k', c) = expose(TL) if (h(c) <= h(TR) + 1) T'=Node(c, k, TR) if (h(T') <= h(l) + 1) then return Node(l, k', T') else return rotateLeft(Node(l, k', rotateRight(T'))) else T' = joinRightAVL(c, k, TR) T = Node(l, k', T') if (h(T') <= h(l) + 1) return T'' else return rotateLeft(T) function joinLeftAVL(TL, k, TR) /* symmetric to joinRightAVL */ function join(TL, k, TR) if (h(TL) > h(TR) + 1) return joinRightAVL(TL, k, TR) if (h(TR) > h(TL) + 1) return joinLeftAVL(TL, k, TR) return Node(TL, k, TR) Here h(v) of a node v the height of v. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node v's left child l, the key of the node k, and the right child r. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child l, key k, and right child r. The join algorithm for red- black trees: function joinRightRB(TL, k, TR) if r(TL) = ‚åär(TL)/2‚åã √ó 2: return Node(TL, ‚ü®k, red‚ü©, TR) else (L', ‚ü®k', c'‚ü©, R') = expose(TL) T' = Node(L', ‚ü®k', c'‚ü©, joinRightRB(R', k, TR) if (c' = black) and (T'.right.color = T'.right.right.color = red): T'.right.right.color = black return rotateLeft(T') else return T' function joinLeftRB(TL, k, TR) /* symmetric to joinRightRB */ function join(TL, k, TR) if ‚åär(TL)/2‚åã > ‚åär(TR)/2‚åã √ó 2: T' = joinRightRB(TL, k, TR) if (T'.color = red) and (T'.right.color = red): T'.color = black return T' else if ‚åär(TL)/2‚åã > ‚åär(TL)/2‚åã √ó 2 /* symmetric */ else if (TL.color = black) and (TR = black) Node(TL, ‚ü®k, red‚ü©, TR) else Node(TL, ‚ü®k, black‚ü©, TR) Here r(v) of a node v means twice the black height of a black node, and the twice the black height of a red node. expose(v)=(l,‚ü®k,c‚ü©,r) means to extract a tree node v's left child l, the key of the node k, the color of the node c and the right child r. Node(l,‚ü®k,c‚ü©,r) means to create a node of left child l, key k, color c and right child r. The join algorithm for weight-balanced trees: function joinRightWB(TL, k, TR) (l, k', c)=expose(TL) if balance(TL, TL) return Node(TL,k,TR) else T' = joinRightWB(c, k, TR) (l1, k1, r1) = expose(T') if (balance(l, T')) return Node(l, k', T') else if (balance(l, l1) and balance(l+l1, r1)) return rotateLeft(Node(l, k', T')) else return rotateLeft(Node(l, k', rotateRight(T')) function joinLeftWB(TL, k, TR) /* symmetric to joinRightWB */ function join(TL, k, TR) if (heavy(TL, TR)) return joinRightWB(TL, k, TR) if (heavy(TR, TL)) return joinLeftWB(TL, k, TR) Node(TL, k, TR) Here balance(x,y) means two weights x and y are balanced. expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node v's left child l, the key of the node k and the right child r. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child l, key k and right child r. Join-based algorithms In the following, expose(v)=(l,k,r) means to extract a tree node v's left child l, the key of the node k and the right child r. Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child l, key k and right child r. right(v) and left(v) extracts the right child and the left child of a tree nodev, respectively. k(v) extract the key of a node v. Many of the join-based algorithms are parallel. \\"s_1  s_2\\" means that two statements s_1 and s_2 can run in parallel. =Split= To split a tree into two trees, those smaller than key x, and those larger than key x, we first draw a path from the root by inserting x into the tree. After this insertion, all values less than x will be found on the left of the path, and all values greater than x will be found on the right. By applying Join, all the subtrees on the left side are merged bottom-up using keys on the path as intermediate nodes from bottom to top to form the left tree, and the right part is asymmetric. For some applications, Split also returns a boolean value denoting if x appears in the tree. The cost of Split is O(log n), order of the height of the tree. The split algorithm is as follows: function split(T,k) if (T=nil) return (nil,false,nil) (L,m,R)=expose(T) if (k=m) return (L,true,R) if (km) (L',b,R')=split(R,k) return (join(L,m,L'),b,R')) =Join2= This function is defined similarly as join but without the middle key. It first splits out the last key k of the left tree, and then join the rest part of the left tree with the right tree with k. The algorithm is as follows: function splitLast(T) (L,k,R)=expose(T) if (R=nil) return (L,k) (T',k')=splitLast(R) return (join(L,k,T'),k') function join2(L,R) if (L=nil) return R (L',k)=splitLast(L) return join(L',k,R) The cost is O(log n) for a tree of size n. =Insert and delete= The insertion and deletion algorithms, when making use of join can be independent of balancing schemes. For an insertion, the algorithm compares the key to be inserted with the key in the root, inserts it to the left/right subtree if the key is smaller/greater than the key in the root, and joins the two subtrees back with the root. A deletion compares the key to be deleted with the key in the root. If they are equal, return join2 on the two subtrees. Otherwise, delete the key from the corresponding subtree, and join the two subtrees back with the root. The algorithms are as follows: function insert(T,k) if (T=nil) return Node(nil,k,nil) (L,k',R)=expose(T) if (kk') return join(L,k',insert(R,k)) return T function delete(T,k) if (T=nil) return nil (L,k',R)=expose(T) if (kk') return join(L,k',delete(R,k)) return join2(L,R) Both insertion and deletion requires O(log n) time if T=n. =Set‚Äìset functions= Several set operations have been defined on weight-balanced trees: union, intersection and set difference. The union of two weight- balanced trees and representing sets and , is a tree that represents . The following recursive function computes this union: function union(t1, t2): if t1 = nil: return t2 if t2 = nil: return t1 (t<, b, t>) = split t2 on t1.root nl = union(left(t1), t<)  nr = union(right(t1), t>) return join(nl, t1.root, nr) Similarly, the algorithms of intersection and set-difference are as follows: function intersection(t1, t2): if (t1 = nil or t2 = nil) return nil (t<, b, t>) = split t2 on t1.root nl = intersection(left(t1), t<)  nr = intersection(right(t1), t>) if (b) return join(nl, t1.root, nr) else return join2(nl, nr) function difference(t1, t2): if (t1 = nil) return nil if (t2 = nil) return t1 (t<, b, t>) = split t2 on t1.root nl = difference(left(t1), t<)  nr = difference(right(t1), t>) return join2(nl, nr) The complexity of each of union, intersection and difference is Oleft(m log left({nover m}+1right)right) for two weight-balanced trees of sizes m and n(ge m). This complexity is optimal in terms of the number of comparisons. More importantly, since the recursive calls to union, intersection or difference are independent of each other, they can be executed in parallel with a parallel depth O(log mlog n). When m=1, the join-based implementation applies the same computation as in a single-element insertion or deletion if the root of the larger tree is used to split the smaller tree. =Build= The algorithm for building a tree can make use of the union algorithm, and use the divide-and-conquer scheme: function build(A[], n): if (n=0) return nil if (n=1) return Node(nil,A[0],nil) L = build(A,n/2)  R = (A+n/2, n-n/2) return union(L,R) This algorithm costs O(nlog n) work and has O(log^3 n) depth. A more-efficient algorithm makes use of a parallel sorting algorithm. function buildSorted(A[], n): if (n=0) return nil if (n=1) return Node(nil,A[0],nil) L = build(A,n/2)  R = (A+n/2+1, n-n/2-1) return join(L,A[n/2],R) function build(A[], n): A'=sort(A,n) return buildSorted(A,n) This algorithm costs O(nlog n) work and has O(log n) depth assuming the sorting algorithm has O(nlog n) work and O(log n) depth. =Filter= This function selects all entries in a tree satisfying an indicator f, and return a tree containing all selected entries. It recursively filters the two subtrees, and join them with the root if the root satisfies f, otherwise join2 the two subtrees. function filter(T,f): if (T=nil) return nil L = filter(left(T),f)  R = (right(T),f) if (f(k(T)) return join(L,k(T),R) else return join2(L,R) This algorithm costs work O(n) and depth O(log n) on a tree of size n, assuming f has constant cost. Used in libraries The join-based algorithms are applied to support interface for sets, maps, and augmented maps in libarays such as Hackage, SML/NJ, and PAM.

He was briefly Acting Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1989 during the transition from the Reagan to the Bush administrations.  Early life and education  Dorsey was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on February 6, 1943. He graduated from Stanford University with a BA in 1965, and from the University of Missouri with a JD in 1968 and an LLM in 1973.  Legal and political career  Dorsey worked as the Legal Aid and Defender Society of Greater Kansas City as an assistant director, managing attorney, and staff attorney, from 1969 to 1973. In 1973, he began working for a year as Assistant Attorney General of Missouri, under John Danforth. In 1974, he became a partner at the law firm of Stinson, Mag & Fizzell in Kansas City, Missouri. In May 1986, Dorsey was nominated by Ronald Reagan to serve as Assistant Secretary of Public and Indian Housing at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in place of Warren T. Lindquist who had resigned. Dorsey was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by voice vote on August 2, 1986. During his time as Assistant Secretary, he described housing vouchers as \\"the centerpiece of the Reagan housing program\\" to the Chicago Tribune. In January 1987, Dorsey was nominated as General Counsel of HUD, to succeed John J. Knapp. He was confirmed in the Senate by voice vote on March 12, 1987. As General Counsel, Dorsey formed part of the selection committee for public money for housing, alongside Thomas Demery and Carl Covitz. The committee was the subject of controversy when a federal audit released in 1989 said that most of the money approved by it went to developers with HUD connections. It said that Dorsey and Covitz typically agreed to suggestions that Demery made. He briefly served as Acting Secretary of HUD in 1989, before Jack Kemp became Secretary. On July 13, 1989, Frank Keating was confirmed as General Counsel, succeeding Dorsey. On July 13, 1990, Joseph G. Schiff was confirmed as Assistant Secretary in place of Dorsey. Dorsey became Administrative Counsel of the newly-formed Office of the Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives when it was formed in 1995. His tenure lasted from January 1, 1995 to February 14, 2003. During some of that time he served as Acting Associate Administrator. Dorsey became Chief of Administrative Services of the newly-founded United States Department of Homeland Security on February 15, 2003, serving until June 11, 2004. In this role, he was subordinate to the Under Secretary for Management, Janet Hale.  Personal life and retirement  Dorsey is married and had two children.

M√°xima Apaza highlighted the decolonizing character and the gender perspective in the policies implemented by the Government led by Evo Morales. But, simultaneously, she recognized the need for a collective work and from the bases to end against the patriarchy: \\"If in a home we put into practice decolonization, assuming men and women the roles and functions of the home, is a contribution in this historical juncture we are living\\". Apaza is an advocate for safe abortions. She has worked with Ipas for years to educate people on the preventable public health problem of unsafe abortion, which tends to greatly affect rural, indigenous women. Prior to her work in Bolivia, abortions were only accessible in cases of rape. Furthermore, women were dying as a result of unsafe abortions. Though restrictions on these abortions still exist, Apaza has contributed to women being able to have access to safe and effective abortions. Pregnant women with serious health conditions, financial limitations, and who are minors or adolescents are now among those who are able to access safe abortions. Apaza's stance on the reform of the penal code regarding abortions is as follows: \\"We cannot turn a blind eye to this reality. With the reform of the penal code, for the first time women will be able to decide over their own bodies and that decision must be respected.\\" Has collected international accessions for the exit to the sea of Bolivia: Suddenly the brothers from different countries manifest themselves: ¬´Mar for Bolivia!¬ª.

The world is aware that Bolivia lives in an enclosure that harms it, we do not have access to the sea and that hurts our economy, harms the economy of the region.

The CEO and co-chairman of Warner Records (formerly Warner Bros. Records), he was previously the president of A&R; at Interscope Geffen A&M; and the senior vice president of A&R; at Atlantic Records. Early life and education Bay-Schuck was born in Los Angeles to actors Susan Bay and John Schuck. His parents divorced when he was a child, and in 1989 his mother married Leonard Nimoy. Bay-Schuck attended Columbia University, where he majored in political science. He planned to attend law school and pursue a career in entertainment law. In his senior year, he met a video promotion executive from Capitol Records and had a conversation with her about how record companies operate. The next day he applied for an internship at Interscope Records. He was hired, and although he interned in the video promotion department, he became interested in A&R.; He graduated from Columbia in 2003. Career Bay-Schuck returned to Los Angeles following his college graduation. Knowing that jobs at record companies had become scarce as the music industry constricted in the post-Napster era, he registered at an employment agency that placed temps at labels. He was assigned a short-term job at Interscope, and was quickly hired as a full-time assistant to Martin Kierszenbaum, then the head of international marketing for the label. Determined to work in A&R;, he left Interscope a year later to take a job as an A&R; assistant at Atlantic. In 2006, he was promoted to a staff A&R; position. His first hits in an A&R; capacity were with the songs \\"Shawty\\" by Plies featuring T-Pain, and \\"Right Round\\" by Flo Rida featuring Kesha. Bay- Schuck co-wrote \\"Right Round,\\" which went five times platinum in the US and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. Over the course of his ten years at Atlantic, Bay-Schuck worked with Cee Lo Green, B.o.B., T.I., Trey Songz, Travie McCoy, and Trick Daddy, among others. Most notably, he discovered, signed and developed Bruno Mars, who has since sold more than 170 million singles and 26 million albums worldwide. Following his success with Mars, Bay- Schuck, who had originally focused on rap and R&B;, worked with artists of all genres. He was appointed senior vice president of A&R; for Atlantic in 2012. In 2014, Bay-Schuck was named president of A&R; at Interscope Geffen A&M; (IGA). At IGA he worked with artists including Gwen Stefani, Imagine Dragons, Lady Gaga, Maroon 5, One Republic, and Selena Gomez. In October 2017, it was announced that Bay-Schuck had been appointed CEO and co-chairman of Warner Records. He assumed the position in October 2018, when his contract with Interscope expired.

The web series was announced on September 11, 2018, through Dawson's Twitter account. A trailer and an extended trailer for the series was posted on his YouTube channel on September 11, 2018 and September 21, 2018, respectively. The series premiered on September 25, 2018 and concluded after eight episodes on October 18, 2018. The series is presented by Dawson, who investigates the world and mind of controversial fellow YouTuber Jake Paul as well as the psychology of YouTubers. The series is edited by Dawson and cameraman Andrew Siwicki and produced by Jessica Buttafuoco. The series has over 120 million views in total. It follows Dawson's previous series, The Secret World of Jeffree Star, and is similar in format. Conspiracy Series with Shane Dawson‚Å†‚Å†‚ÄîDawson's following project‚Äîwas released in this same formatting similarity. The Mind of Jake Paul generally received mixed reviews. Criticism of The Mind of Jake Paul was directed toward the second video, \\"The Dark Side of Jake Paul,\\" as negative reviews argued he attempted to diagnose Paul with a mental illness.  Background  Before production of The Mind of Jake Paul started, Dawson thought about making a video \\"...about the idea that YouTubers have to have some kind of personality disorder.\\" The project started with a series of tweets from Paul and Dawson wherein they agreed they would collaborate. Dawson also told Paul the purpose of the series was to investigate if he was a sociopath, before the trailer was published.  Synopsis  The first four episodes in The Mind of Jake Paul are referred to as the \\"research phase\\" by Dawson. In the first episode, \\"The Mind of Jake Paul,\\" Dawson states that the purpose of The Mind of Jake Paul is to investigate Jake Paul's psychology. Dawson investigates multiple allegations related to Jake Paul's behavior. Namely, Dawson discusses, with fellow YouTuber iNabber, allegations of fake relationships in Paul's videos and assault allegations related to Paul's former relationship with Alissa Violet. In the second episode, Dawson interviews therapist Kati Morton and discusses Jake Paul's psychology; notably, he investigates if Jake Paul is a sociopath. As an introduction to the video, one of Jake Paul's vlogs are shown, showing him doing a \\"buried alive prank\\" with Team 10 member Tessa Brooks. Morton compares sociopaths to narcissists, and states \\"they have no empathy.\\" In the third video, Dawson addresses controversy surrounding the previous video and discusses Logan Paul's response to the first two videos. The third video also discusses Jake Paul's family and criticism of his parents. Concluding the \\"research phase\\" in the fourth video, Dawson interviews Nick Crompton, a former member of Team 10. Crompton states the group still had the purpose of functioning as a business. Dawson discusses Alissa Violet's relationship with both Jake Paul and Logan Paul in the fourth episode, and Crompton also states that all pranks presented in Team 10 videos are fake. Jake Paul first makes an appearance in \\"The World of Jake Paul\\". Kati Morton enters the Team 10 house disguised as a producer. Paul and his former girlfriend, Erika Costell, are interviewed by Dawson. Dawson compares himself to Jake Paul‚Äîthey especially relate when comparing their childhoods. Morton says she \\"feels bad\\" for Paul and also stated she was suspicious about Paul. The penultimate video goes into further detail about Alissa Violet, Jake Paul, and Logan Paul. Violet confirms allegations that she had a relationship with Logan Paul. However, she also states her public relationship with Jake Paul was fake. She also called Jake Paul an \\"emotional abuser.\\" The series finale of The Mind of Jake Paul discusses Jake's thoughts about his videos and his personal life.  Cast  * Shane Dawson: The host and creator of the series. He visits Jake Paul and documents his life: present and past. * Jake Paul: He is the subject of the series, where his past and present are talked about. * Alissa Violet: Paul's ex-girlfriend and former Team 10 member. * Erika Costell: Paul's then- girlfriend, current COO and member of Team 10. * Kati Morton: A licensed marriage and family therapist who analyzes Paul in an attempt to determine if he is a sociopath. * Nick Crompton: A former friend of Paul and former COO of Team 10. * Andrew Siwicki: The co-director, co-editor, and cameraman of the series. * Fraser Macdonald (iNabber): A fellow Youtuber that provides Dawson with general information on Jake Paul's online life. * Daniel \\"Keemstar\\" Keem: An online news reporter of drama and controversies surrounding other YouTube personalities. * Ryland Adams: Dawson's fianc√© (then boyfriend). * Morgan Adams: Ryland's sister and a former fan of the Paul Brothers.  Episodes   Reception  The Mind of Jake Paul generally received mixed reviews. Patricia Hernandez, writing for The Verge, called Dawson the \\"king of YouTube,\\" yet acknowledged the backlash after \\"The Dark Side of Jake Paul\\" was published. Steven Asarch of Newsweek also acknowledged the backlash, but nevertheless concluded that, by the end of the series, most thought that Paul wasn't \\"just a crazy 'sociopath' who screams at babies and plugs his merchandise for most of his videos.\\" Becky Freeth, writing for Metro, also noted most reacted positively to Jake Paul after the series. CJ Feist, writing for Bradley University's The Bradley Scout, noted that while some criticized the second episode for seemingly trying to diagnose Jake Paul without his knowledge, no matter what, \\"it is an interesting watch and certainly exciting to experience.\\" Julia Alexander, writing for Polygon, applauded Dawson for making the series feel like \\"it‚Äôs unfolding in real time.\\" Negative reviews mostly criticized the second episode of The Mind of Jake Paul for its editing style and usage of the term \\"sociopath.\\" Tanya Chen and Remy Smidt, writing for BuzzFeed News, criticized Dawson for using the \\"outdated term\\" sociopath, and stated he should rather use the term antisocial personality disorder. They particularly criticized the second episode for using the term; Lauren Strapagiel, another Buzzfeed News reporter, concurred with Chen and Smidt. Jacob Shamsian, writing for Insider, also criticized the second episode, stating it was edited like a \\"horror movie.\\" Adam White from The Telegraph summarized the criticism, stating: \\"So far it has been Dawson who has become the target of significant backlash, emerging as a vaguely ignorant figure putting profitability before mental health, while Paul has emerged as his more level-headed mirror image, curious if slightly miffed by where this all seems to be going.\\" Carolyn Todd, writing for Self, did a full investigation on the topics presented in The Mind of Jake Paul. Todd validates the criticism by Chen and Smidt, and disputes most of Morton's claims. Jake Paul responded to the first two videos, stating that \\"the sociopathic stuff doesn't interest me.\\" Logan Paul, Jake's brother, made a video in response to the word \\"sociopath\\" being \\"thrown around\\" in the videos; Logan mentions he has sociopathic tendencies. Dawson apologized for anyone who was offended, but stated his \\"intentions were not bad.\\" Dawson also states he never had the intent to diagnose others. Kati Morton also made a video to respond to the criticism she received for her comments about sociopaths in the second episode: she claimed her intention was to educate those who are not sociopaths so they do not fall victim to manipulation from sociopaths and said of Dawson, \\"I applaud him for even reaching out to me and asking a real mental health professional to weigh in on something\\".

Gilfoyle (born 1934) is a retired American occupational therapist, researcher, educator, and university administrator. She worked at several hospitals before accepting a professorship at Colorado State University, later serving as Dean of the College of Applied Human Sciences and Provost/Academic Vice President at that university. She is also a past president of the American Occupational Therapy Association. With research interests in child development, developmental disabilities, and child abuse, she has led studies on the state and federal levels. The co-author of two books and many articles, she was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1996. Early life and education Ottumwa She was born Elnora Clausing in 1934 in Ottumwa, Iowa. She is the youngest of four children of Otto Herman Clausing (1895‚Äì1960), a manufacturer, and his wife Alice (n√©e Stark) (1896‚Äì1978). The family was German-American and had a strong work ethic. Her father believed that girls could do the same work as boys, and Elnora and her two sisters worked alongside their brother in their father's machine shop. A graduate of Ottumwa High School, she studied home economics at Iowa State University for two years beginning in 1952. During this time, she accompanied her roommate, an occupational therapy student, to the hospital where she worked and became interested in the discipline. She transferred to the State University of Iowa where she earned her B.A. in occupational therapy in 1956. She was one of the first students to receive a scholarship under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1954, whose goal was to increase vocational rehabilitation practitioners. She earned an Advanced Certificate in professional occupational therapy from the State University of Iowa in 1958. Career Gilfoyle relocated to Denver, Colorado, as a graduate student intern in 1956. There she met her husband, Gene Gilfoyle, whom she married in 1958. She first worked as an occupational therapy clinician in the Denver General Hospital. She next moved to the Craig Hospital, where she served as a clinical supervisor in the occupational therapy department, working primarily with patients with spinal cord injuries and brain damage. In the 1960s, she was appointed director of the occupational therapy department at Children's Hospital Colorado. In 1964 Gilfoyle was named to a fellowship in child development at the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, where she worked until 1966. She was among the first therapists at the new John F. Kennedy Child Development Center, assisting developmentally disabled and abused children. She also involved families in the rehabilitation process at the university's occupational therapy department. She also taught classes for pediatric occupational students. She became an associate professor at Colorado State University (CSU) in 1981 and a full professor in 1986. In 1988, she was appointed assistant dean of the College of Applied Human Sciences, and head of CSU's department of occupational therapy. She held the post of Dean of the College of Applied Human Sciences from 1989 to 1991, and Provost/Academic Vice President of CSU from 1991 to 1995, being the first woman to hold the latter position. In 1995 she founded and directed CSU's Institute for Women and Leadership. Research The Denver Department of Health tapped Gilfoyle to serve on a research team studying developmentally delayed and abused children. The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) appointed her as director of a U.S. Department of Education research grant project that produced a national curriculum to prepare occupational therapists to work with developmentally delayed children in public schools. In the book Children Adapt (1981), co-authors Gilfoyle, Ann P. Grady, and Josephine C. Moore advanced a developmental theory of spatiotemporal adaptation, which posits that children develop as a result of interaction with their environment. The authors believed that by combining modifications to the child's environment with subcortical learning, an occupational therapist could assist children with developmental disabilities. Between 1968 and 1991, Gilfoyle secured more than $2 million in funding for occupational therapy research from U.S. government and Colorado state agencies. Memberships and affiliations Gilfoyle was a member of various committee and boards for the AOTA, including editorial board member for the American Journal of Occupational Therapy (1970‚Äì1975), chair of the Task Force on Organizational Design and Transitional Planning (1975‚Äì1978), Secretary (1983‚Äì1985 and 1974‚Äì1977), and President (1986‚Äì1989). She was also President of the Colorado Occupational Therapy Association from 1966 to 1970, and co-chaired the annual conference of the Society for Behavioral Kinesiology in 1972. Honors and awards Gilfoyle received numerous commendations and distinguished service awards from the AOTA. She was awarded the 1984 Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lectureship, AOTA's highest academic award. In 1989 AOTA named her as \\"one of ten individuals nationwide whose contributions have had a significant impact on the practice, education, and research of the profession\\". She received the association's Award of Merit in 1991. In 2017, AOTA included her on their list of \\"100 Influential People\\" in the field. She received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Colorado State University in 1981, being the first occupational therapist to receive this degree. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1996. Personal life She married Eugene R. \\"Gene\\" Gilfoyle, a Denver native, in 1958. They had one son. They were married for 53 years until her husband's death in November 2010. Selected bibliography =Books= * (4 volumes) * (with Ann P. Grady, Josephine C.

It is reportedly the hill that St. Brendan once looked out to the Atlantic Ocean and decided to sail out towards it seeking the \\"Isle of the Blessed\\" (later called Saint Brendan's Island) as recorded in the 9th century manuscript, The Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot. It was used as part of a walking trail for hikers and pilgrims heading en route to Mount Brandon. Church Reenconnell has a church on it originally dedicated by St. Maolcethair in the 6th century AD but later rebuilt in the 12th century in Irish Romanesque style to resemble the chapel built on the Rock of Cashel. The church's graveyard at Calluragh/An Ceall√∫nach on Reenconnell was set aside for unbaptized children. A -tall High cross was erected on the site to mark the location of the graves. In addition there are also stones with Ogham inscriptions amongst several smaller stone crosses. One of which is dated to the 6th century with Latin script. Pilgrims also carved a rock spiral in Reenconnell as a celebration of seeing Feothanach. However, it is also speculated that the spiral pre-dated Christian pilgrimage and was a symbol of Celtic paganism of unknown meaning.

For an ordered map m with key type K, comparison function <_K on K and value type V, the augmented value is defined based on two functions: a base function g: Ktimes V mapsto A and a combine function f: Atimes Amapsto A, where A is the type of the augmented value. The base function g converts a single entry in m to an augmented value, and the combine function f combines multiple augmented values. The combine function f is required to be associative and have an identity I (i.e., A,f,I forms a monoid). We extend the definition of the associative function f as follows: f(emptyset)=I f(a)=a f(a_1,a_2,dots,a_n)=f(f(a_1,a_2,dots,a_{n-1}),a_n) Then the augmented value of an ordered map m={(k_1,v_1),(k_2,v_2),dots (k_n,v_n)} is defined as follows: A(m)=f(g(k_1,v_1),g(k_2,v_2),dots,g(k_n,v_n)) Accordingly, an augmented map can be formally defined as a seven-tuple mathbb{AM}(K,<_K,V,A,g,f,I). For example, an augmented map with integral keys and values, on which the augmented value is defined as the sum of all values in the map, is defined as: M_1 = mathbb{AM}(mathbb{Z},<_mathbb{Z},mathbb{Z},mathbb{Z},(k,v)mapsto v, +_mathbb{Z},0) As an abstract data type, the augmented map is often used to model problems and serves as an abstraction with a useful interface. It is designed for supporting fast range sums, which means to quickly return the augmented value of all entries in a certain key range. Interface In addition to the interface for a standard ordered map, the augmented map should also support functions for range sums. In particular: *aug_left(m,k): returns the augmented value of all entries in m with keys no more than k. *aug_right(m,k): returns the augmented value of all entries in m with keys no less than k. *aug_left(m,k_1,k_2): returns the augmented value of all entries in m with keys in range [k_1,k_2]. *aug_val(m): returns the augmented value of all entries in m. Some functions, although are not defined based on augmented values, can make use of augmented values to accelerate their algorithms. Usually, they would require some certain representation of augmented maps, and certain conditions for input parameters. *aug_filter(m,h): returns all entries in m satisfying the indicator h: Amapsto text{bool}. It is only applicable when h(a)vee h(b)Leftrightarrow h(f(a,b)). In this case, the aug_filter function is equivalent to filterm,h', where h':Ktimes Vmapsto text{bool} and h(g(k,v))Leftrightarrow h'(k,v). When the augmented map is implemented using augmented trees, this function can be implemented asymptotically more efficient than the naive implementation. *aug_project(g',f',m,k_1,k_2): returns g'(aug_range(m,k_1,k_2)). Here g':Amapsto B, f':Btimes Bmapsto B. It requires (B,f',g'(I)) to be a monoid and f'(g'(a),g'(b))=g'(f(a,b)). This function is useful when the augmented values are themselves maps or other large data structures. It allows projecting the augmented values down onto another type by g' (e.g. project augmented values with complicated structures to values like their sizes) then summing them by f', and is much more efficient when applicable. Implementation =Augmented Trees= The augmented map can be supported efficiently by augmented trees, where each tree node is augmented by the augmented value of all entries in its subtree. Because of the associativity of the combine function f, the augmented value of a certain tree is fixed, and is independent of the shape of the tree, regardless of rotations. In this case, by combining the partial sums in the tree nodes, any range sum can be returned in O(log n) time on an augmented map of size n, assuming both f and g have constant cost. For aug_filter, the tree structure takes the advantage that if the augmented value of a subtree does not satisfy the indicator h, the whole tree gets discarded. In this case, the cost of aug_filter is O(klog(1+frac{n}{k}) where k is the output size. For aug_project, whenever a whole subtree falls in the range [k_1,k_2], its augmented value can be directly combined to the result, instead of requiring traversing the tree. =Prefix Structures= Another implementation is to use prefix structures, which stores the augmented value of all prefices of the map. For the above-defined augmented map M_1, the prefix structure is an array stored the prefix sum of the values, sorted by their keys. Prefix structures are particularly useful for aug_left, but can be inefficient to implement other functions on the augmented map interface. It can be useful in some geometric algorithms. Example Application =1D stabbing query= A 1D stabbing query takes as input a set of intervals on 1D number line. The query asks for if a given point is covered by any input interval, or all intervals covering this point. An augmented map can be defined for this problem, where the keys are the left endpoints of all intervals, values are the corresponding right endpoints, and the augmented value is the maximum value of all right endpoints in the map. More formally: M_{interval}=(mathbb{R},<_mathbb{R},mathbb{R},mathbb{R},(k,v)mapsto v, text{max}_mathbb{R},-infty) To report if any interval covers a given point p, the query algorithm simply determines if aug_left(p)>p. This is because aug_left looks at all intervals that start before p, and if the maximum right endpoint among them exceeds p, then p must be covered. When implemented with augmented trees, the augmented map M_text{interval} is exactly an interval tree. Constructing such an augmented tree structure costs work O(nlog n), O(log n) parallel depth and O(n) space. Each stabbing query can be done in time O(log n). =2D range query= A 2D range query takes as input a set of points on 2 dimensions. The query asks for all points (or the number) in a certain rectangle, whose edges are parallel to the axis. An augmented map can be defined for this problem, which is a two-level nested map structure. The outer map stores all points and sort them by their x-coordinates. The augmented value of the outer map is an inner augmented map structure, which stores the same set of points as the outer map, but sorts them by their y-coordinates. The augmentation of the inner trees accumulate the count of points, i.e., the augmented value of an inner map is its size. Accordingly, the combine function of the outer map is to take a union of the two inner augmented maps. More formally: M_{inner}=(Y,<_Y,X,mathbb{Z},(k,v)mapsto 1,+_mathbb{Z},0) M_{outer}=(X,<_X,Y,M_text{inner},(k,v)mapsto M_text{inner}.singleton(v,k),M_text{inner}.text{union},M_text{inner}.text{empty}) Here for simplicity, assume all coordinates are unique. X and Y are the types of the x- and y-coordinates. To answer the range query in rectangle (x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2), the query algorithm extracts the augmented value of the outer map in the key range [x_1,x_2], which is an inner map of all desired points sorted by y-coordinates. Therefore, the algorithm takes another aug_range on this inner map and gets the result. For counting queries, the algorithm can make use of the aug_project function. query(m,x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)=M_text{outer}.text{aug}_text{project}(g',+_mathbb{Z},m,x_1,x_2) text{where }g':M_text{inner}mapsto mathbb{Z}, g'(m')=M_text{inner}.text{aug}_text{range}(m,y_1,y_2) If the both the inner and the outer maps are implemented by augmented trees, then the whole two-level map structure becomes a range tree structure. If the inner map is supported by the augmented tree structure, and the outer tree is supported as the prefix structure, then the algorithm becomes a sweepline algorithm. =Other examples= Other examples include segment queries, inverted index searching, rectangle queries, etc. Libaray support A parallel implementation of the augmented map interface is provided in a library PAM.

The school, exemplified by the work of William Appleman Williams and also including as core members Walter LaFeber, Thomas J. McCormick, and Lloyd Gardner, generally holds that economic reasons, and the desire for increased markets abroad, were the driver behind much of American foreign policy and the creation of an American empire during the 19th century. These beliefs ‚Äì which consigned to subordinate status other possible explanations such as morality, security, and balance-of-power calculations ‚Äì have been referred to as the \\"Open Door Interpretation\\", in reference to the Open Door Notes of 1899 and 1900. Two ongoing world events highlighted the influence and debate over Wisconsin School thought. One was the historiography of the Cold War, where \\"revisionist\\" theories held by the school stated that the United States bore a large share of the responsibility for the breakdown in post-World War II relations with the Soviet Union. The other was criticism of the Vietnam War. The Tragedy of American Diplomacy, the 1959 work that Williams became best known for, became heavily referenced by many of those participating in opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and dissatisfaction with the war boosted the popularity of the Open Door interpretation. But works of the Wisconsin School focused not just on causes of the Cold War or Vietnam, but the entire course of American expansion from the time of the nation's creation. At p. 261. The tenets of the Wisconsin School have been incorporated to some degree by other lines of scholarly thought in the decades since and still remain influential. Background and members Forebears to the Wisconsin School include Charles A. Beard and his economically determined theories of American history that became widely read in the early 20th century before later becoming unpopular. A more direct antecedent was the influence and intellectual mentoring of Wisconsin professor Fred Harvey Harrington, under whom Williams studied. In part the ideas of the Wisconsin School were due to the nature of the department itself. As American historian Emily S. Rosenberg has written, \\"While many other history departments across the country celebrated cold-war orthodoxies, exiling economic interpretations from respectability and removing Beard from reading lists, Wisconsin maintained an attachment to economic interpretation and to independent, unorthodox thinking.\\" The immediate founder, and the most well- known exponent, of the Wisconsin School was William Appleman Williams and especially his 1959 book The Tragedy of American Diplomacy. As British historian John A. Thompson has written, \\"this work may well have had a greater influence of the historiography of US foreign policy than any other.\\" Williams was followed in visibility by several of his students, most notably Walter LaFeber, but also Thomas J. McCormick and Lloyd Gardner.Morgan, Into New Territory, p. 28. Their work helped gain the \\"Wisconsin School of diplomatic history\\" a national reputation. (After Williams left Wisconsin for Oregon State University in the late 1960s, McCormick replaced him on the faculty there.) Another scholar sometimes associated with the Wisconsin School is Carl Parrini. Of other people at Wisconsin, some have considered David F. Healey and Robert Freeman Smith to be at least partly a member of the school, but they are distinct in not holding commercial factors to be the primary factors above all in explaining American policy. Students of Williams who carried forward his themes have included Edward P. Crapol, Howard Schonberger, Tom E. Terrill, and others. At pp. 3‚Äì4. Characteristics As always, any such school of thought ends up containing some different viewpoints, and it should not be assumed that everyone coming out of seminars led by Harrington or others at the department adopted the same approach. LaFeber himself made this point by referring to \\"a supposed 'Wisconsin School of Diplomatic History'\\" in a 1993 essay about Harrington and pointing to the variety of scholarly perspectives emerging from Wisconsin at the time. At pp. 6‚Äì7. And before that, Williams had said in a 1978 essay that the Wisconsin seminars were not as tightly directed as some apparently thought, that no collection of thought came out of the department that was as clearly defined as, say, the Frankfurt School of social history, and that mention of the \\"Wisconsin School\\" brought about more \\"professional discussion (and gossip)\\" than warranted. Also available as an online article at Encyclopedia of the New American Nation. In particular, he pointed out that he, LaFeber, McCormick, and Gardner differed to the degree in which they saw a coherent \\"Open Doors worldview\\" being acted upon by American policymakers. Furthermore, it is generally thought that LaFeber and McCormick were more subtle in their approach than Williams.Morgan, Into New Territory, p. 6. The Wisconsin School has often been conflated with the New Left.For example, see While members of each found themselves allied at times, the two were distinct: New Left critiques tended to be a good deal more radical both in analysis and in proposed solutions.Morgan, Into New Territory, pp. 172‚Äì176. Wisconsin School members thought that it was possible for American decisionmakers to correct their overemphasis on markets and that doing so would make for a more effective American diplomacy. At pp. 80‚Äì81. At p. 7. In contrast, historians associated with the New Left, such as Gabriel Kolko, more often subscribed to Marxist interpretations and believed that there were fundamental structural causes, due to the needs of American capitalism, behind American foreign policy and that little could reverse that short of an outright remaking of the economic system. Moreover, Williams left the University of Wisconsin in the late 1960s in part because he disliked the militant direction that student protests were taking there. Furthermore, Robert Freeman Smith ‚Äì who has also sometimes been grouped in with the Wisconsin School ‚Äì has remarked that \\"if there is such a thing as the Wisconsin School of Diplomatic History it has to be an ecumenical school. There is not one party line because Fred [Harvey Harrington] had a number of different students, both liberal and conservative.\\" Harrington later voiced similar thoughts, saying that \\"the Wisconsin School of diplomatic history ought not to be just associated with the New Left.\\"Brown, Beyond the Frontier, p. 234. Following the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970s, and then again following the conclusion of the Cold War in the early 1990s, the Wisconsin School's work became less controversial. Other historians adopted much of its scholarship and some of its conclusions, albeit in a more partial form.Rosenberg, \\"Economic interest and United States foreign policy\\", pp. 45‚Äì46. As a biography of Williams has stated, \\"the Wisconsin School as a body of thought ... was renewed in virtually ceaseless diaspora of individuals and generations.\\"Buhle and Rice-Maximin, William Appleman Williams, p. 197.

The bargaining unit comprises about 5,000 student employees, including graduate students working as research assistants and teaching fellows as well as several hundred undergraduate students holding teaching positions. Contract negotiations with the university are scheduled to begin in Fall 2018. HGSU is affiliated with the United Auto Workers labor union, whose 400,000 members include 45,000 graduate students and 30,000 academic workers. History A group of graduate students began a union organizing campaign in Spring 2015. By February 2016, union organizers calling themselves the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers claimed to have collected election authorization cards from over 60% of graduate students. In August 2016, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) overturned previous precedent since 2004 that graduate students at private universities were not employees with collective bargaining rights. Following this decision, HGSU organizers petitioned for a union representation election to be held. In October 2016, union organizers and the university announced that a two-day, secret ballot election on union representation would take place on November 16‚Äì17 of that year. In the 2016 election, 1,274 voters cast ballots favoring unionization and 1,456 opposed unionization, with 314 ballots challenged on eligibility grounds. The NLRB ultimately overturned the results of that election and ordered a new election, finding that the university failed to furnish an accurate list of eligible voters. The second election was held in April 2018. On April 20, the NLRB announced the results of the two day election, reporting 1,931 votes (56%) in favor to 1,523 opposed. In the second election, 70% of eligible voters cast a ballot. In May 2018, Harvard University announced that it would recognize the union and enter into contract negotiations in good faith. The union and university administrators held their first bargaining session in October 2018. On May 1, 2019, about 30 union members held a sit-in and others marched in support of union demands regarding wages, health care, and protections against sexual harassment. In July 2019, more than 300 union members signed a letter threatening to hold a strike authorization vote if negotiations did not make progress. In late October, after a two week voting period, about 2500 graduate students voted to authorize the bargaining committee to call a strike, with 90.4% of votes cast favoring strike authorization. HGSU-UAW went out on strike for the first time on December 3, 2019, citing (among other issues) the need for stronger protections against sexual harassment and discrimination, improved compensation, and more affordable and comprehensive healthcare (especially mental health and dental care). The strike ended on January 1, 2020.

It was built in 1845 at the behest of Charles Throsby, possibly by convict labour. The design of the church has been attributed to John Verge. The church site includes an associated cemetery. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 7 April 2000.  History  Charles Throsby of Throsby Park gave land for a church, burial ground and parsonage with a glebe of at Bong Bong. Construction started early in 1845 to the plans of the well known architect, John Verge. These were prepared in 1837, probably for a church at Sutton Forest. Charles had inherited Throsby Park estate from his uncle, the explorer Dr Charles Throsby. Charles (Jr.) built Throsby Cottage before his marriage to Elizabeth \\"Betsey\\" Broughton in 1824. Broughton had come to Australia after being one of only five survivors of the Boyd massacre in New Zealand. Throsby started work on the 27-room Throsby Park homestead in 1834. He built Christ Church Bong Bong on his own land and it has always been strongly connected with the Throsby family. He and Betsey had 17 children and over decades the Anglican church has seen scores of descendants christened, married and farewelled. The Church was paid for by Charles Throsby at a cost of . Its architecture is attributed to Verge and the building was dedicated and consecrated by Bishop of Australia William Broughton in 1845. Beneath the church is a crypt, intended for Throsby family members but never used. Charles died relatively young and Betsey brought up their 17 children. Being very pious, she kept up regular attendance at the \\"Throsby Church\\", all her long life. She cherished the church and funded work on its interior in 1884. A rare mahogany organ, , was installed during the 1884 renovations. Later work was done in 1907, after her death. The surrounding land was settled by recipients of Crown land grants and rewards to pardoned convicts. Many of these pioneers and early settlers are buried in the cemetery including Charles and Elizabeth (Betsey) Throsby 1854 and 1891 and their descendants; Joseph Wild 1847 (explorer of Lake George and Wildes Meadow); and Rebecca Jenkins. Around 30 Throsbys are buried in the cemetery.Reid, 2003. Bong Bong had been the first designated village in the southern highlands of New South Wales when it was proclaimed by Lachlan Macquarie in 1821, but the village declined in the 1850s due to flooding and diversion of the main south road. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the Rectory fell into disuse and was later demolished. When Betsey Throsby died in 1891, aged 83, the funeral service at Christ Church was conducted by three clergymen. There were 50 vehicles in the cortege and 20 horsemen. She left 78 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. The Church celebrated a centenary service in 1945 and a 150-year service in 1995. To commemorate the centenary in 1945, 17 Bhutan cypresses (Cupressus torulosa), one for each Throsby child, were planted in the church grounds in two rows. These remain today. The church's stained glass windows were restored in 2004. The east window, depicting Christ's ascension, was given by Betsey Throsby (probably in 1884) in memory of her late husband. Three other floral windows are thought to have been commissioned by Betsey and made by Lyon, Cottier and Company which made windows for major buildings including St Andrew's College, University of Sydney, and St. Andrew's Scots Church, Rose Bay. A later ecclesiastical window reads that it is in memory of the Rev. William Fisher, who died in 1916. Former warden Sally Darling was instrumental in organising the window restoration work. The church's paintwork gradually deteriorated. In 2010 an anonymous benefactor, who came to the region and is a regular member of the congregation, came to the rescue, finding heritage contacts in Sydney and putting momentum into the conservation project, said church warden Robin Croker (warden for 42 years). Discoloured stencil work on the ceiling and walls was repainted in its original colours, other parts were rediscovered and recreated, such as gold circles and fleurs-de-lis (iris motifs) that had been painted over. Lettering, which had always remained visible, was restored to its original brighter condition, and to its more ornate original scheme. The restorers discovered the cream window frames were originally stained wood, so these were returned to their original state. The whole interior was repainted, where previously paint was peeling off walls. One small section was left to show the condition pre-restoration. New lighting and heaters were installed. Of the Bong Bong township, only the church and graveyard, the Briars Inn and Throsby Park remain.  Description  Christ Church is set in a churchyard with a cemetery on a hill over the Wingecarribee River, now on the outskirts of Moss Vale, and near the related site, Throsby Park estate. It is constructed of sandstock brick on stone foundations. The exterior has been cement rendered and painted white. here is a covered entrance on the north side and a tower. The interior contains stained glass windows including an Ecclesiastical decorative east window and eight stained glass and painted enamel floral panels designed by Lyon, Cottier & Co. showing lilies, roses, chrysanthemums, iris, arum liilies and passionfruit flowers. There is a Parsons Organ and a painted ceiling attributed to Lyon, Cottier & Co. It contains Australian cedar pews, oak pulpit and brass lectern. The cemetery is divided into two distinct sections; one of the Anglican graveyard of Christ Church Bong Bong and the other the Presbyterian cemetery. Although there is a light steel and concrete fence between them the two sections form a unified group. The cemetery landscape is enhanced by two rows of mature Bhutan cypress trees (Cupressus torulosa), planted on the 1945 centenary of the church's construction, one tree per (17) Throsby child, and some other large trees including gums which predate the church's construction, being shown in an 1820s painting of the area. The monuments are arranged in parallel rows facing east. They date from 1841 and about half are pre-1900. The early monuments are mainly sandstone (40% 1841-1900) and of simple design, with a few of \\"Marulan stone\\". Other materials used are marble (10%, 1866, 1890-1925), Trachyte (10%, crosses 1867-1925, other styles 1908 to present), granite (5%) and marble tablets on plinths (35%) of sandstone (1915-1930) or of cement or terrazzo (1930 to present.) Other cemetery plantings include Chinese/funeral cypress (Cupressus funebris), Lawson cypress (Cupressus lawsoniana), black locusts/false acacias (Robinia pseudoacacia), cherry plums, privets, and firethorns (Pyracantha). The ground is carpetted by kiss-me-quick/valerian (Kentranthus ruber), sparaxia bulbs and grass. The physical condition of the church was reported as good as at November 2000, although some damp was coming in through cracking in walls. The churchyard and cemetery were in relatively good condition, although becoming encroached upon by suburban sprawl of Moss Vale to the east and north (formerly open fields). Christ Church retains all its significant features except that of the gallery. = Modifications and dates = * 1845 - Constructed * 1884 - Gallery and stair demolished, Parsons Organ installed, ceiling removed and painted finish dome on diagonally laid pine boards, stained glass & painted enamel windows installed, enaustic tiles laid on floor and gothic porch (by Blacket Bros) * 1930s - exterior cement rendered * 1992 - Church reroofed in colorbond.  Heritage listing  Christ Church was constructed in 1845 and is the oldest church between Cobbitty and Canberra. It is associated with important figures such as John Verge who designed the Church and Charles & Betsey Throsby. It was dedicated and consecrated in 1845 by Bishop W. G. Broughton - Bishop of Australia. It provides evidence of the first designated township in the southern highlands by Governor Macquarie in 1821 and is a landmark feature on the approach to Moss Vale, and Wingecarribee River, relating to nearby Throsby Park. It contains a unique interior collection of a Parsons Organ, church pews, pulpit and lectern, painted ceilings, painted enamel and stained glass windows. The cemetery is an important record of the history of the southern highlands and of the Throsby family. Christ Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 7 April 2000.

The ship was a timber carrier, that sank to . She contained of fuel oil. She ran aground on Blow Hard Rock, off Change Islands. The oil was contained, within the ship, until a storm in 2013 cracked the hull. Since then some oil leaked from the hull, and the Canadian Coast Guard was able to contain some of that oil. But the wreck has been described as a \\"ticking time bomb\\", that could suffer a total rupture of the oil tank, at any time. For a period of five years, the Manolis L Citizens Response Committee advocated for the removal of the oil through public awareness campaigns that included art exhibits, a protest march and other means to keep the issue in the public eye while meeting with stakeholders, government officials and Coast guard regularly to keep apprised of the efforts. The committee was integral to the eventual resolution of the issue. The Conservative government under Stephen Harper, refused to address the issue however when the Liberal party under Justin Trudeau came to power they ordered a technical assessment of the wreck. This assessment was undertaken in 2016, Because of the extreme pressure changes, it took an hour to descend. They were only able to spend half an hour working before they had to spend an hour and a half managing their return to the surface. The recommendation of Coastguard was to remove the remaining oil. Meanwhile the government created and passed Bill C-64 to fill the legislative vacuum surrounding abandoned and derelict vessels in Canada. Efforts to safely pump out the oil began on August 8, 2018. Because of the depth the work was performed by remotely operated vessels. The oil was completely removed by September 8, 2018.

On 17 September 2018, the Russian president Vladimir Putin and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, reached an agreement to create a buffer zone in Idlib.  Background  In the start of 2018, after ISIL defeat in eastern Syria, the Syrian government and its allies intensified their assault on rebels in the southwest. After the Beit Jinn offensive in January, the Eastern Qalamoun offensive (April 2018), rebel fighters who refused to \\"reconcile\\" with the government were evacuated to Idlib ‚Äì reportedly about 1,500 from Qalamoun and 300 from Beit Jinn to Idlib and Daraa in December and more in March. At the same time, rebel and HTS fighters surrendered in the long Rif Dimashq Governorate campaign, and the rebels, numbering about 20,000, were transported to Idlib, Afrin and Al-Bab area. In late July 2018, Syrian government forces and their allies captured the Southern Front, during the 2018 Southern Syria offensive. Rebel fighters who refused to reconcile were again transported to Idlib. After that, the Syrian government started gathering troops outside of Idlib, and began shelling rebel-held territories at the start of August. Rebels started building defenses and trenches for an upcoming offensive.  The bombardments  On 4 September 2018, at least ten Russian Sukhoi aircraft launched dozens of air strikes over the southern and western part of the Idlib Governorate, which led to the largest bombing campaign in the province. Russian air strikes specifically targeted the Jisr al-Shughur District, including Al-Shughour, Mahambel, Basnkoul, Zaizooun, Ziyarah, Jadariiah, Kafrdeen, Al-Sahn, Saraseef and a dozen others. The Russian air force on the first day recorded more than 50-70 attacks. According to pro-government sources, at least 11 civilians were killed, and 24 wounded during the strikes. The following day, one of the top Syrian Arab Army (SAA) commanders arrived in northern Syria in the upcoming offensive in Idlib, Hama and Latakia: according to the official media wing of the Tigers, their commander, Major-General Suheil al-Hassan, went to Aleppo area to visit the areas retaken by the government. The Syrian and Russian air forces resumed their airstrikes over the southwestern countryside of the Idlib Governorate today. Using their Sukhoi jets, the Syrian and Russian air forces heavily bombarded the Jisr Al- Shughour District for the second straight day. As the bombardments continued, and the fears for an upcoming offensive appeared to become a reality, the United Nations issued a warning that the offensive will result in a bloodbath and a massacre, as about 100,000 rebels and 3,000,000 civilians were holed up in the area. Turkey started sending more troops and boosting defenses in the frontlines, and warned the government and Russia of a humanitarian disaster if their forces started the offensive, saying it would create a new wave of refugees. On 13 September, it was announced Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Iran, to discuss ways forward.  Terms  The demilitarization deal was struck on 16 September and was announced as binding on both parties. The terms were as follows: * A demilitarized zone (DMZ) would be set up entirely within rebel-held territory. It would be 15 to 25 km deep (9‚Äì15 miles) and come into effect by 15 October. All acts of aggression would be prohibited within the zone. * The Syrian Government would refrain from attacks on the rebel-held Idlib Governorate. * Groups deemed \\"radical\\", such as the Al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), would have to leave the demilitarized zone entirely. * Groups deemed \\"moderate\\", such as the Turkish-backed National Front for Liberation , would be allowed to remain within the demilitarized zone, but would have to withdraw all heavy and medium weapons from it, including all tanks, MLRS, artillery and mortars. * The HTS-run Syrian Salvation Government would be dissolved. * The rebel groups would open and ensure unrestricted civilian access through the M4 and M5 highways. * Turkey would use its network of observation posts in Idlib to secure the rebel-held DMZ, while Russia and Iran would likewise set up and use their own military observation posts to secure the government-controlled territories, which border the zone. * Turkey and Russia would coordinate joint patrols along the DMZ, in order to ensure compliance. * Russia and Turkey would reiterate their \\"determination to combat terrorism in Syria in all forms and manifestations\\". The pro-government Al-Watan newspaper further reported that the agreement would reportedly end in the return of government institutions to Idlib, after rebel groups withdraw from residential areas. The Turkistan Islamic Party, Guardians of Religion Organization, Ansar al-Tawhid, Ansar al-Din Front, and Ansar al-Islam rejected the deal, putting the agreement in jeopardy, while Tahrir al-Sham issued an ambiguous statement on the deal. The Syrian Government accepted and \\"welcomed\\" the deal.  Incidents after the deal  On 19 September, the Syrian military attacked positions held by HTS and its allies, in the Hama-Latakia-Idlib axis, stating that it has still not withdrawn its troops from the area. On 20 September, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham reportedly executed an individual who was reportedly supportive of reconciliation with the Syrian Government. Turkish officials and officials from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) since the inception of the deal have been discussing a course of action to be taken in Idlib in line with the deal's guidelines. Reportedly the most urgent topic of the discussions is the uncertain fate of foreign fighters within HTS, with HTS proposing that the group dissolves and become part of an umbrella of other groups, while foreign fighters along with the group's leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani be allowed safety, discussions have been inconclusive in this regard but satisfactory in other aspects with many elements of HTS welcoming much of the Sochi agreement. While pro-government forces reportedly attacked opposition forces positioned in Turkmen Mountain in the Latakia Governorate which is reportedly a part of the agreed demilitarized zone, which caused several fires in the area, the government also targeted other areas of the Latakia Mountains including Jabal Al-Akrad and Kabani. Government targeting also hit areas in the Idlib Governorate including the Qoqfeen area in the western countryside of the province. The areas in the Hama Governorate were also reportedly hit including the town of al-Sermaniyyeh in the al-Ghab plain, opposition factions responded by shelling government-held areas in the northern countryside of the Hama governorate in the towns of Joureen and Foro. Later at night on the same day multiple rebels including the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement reportedly shelled Pro-Government positions in the western parts of Aleppo targeting the Mokambo and Al-Andalus districts of the city. In response to the attack the Syrian military fired missiles into the Rashideen 4 area held by the Syrian opposition. On 1 October, machine gun fire was reportedly emanating from pro- government forces in the rebel-held Lirmoun area of the northwestern outskirts of Aleppo, along with continued shelling on behalf of pro-government forces after shelling from the previous night. On 2 October, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Turkish officials reportedly reached an agreement where agrees to withdraw fighters and heavy weapons from the established demilitarized zone, as well as a dissolution of the Syrian Salvation Government and its administration became integrated with the Syrian Interim Government and that HTS restructures so it will no longer be designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, and Turkey in turn agrees not to take action against the group and its members and leadership will be given safety.HTS to allegedly withdraw, Al- Masdar On 26 October, pro-government shelling in the Idlib Governorate killed seven, reportedly being the largest loss of life since August 2018. On 16 February, SOHR reported that at least 18 people were killed and many more injured after sporadic Syrian government shelling on Maarrat al-Nu'man, Khan Shaykhun, Hama and surrounding settlements in the rebel-held Idlib region within the past two days. Rebels responded with machine gun and rocket fire towards SAA positions. = Failure of the deal = The deal's terms were never implemented fully. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) never left the demilitarized zone and, to the contrary, launched a full-scale offensive against the other rebel groups remaining within the rebel-held Idlib Governorate. After 10 days of fighting, the National Front for Liberation (at that point the second largest and most powerful rebel group in Idlib, after HTS) signed a peace deal with the group, which allowed HTS to take over almost the entirety of the Idlib governorate, leaving only small and minor pockets under the control of the other rebel groups. The HTS-run Syrian Salvation Government was not dissolved but instead expanded its control to all of the areas recently captured by HTS, including those within the demilitarized zone. The presence of HTS forces along the demarcation line led to frequent exchanges of artillery shelling with government forces, which significantly undermined any chances for a true cesassion of violence. The M4 and M5 highways were never reopened by rebel forces and even the groups deemed 'moderate' by the deal never withdrew all heavy and medium weapons from the demilitarized zone. The provision for joint Turkish-Russian patrols within the DMZ was also not enforced, as the rebel groups categorically refused the entry of any Russian soldiers or military police to their controlled areas, allowing only Turkish forces to do so. The rebel's refusal reportedly came after Turkey reportedly 'promised' them that it would not allow any Russian presence within the DMZ. The deadline for the fulfilment of the deal's conditions was extended multiple times to allow Turkey more time to convince the rebel groups to adhere to the terms, but all such attempts were unsuccessful. =Renewed fighting= On 6 May, after six continuous days of intensive airstrikes on the region by the SyAAF and RuAF, the Syrian Arab Army launched a ground offensive against HTS and NFL-held areas in northern Hama and southern Idlib. The Syrian Government stated that the assault was provoked by increased rebel attacks on government- held areas originating from within the demilitarized zone. The Russian government stated that the deal was not implemented by the rebel groups, hence justifying military action against them. The Idlib-based rebel groups stated that the goal of the offensive would be to capture the M4 and M5 highways in the Idlib Governorate. = Attempted revival of the deal = On 1 August 2019, following several months of intense fighting between government and rebel forces, the Syrian Government announced a unilateral truce, conditional on rebels' fulfilment of the original 2018 demilitarisation terms. Most rebel groups reportedly accepted the offer. Shortly after the truce went into effect, however, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham declared that they would categorically refuse to leave any region under their control at that time, which was a core demand of both the original agreement and the conditional ceasefire. A day later, the government announced the end of the ceasefire and a resumption of military operations, citing the refusal of rebel groups to withdraw from the zone as the reason for the truce's failure. A considerable portion of the DMZ's territory was subsequently captured by the Syrian Army and its allies during the final stages of the offensive. Another ceasefire was announced in late August, which confirmed the government gains. Some rebel groups on the other hand, expressed their refusal to adhere to the deal and withdraw from the remaining 'demilitarized' areas, hence signaling that the agreement would not be revived. The subsequent 2019-2020 Northwestern Syria offensive saw large parts of the originally designated zone being captured by the Syrian Army. In mid February 2020 the Syrian Army regained control of the M5 Motorway. On 5 March 2020, Russia and Turkey came to a new cease-fire agreement, which included joint Russian and Turkish patrols of a wide corridor alongside the M4 Motorway that runs through Idlib to Latakia.  Conflict parties  A number of pro-rebel and pro-Turkey demonstrations were held in rebel-controlled towns in the Idlib, Hama, and Aleppo governorates during the attempted implementation of the ceasefire, including the ones shown here on 22 September 2018. A number of different, rivalrous rebel and jihadist factions control territory in Idlib Governorate, with fighters numbering up to 70,000. They are loosely organised into two rival coalitions, who had fought against each other in the January‚ÄìMarch and July 2017. = HTS and allies = *Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS): one of the most powerful militant groups in Syria. It controls up to two-thirds of Idlib Governorate,Sarah El Deeb Last stand: Syria‚Äôs rebel Idlib prepares for a losing battle, Associated Press, 17 September 2018 including Idlib City and the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. It was previously affiliated with Al-Qaeda, and is often said (including by the US State Department) to remain an al-Qaeda affiliate, despite the group's statement that since 2016 it does not belong to any \\"external entity\\". The group's leader, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, stated after the rebel defeats in the south that the same thing will not happen in Idlib, implying that his coalition will fight if the regime raided Idlib. The UN estimates it and its allies to have 10,000 fighters, with a high number of foreigners. Other estimates put it at 8,000, about 10,000, to 12‚Äì14,000 fighters or even 30,000. *Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria: an ethnic Uyghur jihadist group that came to Idlib from China during the revolution, and is close to HTS. They reportedly rejected the agreement. According to the Syrian government, the group has as many as 10,000 armed fighters, although Western analysts say the number is considerably lower, and the German government estimates 1,500. According to some commentators, many of its leaders are \\"double-agents\\", meaning that although the group as a whole is not a part of Al-Qaeda, its leaders are high ranking al-Qaeda members. *Alliance to Support Islam: the group is another branch of Al-Qaeda in Syria, formed by Huras al- Din (whose fighting force is estimated by the German government at 1,000), and Ansar al-Tawhid, strong loyalists to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who rejected Joulani as their leader and the HTS project. It is led by Abu Humam al-Shami. *Katibat Jabal al-Islam: a Turkmen group, allied to HTS. *Ajnad al-Kavkaz: a group made up from people from the Caucasus countries, that it came to Syria to fight the Russian government and the Assad regime, closely allied with HTS and other rebel groups. It has about 200 fighters. *Jama'at Ansar al-Furqan in Bilad al Sham: another Al-Qaeda branch is Syria, thought to be led by Abu Julaib, a veteran Qaeda commander. VOA news states that the group may even be led by Hamza bin Laden. Not many things are heard about the group, and it may have merged with Hurras al-Din. *Junud al-Sham: a very small group, made primarily of Chechens. = NFL coalition = The National Front for Liberation (NFL): not a single group, but a coalition, formed in 2018, mainly from two big groups. The first identifies as part of the more moderate Free Syrian Army; the second, which joined in August, is another, more radical, coalition, the Syrian Liberation Front (made up primarily of Ahrar al-Sham and the Nour al- Din al-Zenki Movement). The coalition controls territory in rural southern Idlib, rural western Aleppo and some settlements around Idlib City, according to the Turkish government linked Center for Middle Eastern Strategic Studies, and is thought to boast 30,000 to 55‚Äì60,000 rebels, or even up to 70,000. The coalition is heavily supported by Turkey. The groups that made the coalition are: *Free Idlib Army: an FSA group, it commands about 6,000 fighters. *1st Coastal Division: an FSA group. Close allies of the group, who are also part of FSA, 2nd Army, 2nd Coastal Division, 1st Infantry Division, and Islamic Freedom Brigade, also joined the coalition. *23rd Division: another smaller FSA group, who joined the coalition. *Elite Army: another FSA group, whom a part of it, is also part of Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army. *Jaysh al-Nasr: another FSA group. It has about 5,000 fighters in its ranks. *Syrian Liberation Front: one of the biggest forces in Idlib, it has about 25,000-27,000 fighters. It is essentially an alliance of Ahrar al-Sham and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, two hardline Sunni Islamist groups and the two largest rebel groups in northwestern Syria behind their main rival, Tahrir al- Sham. *Sham Legion: an alliance of rebel Islamist groups, it is also an ally of HTS. The group has about 8,500-10,000 fighters. It has rejected the deal.  Reactions  Supranational * ‚àí the United Nations praised the deal, hoping that it will be the start of a political solution in Syria. National * ‚àí Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in response to the deal tweeted, \\"Diplomacy Works\\", while adding that visits to Turkey and Russia in recent weeks pursued the deal to avert an offensive or campaign in Idlib \\"with a firm commitment to fight extremist terror.\\" Bahram Ghasemi Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesmen said in regards to the agreement, \\"it is an important and essential step for removing the remaining terrorists in Syria.\\" * ‚àí Turkish foreign minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu in response to strong opposition to aspects of the agreement by groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, that Turkish and Russian drones would patrol the demilitarized zone, while also saying, \\"The moderate opposition will stay in its place, a thing of much importance. A ceasefire will be conducted, the area will not be attacked, and accordingly there would not be provocations against other areas.\\" * ‚àí President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter warning that a large humanitarian crisis could happen in a post saying, \\"President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don‚Äôt let that happen!\\" He also said in another occasion it would make the United States \\"Very, very, Angry\\". On 26 September, President Donald Trump said to the United Nations Security Council \\"the Syrian regime's butchery is enabled by Russia and Iran\\" and he added \\"I want to thank Iran, Russia and Syria for --at my very strong urgent and request-- substantially slowing down their attack on Idlib province and three million people who live there in order to get 35,000 targeted terrorists. Get the terrorists but I hope the restraint continues. The world is watching,\\" while also thanking Turkey by saying, \\"Thank you also to Turkey for helping to negotiate restraint. Anything the U.S.A. can do to help resolve this problem in order to save perhaps even hundreds of thousands of lives, maybe more, we are willing and able. We are available to help.\\" In May 2019, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy said, Idlib is the largest collection of al-Qaida affiliates in the world, at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. Domestic * Democratic Federation of Northern Syria ‚àí Former president of DFNS Salih Muslim said that Turkey and Russia are plotting to send a Jihadist army from Idlib to Afrin for future attacks against Kurds in Syria. * ‚àí The Syrian government welcomed the agreement; however, officials still vowed to the press to retake \\"every inch of Syria\\". The Syrian ambassador to Lebanon also said this would be a test of Turkey's ability to keep its promises. * ‚àí Mustafa Sejari, a Free Syrian Army official told journalists, \\"The Idlib deal preserves lives of civilians and their direct targeting by the regime. It buries Assad‚Äôs dreams of imposing his full control over Syria.\\" He added, \\"This area will remain in the hands of the Free Syrian Army and will force the regime and its supporters to start a serious political process that leads to a real transition that ends Assad‚Äôs rule.\\" Mahmoud Abbi the spokesman for the Turkish funded Free Idlib Police told the Guardian \\"Civilians in Idlib think this is a good deal, they feel hopeful and happy concerning it, We are grateful for Turkey‚Äôs efforts to prevent the Russian and Assad attack on Idlib. However ... we do not trust Russia about the deal. But for now it is better than displacement or bombing. The deal is for Turkey‚Äôs security but it is also face-saving for Putin and by association Assad, Iran refused to participate in this attack because of its own bad military and economic situation. The Assad regime is weak and has no ability to attack without the help of Iranian militias.\\" * Hayat Tahrir al-Sham ‚àí rejected the conditions of the deal on 19 September. Several high ranking leaders, including scholars in Tahrir al-Sham, expressed their dissatisfaction with the terms through outlets such as Telegram channels. Abu al-Fath al- Ferghali, a scholar in Tahrir al-Sham on Telegram, wrote on 19 September, \\"that who demands surrendering his weapon, whom ever he is, is undoubtedly an enemy, for giving up on this weapon is treason to religion, upholding the word of Allah and the blood of martyrs which has been scarified to get it.\\" While adding, \\"There is no worry about surrendering what is more important than arms, which is the areas liberated by the blood of the honest people. [. . .] The matter of concern is that the human and jinn would act as to disperse the lines of Mujahideen, inspiring doubt among them and justifying submission.\\" Zaid al-Attar another HTS official posted on Telegram, \\"Our weaponry is our pride and honor, as well as the safety valve to this blessed jihad; it is rather the only guarantee to the realization of the revolution‚Äôs aims of attaining dignity and freedom, for our enemy knows no other language but force.\\"Commanders of ‚ÄúTahrir al-Sham‚Äù Disapprove the Idlib Deal Terms, Enab Baladi 19 September 2018 No official stance was held by HTS until 14 October when Hayat Tahrir al-Sham published an official statement on the agreement entitled \\"The Revolution will not die\\", the statement detailed the group's stance as after a period of consultation it accepts the deal but the group will not abandon Jihad nor will they hand over weapons and it thanked individuals who had supported the group financially. * Jaysh al-Izza ‚àí on 20 September, Jamil al-Salih, the leader of the group, posted on Twitter though initially opposing the agreement, \\"All the thanks to our Turkish brothers who prevented warplanes and bombers from targeting our civilian people and all the shame and disgrace to those who left the Syrian people in the middle of the road and disappointed women and children,\\" The group is also considered a key ally to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham as well as a major Free Syrian Army faction. Later, on 29 October, the group went back to rejecting the deal, after it was announced that the zone will only include the areas of opposition control, and published a statement demanding an equally divided zone. The group also rejected the presence of Russian forces in rebel-held areas, and opposed the opening of highways until the Syrian government releases detainees.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DoQ8HbRXkAAyuUn.jpghttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DoQ8HbaXoAAvbsW.jpg * Ansar al-Din Front ‚Äì On 23 September, the group published a statement condemning the Sochi Agreement, stating it was an extension of the \\"disastrous\\" Astana Agreement, as well as saying the agreement was a destruction of the Revolution. *Guardians of Religion Organization ‚Äì On 22 September, a statement was published by the group titled \\"About the Recent Sochi Agreement (Dayton #2): We Did Not Strive To Remove The Tyrant To Replace With Another Tyrant\\". The statement said the most evil of forces have gathered together to destroy the Jihad in Syria, which is in a fragile state as it is and the agreement is part of the plot to destroy the goals of Jihad in Syria. The statement also said that these forces won their roles and share their influence and control. *Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, Jama'at Ansar al- Furqan in Bilad al Sham, and Ajnad al-Kavkaz have also all rejected the deal.

It is the most significant result of his 1853 trip to South America,Ayers, 17‚Äì19 where he would travel again in 1857. It is Church's first major painting, his largest work to date,Raab, 7, 45 and \\"an early masterpiece of Luminism\\", according to the Reynolda House Museum of American Art in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which holds the painting. Background and description The painting is a composite image of different climate zones, from snowy mountains in the distance to grasslands in the mid-ground and tropical flora in the foreground. Church's approach to landscape painting was influenced by Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who wrote of his travels in South America and exhorted painters to capture the beauty of the New World. Around the Chota Valley, Humboldt marvelled at the Andes' \\"symmetrical disposition in two lines from north to south\\", and noted that a plateau rather than a valley separated them. Thus the mountains in The Andes of Ecuador‚Äîprobably Tungurahua at left and Cotopaxi at right‚Äîare arranged along two lines that would converge near the painting's center. The plateau is a strong horizontal line just beneath that point. Humboldt encouraged painters to make sketches in the field, a practice not then common, and this painting shows the influence of Church's sketches in northern Ecuador and southern Colombia. In 1859, after his second trip south, Church painted his monumental The Heart of the Andes, another composite of South American landscapes and a re-interpretation of Humboldt's aesthetic ideas. The Andes of Ecuador depicted little tropical flora and its details were subdued by the strong light. (A contemporary critic in Harper's Weekly commented that \\"all detail, all shape [is] lost in the vastness of the gorges\\".) It excluded Chimborazo, the Ecuadorian mountain then thought to be the world's highest. In the 1859 painting, Church more clearly cataloged the diversity of plants and topography, culminating in Chimborazo, and used a more naturalistic lighting. The Andes of Ecuador retains some of the influence of Church's teacher, Thomas Cole. Cole believed that details should be limited in the search for a general, sublime effect. Although the painting is highly detailed throughout, the strong light of the Sun subordinates these details, providing the overall effect that Cole espoused.Raab, 49‚Äì50 (This would not be the case in The Heart of the Andes, which is given over to detail.) The sunlight casts the whole image in its radiance, making the distant mountains faint and creating shadows on the small foreground details like the grazing llamas. The painting of the Sun is noticeably built up in oils of white and yellow, in contrast to the smoothness of the other areas. Any criticism of the painting likely opined that the lighting was too strong. Themes Church, like Cole, continued to evoke Christian themes in his landscapes. Two small staffage figures visit a stone cross near the palm trees at bottom left, and a red-roofed Spanish mission appears at the end of the path near them. Most significant is the intersection of the sun's golden vertical rays with the plateau's line, forming a large but subtle cross. Church's art encouraged contemporary viewers to ponder on the spiritual and cosmic questions evoked therein. Church scholar David C. Huntington wrote in 1980 of The Andes of Ecuador: Provenance The painting was exhibited at the Boston Athen√¶um in early 1855, where it was seen by Henry Thoreau. It was bought by the railway tycoon William H. Osborn, and remained in the family until 1965. After passing through the hands of investment banker J. William Middendorf II and Kennedy Galleries, it was bought by the Reynolda House Museum of American Art in 1966.

The library is available on GitHub. It uses the underlying balanced binary tree structure using join-based algorithms . PAM supports four balancing schemes, including AVL trees, red-black trees, treaps and weight- balanced trees. PAM is a parallel library and is also safe for concurrency. Its parallelism can be supported by cilk, OpenMP or the scheduler in PBBS. Theoretically, all algorithms in PAM are work-efficient and have polylogarithmic depth. PAM uses underlying persistent tree structure such that multi-versioning is allowed. PAM also supports efficient GC. Interface =Sequences= To define a sequence, users need to specify the key type of the sequence. PAM supports functions on sequences including construction, find an entry with a certain rank, first, last, next, previous, size, empty, filter, map-reduce, concatenating, etc. =Ordered sets= To define an ordered set, users need to specify the key type and the comparison function defining a total ordering on the key type. On top of the sequence interface, PAM also supports functions for ordered sets including insertion, deletion, union, intersection, difference, etc. =Ordered maps= To define an ordered map, users need to specify the key type, the comparison function on the key type, and the value type. On top of the ordered set interface, PAM also supports functions for ordered maps, such as insertion with combining values. =Augmented maps= To define an augmented map, users need to specify the key type, the comparison function on the key type, the value type, the augmented value type, the base function, the combine function and the identity of the combine function. On top of the ordered map interface, PAM also supports functions for augmented maps, such as aug_range. In addition to the tree structures, PAM also implements the prefix structure for augmented maps. Implementation for Example Applications The library also provides example implementations for a number of applications, including 1D stabbing query (using interval trees, 2D range query (using a range tree and a sweepline algorithm), 2D segment query (using a segment tree and a sweepline algorithm), 2D rectangle query (using a tree structure and a sweepline algorithm), inverted index searching, etc. Used in applications The library has been tested in various applications, including database benchmarks, 2D segment tree, 2D interval tree, inverted index and multiversion concurrency control.

She continued there until the organization ceased to operate in 1930 due to the Depression. After this time Lutes concentrated on her writing and achieved success starting around 1935, initially combining her expertise in cookbooks and recipes with her memories of her Michigan childhood in a series of popular essays collected in The Country Kitchen (1936), which won a National Book Award for \\"Most Original Work\\". Lutes had many articles and stories published in a variety of magazines, including Vogue, Woman's Day, Farm Journal, American Mercury, Gourmet, and others, and a historical article on dime novelist (and Cooperstown resident) Erastus Beadle published in New York History.New York History, Vol. 22, no. 2 (April 1941), p. 147-157 Lutes died of a heart attack in 1942, shortly after finishing her final memoir, Cousin William. She was buried near her childhood home in Jackson, Michigan. Appreciations In a promotional blurb published on the dust jacket of one of her own books, L. M. Montgomery wrote of Lutes' The Country Kitchen, \\"I seemed on every page to be living over again my own childhood in that old P.E. Island kitchen I remember so well.

During the early years the band changed formation several times until Simon Rojas Hoces decided to establish a solid lineup with Ernesto \\"Virgo\\" Domiƒá and Esteban Domiƒá. The band is known for dealing with subjects such as social conscience, environmentalism. Their sound has been described as a high energy wall of sound, backed by steady drum beats and atmospheric vocals. Their skeptical message is what defines their lyrical and musical content. They released three studio albums. Their debut album Selknam was produced by Garth Richardson in The Farm Studios in Vancouver, Canada released in 2015. Their second album Similitude came out worldwide during 2017, both albums released by the record label Mainia Recordings in Los Angeles, California. What a Day is their third studio album which exposes critically the migrant crisis, 2019‚Äì20 Chilean protests. Under the watchful eye of Europeans, the current trio enjoys well-deserved media attention after ten years of musical journey, a persistence that has fueled the daily lives of the band in the old continent considered as key social whistleblowers among the community. Their first EP BeLIEve in rEVOlution was released in 2011, the band has recorded eight official videoclips. They have expanded their career throughout North America and South America, touring and performing in Knotfest, Texas Showdown, Kushstock Festival and other major shows since they signed under Sid Wilson's management with press exposure in Rolling Stone, Revolver (magazine), Loudwire. The band has performed in humanitarian causes and main venues across Europe in countries such as; Germany, the United Kingdom and vastly across Eastern Europe. History =Foundation and BeLIEve in rEVOlution (2010-2012)= The feeling of having a rock band came from Simon \\"Nowis\\" Rojas Hoces and Leonardo Signorelli. They were schoolmate during 97' in Santiago, Chile and became close friends listening intensely to rock music such as; Slipknot, Messhuggah, Alice in Chains, Nirvana and more harmonic rock; The Beatles, Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins, looking a way to put their musical influences, lifestyle and career together. After playing in different rock bands they came up with The Reaction together with Phillip Monypenny in bass and Diego Sagredo in guitar, they both came with musical influences based on Rammstein, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Atari Teenage Riot and industrial metal in general. At that time Alvaro Monz√≥n and Patricio G√≥nzales joined the band, playing the band's first performances, but soon departure the musical project during that same year. During the summer of 2010 the band recorded their first EP BeLIEve In rEVOLution with 14 full-length songs and 2 hidden tracks in Backstage Rockstore where they lived together. Rojas Hoces spent four months intensively producing, mixing and mastering to achieve the sound the band wanted to deliver at the time. In the beginning of their career they did shows around bars and clubs in the city and one local tour. Then during 2011 they decided to go to Vancouver, Canada to release their new EP internationally and get to sign with a record label. =Selknam (2012‚Äì2015)= The band did shows in Canada for three months until they met their first producer Garth Richardson in 2012 when the band was beginning to write Selknam, their first official album and changing their name from The Reaction to The ReAktion by a suggestion of the co-producer Garth Futcher during a concert in the punk venue Funky Winker Beans due to the controversial message of the band regarding their approach to consciousness. It took them almost a year to record Selknam, for it to be released afterwards in the beginning of 2015. In this period Felipe ‚ÄúIkaro‚Äù Alvar√©z joined as a tour member playing synth and backing vocals. After all this process, the band signed with the promoting agency Mach2point8ent and their first manager Sid Wilson from the world known alternative metal band Slipknot. This was the beginning of The Reaktion¬¥s U.S career. They did their first tour Art of Fury with the nu-metal band Otep which covered more than 60 cities in the US during 2015. The last show of this tour was in the famous Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood). That day the band signed with their first record label Mainia Recordings, in Los Angeles, California. After that tour, they had a recess and reconsidered their personal lives and thoughts. This led to Monypenny's departure of the band and after a couple of months Signorelli and Sagredo's departure by their own consent. Rojas Hoces and Felipe Alvar√©z continued the band and Garrett Wolf joined playing bass, whom they have met in Canada. The band grew and got involved with bands like Hollywood Undead, Tantric and performing in festivals such as; Knotfest California and Kushtock Festival in Downtown Los Angeles. The band continued touring North America, their concerts covered four times the U.S. territory, this to promote Selknam which also included performances in South America. After several shows during 2015 and 2016, the band was crossing El Paso, Texas going to a festival to perform but the band got in legal troubles. The band was forced to stop spending two months held. This became a creative process and the starting point of their new album Similitude where songs and lyrics were made. Inspired by horror, depression and the chihuahuan desert. The scenario created a completely new beginning for the band, Garrett Wolf and Felipe \\"Ikaro\\" Alvar√©z reconsidered their lives and progressively departure the band. During this time Rojas Hoces became the only member of the band. =Similitude (2016‚Äì2019)= From 2016 until 2017 The Reaktion made their second album Similitude in Invitro Studios Santiago de Chile which was written and produced by Rojas Hoces. From this period onwards the Domiƒá brothers Esteban and Virgo joined. They recorded most of the album's music after what Rojas Hoces had already done together with former members Moneypenny and Alvarez's collaboration. The album was successfully released on October 27, 2017, where it had again very good reception on the U.S press and very positive reviews regarding the originality of their music. On the local scene the band performed several shows, and toured extensively the South of Chile. Together with their record label Mainia Recordings and The Revels group, the band started to plan their return to the U.S to continue performing, which led to a bureaucratic struggle regarding the musicians visas. This led the band to develop its career in Europe, which the Domiƒá brothers had previously made career with alternative rock band Scomic since 2012. Since 2018 the band signed with Rock Zone Records in Hamburg, Germany and performed in popular venues and humanitarian action in Germany mainly regarding Tommy-Weisbecker-Haus cause. =What a Day (2020-present)= Musical style The musical concept of The ReAktion is founded on spirituality and the belief of metempsychosis by agreeing as being musicians. Their tuning is on the pythagorean tuning A432Hz, and their compositions are inspired by the mandelbrot set. The band has described and agrees; that this is what has given them exposure to the worldwide music industry, since most of the members where born in a culturally isolated country. Their style is mostly define as alternative rock with variations to alternative metal. Their overall compositions are made by guitar, bass, drums and in some songs synths.

According to William Hutchings' review at the Comparative Drama Conference Series 15, Goudouna's book is surely the most ever said about the least in the entire history of literary criticism. Goudouna was selected as the inaugural Andrew W. Mellon Foundation curator at Performa (performance festival) in New York City founded by Roselee Goldberg. Goudouna served as the director of the first European funded Art Residency and as the Visual Art Consultant of the Onassis Foundation Festival in New York. She curated a project with Paul B. Preciado with the participation of Karen Finley at the Parliament of Bodies public arts program at Documenta 14 and in 2019 she joined as head of operations Raymond Pettibon Studio  Education  Goudouna moved to London in 1996 where she settled until 2012. She received her BA (Hons) in Philosophy with Theatre from London Metropolitan University and holds a Master of Arts (MA) in Text, Performance and Directing from Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and in English Literature from Kings College, University of London. She holds a PhD from the University of London on high modernist theory focusing on Michael Fried and the work of Samuel Beckett supervised by David Bradby. Goudouna received a scholarship in 2002 from the Alexander S. Onassis Foundation Public Benefit Foundation to pursue her PhD research.  Early life  Goudouna was born in Athens, Greece. When she was 15 she co-organised, with a collective of five friends, the first renowned concert in Greece in support of ACT UP at the old brewery of FIX with the participation of school bands and of popular alternative bands including Deus Ex Machina, Groove Machine, Make Believe and Honey Dive. Goudouna first gained art world attention in 2000, when she directed for RADA a performance and visual art project in a listed house at Duke st in London, in collaboration with dancers from The Place based on Ritter, Dene, Voss by Thomas Bernhardt. The site specific project at Duke st alluded to Haus Wittgenstein's modernist house in Vienna.  Beckett's Breath  Goudouna's book Beckett's Breath: Antitheatricality and the Visual Arts was published by Edinburgh University Press in 2018 and released in the US by Oxford University Press. Samuel Beckett wrote Breath (play), a thirty-second playlet for the stage that does not include actors, text, characters or drama but only stage directions. Goudouna's monograph analyses the ways the piece became emblematic of the intermedia exchanges that occur in Beckett's later writings, as well as the cross-fertilisation of the theatre with the visual arts. The book examines Beckett's ultimate venture to define the borders between a theatrical performance and purely visual representation and juxtaposes Beckett's Breath with breath-related artworks by visual artists including Valie Export, Feminist Art Workers, Marcel Duchamp, Piero Manzoni, Gerhard Richter, Bridget Riley, Giuseppe Penone, John Latham, Vito Acconci, Chris Burden, Nancy Spero, Lygia Clark, Art & Language, Marina Abramoviƒá.  Performa Biennial (New Visual Performance Festival)  Goudouna was selected in May 2015 as the first Andrew W. Mellon Foundation curatorial fellow at Performa. In 2005 Performa (performance festival) hosted the first Performa Biennial, a series of performance events at venues and institutions across New York City by its founding curator and editor Roselee Goldberg. For the 2005 Biennial the Solomon R. Guggenheim presented Marina Abramoviƒá's Seven Easy Pieces, in which Abramoviƒá re-performed several works from the canon of early performance works, including two of her own. Performances included works by Gina Pane, Vito Acconci, Valie Export, Bruce Nauman, and Joseph Beuys. For Performa15, that celebrated ten years since the founding of the Performa biennial in 2005, Goudouna worked for the production of new commissions by artists Yvonne Rainer, Tania Bruguera, Francesco Vezzoli, David Hallberg, Juliana Huxtable, Robin Rhode, Laura Lima, Heather Phillipson, Chimurenga, Edgar Arceneaux, Erika Vogt and Performa alums J√©r√¥me Bel, Jesper Just among others. During Goudouna's post in 2015, Performa announced a new partnership with the Paris- based arts organisation Lafayette Anticipation, Fondation Galeries Lafayette. For Performa, Goudouna initiated the commissions from Performa Archives among other initiatives.  Raymond Roussel Society  Goudouna curated a production on Raymond Roussel's Locus Solus that was presented from 2009 until 2010 as a location driven project in Shunt Vaults Shunt (theatre company) London Bridge, The Byzantine and Christian Museum and the Benaki Museum, as well as in public spaces in Elephant and Castle. For this project Goudouna collaborated with Werner Nekes, Mat Collishaw, Flux Factory NYC, The International Institute for Important Items and more than 100 artists and architects. Owing to Goudouna's extensive research on Roussel she was invited to participate in the tribute to John Ashbery.Raymond Roussel Society consists of a special team of creators, thinkers and artists who were profoundly affected by Roussel. The Raymond Roussel Society honoured John Ashbery with the Raymond Roussel Society Medal in June 2017 in New York.  Ecological activities  Sozita Goudouna has been widely involved in ecological Activism. She ran for the municipal elections of the island of Hydra in 2010 as a member of the Ecological Association The Hydra Seal. Since 1988 she is a member of the association which was founded in 1988 in Hydra (island) with the aim to protect the environment and Greek cultural heritage within the broad areas of archaeology, traditional settlements and submarine antiquities in Hydra (island) and Dokos . The range of the Association's activities covers the protection of natural reserves, protected species and most notably the Mediterranean monk seal \\"Monachus- Monachus\\" Mediterranean monk seal which lives and reproduces in the Myrtoan Sea and the eastern part of the Peloponnese. The ecological association has received support from Stavros Niarchos Foundation. In 2002 she became a board member of the association. As a board member she co-organised projects in collaboration with the Zoology Department at the University of Athens, the University of the Aegean, the Ministry of Environment, Energy & Climate Change, the European Union and other organisations including WWF World Wide Fund for Nature and mother Society for the Study and Protection of the Mediterranean Monk Seal. The projects that she is actively involved include the following: The Association's protection of the traditional settlements and the archaeological heritage have led to six executive decrees for the benefit of Hydra, including the 1993 the transference of jurisdictions from the Ministry of Environment, Energy & Climate Change and the Ministry of the Aegean Sea to the Ministry of Culture. In 1994 the ancient island of \\"Aperopia\\" Dokos known today as \\"Dokos\\" was proclaimed as \\"Non-building Zone A\\" and the sea around Dokos an archaeological park. In 1996, Hydra was declared an archaeological space and every settlement of the island was held under the auspices of the state. In 1998,the department of Byzantine and post- Byzantine Monuments resulted in the placing of signs/epigraphs in Hydra under particular specifications. In 2002, the association resolved the issue of the ban of vehicles in Hydra with the publication of a joint Ministerial decree regarding the circulation of vehicles in the island. The Association is organising events with institutions including the \\"Hellenic Society for the Protection of the Environment and the Cultural Heritage,\\" the Goulandris Natural History Museum,the Benaki Museum, the National Gallery,the Byzantine Museum and National Television ERT where Goudouna presented a show on Art and Upcycling Bibliography * 2018 Beckett's Breath: Antitheatricality and the Visual Arts Edinburgh University Press * Space, Kenji Aoki, Monograph, Kehrer Verlag in English and German (forthcoming). * 2018 Mat Chivers in Horea Avram (ed) Moving Images, Mobile Bodies.

She has contributed heavily to efforts to obtain an effective HIV vaccine. She created a database at Los Alamos National Laboratory that has enabled her to design novel mosaic HIV vaccines, one of which is currently in human testing in Africa. The database contains thousands of HIV genome sequences and related data. Korber is a scientist in theoretical biology and biophysics. at Los Alamos National Laboratory. She has received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy's highest award for scientific achievement. She has also received several other awards including the Elizabeth Glaser Award for pediatric AIDS research and the Richard Feynman Award for Innovation.  Early life and education  Bette Korber grew up in Southern California. She earned her B.S. in chemistry in 1981 from California State University, Long Beach, where her father was a sociology professor, her mother graduated in nursing, and her sister graduated in journalism. From 1981 to 1988, she was in the graduate program at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where she worked with Iwona Stroynowski in Leroy Hood's laboratory, receiving her PhD in chemistry in 1988. Her work focused on regulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex type 1 genes, producing cell surface proteins that participate in the rejection of tissue transplants, by interferon induced by viral infections. She then became a postdoctoral fellow with Myron Essex, working on the molecular epidemiology of the AIDS/HIV virus and HTLV-1, the human leukemia virus, at the Harvard School of Public Health until 1990. There, Korber used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to show both complete and deleted versions of viral genomes in leukemic cells. Her work on these viral partial and complete genomes was influential and widely cited.. She became a visiting faculty member at the Santa Fe Institute in 1991, continuing in that position until 2011.  Research  HIV release from infected cell Korber conducts her research at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where she began in 1990. Her approach involves applying computational biology to the design of a vaccine against the HIV/AIDS virus. She first became interested in HIV when a close friend of hers and her fianc√©'s at Caltech contracted one of the first cases of AIDS in Pasadena, California. She said, \\"We learned a lot about HIV while he was sick. But there was no treatment for him and he died in 1991. I decided when I graduated from my PhD program that I wanted to work on HIV.\\". Several years later, looking back on this event, she described its effects: \\"I hate HIV ... I lost a couple friends to it. HIV kills in horrible ways. I think of what the epidemic has done to Africa and it motivates me.\\" = HIV database = Phylogenetic tree showing HIV compared to SIV Korber oversees the HIV Database and Analysis Project at Los Alamos. She and her team have built a global HIV database of more than 840,000 sequences from publications of the viral genome. In addition, the database focuses on the small regions (called epitopes) within the virus that can be recognized by antibodies, and evaluates the evidence for the strength of each epitope in eliciting immune responses. There is also data on the immunological profiles of individuals resistant to HIV. Korber and many other researchers have applied the data to devise possible treatments and vaccines against HIV. Her work has resulted in design of vaccines now being tested in clinical trials. = HIV vaccine design = Creating a vaccine against HIV has been challenging because the virus mutates rapidly, creating multiple variants that may not be recognized by immune system components specific to the original infecting virus. The most variable region is the surface of the virus, but there is also some variation of the internal proteins involved in virus replication, which may be attacked by the cellular immunity system or T cell responses. A recent approach that Korber and collaborators have taken is to design mosaic antigens. Korber developed a novel mosaic HIV vaccine that may slow or prevent HIV infection; this is currently in human testing in Africa. The goal of the mosaic antigen vaccine is to protect the vaccinated person against the great variety of HIV variants encountered. Since the proteins of HIV vary so greatly, mosaic test proteins are designed to represent the most common forms of HIV-1 virus that can be recognized by antibodies or cellular immune responses (epitopes). In 2009, Korber described the process: \\"I create sort of little Frankenstein proteins that look and feel like HIV proteins but they don't exist in nature.\\" Several of the major variations are included in each molecule of protein, thus producing a variant protein antigen that probably does not exist in the wild virus population but should cross-react with variants that do exist. Korber has taken two different approaches to designing such antigens. Her group has developed a computer algorithm to choose epitopes to combine into a mosaic molecule for the mosaic antigens. In 2009, she described a designed mosaic protein this way: \\"People didn't know if it would fold properly, if it would be antigenic, or if it would have the same sites that recognized by killer T cells\\". They found that the newly designed antigens did fold properly and acted as a strong antigen, and were recognized by the cytotoxic T cells (killer cells). Also, Korber and her collaborators have developed a graphical analysis called Epigraph that can generate promising antigens with a mixture of epitopes. Korber explains that the approach of designing a protein via computer, combining bits of known proteins that provoke immune responses, had never been tried. She says, \\"Even after it worked, it was hard to convince people that this novel thing could be a vaccine because it hadn't been done before\\". In collaboration with Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard Medical School, some of these antigens have been tested in monkeys as possible vaccines. With one series of tests, Barouch checked a number of possible ways to deliver the virus genes and chose to use the common cold virus as a vehicle. The tested mosaic vaccine routinely slowed monkey infection with the closely related Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), and for 66 percent of monkeys exposed multiple times, no infection resulted. Next, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies (a division of Johnson & Johnson), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the researchers tested a mosaic vaccine for safety in human subjects; it passed that test too. In 2017, the group of collaborators announced a human efficiency test with that same mosaic protein preparation, vaccinating 2,600 women in Sub Saharan Africa, who will be examined for several years to show how efficiently, if at all, the virus interferes with infection. Korber cautioned that effectiveness of this strategy in monkeys is not a guarantee that a human vaccine will work. In recognition of her research, Korber received the 2018 Feynman Award for Innovation, the first woman at Los Alamos National Laboratory to receive one. She recalled that at Caltech when few women were there, she took a class with physicist Richard Feynman and became friends with him. She said, \\"At a time when kindness seemed rare, I really appreciated his generous spirit and encouragement. I think he would have been pleased about this award\\". = Dating the HIV-1 virus = In the history of HIV/AIDS virus with regard to when and where HIV originated, Edward Hooper had postulated in a best-selling book called The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS in 1999 that HIV could have jumped from chimpanzees to humans because of an accidental contamination by chimpanzee SIV of the oral polio vaccine (CHAT) used in Africa in the 1950s. Korber and her colleagues employed the Los Alamos National Laboratory database's genomic data to calculate when the HIV sequence evolution began, using a model of evolution based on the mutation rate of HIV strains and assuming that variable was the same on all branches of the evolutionary tree. In 2000 they published an estimate of approximately 1930 for the origin of the human immunodeficiency virus. Their research was covered widely as establishing a new date for the origin of the human virus, discrediting the oral polio virus theory, and therefore refuting concerns about using oral polio vaccine (OPV). These two concepts of the origin of this virus plus other related theories continued to compete for scientific credibility. In 2008, Worobey and collaborators used a computer modeling approach similar to Korber's but with a relaxed evolutionary model and two older samples, collected earlier than any genomes included in Korber's study, and found an origin date for HIV of approximately 1900.  Personal life  Korber married James Theiler in 1988. They have two sons. Out of her concern for the impact of AIDS on those with few financial resources, Korber contributed $50,000 from her EO Lawrence Award to help establish, along with family and friends, an AIDS orphanage in South Africa, working through Nurturing Orphans of AIDS for Humanity (NOAH). She has joined the Board of NOAH. She also contributed to the distribution of Earth Boxes of maintenance- free portable gardens to orphanages, clinics, and schools in Africa.

Paul's traditional name is ', which translates as, \\"a welcoming person with a wealth of knowledge, someone who shares her culture\\".  Early life  Elsie Paul (n√©e Timothy) was born in 1931 in the Tla'amin Nation to parents, Gilbert Francis and Lily Timothy. Paul was later adopted by her maternal grandparents, Jim and Molly Timothy, who raised her in Tla'amin Nation. Elsie survived 2 years of residential school and was then protected by her grandparents who moved her along the coast of British Columbia in order to avoid residential school. Paul's experiences avoiding residential school provided the opportunity to learn the traditional knowledge, skills, language, and customs of the Tla'amin Nation; an uncommon experience for Indigenous children and people at that time. At the age of 18 Elsie Timothy married William Dave Paul and took the last name Paul. Elsie and William Paul had 9 children together, Sharon (deceased), Jane (Deceased) Glen, Jeannie, Walter, Ann, Cathy, Marlane, and Clifford (Deceased) and were married until William's death in 1977.  Education  Paul completed her grade 10 level of schooling as well as upgrading and finally her certification as a Social Worker from the University of British Columbia. She received an Honorary Doctorate degree from Vancouver Island University in 2009, recognizing her longstanding work for her communities.  Work  Before beginning her career as a Social Worker, Elsie travelled the province doing a variety of jobs from working on fish farms, to housekeeping in the hospital, and shucking oysters. In 1972 Elsie Paul took over the position of Administrator in the Social Services Department in Tla'amin, she worked there for 24 years. She was one of the founders of the Tsow-Tun-Lelum House Treatment Centre, a Healing Lodge specializing in substance abuse, trauma, and support for survivors of residential schools, she served as Justice of the Peace in Victim Support Services and Aboriginal Policing, and she also taught part-time at Malaspina College.

The school was included as a contributing property in the Fort Street Historic District on November 12, 1982. It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 17, 1982. History In the late 1920s and early 1930s, several independent schools and small school districts were consolidated under the larger Boise School District, and soon arose a need for additional classroom space. Moreover, the district reorganized its schools from an eight-grade primary and four-grade secondary system to an elementary, junior high, and senior high school system. The district received a grant from the Works Progress Administration allowing construction of Boise's first junior high. The school was constructed by contractor J.O. Jordan & Son from locally sourced brick and sandstone, and the building was dedicated in 1937. When South Junior High School was constructed in 1948, Boise Junior High School was renamed North Junior High School. A band room was added to the building in 1949, and a cafeteria was added in 1968. History of Lemp Triangle The school was constructed on a , 2-block parcel of land known as Lemp Triangle, named for brewer and former Boise City mayor John Lemp. On November 23, 1867, mayor Henry E. Prickett filed the original 410-acre plat of Boise City in the office of the Ada County Recorder, and on January 13, 1868, Prickett petitioned the United States Department of the Interior for a townsite patent. But on May 2, 1870, Boise City received an award of 442 acres from the Department of the Interior, an increase of 32 acres of public property over the original townsite plat. Part of the 32-acre parcel remained unimproved, and on June 5, 1891, mayor James A. Pinney deeded 4.55 acres of the parcel to John Lemp in exchange for $1.00 consideration. Lemp occupied the property, and by 1905 he was renting it to a \\"China vegetable garden,\\" but by then his claim of ownership was in dispute, and a new deed to the property was presented to Lemp by mayor John M. Haines in 1908. Voters rejected a bond measure in 1910 that would have provided $40,000 for the purchase of Lemp Triangle and would have designated the property as a city park. Then in 1913, after a decision by the Idaho Supreme Court declaring the Lemp deeds unlawful, Boise City regained control of the property and designated it as a park. The Boise School Board voted to purchase the property for $22,500 in June, 1925, for construction of a junior high school, and the site also was considered briefly for additional construction of an elementary school to replace the aging Whittier School. Boise Junior High School construction would be delayed for over ten years, however, and excavation at Lemp Triangle finally began early in March, 1936. The cornerstone was set in place by buildings and grounds superintendent C. B. Little on May 21, 1936, and the building was dedicated May 24, 1937. The residential area north and east of Lemp Triangle was developed in 1911, including 65 homesites in what was dubbed the Lemp Triangle Addition. Lemp street runs east and west, seven blocks north of Lemp Triangle. The street is part of Boise's North End.

It also saw action during the Second World War. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it didn't necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 164 mod√®le 1893/96 TAZ began life as eight Canon de 164 mm Mod√®le 1893 naval guns which were converted by Schneider to railroad guns during the First World War. They were typical built-up guns of the period with steel construction consisting of a rifled steel liner and several layers of steel reinforcing hoops. The guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The first two guns were converted and delivered to the French Army in 1916, followed by two in 1917 and four more guns of a simplified design in 1918-19. The guns were mounted on a top carriage traverse mount with a gun shield in the middle of a 4-axle rail carriage. It also had a circular firing platform for the crew that had to be folded up for travel. There were ammunition storage casemates at both ends of the carriage and the armor was sufficient to provide protection from shell splinters and gunfire. The mount was capable of 360¬∞ of traverse at elevations from +10¬∞ to +40¬∞ with a maximum range of and was often used for counter- battery fire. At lower elevations, the casemates at either end of the carriage interfered with traverse which limited the gun's firing arc to approximately 90¬∞ on each side. Carriages with this capability were known as Tous Azimuts or TAZ for short. The guns used a top-carriage recoil system where the gun sat on a cradle which held the trunnioned barrel. When fired a combination of hydraulic buffers and inclined rails on the firing platform returned the gun to position. Once in position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wooden beams the firing platform was unfolded and a combination of screw jacks, outriggers, and rail clamps stabilized the carriage during firing. It shared its railroad carriage with the Canon de 19 mod√®le 1870/93 TAZ. World War II Eight of these railroad guns remained in French service after the end of World War I. Four were assigned to the 12th battery of the Heavy Artillery Regiment 374¬∞ of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferr√©e) during the Second world war. At least four were captured by the Germans and given the designation 16 cm Kanone (E.) 454(f) although what use was made of them, if any, is unknown.

Having served in the Palm Beach Police Department since 1981, he has been involved in several high- profile criminal investigations in the affluent town with several nationally- prominent residents, including the overdose death of David Kennedy and the criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Reiter came to international attention since the mid-2000s when he initiated the first inquiry into Epstein, a billionaire investor who was accused of involvement in multinational child sex trafficking and having sex with a minor, and was later convicted for soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.  Early life and education  Reiter grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While serving as a police officer, he earned several college degrees and certifications in law enforcement and public safety. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Florida Atlantic University and a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University. Reiter also graduated from the Senior Executives in State and Local Government Program and the Crisis Management Program at the Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Reiter is also a graduate of the FBI National Academy and the U.S. Secret Service's Dignitary Protection Program.  Career  Before joining the police department in the Town of Palm Beach, Florida, Reiter served as a campus police officer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1981, at 22 years old, he moved to Palm Beach and joined the Palm Beach Police Department (PBPD) as a patrol officer and later became a detective investigating organized crime, substance abuse, and vice. In 1984, one of his first cases as a detective was investigating the source of illegal drugs after the death of David Kennedy. Reiter was the lead investigator on the highly publicized case involving the third son of Ethel and Robert F. Kennedy. For two years, he investigated the cocaine suppliers that provided the illegal drugs that led to Kennedy's overdose death. Even a decade later, Reiter continued to get tips from supposed informants who claimed to have new information on the case. Reiter was promoted to sergeant in 1985. By 1989, he was head of the Organized Crime, Vice, and Narcotics Unit. He continued to rise through the ranks to captain in 1992, and major in 1993, before serving as assistant chief for three years beginning in 1998. Reiter was later appointed as chief of the police department in March 2001. At the same time, he served as vice-chairman of the Palm Beach County Anti-Terrorism Committee in 2003 and chairman of the committee in 2004. In November 2004, he also served as chairman of the Palm Beach County Election Security Task Force. In 2004, Reiter initiated the first inquiry into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible involvement in human trafficking. Prior to the investigation, Epstein had made donations to the PBPD for the purchase of additional equipment needed to investigate a crime in which Epstein was the victim. However, Reiter grew suspicious of the billionaire after his officers received reports of suspicious activity around Epstein's home‚Äîsuch as young women entering and exiting the home at odd hours and loitering on the block. The department launched a several-months-long investigation and gathered \\"sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses.\\" Reiter requested that Epstein be charged with at least four counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor with girls as young as 14 years old. The chief also returned the recent donations to PBPD back to Epstein. After turning the evidence over to prosecutors, Reiter was \\"outraged\\" to learn that the State Attorney's office offered Epstein a plea agreement. On May 1, 2006, the PBPD requested an arrest warrant be issued for Epstein's arrest, and Reiter wrote a letter to Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer, \\"all but demanding that [Krischer] recuse himself from the case.\\": \\"Reiter took the extraordinary step of writing Barry Krischer a letter all but demanding that he recuse himself from the case.\\" At a grand jury hearing in July 2006, state prosecutors obtained an indictment of one count of felony solicitation of prostitution. Again dissatisfied by the outcome, Reiter contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta. Reiter also sent letters to the each of victim's parents explaining that he believed justice had not been served. Epstein, under threat of federal prosecution, agreed to plead guilty to the state charge of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution, served a 13-month jail sentence, and was registered as a sex offender. On January 23, 2009, Reiter announced his retirement from the Palm Beach Police Department, effective February 27, after 28 years with the department and the last eight years as the police chief. Following his retirement from the department, Reiter started Michael Reiter and Associates, a Palm Beach-based firm that provides private security, crisis management, and investigative services.  Personal life  Reiter is married to Janet Pleasants, and they continue to live in Palm Beach. He is a historian with a particular interest in early Palm Beach history. Reiter acts as Palm Beach's unofficial town historian, and he was the initial organizer of the town's centennial celebration in 2011. In 1996, with the help of the Historical Society of Palm Beach County, Reiter rediscovered the first two and, as of 2006, the only PBPD officers to die in the line of duty: Joseph Smith (d. 1923) and John Cash (d. 1926). In May 2006, the officers were commemorated with an inscribed plaque in Memorial Fountain Park. In June 1999, he also rediscovered the lost story of a West Palm Beach Police (WPBP) officer, William Morgan Payton, who was killed while on duty. While researching the unrelated deaths in his own police department's early history, Reiter discovered a press clipping about the 1924 trial on Payton's death and alerted the WPBP. Payton was later recognized as the first West Palm Beach Police officer killed in the line of duty.

He was the son of Fara Penda, who was a Waalo noble, as well as a direct descendant of Laman Jaw, who was the king of the Jolof in 1285. Yoro was in command of the canton of Foss-Galodjina and was set over W√¢lo (Ou√¢lo) by Louis Faidherbe, where he served as a chief from 1861 to 1914.  Biography  Dyao graduated in 1860 as one of the earliest graduates of Governor Faidherbe's Ecole des Otages, which was founded in 1855. He was one of many West African authors during the colonial era who wrote chronicles on the history (e.g., Wolof history) and culture of the people (e.g., Wolof) of Senegal, to have their works translated by Maurice Delafosse, Octave Houdas, and Henri Gaden. His Histoire des Damels de Cayor was published in Moniteur du Senegal (1864). Among the people interviewed and works reviewed by Eunice A. Charles, Dyao's account of the Jolof Empire, published in Legendes et Coutumes Senegalaises, cahiers de Yoro Dyao, known in English as Senegalese legends and customs: notebooks of Yoro Dy√¢o, was regarded as being the most detailed. It was also regarded as a valuable and remarkable contribution to Revue d'Ethnographie et de Sociologie. Dyao's notebooks detail indigenous Senegalese thought, life, and tradition, as well as the basic elements of Wolof society and institutions, such as the family structure, the caste system, and degrees of nobility. For instance, his work described griots, who, within the social hierarchy of artisans (nyeenyo), there were musicians (sab-lekk), drummers (tamakat), and xalmbaan, who used violin-like instruments to play their music. The works of Dyao also detailed the Ndyadyane Ndyaye legend, the Jolof Empire's founding, and the inauguration of kings in Senegal. His works highlighted the existence of a customary belief that supernatural forces reconstitute the Jolof Empire under the Buurba as well as indicated that the normal growth and development of planted anointed seeds were regarded as key to the prosperity of the Jolof Empire. Senegalese historian, Boubacar Lam, a disciple of Cheikh Anta Diop, also encountered the compiled and collected work of Yoro Dyao, such as his works on migrations from the Nile Valley to West Africa. Yoro Dyao indicated that there was a widespread oral tradition among the peoples of Senegal and Senegambia: \\"The general opinion in all of Senegambia being that our country owes its peopling to migrations out of Egypt, from which descend all of its population.\\" In Chronicles of Senegalese Fo√πta, Dyao gave account of six population migrations from Egypt to Senegambia: * In the first migration, composed of the Dya'go, Dyao highlighted that they migrated out of Egypt armed with metal (hogo) assegais, sabers, daggers, and knives, bringing along with them armor, as well as their industrious wisdom of metallurgy; they inaugurated the sorghum culture to prevent flooding from the Senegal River; the migration took place under the king of Egypt, identified as \\"Pate Lamine\\"; the words, whether used separately or together, are used among the Mandinka, the Peuls, the Khassonk√©, the Sarakholl√©, and to some extent, among the Wolof. * In the second migration, composed of the Manna (named after their chief leader), which was caused by the vexations of the king of Egypt, Soss√© Tour√©, Dyao notes that they were much more numerous than the Dya'go; they sojourned through the desert, settled near the Senegal River, and peopled Fouta; as they seized political power from the Galos, their leaders bore the title of Fari (Emperor), which is used among the Wolof and Peul. The Bambara, Malink√©, Sonink√©, and Khassonk√© are also said to have come along with this migration. * In the third migration, composed of the Tondyon people, Dyao made note of their migration being more important than the Dya'go and Manna migrations, as they had seized the titles and rights to rule from the Fari and bestowed it upon their leaders, the Farang; Farang was a title used for their rulers, as well as the king of Egypt, who caused them to expatriate due to the continuous menial tasks they were being commanded to perform; as part of an extended Farang Empire, some of the migrants settled near the Senegal River, in the Sokhotoro, Kindila, Gangari, and Tambo-Dougoura, and became known as Sonink√©. The Bambara, Malink√©, and Khassonk√© are also said to have come along with this migration. * In the fourth and fifth migrations, composed of Tourmiss and Koli-Tenguella, respectively, which was caused due to the excessive demands of the Farang of Egypt, it was noted by Dyao as being comparatively smaller than the Dya'go, Manna, and Tondyon migrations; while partly composed of Sonink√©, Bambara, Malink√©, Khassonk√©, and other Manding, these migrations were largely composed of Fulani, to which the leader, Tourmiss, belonged, and ultimately, resulted in the spread of the Fulani throughout the six countries of Senegambia. * In the sixth migration, composed of the Turi-Siny, or Lam-Toro (also the title of its leader), Moussa departed with some of the group he would travel with, from Tripi Sing, near Mecca, and others from the group in Egypt; he arrived as a cavalry in Senegal, overthrew Ymido, defeated the Kalimou quarter, and proclaimed himself king, which led to subsequent migrations and state formations in the region.

Nia Nal is the first transgender superhero on television.  Storylines  Nia Nal, who has a degree in international relations from Georgetown University, was a political speechwriter in Washington, D.C. where she worked for Cat Grant, the White House Press Secretary, under the administration of President Olivia Marsdin. She is sent to National City to be taken under the wing of Catco Worldwide Media employee Kara Danvers to learn the ways of reporting. As there is increasing anti-alien hatred in the United States, Nia, who reveals herself to be transgender, convinces Catco CEO James Olsen to write an editorial against this hatred. Kara and Nia later interview a healer alien, Amadei, to counter the anti-alien rhetoric. Afterwards, Kara and James discover that Nia has narcolepsy. Nia wakes up suddenly from a dream involving the alien-hating Ben Lockwood. When Kara visits her, Nia reveals she is an alien from the planet Naltor, and select women of this race develop the power of precognition. Brainy, another alien, helps Nia with her dreams which lead them to Lockwood, who is ultimately arrested after being confronted. Nia has ill confidence about her family when she develops the unwanted \\"Dreamer\\" powers that occur to one female in every generation in her family.

J-Novel Club has licensed the light novel and manga series for English releases in July 2019, with the first English-translated volume being published in November 2019. An anime television series adaptation by Ekachi Epilka aired from July 4 to September 19, 2019. Episode 12 ended by claiming, \\"To be continued!\\" Plot As Akira Ono prepares to shut down the servers of his creation, the MMORPG Infinity Game, he suddenly finds himself in the body of his character, Demon Lord Hakuto Kunai, after an unexplained event. The new world he wakes up in appears to be set within Infinity Game, but with some differences. He encounters and summons various companions who join him on his travels, and his reputation of \\"Demon Lord\\" spreads throughout the land, making him a target. Eventually, Ono/Kunai finds himself having to deal with the sociological problems of the Kingdom of Holy Light and the Satanist cult that opposes it, as he continues to pursue his mission of finding out why and how he was summoned. Characters =Main= ; / : :Akira Ono is the creator of Infinity Game and has been its administrator for 15 years. He has an average, unassuming appearance who firmly believes God does not exist; outside of that, he seems perfectly ordinary. Through thousands of hours of gameplay he has become extremely experienced at his work, and as a functional employed adult has excellent acting skills, which he uses to maintain the appearance of his character, the self-proclaimed Demon Lord of the Great Empire Hakuto Kunai. He takes on Kunai‚Äôs appearance of a tall man with sharp black eyes, long black hair, and the clothing of a mafia boss upon his summoning into the game's world. He smokes constantly, reinforcing the image of a mobster, and is quite sociable but becomes shy around women. He does not like being accused for actions he did not commit and prefers to avoid violence where possible, but won't hold back if he feels his actions are justified. Since Ono is sharing a body with Kunai‚Äôs original personality, he can also be quite brutal towards his enemies, a side that the magic ring obtained from an idol he inquired attempts to appeal to. As Demon Lord, he boasts high levels of durability, physical strength, and numerous techniques, but no magic resistance, as he notes magic was not a proper mechanic in the original Infinity Game. He gains skill points for killing enemies, which he can spend to create items out of hammerspace, summon one of his 8 NPCs to aid him, or unlock more administrator actions. His current goal is to find as much information as he can as to who, why, and how he was summoned, and if he can return back home. Like Akira, Kunai is also an atheist, though this is because he thinks of himself as a god. His novel/manga design features slit pupils, and his chin shape and hair aren't as long. ; : :Aku is a 13 year old girl with short blonde hair, an androgynous appearance, and heterochromia eyes, one red and one green. Her long fringe covers the left side of her face, over her green eye. She is the first friend Kunai makes once inside the game, unable to walk well because of an infected right leg. Aku was orphaned by disease at a young age, and this status, along with her unusual eyes, lead the other people in her village to bully and abuse her, forcing her to carry out the village's worst jobs such as waste disposal; she didn't complain as she just wanted to be helpful. When the demon king Greol appeared and demanded human sacrifices from the nearby villages, Aku was cast out to be killed, but fled until she was saved by Kunai and became his partner. Initially keeping her for exposition about the world around him, Kunai came to see Aku as a daughter figure over time. At first she was hesitant of Kunai's hospitality because her poor upbringing had conditioned her to believing that she was undeserving of such luxury, but after giving her several baths, shelter, buying food and clothes, and healing her leg, she has come to see the Demon Lord as the nicest person she has ever met, constantly stating his acts are like that of dreams, and the one she wants to stay with, regardless if he is evil or not. Aku's name means \\"evil\\" in Japanese, which Kunai notes the irony of. Her anime design gives her somewhat longer hair than the novel/manga, but is otherwise similar. ; : :Luna is a 16 year old girl with rose coloured hair and eyes. The youngest of the Holy Maidens in the Kingdom of Holy Light, she respects her sisters while in their presence but is determined to one day surpass them both. Her natural talent and high levels of magical power have made her self- centred and narcissistic with an inflated opinion of her own abilities, though when faced with her first real fight, her lack of experience left her unable to make quick decisions and she was swiftly and embarrassingly defeated by Kunai. She has also neglected her own province, letting the Church manage it for her at a bare-minimum state, until Kunai decides to turn it into a resort to generate income from nobles. After developing a tsundere relationship with Kunai, she decided to continue travelling with him, often becoming jealous when he pays attention to other girls. She befriends Aku quickly and treats her like a little sister. Initially wearing a monastic habit fitting of her title, Kunai later has her wear a school uniform so as to avoid her standing out. In the novel/manga, her design was simpler, decorated with cross-shaped pins on her hair and frill dress, and the veil absent; this design was shared amongst the other Holy Maidens. =Supporting= ; : :Killer Queen is the 17 year old middle sister of the Holy Maidens, though her aggressive, vulgar personality is more fitting of her name than the title. She is a wild beauty otherwise, with amber eyes, messy braided golden hair that reaches to her ankles, a voluptuous figure, and wearing a white and blue short dress with black leggings and gold boots. Rather than a Holy Maiden, Queen is a warrior who prefers the frontlines, riding in a war chariot. She has high skill and sense in close combat, using a variety of melee weapons. Her rough demeanour is changed for the first time upon seeing Kirisame Zero appear and effortlessly beating a large amount of Satanists and clearing away the Hades miasma that was weakening her. Due to Zero being the first man to ever treat her like a proper lady, she has since devoted her life to finding and being with Zero, to the point of obsession. In the novel/manga, all three Holy Maidens wore identical outfits and appearances; Queen received the most drastic revision for her anime design. ; : :Angel White is the 18 year old eldest sister of the Holy Maidens. She is the only one of the three who can be considered \\"normal\\", as she is calm, religious, straightforward, and always tries to analyse the situation. She has long vivid pink hair and fuchsia eyes, wears a white veil and gown dress that exposes her cleavage, elbow-length gloves, silver boots, and is described as beautiful beyond compare; even Kunai is taken aback by how attractive she is. White is very suspicious and cautious of Kunai's reputation as the Demon Lord, wondering if the rumour that demon king Greol being slain was true. She then suffers a brief nervous breakdown when she finds her younger sisters going through drastic changes in their behaviour, with no obvious reason why. When the two do finally meet, White becomes anxious as to why Kunai is intent on researching Seraph, one of the angels said to have created the kingdom. She is also in disbelief how Luna, the embodiment of selfishness, was tamed by Kunai so fast, attributing it to brainwashing. Their conversation ends on seemingly amicable terms, with White agreeing to wait and see for his accomplishments before judging him, but still remains uneasy of what Kunai's end goal could be. When Kunai later gifts her an angel halo, she confuses Kunai with \\"Lucifer\\" thanks to a series of misunderstandings, and swears she will guide him to the right path. During this time she develops romantic feelings for him, but she herself does not seem to be aware of this. In the novel/manga, all three Holy Maidens wore identical outfits and appearances. ; : :The first of Akira Ono's NPC's to be summoned by Kunai; a 22 year old appealing woman with long black hair, black eyes, and a laboratory coat who served as a boss of \\"Nightless City\\" in the original Infinity Game. She is described as a brilliant mad scientist, but also a sadist with an attraction to young boys. Her innate power \\"Hand of God\\" allows her to morph her fingers into surgical instruments and exterminate any illness and cure any wound, which can only be described as cheating. Kunai chose Yu with the intent of having her invent a solution to his lack of magic resistance, as well as to have someone to confide his situation to, but forbade her to kill so as to focus on gathering information. She initially proposes using the Nightless City, but it was turned down because their world had a cyberpunk setting, and the act of bringing in an urban fortress into a fantasy world would be too much. After healing Aku's leg, Kunai complimenting Yu caused her to experience happiness for the first time, which she describes as \\"an all-knowing creator acknowledging my presence for the first time\\". From then on, she develops a crush on Kunai and experiences a wave of euphoria whenever Kunai states that he's counting on her. Across different mediums, her design and outfit has undergone several minor changes, but the one constant is her lab coat. ; : :The second NPC summoned by Kunai; a 31 year old male special forces soldier with short brown hair and an innate speciality for firearms; he owns 47 firearms from flintlocks to sniper rifles that all apparently have their own will, can float in the air, and can by commanded by Isami to shoot specific targets or follow and protect a target such as Aku. He apparently has infinite bullets. He has a teasing, provocative attitude and is considered a lazy genius, with a fast learning capability no matter what he is made to do, and producing a result higher than that of his peers. He is noted to get along amicably with Yu, but is secretly afraid of her, nor does he like to think of the horrors she has committed back in Infinity Game. Perhaps Isami's most iconic trait is the absolute adoration he has for his little sister Manami who is much younger than him, his in-game bio stating he became Kunai's aide to earn money to raise her and himself out of homelessness. ; : :An alternate character of Akira Ono initially meant to be a joke character but played for at least 10 years, he is first seen when Kunai is forced to swap avatars in order to save Luna and Killer Queen after his magic ring paralyses him, at the cost of being unable to control Zero. With his silver hair and eyes, gold chains, and enormous white coat covered with strange phrases and artwork of a silver dragon drawn on the back, Zero's presence draws in all types of attention. He is extremely proud and arrogant, bragging about being the best. Zero showcases immense physical prowess and barefisted close combat techniques, including the ability to create a dragon-shaped shockwave and multiplying his damage output based on how many lives his enemy had killed. The gallant delinquent is likened to a berserker during battle, feeling great joy in a good fight. His sense of justice means he cannot ignore weak people being abused by the strong, especially women and children. Ironically, he was programmed to be wrathful over the actions of Hakuto Kunai and his Grand Empire and is a declared enemy, not knowing they are now one and the same. After his first stunt saving Killer Queen and Luna from the Satanists and their miasma, he became the object of Queen's undying affection, and word of his actions spread. He became a target of concern for the Satanists and others due to being a half-dragon hybrid. Kunai would swap to Zero to save Queen from Satanists again, this time battling demon prince Oruit. He revives Tron from fatal damage inflicted by his opponent before finishing a transformed Oruit off, earning him a new admirer. Later, Tron would find Kunai and recognise from his soul makeup and manner of speech that he and Zero are the same person. Much like Kunai, Zero is quite talkative but becomes shy about contact with girls. Ono/Kunai can only watch and experience the bitter taste of his over-the-top creation gain awareness, and is deeply embarrassed that he ever created such a showy delinquent character, but those traits are amusingly the reason Queen is attracted to Zero, and he himself acts similar to Zero many times without realizing it. He is depicted with a motorcycle in the original Infinity Game. In the manga/novel, he sports a different hairstyle, a scar on his cheek, and his coat design changed somewhat as well, most noticeably the collar. ; : :A half-demon girl with red eyes and blonde hair in a long ponytail in the image of a blue and black gothic lolita, appearing around the same age as Aku. Much like Aku, she was orphaned at a young age and persecuted by the world around her, by demonkind for having unclean blood, and by humans for being a half-breed. Her melancholic behaviour was reinforced by the Satanist leader Utopia capturing her and seeing her as nothing more than a tool, as he also hates her for being impure. She was tasked with delivering a second release of Hades miasma to aid the Satanists summoning Oruit. When Zero Kirisame appears and easily defeats Oruit, he mortally wounds Tron through her gut and drains her blood to transform into a bestial entity. As Tron bleeds out and quietly accepts the end of her miserable life, she is fully revived when Zero feeds her a magic energy bar and is told to just smile, no matter the hardship. She has held a crush and admiration for Zero since then. Tron can fly freely, and can see the souls and emotions of people via colours. It is through this ability that she manages to track down Kunai and find that he and Zero are the same being. Out of love for Zero, Tron insists on joining Kunai, who after thinking it would be wrong to leave someone Zero saved back on the streets again, eventually relents. Kunai promises to her that if she behaves and serves him well, he won't mind bringing out Zero to see her. She is so far the only character to know that Zero and the Demon Lord are the same. Her manga design has untied straight hair. ; : :A 17 year old B-rank adventurer with tan skin and short orange hair and eyes, fitting of her name. She travels alongside Yukikaze, and is serious and straightforward in nature compared to her friend. She is described as being rebellious but kind, and has a preference towards frontline battling, fighting with a large two-handed sword. Despite the two adventurers being saved by him twice, Mikan remains distrustful of Kunai because of his ominous title, and objects to Yukikaze opening up to him, but when Kunai plans to travel to the northern territories, it is Mikan who tells him about guilds and how weapons and armour looted from dungeons are categorised. Kunai then recruits the two to help him traverse the northern territories. She wears torn, broken armour that exposes a lot of her breasts, arms, and body, covered by a green cloak, and goggles on her head; this is changed from a modest red outfit in the novel/manga, where she also has red eyes and hair. ; : :A 16 year old B-rank adventurer with pale skin, silver hair with a red ribbon, and silver eyes, described repeatedly as a \\"girlish boy\\". He travels alongside Mikan, and is sexually perverted and joking in nature compared to his friend. He constantly spouts obscene innuendo, even in the midst of danger. As a mage, he fights using ice and wind magic, fitting of his name. Because Kunai saved the two adventurers twice, Yukikaze is enamoured with him while Mikan remains distrustful. Yukikaze helps to explain items and life as an adventurer, and informs Kunai that traversing the north is tough because of a war campaign that is happening. He volunteers himself to travel with Kunai when he states his plan to go to the northern territories, so Kunai recruits the two to help him. Yukikaze wears an ornate black bandeau and skirt, loose black boots and stockings with suspenders, purple cloak with pink underside, and an oversized witch hat, decorated with red and orange scarves. The novel/manga gives him a far more simpler appearance of a loose black and white shirt with large sleeves, pink shorts, and a smaller hat decorated with a large button of a snowman face. ; : :A 20 year old S-rank adventurer with red eyes, neck-length indigo hair that obscures her right eye, and wearing a blue dress with multiple belts and braces, topped with a flat, wide-brimmed hat. A bandage wrapped around her forehead covers her right eye, though there is no injury. Mink has a tall buxom stature, her countenance and big breasts naturally draw in the eyes of men. She suffers from Chunibyo syndrome (delusions of grandeur), leading to her spouting outlandish phrases. She has a favourite pose while she does so, raising her right hand over her covered eye in dramatic fashion. Mink is very energetic and always ready for a fight. Despite being a priestess who uses the power of light to purify and heal, she enjoys chanting strange, macabre words that are not expected of a priest. She is considered a \\"Star Player\\", the equivalent of a celebrity. Despite Organ being her companion, Mink does most of the fighting while Organ stays a distance away. She is shown to be powerful enough to hold her own against large groups of Satanists and even Oruit, until the Hades miasma was dumped onto her by Tron. Her outfit more resembles a nun habit in the novel/manga. ; : :An S-rank adventurer of an unknown age with blue eyes, deep magenta hair that reaches down to her bare feet, and wearing nothing but a brown bandeau and bikini, with bangles on her wrists, neck, and stomach, covered by a tattered black robe with red interior that hides her appearance. Part of her skin from the legs up to the left side of her body is discoloured, and teal scales are found growing on her left cheek and right leg; this could be a result of her half- demon heritage. Organ is reclusive and apathetic, keeping in touch only with Mink, she doesn't care much about anyone else. Because she was weak and became strong to protect herself, she does not like to see the strong saving the weak, and wonders why Mink bothers to do so. Only Mink knows that she is a half-demon. Organ dislikes Zero, and after witnessing him saving Tron, another half-devil, her frustration increased. Even though Zero is of mixed race just like her, a half-dragon is valued, while a half-demon is hated. In Organ's eyes, this logic is unreasonable, and it frustrates her; this is why she goes to great lengths to hide herself, constantly changing where she is, to avoid being a target of subjugation. ; :The 45 year old pub landlord of the Noma Noma tavern. She is well-built and has a loud, amicable, boisterous nature, and many young adventurers such as Yukikaze and Mikan see her as a motherly figure. She looks after her patrons and knows many of them at a personal level, and is noted to manage the tavern and her regulars with great efficiency. She and all the adventurers at Noma Noma treat Kunai to food and drink for defeating Carnival when Yukikaze and Mikan take him there. Iei and the tavern she owns are named after Romanian lyrics from the chorus of Dragostea Din Tei. ; : :Killer Queen's second-in-command and most devout follower; he visually references Street Fighter's Zangief. He is usually carrying Queen's arsenal on his back, such as her sword or her Holy Sigma hammer. When he notices Queen acting meek towards Zero, he does a spit-take, to which Queen angrily whispers he would be executed if he ever acknowledges what he just saw. ; : :The leader of the kingdom's military forces. Marshall Arts is, despite being in his 60s, a seasoned veteran who puts more confidence in his own subordinate's reports than the words of a nobleman. He holds great respect for the previous leader Commando Sambo, and holds a celebration in his honour when Sambo's blindness is cured by Yu. He does not hide his hostility towards Dona Dona. ; : :A high ranking bureaucrat of great influence of the kingdom, although he is of such elevated class, his vulgar expressions (such as subtly masturbating in Angel White's presence) leave a bad impression of himself. Regardless, he is still considered important for his ability to lead, deal with, and bring many other nobles together. He owns many mining operations, and controls a large portion of the kingdom's economy. He does not hide his hostility towards others including Marshall Arts and his own assassin butler Azur, and becomes upset upon finding out Ebifry Butterfly had moved to Rabi village. Dona Dona is named after a song about a calf being led to slaughter. ; : :A central figure amongst the nobility of the kingdom, Ebifry bears the most influence of all female nobles. Luna refers to her as \\"Madam\\". Her large, obese body is adorned with such decor and dress making it clear to the eye that she is wealthy. Such is the influence she radiates that it scares other nobles, and her skill in politics and socialisation allows her to control the wives of nobility with iron hands. Ebifly is envious, since when she was little she was always bullied for being fat. She is also proud and social, despite her past she has grown to be a strong, threatening woman. It is through this upbringing that allowed her to be unfazed by Kunai's title of Demon Lord when they first meet. After learning from Luna that Ebifry is one of the greatest social powers in the kingdom, Kunai proposes prospects involving renovating Luna's province to gain her trust, taking advantage of her concern regarding her appearance. She becomes curious of the message Kunai is trying to send, and after witnessing Commando Sambo's blindness being cured and experiencing the various types of baths in the hot springs resort, she makes the decision to move out of the kingdom and have permanent residence in Rabi Village, a move that shocks all of the high class. She has a bitter relationship with her sister, Kakifry. ; and :Momo :Kyon :Two Bunny residents of Rabi Village in Luna's neglected province. Momo has tan skin, short black hair and brown eyes, with \\"-usa\\" as a verbal tic (part of \\"usagi\\" meaning \\"rabbit\\"), while Kyon has light blue hair and maroon eyes, and has \\"-pyon\\" as a verbal tic (Japanese onomatopoeia for hopping); they do this because the Bunnies are conditioned to talk that way to the humans who looked down on them. The two friends, along with the other residents of the village, are overwhelmingly grateful to Kunai for improving their town, and promise to keep the source of his contributions secret. Momo and Kyon are later employed by Kunai to help greet visitors and manage the hot springs resort. ; : :A demon \\"prince of darkness\\" with silver hair, pale skin, blue slit pupils with black sclera, and wearing a black and blue suit and cloak over his black wings. He is condescending, collects works of art, and is very spiteful towards angels and dragons. He was summoned by a large group of surviving Satanists as a last resort after the demon Carnival's defeat and made short work of Killer Queen, Mount Fuji, and Mink. When Zero came in however, he was swiftly outclassed despite his rank. Becoming stressed at the thought of losing so easily, he spots Tron and mortally wounds her through her gut, draining her blood, which he calls \\"stinky and disgusting\\" due to being half-breed. He transforms into an exaggerated bat-hellhound entity, but is still vanquished by Zero. It is later revealed that what Zero killed was just a vessel in Oruit's image, though he still felt the pain and humiliation of the fight. In his mansion, Oruit has a female servant who is suffering from the same petrification as the idol Kunai met, and is pestered by another demon resembling a young boy called Cale. ; : :The leader of the Satanist cults, dressed in a cassock with a hood covering his eyes. His goal is to destroy the Kingdom of Holy Light and its Holy Maidens, the reason he claims is to overthrow the government led by the luxurious and rich of the kingdom and create a new country that respects everyone and gives basic needs, though this is all a lie taking advantage of the poor's resentment. Has a strong hatred for dragons, because they claimed to be neutral in the past when the Demon Regime fought against the Beast Kingdom, but always intervened against the demons. He is upset of Zero being a half-dragon who appeared suddenly, but is more concerned of Hakuto Kunai being a Demon Lord his cultists did not intend to summon, and may oppose him. ; :A hero of the northern territories referred to as a \\"Holy Brave\\". He is a somewhat overweight young man wearing modern day clothes, unkempt brown hair, and his spectacles emit a blinding shine that covers his eyes. On his back is a big white boxy rucksack with two handles coming out from it, one a sword of light and the other a morningstar. He is the image of someone right out of an anime convention. It is not made clear how he came to the game's world, but he has an altruistic nature, wishing to have power to change the lives of poor people for the better, but that made him hated by the elites of the region. Nevertheless, Otamega isn‚Äôt the type of person who would change his ideals to protect himself, his peers from home already gave low opinions of him anyway. He apparently goes around the northern countries every year distributing food to the poor. Despite his unfit body, he can move fast like the wind and bears the power of an army. Otamega is followed by a passionate, loyal group of heroes called the White Tri Stars; this along with his rucksack design and the \\"White Comet\\" epithet he gives himself are all homages to Mobile Suit Gundam. \\"Otamega\\" can also be read as a shortening of \\"Otaku-megane\\" or \\"glasses- geek\\". While a somewhat major character in the novels, he makes a cameo appearance in the anime as part of the final episode's teaser, with Kunai confused and repulsed by the sight of him. ; :Another NPC created by Akira Ono; a 16 year old athletic schoolgirl with black eyes and short dark hair, wearing a qipao that changes to a sailor fuku when she enters the game. Her personality is stated to be headstrong and cheerful, as well as a feverish otaku. She wields a pair of tonfa and is noted to be the fastest of Kunai's aides. Unlike Yuu and Isami, it is unknown how Akane came to be in the series's setting as Akira did not willingly summon her. She encounters Mink and Organ at some point in her wandering journey, and also befriends Otamega through their shared passion of popular culture. So far, she only has a proper appearance in the novels. Media =Light novels= Futabasha started publishing since June 2017 under their Monster Bunko imprint, illustrated by K≈çji Ogata.

He is now a member of the breakaway Social Democratic Party (Socijaldemokratska stranka, SDS). Early life and private career Samofalov was born in Belgrade, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. His great-grandfather was a Russian military officer who immigrated to Belgrade in 1923. He participated in protests against Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's government in 1999; in a 2017 article for Danas, he recounted how he had been physically attacked by regime supporters at some events.Konstantin Samofalov, \\"Vuƒçiƒáev ministar i peta kolona\\" m, Danas, 23 August 2017, accessed 11 September 2018.

In January 2005, Samofalov took part in a media prank with other members of the DS's youth wing, in which the party activists left alarm clocks, car radios, and cellphones on the doorstep of Serbian prime minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica to allow him to \\"wake up, hear the news, and communicate with the nation.\\" (This was in reference to the prime minister's perceived aloofness.) They also attempted to award Ko≈°tunica with a diploma for \\"extraordinary efforts to lead Serbia back into the darkness\\" for his refusal to extradite war crimes suspects to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).\\"Wake up!

(From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for the parties to distribute their mandates out of numerical order.

The film stars Charles Ray, Otto Hoffman, Charlotte Pierce, R. Henry Grey, William A. Carroll, and Dick Sutherland. The film was released in March 1922, by Associated First National Pictures. Plot As described in a film magazine, Henry Jones (Hoffman) runs a hotel near the Mexican border that is popular with tourists. His daughter Susie (Pierce) is attracted to George Oliver Watson (Ray), a young man who has just opened a new gas station across the road. However, George is actually a government agent sent to the border to catch a band of smugglers who have been operating in that section. George watches two hotel guests who are acting suspiciously. His observations reveal several others around the place who appear to be in league with the two. Working slowly, he gathers sufficient evidence and data about the band that he imparts to other agents assigned to assist him. These agents trace the smugglers to their hiding place and in a raid the agents round them up. Hobart Rush (Grey), the ringleader, makes an attempt to escape and carries Susie off in an automobile. George jumps into another car and pursues them after leaving instructions to have the road ahead blocked. As the two cars come alongside each other, Susie jumps from Hobart's car to the one driven by George just as an explosion throws boulders across the roadway, sending Hobart's automobile rolling down the embankment.

Life  Bernaud was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine of a polytechnician father, a good violinist and violist and a mother playing the piano, daughter of Marcel Chadeigne who was, before and after the First World War, choir conductor at the Paris Opera and pianist - accompanist - decipherer - reducer of orchestral scores. He had formed with Maurice Ravel, Maurice Delage, D√©odat de S√©verac, Florent Schmitt, Paul Ladmirault, √âmile Vuillermoz, D√©sir√© Inghelbrecht, Ricardo Vi√±es and Tristan Klingsor, a group they had named Les Apaches, and whose rallying call was whistling the first theme of Borodin's Second Symphony. Arriving in Paris in 1938, he began studying piano and music theory with , wrote his Opus 1, a string quartet (for the family!) and then returned to the Conservatoire de Paris (direction of Claude Delvincourt) in specialized solfege class, at Lucette Descaves, where he met Michel Legrand, Roger Boutry, Jean-Michel Defaye and Alain Weber. He then followed Jules Gentil's piano class (1st medal) - studied harmony with Jacques de La Presle (1st prize) - counterpoint and fugue with No√´l Gallon (1st medal and 1st prize) - finally musical composition with Tony Aubin (1st Prix de Rome in 1953 with Ouverture √† la fran√ßaise for 2 pianos). He won the 2nd Prix de Rome in 1955 with the cantata Le Rire de Gargantua then 1st Grand Prix de Rome in 1957 with the cantata La f√©e Urg√®le. Bernaud stayed 40 months at the Villa M√©dicis, a stay during which he wrote a quartet for saxophones, Les chants de la jungle - six melodies for baritone and string orchestra on poems from Rudyard Kipling, a Symphony, an Ouverture pour orchestre de chambre (1960), a Messe br√®ve for mixed choir and organ (1958), a Nocturne pour orchestre √† cordes, Sept m√©lodies pour fl√ªte et mezzo soprano on poems by Omar Khayyam. Back in France, he wrote scores for television shows Pr√©sence du pass√©, for short films and also feature films and was appointed, in 1963, professor of solfege for instrumentalists at the Conservatoire de Paris, and a little later, in 1971, harmony teacher in the same establishment. He provided this teaching there until the end of 1999. He is currently retired in northern Brittany and continues to compose and put in order his existing production.

She was the founder of Woman's Exchange of Buffalo, New York. Sheldon gave drawing-room talks in cities around the United States and in Europe on Walter Scott and his works. She was a delegate to the International Press Congress, Bordeaux, France 1895. Sheldon was a correspondent for the Buffalo Courier in France (1895); and in South America (1896) for New York City and Buffalo papers. She was the author of, As We Saw It in '90 and From Pluckemin to Paris. Early years and education Grace Carew Sheldon was born in Buffalo, New York, March 25, 1855. She was the eldest daughter of Chief-Justice James, and Sarah (Carew) Sheldon; granddaughter of James and Sylvia (Alexander) Sheldon and of Daniel and Grace Billings (Palmer) Carew, and a descendant on her maternal grandmother's side, of Capt. George Denison, who came to the United States in the Lion when thirteen years of age, and settled in Roxbury, Massachusetts; and also of John Sheldon, who came to Dorchester, Massachusetts, early in the sixteenth century. She was graduated from Wells College, Aurora, Cayuga County, New York, A.B., June, 1875. She received an advanced education in vocal and instrumental music, including vocal, instrumental and thorough-bass. Career =Business founder= After extensive travel in Europe, and wanting to do something outside society work, Sheldon founded the Woman's Exchange of Buffalo on May 1, 1886, served as its president. Starting the business with of her own money, it was an organization for the disposal of handiwork of self-supporting women in the United States. She also was the founder and proprietor of Mental Clearing House for writing and handling manuscripts, as well as instruction in journalism and playwriting. In 1901, fourteen years after it was founded, the Buffalo Exchange had 500 subscribers from all over the U.S., and had to remove to a new location, an entire house being fitted up for the various departments to which the exchange was developed. Every sort of work that a woman could do, from weaving rag rugs to washing fine laces found customers. Sheldon engineered the affairs of the exchange independent of committees and without red tape. The consignor's fee was for a year, 10 per cent off all sales and 5 per cent off ordered work. Sheldon attributed the success of the exchange to the simplicity of the management, to a careful study of the talents of women who submitted their handiwork, and to allot to each consignor the work for which she was best fitted. She said:‚Äî \\"I most contributors are fine needlewomen, and most are just, prompt and agreeable to deal with. We have a great number of special workers who confine their work to our exchange. This makes us noted for our novelties and enables us to go to New York, Boston, Chicago, and other large cities and compete favorably with local firms. It also enables us to hold our customers from year to year, and thus augment our receipts. We make a specialty of house decorating, that is, all kinds of hangings, table, piano and mantel covers; and our Marie Stuart caps for evening and steamer wear have a national reputation. We can carry out any kind of work that a woman can do with promptness and perfection.\\" =Writer= In 1887, in Buffalo and other cities, Sheldon originated drawing room talks on \\"European Cities\\", on \\"Scott and his Novels\\", and on art. During the period of 1890 to 1900, Sheldon was a member of the staff of the Buffalo Courier. She was the first American woman delegate to the International Press Congress, Bordeaux, France, September 1895, acting at the same time as correspondent for the Buffalo Courier. Sheldon was sent to South America in February, 1896, as special correspondent on the gold mine controversy, and visited Venezuela (going up the Orinoco River to Ciudad Bol√≠var), also Curacao, Haiti, and the other West Indies, contributing articles meanwhile to the New York City and Buffalo press. By 1891, Sheldon had become her own publisher. Discouraged in her quest for the book production of her foreign letters to the Courier, she edited her work into proper form, and with The Courier Co. as her printer, brought out her own book. As We Saw It In '90 was a good sample of a moderate-priced book. In 1897, she organized an independent newspaper syndicate, which she supplied weekly as she traveled. Two years later, she authored From Pluckemin to Paris (1899). It was a compilation of her letters which appeared in the columns of the Buffalo Courier, several years previous, descriptive of her travels in France. The information included things not usually found in guide-books., such as side-lights on out-of-the-way places. By 1914, Sheldon was serving as the department editor of the Buffalo Times and was a special writer for various papers and magazines in the U.S. Personal life She was a charter member of The Scribblers' club of Buffalo; corresponding member of the National Geographic Society; and active member of the National League of American Pen Women. She died August 20, 1921 and was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo.

This dog is often used as a livestock guardian against predators. It is the oldest dog breed in the Asian regionand one of the oldest in the world. Its history dates back to 6,000 years, when its ancestors were used by Assyrians and Babylonians as war dogs and for protection against wild animals. It was, and still is, specially prized for its high stamina while fighting external threats, especially wild animals and other dogs. It has a fish-like body, broader at the chest and narrower at the waist, which enables it to twist and turn at high speeds irrespective of its huge frame. The breed is found in Iran in the cities of Bukan, Mahabad, Saqez, Sanandaj, Piranshahr; most of the cities of West Azerbaijan; and parts of Iraqi Kurdistan. The name is most likely derived from the Pshdar region of Iraqi Kurdistan. This breed has been a native breed which formed due to natural selection and a bit of human interference. The coats of Kurdish mastiffs can be yellow, white, red, burgundy, blue and black. The breed has loose skin, large dewlaps, and non- cartilaginous (soft and floppy) ears. The breed is longer and stronger than the other Asian mastiffs. Its body length is especially eye-catching, since it has a long and slender body resembling the lion. This breed has a significantly larger amount of endurance comparative to other dog breeds. It also has high body strength and is usually longer than other giant dog breeds. Weight and height Kurdish mastiff Males weigh between 50 and 92 kilograms (even crossing 100 kg in rare cases), females 45 to 80 kilograms. The height of these dogs at the shoulder is between 75 and 90 centimeters in males and between 70 and 85 in females.  Age  The Kurdish mastiff has a surprisingly longer life span than most dog breeds because it was formed by natural selection thousands of years ago and is very adaptable and suited to the Kurdish climate. If the proper nutrition and home are provided, these dogs live on average 9 to 13 years. If they are used in combat, their expected lifespan is reduced to 6-8 years. Maintenance Kurdish mastiffs need long walks during the day to drain their energy. Besides this, they also need other exercises like running and hiking. A large garden or a large courtyard is a must. They are not suited to living in apartments.

Function MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA.

An array of protein tandem repeats is defined as several (at least two) adjacent copies having the same or similar sequence motifs. These periodic sequences are generated by internal duplications in both coding and non-coding genomic sequences. Repetitive units of protein tandem repeats are considerably diverse, ranging from the repetition of a single amino acid to domains of 100 or more residues. alt=  \\"Repeats\\" in proteins  Example multiple sequence alignment of a pentapeptide repeat leading to a tandem repeat structure In proteins, a \\"repeat\\" is any sequence block that returns more than one time in the sequence, either in an identical or a highly similar form. The degree of similarity can be highly variable, with some repeats maintaining only a few conserved amino acid positions and a characteristic length. Highly degenerate repeats can be very difficult to detect from sequence alone. Structural similarity can help to identify repetitive patterns in sequence.  Structure  Repetitiveness does not in itself indicate anything about the structure of the protein. As a \\"rule of thumb\\", short repetitive sequences (e.g. those below the length of 10 amino acids) may be intrinsically disordered, and not part of any folded protein domains. Repeats that are at least 30 to 40 amino acids long, are far more likely to be folded as part of a domain. Such long repeats are frequently indicative of the presence of a solenoid domain in the protein. Approximately half of the tandem repeat regions have intrinsically disordered conformation being naturally unfolded. Examples of disordered repetitive sequences include the 7-mer peptide repeats found in the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II, or the tandem beta-catenin or axin binding linear motifs in APC (adenomatous polyposis coli). The other half of the regions with the stable 3D structure has a plethora of shapes and functions. Examples of short repeats exhibiting ordered structures include the three- residue collagen repeat or the five-residue pentapeptide repeat that forms a beta helix structure.  Classification  Depending on the length of the repetitive units, their protein structures can be subdivided into five classes: # crystalline aggregates formed by regions with 1 or 2 residue long repeats, archetypical low complexity regions # fibrous structures stabilized by inter-chain interactions with 3-7 residue repeats # elongated structures with repeats of 5‚Äì40 residues dominated by solenoid proteins # closed (not elongated) structures with repeats of 30-60 residues as toroid repeats # beads on a string structures with typical size of repeats over 50 residues, which are already large enough to fold independently into stable domains.  Function  Some well-known examples of proteins with tandem repeats are collagen, which plays a key role in the arrangement of the extracellular matrix; alpha-helical coiled coils having structural and oligomerization functions; leucine-rich repeat proteins, which specifically bind a number of globular proteins by their concave surfaces; and zinc-finger proteins, which regulate the expression of genes by binding DNA. Tandem repeat proteins frequently function as protein-protein interaction modules. The WD40 repeat is a prime example of this function.  Distribution in proteomes  Tandem repeats are ubiquitous in proteomes and occur in at least 14% of all proteins. For example, they are present in almost every third human protein and even in every second protein from Plasmodium falciparum or Dictyostelium discoideum. Tandem repeats with short repetitive units (especially homorepeats) are more frequent than others.  Annotation methods  Protein tandem repeats can be either detected from sequence or annotated from structure. Specialized methods were built for the identification of repeat proteins . Sequence-based strategies, based on homology search or domain assignment ,mostly underestimate TRs due to the presence of highly degenerate repeat units . A recent study to understand and improve Pfam coverage of the human proteome showed that five among the ten largest sequence clusters not annotated with Pfam are repeat regions. Alternatively, methods requiring no prior knowledge for the detection of repeated substrings can be based on self-comparison , clustering or hidden Markov models . Some others rely on complexity measurements or take advantage of meta searches to combine outputs from different sources . Structure-based methods instead take advantage of the modularity of available PDB structures to recognize repetitive elements .

Early life  Hines was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, to Edward and Willie (Chandler) Hines.Custom Rodder, March 2004 He had a twin brother, Edward, and a sister Elizabeth. Born with a severely deformed spine, the result of spinal kyphosis, he was unable to stand completely upright. At age two, he was sent to an Erie hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove two vertebrae. The hospital recommended he be sent to a special camp, where he was laid on a board in the sun all day for seven months, returning over the course of two and a half years; it helped relieve the unusual curvature. Soon after Hines was initially released from hospital, his father died of tuberculosis. Hines' mother moved to Detroit, Michigan to work, while her children were sent to be raised by their grandmother in Jackson, Tennessee. In 1932, the Hines children went to Detroit.Driving.ca (retrieved 12 September 2018) Career In high school, Hines preferred art and shop classes to academics, and 1941, while in Grade 11, dropped out to rent a garage in Ecorse, Michigan, where he set up a custom shop. It was there he began working with lead body filler. His first project was a 1934 Ford, fitted with a flathead V8 with milled heads.Weesner, Jerry. \\"The Leadslinger\\" (interview with Hines), Street Rodder, September 1989. He opened a gas station in Lincoln Park, Michigan, with an attached custom shop later the same year. His first custom, built in 1941, was a 1941 Buick, with molded fenders, widened rocker panels, cut-down doors (a Hines trademark), fender skirts, Appleton spotlight, and single-bar flipper hubcaps; he repainted the original turquoise to red, claiming every custom should be red with a white interior.Hemmings.com (retrieved 12 September 2018) He would later add a tailfin in the center of the trunklid, a feature earning so much ridicule, he changed back to a stock lid. He went on to build and race a midget powered by a flathead. In the late 1940s, Hines did bodywork and painting for Vick Sawitskas' Nash dealership in Wyandotte, Michigan.Custom Rodder, May 2004 Hines finally opened his own dedicated custom shop in Lincoln Park early in the 1950s. It was there in 1957 he built Lil' Bat, a 1950 Ford with a chop, frenched headlights, the grille bar from a 1951 Ford Meteor, and large fins fitted with taillights from a 1956 Ford.Rod & Custom, March 1959. The car made its debut at the 1959 Detroit Autorama, and was featured on the cover of Rod & Custom Magazine in March 1959. When he visited George Barris' shop driving this car in 1958, Barris' shop manager, Gene Simmons (not to be confused with the artist), hired him immediately on the strength of the work. Hines moved back to Detroit just before Christmas 1959,. setting up shop where he did several custom jobs and specialized in candy paint jobs. He also hired the Alexander brothers. He served as mentor to customizers Richard Sawitskas (better known as Dick Dean ant the Alexander brothers. Hines returned to California in October 1960, setting up Bill Hines Kustom Auto in Lynwood, next door to Eddie Martinez's shop.Souvenir Program for the 1969 Westernationals. In 1962, Hines installed one of the first hydraulic lift systems on Tats Gotanda's Candy blue 1959 Chevrolet Impala; this became known as the Buddah Buggy, and was Hines' most famous custom project.

This is mainly a farming district, lacking in woodland, with a low population density, and only one village. In the 19th century, high quality lime was quarried here with at least three sites in use in 1832.  History  =The Church, Manse, and Village= The parish of Craigie includes part of the ancient parish of Barnweill, and was itself united to Riccarton until 1647. In 1745, a church is shown on Herman Moll's map of the south part of Ayrshire. William Roy's map of circa 1747 shows the church, the new manse or House of Craigie, above the curling pond and the old manse site, now Lodgebush House. The present church building dates from 1776 and the grounds contain the remains of the 1558 church into which a family memorial has been incorporated. The 1857 OS map shows a network of footpaths running between the old and new manses, the new manse and the church, the church and Campcastle Farm, etc. The former school of 1874 is shown together with the Craigie Inn, then known as the Red Lion Inn. The village had a post office and the first postmaster is buried in the churchyard. A parish seminary or training college for ministers was established in a new building by the school board in the mid 19th century. Writing in 1926 William Walls refers to the Annual Agricultural Show that was the social event of the year, a major spectacle being the famous Clydesdales bred by James Kilpatrick of Craigie Mains. The parish has historically had the lowest population in Ayrshire with 786 in 1801, 779 in 1841, and 470 in 1931. =Craigie Castle= Craigie Castle in the old Barony of Craigie lies around southeast of Kilmarnock and southeast of Craigie village. The castle is one of the earliest buildings in the county of Ayrshire. In the 12th century Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland, held these lands and Walter Hose held his fief from the Steward. In 1177 Walter Hose of Cragyn (sic) had given the church of Cragyn to the monks of Paisley. John, probably Walter's son, inherited and his son Thomas had no heir, resulting in his sisters Christiana and Matilda inheriting. Walter de Lyndesay was the son of Christiana, the father being William Lyndesey of Crawfurd. The male line ended with John de Lyndesey, whose daughter married John Wallace of Riccarton. Craigie Castle. John Wallace of Riccarton in the reign of David II was styled 'Wallayis of Richardtoun'. John married the heiress of Lindsay of Craigie circa 1371 and from this date Craigie was the chief residence of the family. The castle was abandoned and allowed to fall into ruins after 1600. The family moved to their castle at Newton on Ayr and later they built a mansion house on the banks of the River Ayr that they named Craigie. The Lairds of Craigie cared little for the religious discipline of the presbyterians, and the Laird of Craigie, Sir Hugh Wallace, a supporter of the episcopalian sentiments of Charles I and II, allowed his tenants and servants to work on Sundays and he himself traveled openly upon the Sabbath day. The local ministers wrote to the Laird's local minister, Mr. Inglish, about such open and scandalous breaches of the Sabbath. The Laird ignored the ministers' advice and when he was publicly criticised in church he threw his sword at the minister, the sword sticking in the wood at the back of the pulpit. The minister told the Laird that God will reduce your great stone house to a pile of stones and no one will be able to repair it; and your son, of whom you have great hopes, will die a fool. Soon after the castle was in need of repair and when the stonemasons started work a great part of it fell down and almost buried them all. His son =Wallace's Monument= Wallace's Monument, Wallace Tower or the Barnweil Monument is a category-A-listed building located on Barnweil Hill (503 ft). Wallace's Monument, Barnweil Hill The picturesque Wallace's Monument is a Gothic structure in a prominent situation, built to commemorate William Wallace at the time of an upsurge in the Scottish desire for self-determination, predating the 1869 Wallace Monument at Stirling. The story that the name Barnweil derives from an occasion when Wallace, standing on this elevated site, remarked that the Barns of Ayr (containing English soldiers) \`burn weil' is an invention, the reason for the name being that it is situated close to the remains of the medieval parish church of Barnweil, a parish that suppressed in the 17th century.Wallace Monument Retrieved : 2011-03-11 =Barnweil Church & village= Barnweil Church or kirk (NGR NS 40506 29903) is a ruined pre-reformation kirk situated on the slopes of Barnweil Hill about 3 km from Tarbolton. The church was known locally as the \\"Kirk in the Wood\\". It lies about 170m North North-East of Kirkhill Farm and was central to the Protestant Reformation in Ayrshire through its association with John Knox. The village of Barnweil no longer exists, however old maps record the Townhead, Midtown and Townend of Barnweill dwellings in the vicinity along the length of the 'loaning' or roading. A manse for the church would have been located near by but the location has been lost. =Mansion houses= Findlay of Carnell coat of arms. The estates in the parish were Carnell (Cairnhill), Barnweil, and Underwood. Underwood was held by the Kennedy family from 1785 and the mansion house dates from 1790. William Roxburgh, the botanist and surgeon, who was born here in 1759, his father probably working on the estate. The eighteenth century Barnweil House stands on the north-east slope of the hill. Captain William Neill of Barnweil inherited Swindridgemuir House and estate near Dalry on the condition that he assumed the name 'Smith', thus becoming 'Smith-Neill' of Barnweil and Swinridgemuir. In 1850 Major James George Smith- Neill inherited the estates from his father, Colonel William Smith-Neill. In 1857, after the death of his father at Lucknow, Captain William James Smith- Neill of Barnweil, Swinridgemuir, and Kersland R.A. inherited the estates amounting to around 1275 acres. J. W. Smith Neill CBE born in 1855, died in 1935 and his wife Evelyn died in 1947, both are buried in the Barnweil churchyard. Carnell was once known as Cairnhill. Fiveways is a row of workers cottages that stands opposite to the main entrance to the mansion house; it once had a smithy. Carnell was held by the Wallaces, followed by the Cathcarts, then by the Hamiltons who built the present day Jacobean house and today (2018) by the Findlay family. A walled garden is present with a modern dower house. The Findlays and Hamiltons are buried at Craigie Church. Archaeology The moat of Barnweill Motte. Near Meadowhead Farm is the location of Camp Castle, a probable Iron Age broch, roughly circular, sitting on a rocky knoll with a nearly 5 metre thickness excavated in the early 1960s. The small Campcastle Farm once stood just to the west of the knoll. Craigie Fort (NS428325) or oppidium had a entrance to the south and formed a large enclosure around the summit of the hill to the north of the village. A fort once stood on the summit of Craigie Hill however it has been completely destroyed by the whinstone quarry workings. A crannog was discovered, mostly formed from stones, in a boggy depression, once a lochan, to the south-west' of Craigie Castle in the 19th century together with a wooden oar. A Roman fort stood in a prominent location on the slopes of Barnweil Hill and near by a Norman motte has left a rectangular ditch with an earth mound facing to the west. In the Carnell woods stands a mound known as the Judgement Seat which may have been the moot hill where the barony court of Carnell once met. On Dollar Hill are the remains of an earth mound that may have been the gallows hill linked to the barony court where men were executed. =The White or Witch's Stone= This large stone lay in a field close to the church until the local farmer decided to exploit it and after blowing it up with gunpowder he was able to cart away 25 loads of stones, some of which were used to build the inn. The Witch's Stone is said to have appeared in the field following an incident where the church authorities had called a local witch to appear before them and in her anger she had lifted the stone and placed it on her apron, however as she flew towards the church with the intention of dropping it on the roof one of the apron strings broke and it landed instead in the field. Covenanters and Peden's Cave Peden's Cave near Craigie Hill. In October 1665 the Covenanter minister Alexander Peden is recorded as having preached at Craigie and a Peden's Cave has been recorded since the 19th century. The cave is formed from two large rocks leaning at an angle and shape reminiscent of a Gothic arch and leaving a cavity large enough for a person to shelter. The cave is located opposite the entrance lane to High and Low Langcraig Farms on a low knoll. Peden preached at many outdoor conventicles and is said to have used a number of other caves as places of concealment during his years on the run from the King's troops, including Barskimming, one at Auchenbay near Ochiltree, another at the Nick of the Balloch, a further example near the Water of Girvan and his final cave hiding place may have been the Cleuch Glen in Sorn Parish which he reportedly asked to be made when he sensed that his illness was terminal, supposedly hiding beneath some straw when it was searched by soldiers. Peden was first buried at Auchinleck however his final resting place is at Cumnock. Curling & hunting Curling House in 2009 before it collapsed. A ruined Curling house still stands below the old manse at the site of an old lochan in 1832 that was used as a curling pond with a brick dam added. It was a brick built rectangular building with a single fireplace and a corrugated iron roof. The dam and building were created in 1853. In 1902 the Tarbolton Curling Club played the Craigie Curling Club at Craigie and won by 74 to 64. Writing in 1926 a local recalled that when ice formed on the lochan the farmers, minister, teacher and neighbours all came to curl and the day's labour was forgotten. The Eglinton Hunt came to Craigie Hill, Cover, Knowes and Glens with all the hunters dressed in red and the brush of the fox if caught was given to the first lady whilst the hounds devoured the corpse. Placenames The settlement name means Rocky, an apt description of the village environs and the parish lands. The names Laigh, West and High Borland on old maps could refer to the presence of wild boar,Dobie, Page 97 however a 'Boor' also meant a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants.Bayne, Pages 10 - 16. The Borland or Bordland also meant the land that was granted to the feudal superior specifically to be used to furnish food for his castle or dwelling.Mackenzie, Page 29.McMichael, Page 85 A knoll on Craigie Hill is recorded as the Witch Knowe, a name that occurs throughout Ayrshire, without any local legend attached to it. Fiveways is a settlement for agricultural workers near the main entrance to Carnell House, clearly named after the lanes that meet here. Catcraig and Old Catcraig are common names however the element Cat has a wide and complex use. In this context it may derive from the Gaelic for summit Caid or refer to a cairn as in the Scots term Cat-heap.  References  ;Notes ;Sources # Adamson, Archibald R. (1875). Rambles Round Kilmarnock.

The emails themselves are often a form of training, but such testing is normally done in conjunction with prior training; and often followed up with more training elements. This is especially the case for those who \\"fail\\" by opening email attachments, clicking on included weblinks, or entering credentials. Rationale There is wide acceptance within the IT security field that technical measures alone cannot stop all malicious email attacks, and that good training of staff is necessary. Simulated phishing allows the direct measurement of staff compliance, and when run regularly, can measure progress in user behavior. Phishing simulation is recommended by various official agencies, who often provide guidelines for designing such policies. Phishing simulations are sometime compared to fire drills in giving staff regular practice in correct behaviour. Ethics Such campaigns need to be authorised at an appropriate level, and carried out professionally. If such a technique is used carelessly it may breach laws, attract lawsuits and antagonise or traumatise staff. However, if employees are advised of a change to policy such that \\"the company reserves the right to send deceptive 'simulated phishing' email to staff from time to time to gauge staff security awareness and compliance\\", and training and guidance has been given in advance, then such problems should not occur. Some organisations may choose to require users to give their consent by opting in, and others may allow staff the option to opt out. The standard advice is that \\"failing\\" staff not be shamed in any way, but it is appropriate and reasonable to provide supportive followup training. Some techniques which might be effective and in use by malicious actors will normally be avoided in simulated phishing for ethical or legal reasons. These would include emails with content likely to cause distress to the recipient or the use of third- party trademarks, although it is also sometimes argued that this is covered by fair use. Methods Such testing can be done in a number of ways. * Many vendors offer web-hosted platforms to do this, and some provide limited free \\"test\\" campaigns. * A wide range of freely-available open-source tools allow more technical organisations to host and run their own testing.e.g GoPhish, King Phisher, The SocialEngineer Toolkit * Some email service now have such testing as a built-in option. Because organisations generally have a set of multi-layered defences in place to prevent actual malicious phishing, simulations will often require some whitelisting to be put in place at email gateways, anti-virus software and web proxies to allow email to reach user desktops and devices and to be acted upon. Frequency Most advice is that testing should be at done several times per year, to give staff practice in responding correctly, and to provide management feedback on the progress in staff identifying and reporting potentially dangerous email.

Her research focuses on social enterprises and women's entrepreneurship and innovation. Academic career After completing a Massey University PhD in 1997, titled Transformation of the welfare state in New Zealand with special reference to employment, de Bruin rose to full professor. De Bruin has published in leading journals including Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice (ETP) and the International Small Business Journal (ISBJ). She sits on six journal editorial boards: International Small Business Journal, Journal of Management and Organization, Qualitative Research in Organizations and Management, Forum for Social Economics, Small Enterprise Research, and the International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship (having been on the editorial board since its founding in 2008). She has also recently been guest co-editor for Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice and the Journal of Interdisciplinary Economics. De Bruin is the founding director of Massey University's New Zealand Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship Research Centre (SIERC) an interdisciplinary research centre on its Albany campus which opened on 19 July 2018. The idea for SIERC came about in the mid-1990s, when de Bruin was working in ≈åtara, South Auckland, and was developed further during her 2009 Fulbright New Zealand Senior Scholar fellowship, when she spent four months studying entrepreneurship at Babson College, Boston. SIERC has a staff of 12 academics, and its first case study was of innovation and entrepreneurial activity at Wellington Zoo. De Bruin is also a leading member of the Diana International Network, which studies women entrepreneurs.  Research  De Bruin's research is focussed on entrepreneurship and innovation, particularly by women, and how it can create employment in disadvantaged communities or regions. She also studies how social institutions and enterprises can support the community. Her recent work combines these two areas in the study of women social entrepreneurs, and their role in challenging and reshaping capitalism and producing progressive social change. Her research area is interdisciplinary, and she has collaborated with researchers in areas ranging from sociology to marketing, finance, management, and property studies. De Bruin, in collaboration with sociologist Christine Read, studied the reaction of NgƒÅi Tahu's Takahanga Marae in Kaik≈çura to the devastating 2016 Kaik≈çura earthquake. Their work concluded that MƒÅori social relationships form a support network that could be a source of resilience in times of crisis. With her PhD student Bruce Borquist she has studied the role of social enterprises in religious organisations. Traditionally, the work of churches and other religious groups has been funded by donations, but increasingly their social and community work relies on hybrid organisations that have both social and economic goals. De Bruin's research examines the relationship between this kind of entrepreneurship and an organisation's religious values.

However, for injuries caused in highway accidents, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove fault on the part of the defendant (see Tort Law in Australia).  Facts  A female pedestrian (the plaintiff and appellant) was struck down by a motor vehicle driven by Chin (the defendant) while crossing a public highway. As a result, the plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries. The plaintiff then brought legal action, alleging that the defendant was negligent. The defendant denied the allegation and argued that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in crossing the road without due care. The trial judge found contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff for crossing the road without due regard for her own safety. For this reason, the judge could not positively find the defendant to be negligent. On the other hand, the trial judge was also unable to find that the defendant was \\"not guilty\\". In light of this, the plaintiff's claim would fail if it was brought in negligence instead of trespass, where fault is an essential element. As the defendant was unable to prove the absence of fault on his part, the trial judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for personal injury in trespass. In the trial decision, it was held that although the plaintiff had already succeeded in her claim for trespass, Section 27 of the Wrong Act 1936-1971 nevertheless applied for the apportionment. As the court held the plaintiff was held 60 percent of the blame for her own injury, damages were reduced accordingly. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed on this decision.  Issues  In the Supreme Court of South Australia, the following issues were discussed: # Whether trespass is still available for injuries caused by negligence # Onus of proof in a highway case  Judgement  The Supreme Court found that the defendant was guilty of negligence in causing the plaintiff's injuries. Justices Bright and Jacob agreed with Chief Justice Bray's exposition of the rule on the issue of the onus of proof of fault in an action for damages for damage sustained in a highway accident, where the onus is on the plaintiff to prove fault on the part of the defendant.  Ratio  The central issue in Venning v Chin was the relationship between the torts of trespass to the person in highway accident and negligence. Venning v Chin is a classic example of a highway accident in which it was difficult for the plaintiff to prove negligence on the defendant's part. The court raised the question that if trespass is still available for injuries caused by negligence in a highway accident and held, that it was affirmed to be positive in Australia. It was found that there is an implicitly accepted risk that an accident would have occurred on a highway that was caused neither intentionally nor negligently. Examples of highway accidents are collisions between vehicles, vehicle collisions with premises adjourning the highway, and collisions between a vehicle and a pedestrian on the highway. Previously in Leame v Bray,Leame v Bray (1803) 3 East 593, 102 ER 724 the court held that trespass would lie for a highway accident caused by the direct action of the defendant in driving his carriage against the carriage of the plaintiff, even though that driving was negligent, not willfully. However, in Letang v Cooper, Letang v Cooper 1965 1 QB 232 Lord Denning MR held that if the injury was inflicted unintentionally, the plaintiff has no cause of action today in trespass but \\"his only cause of action is in negligence.\\" As both Williams v Milotin and Letang v Cooper can not stand together and that the court is bound by the High Court case of William v Milolton,Williams v Milotin [1957] HCA 83 following Williams v Hollands.Williams v Holland The judge held that trespass was open to the case of Venning v Chin. In Weaver v Ward, it was held that the defendant was not liable in trespass if his act was neither intentional nor negligent. Therefore, the onus is on the defendant to disprove fault in trespass cases.Weaver v Ward (1616) 80 ER 284 However, BRAY CJ held that there can be varieties of this doctrine, where a general doctrine apply to all cases and a particular doctrine apply to highway only. For injury caused by highway accident, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove fault on the part of the defendant because those who use the highway or have premises adjourning the highway must be taken to have implicitly accepted the risk of injury from contacts on the highway caused neither intentionally nor negligently.  See also  Wrong Act 1936-1971.Wrong Act 1936-1971. In the trial decision, it was held that although the plaintiff had already succeeded her trespass claim, section 27 of the Wrong Act 1936-1971 nevertheless applied for the apportionment. As the court held the plaintiff was 60 percent to blame for her own injury, damages were reduced accordingly.  Annotation  * Source 1 - This is a court decision. Weaver v Ward established that there will be no liability where the defendant has no fault. In this case, the defendant injured the plaintiff in a military training, and the court decided that the defendant was not liable for battery because the defendant successfully disproved his being at fault; i.e., it was neither intentional nor negligent. In Venning v Chin case, the court applied source 1 as the authority that the defendant bears the onus of disproving his being at fault in the associated circumstance. * Source 2 - This is also a court decision. In Leame v Bray, the court held that trespass would lie for a highway accident caused by the direct action of the defendant in driving his carriage of the plaintiff, even though that driving was negligent, not willful. Applying source 2 to Venning v Chin, negligent was open to trespass. * Source 3 - This a court decision. In Letang v Cooper, the issue of whether negligent is open to trespass was again discussed. Source 2 was applied in Venning v Chin that it was held by Lord Denning MR's decision (in Source 3) that intentionally inflicted body harm cannot be pleaded as trespass, in contrast to Source 2's decision. * Source 4 - This is an English case, where the Full Court decided that negligent is open for trespass, followed by William v Holland. Source 4 was cited and applied in Venning v Chin that negligent is open for trespass. * Source 5 - This is a High Court of Australia decision citing William v Miloton. This source was used to justify the Australian court position that William v Holland was an English case and does not represent the Australian court position.

Summary Drawing upon biography, literary theory, cultural theory, theodicy, social history, psychoanalysis, philosophy, feminism, lesbian and gay studies, and cultural materialism, Dollimore discusses \\"the complex, often violent, sometimes murderous dialectic between dominant and subordinate cultures, groups, and identities\\" and \\"those conceptions of self, desire, and transgression which figure in the language, ideologies, and cultures of domination, and in the diverse kinds of resistance to it.\\" He refers to the kind of resistance that operates in terms of gender and \\"repeatedly unsettles the very opposition between the dominant and the subordinate\\" as \\"sexual dissidence.\\" He discusses writers such as the theologian Augustine of Hippo, the playwright William Shakespeare, Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, the writers Oscar Wilde and Andr√© Gide, the philosophers Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, and Roger Scruton, and the feminist theorist Jane Gallop. Topics discussed include feminism, feminist theory, homosexuality, homosociality, transvestism, deconstruction, and the \\"perverse dynamic\\". Publication history Sexual Dissidence was first published in 1991 by the Clarendon Press. A second edition, with new material, was published in 2018. Reception Sexual Dissidence received positive reviews from B. R. Burg in Choice, the sociologist Jeffrey Weeks in Victorian Studies, Craig Gingrich- Philbrook in Text and Performance Quarterly, the critic Jeremy Tambling in Modern Language Review, and the philosopher Philipp Rosemann in the International Journal of Philosophical Studies, mixed reviews from the critic Elaine Showalter in the London Review of Books, Collenn Lamos in Signs, from the Virginia Quarterly Review, and a negative review from Roger C. Wade in the Journal of Sex Research. The book was also reviewed by Paul Giles in Modern Language Quarterly, P. Matthews in New Statesman & Society, Robin Robbins in The Times Literary Supplement, and the cultural historian George Rousseau in History of European Ideas and discussed by Peter Dickinson in Essays on Canadian Writing and Biography. Burg described the book as \\"thoughtful and challenging book, not only for its reappraisals of hoary academic controversies like the constructionist-essentialist standoff, but because of the many intriguing analytical formulations it propounds.\\" He credited Dollimore with using a \\"combination of historical method, literary criticism, and generous measures of psychology, sociology, and anthropology to build his complex theses\\". Weeks described the book as \\"extraordinarily versatile\\". Gingrich-Philbrook credited Dollimore with providing \\"significant resources for the articulation of difference in literature, political critique, and the conceptualization and reporting of performance knowledge\\" and praised him for his discussions of Wilde and Gide and his criticism of \\"containment theory\\". However, he considered the book imperfect and believed that it contained \\"impenetrable prose\\". Tambling credited Dollimore with providing \\"a highly suggestive and provocative argument, which makes you wish to argue with it and from it.\\" He praised Dollimore's interest in paradox, transgression, and the \\"perverse dynamic\\", his comparisons of Freud's and Foucault's views on perversion, and his \\"placing of feminist debates relative to discussions of homosexuality\\" in his discussions of Kristeva, Irigaray, and Gallop. He considered Dollimore's arguments about \\"homosocial relationships\\" suggestive. However, he criticized Dollimore for aspects of his reading of Gide, for \\"repetitiousness\\", and for \\"going over ground that should be very familiar\\". He considered some of Dollimore's textual examples irrelevant and believed that his text \\"seems generally unedited\\" and that Dollimore made insufficient use of Derrida's work and neglected that of the philosopher Gilles Deleuze. Rosemann described the book as \\"brilliant\\". He added that it combined \\"philosophical acuity with historical depth\\" and was \\"one of the finest contributions to the debate over identity and difference in recent years.\\" He praised Dollimore's reconstruction of the Renaissance \\"conception of perversion\\" and his discussions of Shakespeare and Wilde, as well as his \\"theoretical sophistication\\". He added \\"Dollimore develops an interpretation of homosexuality as paradigmatic of a dynamic in which the other is drawn out of the same.\\" Showalter credited Dollimore with \\"learning and timeliness\\" but wrote that the book was \\"too sprawling and dense to be readable outside a highly motivated theoretical community\\" and that it was \\"Baffling in its organisation\\" and \\"often goes beyond the difficult to the obstructive\\". She described Dollimore's writing as \\"numbingly abstract\\". Lamos credited Dollimore with \\"command of Western literary culture\\", complimented his discussions of Gide and Wilde, and praised his discussions of topics such as Augustine's concept of sin and transvestism in early modern England. However, while she believed that Sexual Dissidence signaled the \\"coming of age\\" of queer theory and considered it part of a groundbreaking body of work, she wrote that it risked \\"becoming trapped in question-begging debates over the transgressive effects of sexual perversion\\" and that Dollimore was \\"caught in the conflict between a postmodern version of homosexuality as the refusal of sexual identity and the gay liberation version that calls for sex in the streets.\\" She found his writing repetitive and imprecise. She also suggested that \\"sexual dissidence\\" amounted to \\"a code word for homosexuality\\", that Dollimore presented a \\"sanitized\\" version of gay identity by avoiding subjects such as pedophilia, sado-masochism, and sexual fetishism, and that his treatment of Foucault was inconsistent, in that he was indebted to Foucault's ideas but by insisting on the \\"radical nature of homosexuality\\" refused to accept their consequences. She criticized him for being silent about AIDS and for ignoring lesbians in his discussion of homosexuality, and argued that his critique of psychoanalytic accounts of gender difference was \\"hampered by his cursory knowledge of feminist theory.\\" The Virginia Quarterly Review wrote that the work was \\"ambitious, stimulating, and sometimes exasperating\\" and that its \\"vigorous heterogeneity results in a book as brave as it is uneven.\\" It concluded that the work's \\"greatest strength is the vigor and irreverence with which it details the degree to which same-sex desire is perpetually at the center of cultures that strenuously attempt to push it to the margins.\\" Wade credited Dollimore with providing informative reviews of historical views of homosexuality, such as in his discussions of \\"Augustine's beliefs about sexuality and the problem of evil in Christianity\\", and with making accurate assertions about, and raising interesting questions concerning, sexology. However, while he accepted that the book was the product of much effort, he also considered it poorly written and unclear and wrote that it would provide little insight to readers unfamiliar with deconstruction. He was also unconvinced by Dollimore's case that homosexuality \\"has become increasingly central to the maintenance of the current order\\" and dissatisfied with his discussion of Wilde. He criticized him for failing to consider \\"whether gay people are finding their true identities or are creating an identity\\" or to explore the validity of the claim that sexual orientation has a biological basis. He considered Dollimore correct to believe that a more complex understanding of sexual orientation is needed, but criticized him for failing to provide one. In Essays on Canadian Writing, Dickinson compared Dollimore's work to that of the critical theorist Homi K. Bhabha and credited him with formulating a complex theory of \\"perverse dynamics\\" and \\"transgressive reinscriptions\\". The political scientist Sheila Jeffreys described Sexual Dissidence as an example of the way in which gay versions of postmodern theory advocate \\"the revolutionary potential of transgression\\". She criticized Dollimore for describing an 1899 incident in which Wilde helped Gide to \\"buy a young boy musician\\" in Algeria as a case of \\"homosexual liberation\\" rather than as an act of exploitation, for failing to understand that \\"one person's sexual liberation may be another's oppression\\", and for using Derrida's work to argue for a theory suggesting that \\"inversion is necessary and revolutionary and the lesbian feminist project is worthy of derision.\\" References =Bibliography= ;Books  ;Journals     1991 non-fiction books Books about Michel Foucault Books about psychoanalysis Books about Sigmund Freud Books about the philosophy of sexuality Books by Jonathan Dollimore English-language books English non-fiction books Gay non-fiction books Oxford University Press books ","title":"Sexual Dissidence"},{"id":"58466787","text":"Albert Henry Ullin (29 April 1930 ‚Äì 12 September 2018) was a German Australian bookseller and the founder of Australia's first children's bookstore, The Little Bookroom.

Principal photography began in September 2018 in the Newcastle area in north-east England. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Despite having a broken arm in a sling, Loach appeared to promote the film at Cannes, where he said that it would be his final film to compete at the festival.Sight and Sound, Volume 29 (Issue 7), July 2019, page 25 At the 10th Magritte Awards, Sorry We Missed You received the Magritte Award for Best Foreign Film in Coproduction. Plot Ricky (Kris Hitchen) and his family have been fighting an uphill struggle against debt since the 2008 financial crash. Ricky, who has no education or professional training, is given an opportunity when he is hired to run a franchise as a self-employed delivery driver under the supervision of the tough Maloney. In order to afford a van for the job, Ricky convinces his wife Abbie (who uses the car in her work as a home care nurse) to sell the family car. The stress of the new job proves to be too great for Ricky. He is always under pressure to make his deliveries in time and is fined if he is late or makes mistakes. Abbie also finds her work much more demanding without a car and frequently feels upset by the lack of time she is allowed to spend with her patients due to her demanding schedule. The stress of both Ricky and Abbie is greatly increased by their son Seb (Rhys Stone) who both skips school and often gets into trouble with graffiti. After an argument, Seb tags over the family portraits during the night. The next morning Ricky can't find the keys to his van and blames Seb. Seb denies any wrongdoing and in the ensuing argument, Ricky hits Seb. His daughter Liza Jane (Katie Proctor) later tearfully admits that she hid the keys as she blames Ricky's new job for the family's problems. Back at work, Ricky is robbed and brutally assaulted while making his deliveries. While Ricky is in the waiting room at hospital, Maloney phones him and explains that he is facing fines of over ¬£1,000 as his scanner was destroyed during the robbery. After the assault, Seb finally warms up and re-joins the family. The film ends as Ricky drives off to work, still greatly injured and in tears as his family beg him to not leave.

The site's critical consensus reads \\"Sorry We Missed You may strike some as tending toward the righteously didactic, but director Ken Loach's passionate approach remains effective.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 83 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". David Rooney in The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film \\"is an expertly judged and profoundly humane movie, made without frills or fuss but startlingly direct in its emotional depiction of the tough stuff that is the fiber of so many ordinary lives.\\" Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian believed it was superior to Loach's previous film I, Daniel Blake (2016), which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Bradshaw wrote: \\"it is more dramatically varied and digested, with more light and shade in its narrative progress and more for the cast to do collectively. I was hit in the solar plexus by this movie, wiped out by the simple honesty and integrity of the performances.\\" The review in The Times praised the performance of newcomer Debbie Honeywood as Abbie, who was cast after a talent search of non-professionals. Contributor Kevin Maher believed the film should have concentrated on her character instead of Ricky, Abbie's husband. Geoffrey Macnab wrote in The Independent that Loach's film \\"captures brilliantly the alienation and existential anguish that its main characters feel. There is nothing they can do to help themselves. The more they fight to change their circumstances, the worse those circumstances become.\\" Macnab commented that Loach and his screenwriter Laverty \\"pursue their story to its logical conclusion, ending the film in a way that is both ingenious and devastating.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety writes: \\"Loach stages all of this with supreme confidence and flow\\" leading to \\"a fraught, touching, and galvanizing movie.\\" Raphael Abrahams, in his review for the Financial Times, states: \\"In the end credits he [Loach] gives thanks to those drivers whose testimony informed the film but who wished to remain anonymous. He is their much-needed voice and remains that of our moral conscience.\\" Trevor Johnston of British film publication Sight & Sound wrote \\"While Sorry We Missed You may not be as sentimentally affecting as [I, Daniel Blake], it delivers a more nuanced, troubling and provocative state-of-the-nation address.

CHQ stands for \\"Custom House Quay\\". Known as the Tobacco Store to dockworkers, it was built in 1820 to store cargos of tobacco, tea and spirits. Tobacco and tea were kept in separate compartments above ground. Wine and spirit casks were stored in the vaults below ground. Description The building was designed by the Scottish engineer John Rennie, with his son of the same name working as his principal assistant. When it was constructed, the building had one of the largest single interior spaces in the city, and its brick external walls enclosed a space of more than 8,000sqm. The structure was supported by a cast iron frame supporting a slated roof. No wood was used in the construction. The building measures 155m by 55m and of the original nine vaults that run west to east and cover the entire footprint of the building, eight and a half remain after the building was reduced by 5m at its southern end in 1884 in order to widen Custom House Quay. A total of eleven warehouses or \\"stacks\\", as well as three deep-water docks were built on reclaimed land making up the Custom House Docks complex. An description of the CHQ Building dating from 1821 by the Rev. George Newenham Wright, an Anglican clergyman, noted that: :\\"the tobacco store (500 feet by 160, and capable of containing 3,000 hogsheads), the plan of which was given by John Rennie, Esq [has] nine vaults beneath, which altogether afford perfect and convenient storage for 4,500 pipes of wine, allowing a walk behind the heads of the pipes as well as between them; these vaults are lighted by means of thick lenses set in iron plates in the floor of the tobacco store; but this is not sufficient to supersede the necessity of candle light. [The] roof is supported by metal frame-work of an ingenious construction [..] supported by three rows of cylindrical metal pillars, 26 in each row; these rest upon others of granite, which are continued through the stone floor into the vaults beneath.\\"George Newenham Wright, ‚ÄòAn Historical Guide to ancient and modern Dublin. Illustrated by engravings, after drawings by G. Petrie, Esq. To which is annexed a plan of the city‚Äô (Baldwin, Craddock & Joy, 1821), p. 313-315. Use In addition to its use as a storehouse, because of the large interior space, the building has also been put to other uses. For example, on 22 October 1856, the building was the chosen venue for a banquet, paid for by the citizens of Dublin, in honour of those Irish soldiers who had served in the British Army during the Crimean War. The 'Great National Banquet' was the brainchild of Fergus Farrell, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who had been a deputy to Daniel O'Connell. It is estimated that one third of the 111,000 men who served in the war were Irish, including 114 of those involved in the Charge of the Light Brigade. The guests at the banquet included 3,628 soldiers from regiments quartered in Dublin and the four provinces, as well as 1,000 non- military guests, principally subscribers, seated in the gallery overlooking the hall. Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough, the Tipperary-born Colonel-in-Chief of the 60th Royal Rifles, addressed and toasted the attendees. In the early 2000s, the protected structure was restored by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. Irishman Neville Isdell, a former chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola, along with Mervyn Greene, purchased the building in late 2013 with the intention of further developing the structure. Today, the building contains a number of businesses, including the EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum and Dogpatch Labs.

Farrah taught theatre design at Strasbourg (1955-1961) and, as guest, at the National Theatre School of Canada (1968-69). In over three decades as designer, Farrah worked with some thirty directors on more than 250 productions, including designs for plays, operas, ballets and musicals around the world. After his death in 2005, Tom Fleming of the Scotsman called him ‚Äúthe most complete man of the theatre it has been my privilege to know‚Äù.  Biography  Farrah was born in Ksar al-Boukhari, Algeria on 28 March 1926, the second of three sons born to Brahim Farrah and Fatima-Zohra Missoumi. He ran a touring theatre company with his brothers, which performed across Algeria until it was censored and forced to close in 1950. As the political security in Algeria deteriorated, Farrah moved to Paris. He worked as a theatre designer, and taught the subject at the invitation of Michel Saint Denis at the √âcole d‚ÄôArt Dramatique in Strasbourg in the 1950s. In 1955 Farrah was made head of the theatrical design course at the National Theatre School of Strasbourg. It was during this period that he married Simone Pieret, with whom he had two children, Safi and Leila. In 1960, still working with Michel Saint Denis, Farrah designed Stravinsky‚Äôs Oedipus Rex at Sadler‚Äôs Wells, London. The production caught the attention of Peter Hall, who invited him to join the company he was in the process of setting up ‚Äì the Royal Shakespeare Company. Farrah was closely associated with the Royal Shakespeare Company from that point onwards as Associate Designer, working with directors such as Peter Brook, Terry Hands and Clifford Williams. A number of other world-class designers joined Farrah at the RSC, with one such designer John Napier commenting that ‚ÄúAbdel‚Äôs the wisest of us all‚Äù. Farrah continued to work closely with the RSC until his departure in 1991, and between 1994 and 2000 was a visiting lecturer on the European Scenography Centre‚Äôs Masters programme at London‚Äôs Central Saint Martins. Farrah died on the December 18, 2005.  The Abd'Elkader Farrah Collection  The University of Oxford's APGRD maintains an Abd‚ÄôElkader Farrah collection dedicated to his designs and research undertaken for his Greek-inspired productions. Farrah was a close colleague of the APGRD from 2001 onwards, when he was invited to present an exhibition of his Greek projects. His work on Stravinsky‚Äôs Oedipus Rex in 1960 was the subject of an APGRD exhibition and Study Afternoon in 2015 marking the 10th anniversary of his death.

In 1894, the company becomes the Washington Brick Company.Evening Star September 15, 1894 History =The Beginning= The Pension Office Building built in 1883 (now the National Building Museum), featuring Washington Brick Machine Company bricks. The company was incorporated in 1874The New Wrinkle in Brick Making - Evening Star - 23 October 1874 - Page 4 and was originally named the Washington Brick Machine Company. Operating in the northeastern quadrant of the city, it made bricks using a machine as opposed to the more traditional way of molded by hand. This brought prices down in the period following the Civil War when Washington, DC was growing and modernizing under the leadership of Alexander \\"Boss\\" Shepherd and his successor, William Dennison Jr.. For the first decade of its life the company won several big bids with the Federal Government to provide bricks. On September 14, 1876, following a request for bid from the office of General Orville E. Babcock, the company was awarded the contract for 1.5 million burned red bricks to be used for the construction of the east side of State, War and Navy Building.Evening Star - September 14, 1876 - front page On August 30, 1879, the company is awarded the contract to furnish the bricks for the National Museum designed by Adolf Cluss.Washington Brick Machine Company Advertisement - Evening Star August 30, 1879 On July 6, 1880, the company is awarded the contract for the North Wing of the State, War and Navy Building, having the lowest bid price.Local News - Evening Star - July 6, 1880 On July 4, 1881, Edward Clark, Architect of the Capitol awards the company the extension of the Government Printing Office. The price was $6.93 per thousand.Large Contract of Bricks Awarded - Evening Star - July 4, 1881 On January 2, 1883, General Montgomery C. Meigs informs the Secretary of the Interior Henry M. Teller that the Washington Brick Machine Company has signed a contract to provide 600,000 pressed bricks at $10.93 per thousand and 9 million common bricks at $7.93 per thousand for the new Pension Office Building (now the National Building Museum) on Judiciary Square.New Pension Office Building - The National Republican - February 5, 1883 =Brick Size Controversy= The Washington Brick Machine Company was at the center of a controversy in the early part of 1884 being a major producer of bricks with 80,000 bricks being made each day.The Brick Question Again - Evening Star - March 5, 1884 The Sealer of the Weights and Measures, Mr. Small started criticizing the manufacturers for their inconsistency in size and weight of bricks. The attacks were targeted primarily at machine-made bricks as he affirmed that they were smaller and weighed more than the traditional hand- made bricks due to a higher density. These bricks, therefore were not in compliance with the law at the time.The Size of Bricks - The Evening Star - February 1, 1884 By then three quarters of the bricks being made in the city were machine-made. The attacks were a reaction to the threat to the artisans' way of life by mechanization.The Brick Question - Evening Star - March 19, 1884 An October 30, 1820 ordinance setting the size of bricks to 9 1/4 x 4 5/8 and 2 1/4 in clear was not being enforced. The molds were also required to be marked \\"stamped as correct by the sealer of weight and measures\\". It appears that this had not been enforced for some time.The Use and Manufacture of Bricks in the City - Evening Star - June 14, 1884A committee representing the Federation of Labor joined the debates with the District Commissioners in the interest of the traditional hand-made manufacturers which they represented. They argued that making the smaller bricks affected the workman's wages as well as raised price of bricks for builders. They promised to provide samples to prove their case.Protested against small bricks - Evening Star - February 13, 1884 The Washington Brick Machine Company and other brick manufactures brought samples to the Inspector of Buildings Entwisle to have them measures. They were said to come from the standard molds. While they were brought to the wrong office he gave his opinion on the matter stating that the difference in size was due to the nature of the clay. While the machine molds were smaller, they were packed more compactly then the hand made ones leading to a larger brick once fired.The Brickmakers and their bricks - The Evening Critic - February 20, 1884 On March 12, 1884, the Federation of Labor was told of the possibility of an amendment to the law was being discussed but that it was being reviewed by the Engineer Commissioner Lydecker.The Size of Bricks - Evening Star - March 12, 1884 It appears that the underlying reason for this controversy had to do with the unfair competition experienced by the traditional manufacturers. The Washington Brick Machine Company along with A. Richards & Son, William H. West & Brothers, W.T. Walker, Ino P. Appleman and I.P. childs & Son manufactured three quarters of the bricks used in the city. This represented 50 million bricks at the time. The hand-made bricks represented a fraction of sales and the wages were falling as they were not competitive with the machines.The Brick Question - Evening Star - March 19, 1884. On May 26, 1884, the Committee on Bricks of the Federation of Labor submitted an amendment to the law to Major Lydecker: All bricks sold or offered for sale in the District of Columbia, except cornice or fancy bricks, shall measure not less than 9 inches in length, 4 1/2 inches in width and 2 1/4 inches in thickness. Any bricks sold or offered for sale in the said District under the said size by any brick merchant will subject the said merchant to a penalty of $50 fine or 60 days in jail for the first offense, or both, and $500 fine or one year in Jail, or both, for the second offense; the said fines to be collected the same as other District fines.\\"District Government Affairs - Evening Star - May 26, 1884 =Wagon Crashes= On May 15, 1884, two accidents involving wagons owned by the Washington Brick Machine Company were involved in crashes with children. The first one occurred in an alley between 9th Street NW and 19th Street NW. The driver was named Alfred Robinson and the victim was a 14-year-old boy named Henry York. The wagon was stalled and when the team started, the swingtree knocked the boy down and a wheel rolled over his legs. He survived.Two Boys Run Over by Brick Carts - Evening Star - May 16, 1884 The second one involved brick wagon # 17 driven by Robert Duvall who ran over Charles Hassler, an eight-year-old boy. The crash occurred at the corner of 1st St NE and H Street NE in the heart of Swampoodle. He was taken to his house and died ten minutes later. The driver was arrested by the police. On May 17, Robert Duvall was first charged with reckless drivingcharged with Manslaughter - Evening Star - May 17, 1884 before was charged with manslaughter and sent to a grand jury.Duvall held for a Grand Jury - The Evening Critic - May 22, 1884 The charge was ignored on June 10, 1884Evening Star - June 10, 1884 - page 1 =Real Estate Investments= Starting in 1884, the company also started diversifying its business. While it was still making bricks, it was also buying land for real estate development. It purchased the tract of land known as Trinidad from Columbian University (now George Washington University) on October 17, 1884. This piece of land represented 150 acres located north of Boundary Street (now Florida Avenue NE) between Kendall Green (now Gallaudet University) and Bladensburg Pike (now Bladensburg Road NE). It had been donated to the university several years before by William W. Corcoran. The university sold it for $100,000.The National Republican - October 17, 1884 In December of the same year, the university files an injunction against the company accusing them of removing top soil and clay from the lot adjacent to the factory to manufacture bricks a few weeks before. A restraining order was issued by the court.An Injunction Against the Brick Company - The National Republican - December 12, 1884. However, on April 1, 1885, it is announced that the company purchased 152 acres east of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum (Gallaudet University) from Columbian University ($85,000) and the children of Mr. Oyster ($20,000).National Republican - April 01, 1885 - page 4Evening Star - April 11, 1885 - page 5 Later that year on June 10, 1885, it was announced that the company was going to develop a new residential complex on square 1003 between 12th and 13th Street NE and H Street NE and I Street NE. A new 44 feet wide street would be laid in the middle of the square and be called Wylie Street with two alleys running on the back parallel to it. It was estimated that the cost to build the street would range from $30,000 to $40,000. 105 lots would be available on the square ranging from 20 to 30 feet on the front. Houses would be built by the company with between 7 and 10 rooms.Evening star - June 10, 1885 - page 5Brickmakers' Cottages - National Republican - June 11, 1885 - page 4However, most of the houses built were not this big.Auction Advertisement - Evening Star - April 29, 1887 - supplement On September 15, 1894, the company field a deed to transfer all assets from the old company to the Washington Brick Company. This allowed the company to legally change its name by removing the word machine. Operations Map showing the Washington Brick Company lot in 1907 in Trinidad The offices of the company were located at 1420 New York Avenue NW.Brick Manufacturers - National Republican - December 7, 1883 The Washington Brick Company operated from the northeast quadrant of the city. Its manufacturing plant was located off of Boundary Street (now Florida Avenue) where it intersects with H Street NE in what is now the Trinidad neighborhood. The plant covered 10 acres of land in what was at the time rural land. Part of the property was used to mine the fine clay used to make the bricks on site. According to the promoters, it could be mined to a depth of 40 feet. On site, visitors could see several low sheds probably used to dry the bricks, a large building containing an engine and the machine room. The kilns used to fire the bricks were also on-site and the company was building ovens to dry the bricks and no longer rely on sunny days to dry the bricks. It employed 23 men working in various roles focused around a new machine in 1874 which allowed for the manufacturing of bricks to be industrialized. The machine was Graham's patent and introduced to Washington, DC by S. E. Henkins representing the National Brick Machine Company based in New Jersey allowing for the manufacturing of between 40,000 and 60,000 bricks a day. This machine was powered by a forty- horsepower engine (housed in the main building). Barrows of loose clay and stones were thrown in a hopper where they would be crushed by four two feet in diameter rollers. The pulverized clay powder would then drop in a mixing cylinder where it would we steamed. It would then make its way into a vat. A conveyor belt of buckets would collect just enough to form a brick. The wet clay would then fall into a mold before dropping on a conveyor belt. From there they were taken off by men and transported on barrows to a drying room prior to being fired up in the kiln.

Pahlavi government  Modern Iranian- Libyan relations began in the 1960s with King Idris reigning in Libya and the Shah (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) reigning in Iran. Tension began between the two nations following the rise of Colonel Muammar Ghadafi in Libya. Ghadafi, along with other Arab leaders, accused the Shah of betraying his Arab neighbors‚Äô interests and supporting Israel.Zonis, Marvin Majestic Failure The Fall of the Shah, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991 page 199.  After the Iranian revolution  = Before the Libyan revolution = The Iranian revolution of 1979 resulted in the overthrow of the Shah and the improvement of Iranian-Libyan relations. The turning point in Iran‚ÄìLibya relations came during the Iran-Iraq War, when Libya came to Iran's aid despite western pressure to keep Iran isolated. During the war Libya and Syria were Iran's only middle eastern allies. Iranian-Libyan cooperation during the 1990s led to the construction of factories, roads, and hospitals in both Libya and Iran. Ghadafi would even visit then Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei. At the UN Security Council, Ghadafi vindicated Iran's nuclear program and opposed western sanctions against the Islamic Republic. However, relations between the two nations would again become strained following the kidnapping and probable murder of the influential Shia leader Musa al Sadr in Libya. = After the Libyan revolution = Iran supported the 2011 uprising against the Libyan government, describing it as an \\"Islamic awakening\\" and condemning the government crackdown. The Libyan ambassador to Iran later resigned due to the Arab Spring protests in his home country. Following the overthrow of Ghadafi, Iran recognized the new Libyan transitional government.

Currently, all rail connections with Heathrow airport run along an east‚Äìwest alignment to and from central London. Most rail passengers heading for Heathrow must pass through London Zone 1 stations in order to reach Heathrow. The British government's Department for Transport has considered various proposed schemes for new links to improve access to the airport. Background Airport rail links such as Heathrow Express provide transport into central London Heathrow Airport is a major international airport which lies west of Central London. For the first 45 years of its operation, public transport links to Heathrow Airport were provided by airport buses. Rail connections to Heathrow Airport began in 1977 with the extension of the London Underground Piccadilly line to Heathrow Central tube station (now Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3). The Tube was extended to Terminal 4 in 1986 and Terminal 5 in 2008. A new airport rail link opened between Heathrow and London Paddington station in 1998, when the Heathrow Express service began, followed soon after by Heathrow Connect which was a stopping service at all stations between Heathrow and London Paddington. The mainline rail service is due to be enhanced and extended to central London and Essex when the Elizabeth line, currently under construction, opens in 2021 (delayed from 2019). Proposals The Heathwick proposal One of the transport projects being considered is the Western Rail Approach to Heathrow Heathrow Southern Railway The high-speed rail HS4Air proposal A number of schemes have been proposed over the years to develop new rail transport links with other parts of London and with stations outside the city. As yet, none of these proposals has been confirmed or funded. = Dudding Hill Line (1990‚Äì2008) = In the late 1990s, the Dudding Hill Line in North London ‚Äî currently closed to passenger services ‚Äî was considered by BAA as a potential route for the planned Heathrow Express service to run to . Transport Plans for London Various plans for Heathrow services into central London The line was once again featured in the High Speed North scheme put forward by transport campaigners in 2008, which envisaged creating a rail link between Heathrow and via the Chiltern Main Line and the Dudding Hill Line to connect with the Midland Main Line at a \\"Cricklewood Interchange\\" station. = SuperCrossrail and Superlink (2004) = Two schemes known as SuperCrossrail and Superlink were put forward in 2004 by a group of rail industry managers as alternative proposals to the Crossrail route being planned at the time. They proposed connecting a number of regional stations such as , , and via a new underground railway through central London, with a station at Heathrow Airport. The scheme was rejected by planners in favour of the simpler Crossrail route. = Airtrack (2009) = In 2009, Heathrow Airport Limited unveiled a proposal for a new rail link called Heathrow Airtrack which would connect Heathrow Terminal 5 along a southern alignment to the Waterloo‚ÄìReading line. The scheme would have enabled direct rail services between , Heathrow Airport, and , improving transport links with stations to the South West of the airport. The project was abandoned in 2011 due to lack of funding and difficulties with a high number of level crossings on the route into London. = HS2 Heathrow Hub (2009) = A station serving Heathrow Airport, Heathrow Hub railway station, was included in the early proposals for the planned High Speed 2 (HS2) railway line. The spur from HS2 to Heathrow was dropped from the plans in March 2015. = Heathrow‚ÄìGatwick rail link (2011‚Äì2013) = Various schemes to create a transport link between Heathrow and Gatwick Airports have been considered, collectively known as Heathwick. Gatwick lies around south-east of Heathrow Airport, and like Heathrow, it has rapid rail connections into central London but there are no transport connections between the two airports. A fast rail link would allow the airports to operate jointly as an airline hub. Among the schemes has been a 2011 proposal for a high-speed rail link; and a 2013 proposal for a rapid transit system named London Air Rail Transit system (LARTs) running parallel to the M25 which would connect Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton Airports. = Great Western main line (2012) = The Western Rail Approach to Heathrow scheme was announced by the Department of Transport in July 2012 to build a spur from Heathrow Terminal 5 along a north-western alignment, connecting the airport to the Great Western main line. This connection will enable direct trains from , , and , and improve airport connections with the South West, South Wales and the West Midlands. = Windsor Link (2013) = In 2013, a proposal was announced for the Windsor Link Railway, a privately financed project to link the Slough‚ÄìWindsor & Eton and the Staines‚ÄìWindsor railway lines. The scheme also includes a branch to Heathrow Terminal 5, with a potential connection to Crossrail. In 2018, the Department for Transport began to invite proposals for privately funded rail links to Heathrow Airport. As well as the Western Rail Approach, other projects being considered for public‚Äìprivate partnership have included: = Heathrow Southern Railway / Southern Access to Heathrow (2018) = The Heathrow Southern Railway scheme, similar to the abandoned Airtrack proposal, envisages the construction of a south-aligned rail link to connect the Terminal 5 station with or and , which would allow trains to run from , and Guildford direct to the airport stations. It would also create a link to the airport from via , , and . In a November 2019 document from the DfT, this proposed link is renamed Southern Access to Heathrow (SAtH) since other options besides heavy rail are being considered. = HS4Air (2018) = HS4Air was a proposal for a new high-speed railway line which would link HS2 to the High Speed 1 line and the Channel Tunnel. The proposed route would run south of London, with stations at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. The HS4Air scheme was rejected by Government in December 2018 and will not go ahead.

Already exhibiting as an undergraduate in 1964, Sharpe attracted serious notice by 1968, with large-scale, complex abstract works such as Universe (1968), which was publicly exhibited at the Smart Museum, and inclusion in major shows at the Art Institute of Chicago and Renaissance Society.

Work and reception  Sharpe's work was recognized very early in his career for its formal sophistication and maturity, which some critics suggest provided him with the confidence and credibility to develop it in relatively dramatic, stylistic shifts. Despite the shifts in style, his bodies of work have been consistently recognized for their command of color, handling of paint, complex compositions, and wide array of formal strategies. Critics have also noted his increasingly freewheeling use of art historical allusions and strategies which engage with painting as a process of seeing, mediated by memory and cultural knowledge. Sharpe's work can be organized into three relatively distinct bodies: 1) Organic Abstraction (1967‚Äì1973); 2) Abstract Landscapes (early 1970s‚Äì1979); and 3) Abstract Representational work (late 1970s‚Äì ). = Organic Abstraction (1967‚Äì1973) = When Sharpe left SAIC, he was creating complex, vibrant abstract works noted for their bright color, tightly clustered compositions, and adventurous mix of formal strategies.Smart Museum of Art.

David Sharpe, Untitled Landscape, oil on canvas, 56\\" x 68,\\" 1970. = Abstract Landscapes (early 1970s‚Äì1979) = In the early 1970s, Sharpe began creating rhythmic, abstract works composed of repeated, brightly colored dots, dashes, squiggles and hatching, such as Untitled Landscape (1970), that critics described as pointillist or calligraphic \\"landscapes,\\" and linked to Neo-Impressionism.Florescu, Michael. \\"David Sharpe,\\" Arts Magazine, June, 1978.Zimmer, William.

Less contained than his earlier works and lacking a single focal point, these still-complex compositions featured a patchwork of vignettes spread laterally across formats that were unified by color and rhythm.

Based on drawings representing Sharpe's experience of the midwestern American landscape, the paintings appeared primarily abstract except for their compositions‚Äîwhich suggested panoramas of mountains, rivers and geography, surveyed from above‚Äîand marks, which seemed to reference architectural and topographical signs and symbols. Mary Jane Jacob wrote that rather than literal representations, the paintings functioned as composites or \\"imaginative chartings\\" of imaginary places.

Initially, he punctuated his dizzying compositions with small, often-hidden, Matisse-like nymphs. However, by 1979, the figure emerged as his primary subject, with the patterned landscapes retreating to the background or to pictures hanging on interior walls.

Some critics felt that the landscapes suffered when figures were introduced or wondered whether the \\"spirited bit of whimsy\\" might wear out its welcome among Sharpe's admirers. However, Arts Magazine critic and artist Stephen Westfall wrote, \\"Sharpe‚Äôs raiding of 20th-century art has become more boisterous and his paint handling more daring,\\" while David Elliott of the Chicago Sun-Times found them \\"sporty\\" in their mix of provocative color, humor, history lessons, kitsch, and knowingness. Sharpe expanded his repertoire in the mid-1980s with motifs from pre-modernist literature, mythology and popular culture. In works such as Demeter (1985), which New York Times critic Grace Glueck noted for its deadpan satire and camp drollery, he addressed the voyeuristic and theatrical aspects of looking and reading art. Later in the decade, he created his \\"Guadeloupe\\" series: radiant, tropical-island scenes based on recollections of beaches, caf√© life and agricultural activities there.Adrian, Dennis. \\"David Sharpe at Zaks Gallery,\\" Chicago Gallery Guide, May 1987. Depicted in a \\"faux naif\\" style, with typically complex, frieze-like compositions referencing Poussin, Millet and 17th-century Dutch genre painters, these paintings were considered some of the most satisfying Sharpe had created. Alan Artner, once a skeptic of Sharpe's figurative shift, found the more decorative works beautifully integrated, with an idyllic, easygoing feeling he welcomed over the darker themes Sharpe had been exploring. In the next decades, Sharpe reworked his themes and elements in new directions. By the early 1990s, he transported the high color and patterns of the \\"Guadeloupe\\" works into both urban settings and farm landscapes,Artner, Alan G. \\"Sharpe‚Äôs new works move joyous color to urban setting,\\" Chicago Tribune, April 21, 1989.

Critic Margaret Hawkins and others have described his later figurative interiors (e.g., 10/9/15, 2015), as having an almost violent, \\"scratchy immediacy\\" that creates psychological tension in otherwise serene domestic settings.Hawkins, Margaret. \\"Even the ordinary adds weird touch to Sharpe‚Äôs work,\\" Chicago Sun-Times, May 19, 2006.Miller, Chris \\"David Sharpe/Carl Hammer Gallery,\\" New City, December 3, 2013.

Associated with the American social theorist Murray Bookchin, it emerged from a time in the mid-1960s, under the emergence of both the global environmental and the American civil rights movements, and played a much more visible role from the upward movement against nuclear power by the late 1970s. It presents ecological problems as arising mainly from social problems, in particular from different forms of hierarchy and domination, and seeks to resolve them through the model of a society adapted to human development and the biosphere. It is a theory of radical political ecology based on communalism, which opposes the current capitalist system of production and consumption. It aims to set up a moral, decentralized, united society, guided by reason. Overview Murray Bookchin developed the theory of Social Ecology Bookchin's theory presents a utopian philosophy of human evolution that combines the nature of biology and society into a third \\"thinking nature\\" beyond biochemistry and physiology, which he says is a more complete, conscious, ethical, and rational nature. Humanity, according to this line of thought, is the latest development from the long history of organic development on Earth. Bookchin's social ecology proposes ethical principles for replacing a society's propensity for hierarchy and domination with that of democracy and freedom. He wrote about the effects of urbanization on human life in the early 1960s during his participation in the civil rights and related social movements. Bookchin then began to pursue the connection between ecological and social issues, culminating with his best-known book, The Ecology of Freedom, which he had developed over a decade. His argument, that human domination and destruction of nature follows from social domination between humans, was a breakthrough position in the growing field of ecology. Life develops from self-organization and evolutionary cooperation (symbiosis). Bookchin writes of preliterate societies organized around mutual need but ultimately overrun by institutions of hierarchy and domination, such as city- states and capitalist economies, which he attributes uniquely to societies of humans and not communities of animals. He proposes confederation between communities of humans run through democracy rather than through administrative logistics. Bookchin's work, beginning with anarchist writings on the subject in the 1960s, has continuously evolved. Towards the end of the 1990s, he increasingly integrated the principle of communalism, with aspirations more inclined towards institutionalized municipal democracy, which distanced him from a certain evolution of anarchism. Inspired by anarchism (mainly by Kropotkine) and communism (the writings of Marx and Engels). Social ecology refuses the pitfalls of a Neo-Malthusian ecology which erases social relationships by replacing them with \\"natural forces\\", but also of a technocratic ecology which considers that technology must be relied on and more of power in the States. According to Bookchin, these two currents depoliticize ecology and mythologize the past or the future. Thus, social ecology is articulated through several key principles: *Interdependence and the principle of unity in diversity. Social ecology seeks to oppose the standardization of beings and thoughts and wants to promote the contribution of diversity, of the organic union of different parts of society. The differences must be promoted as bringing a diversity of talents, points of view, styles allowing to make evolve the company while making it more stable. * Decentralization. A social ecology society would take the form of a confederation of decentralized municipalities linked to each other by commercial and social ties. Dispersed renewable energy sources would feed these communities on a human scale and provide for each according to their needs. * Direct democracy. Structured around the principle of a form of communalism called libertarian municipalism, social ecology advocates the development of municipal assemblies, a modernized version of the type developed by the Athenians in Antiquity or implemented during the Paris Commune for political decision-making. The decisions concerning the life of the commune are discussed and voted by majority in these assemblies. Similarly, at the higher level, representatives with imperative mandates, and therefore revocable, are appointed to represent their municipality at regional, national, etc. assemblies. It is a horizontal system, a non- hierarchical popular democracy, whose decisions go from the bottom up and are taken transparently face-to-face. *A renewal of citizenship. At the base of the social ecology system are the citizen and the community. Each person must relearn to participate in the choices concerning local life, and to do this he must relearn to decide in common. The citizen must become responsible again and know the minimum allowing him to take an active part in the management of the company, in particular, what has a direct repercussion on his life and that of others. *A liberating technology. Social ecology is not opposed to modern technologies but is in favor of developing them to put them at the service of human beings. Science must regain its moral meaning and develop for humans, not enslave it. Modern machines and tools must become multifunctional, durable, environmentally friendly and easy to use and maintain. By becoming a master of the technique he uses, the citizen will be able to free himself from strenuous work and concentrate on the creative and positive aspect of the tasks. *A social vision of work. Developing machines has, in social ecology, the aim of freeing human beings from a large part of manual work (factory work) that can be done by machines, in order to leave them creative work and reduce working time. The time saved could allow him to participate in the political life of his district and to enjoy social life more fully. The model is thus articulated around diversified partial times, combining as much work as possible inside and outside, intellectual and concrete, etc. The hierarchies at work will be replaced by supervisors whose sole purpose is to provide a global vision on the work of a company. *Dialectical naturalism. Dialectical naturalism is a dialectical philosophy developed to serve as an ethical foundation for a society based on the principles of social ecology. In order to fight against the ravages of Western binary representations, this philosophy is based on \\"developmental\\" thinking to understand the complexity of living things. Thus, dialectical naturalism invites us not to study species by isolating them from each other, which is \\"a reflection of the entrepreneurial bias of our culture\\" but to think about their interrelations. Its principle is that \\"what should be\\" must serve as an ethical basis for \\"what is\\", with the aim of accompanying freedom in germ in nature.  Movements  = International meetings = In May 2016, the first ‚ÄúInternational Social Ecology Meetings‚Äù were organized in Lyon, which brought together a hundred radical environmentalists, decreasing figures and libertarians, most of whom came from France, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, but also from the United States, Guatemala and Canada. At the center of the debates: libertarian municipalism as an alternative to the nation state and the need to rethink activism. The second edition of the meetings takes place in Bilbao, in October 2017. = Kurdish movement = Bookchin's reflections on social ecology and libertarian municipalism also inspired Abdullah √ñcalan, the historical leader of the Kurdish movement, to create the concept of democratic confederalism, which aims to bring together the peoples of the Middle East in a confederation democratic, multicultural and ecological communes. Adopted by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) since 2005, the √ñcalan's project represented a major ideological shift in the Kurdish nationalist movement, once engaged in the armed struggle for an independent state, to go beyond early Marxism-Leninism's notion of nation-state. In addition to the PKK, √ñcalan's internationalist project was also well received by its Syrian counterpart, the Party of Democratic Union (PYD), which would become the first organization in the world to actually found a society based on the principles of democratic confederalism. On January 6, 2014, the cantons of Rojava, in Syrian Kurdistan, federated into autonomous municipalities, adopting a social contract which established a decentralized non-hierarchy society, based on principles of direct democracy, feminism, ecology, cultural pluralism, participatory politics and economic cooperativism.

Torture in Venezuela has been a controversial issue in recent years, especially during the crisis in Venezuela. The United Nations, Organization of American States, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Foro Penal have denounced acts of violence and torture towards those who oppose the Bolivarian government.Venezuela's Brutal Crime Crackdown: Executions, Machetes and 8,292 DeadVenezuela's Brutal Crime Crackdown: Executions, Machetes and 8,292 Dead State institutions such as the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) have been accused of torturing opponents of the Bolivarian government.  Colonial era  Under rule of the Royal Audiencia of Caracas and the Spanish Inquisition, inhabitants of Venezuela faced serious repression. The Catholic Church served as an important source to royalists, with priests serving as informants who would provide accusations to Inquisition judges because they believed crimes against the Spanish king were crimes against God. Judges then held the power to torture those accused of crimes during interrogations in order to obtain a confession. However, this practice was rare in Spanish-ruled Venezuela since it had already became controversial, even in Europe. When the Royal Audiencia was deposed and the Supreme Junta was established, the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence explicitly stated that the death penalty was abolished, torture was forbidden and that courts would presume innocence. However as Venezuela began to face conflicts shortly after its independence, repressive behaviors within the government returned.  Juan Vicente G√≥mez  Cells of La Rotunda in 1924 In 1854, a house of correction called \\"\\" was built to rehabilitate common criminals. Under President Juan Pablo Rojas Pa√∫l, La Rotunda was converted into a prison. La Rotunda grew in prominence under the governments of Cipriano Castro and Juan Vicente G√≥mez between 1900 and 1935, who heavily utilized the prison for political persecution. Types of punishment and torture included being placed in stocks, strappado, ball and chain, having a rope tightened around your temple and having poison or ground glass placed into food. It was not uncommon that prisoners were tortured or starved to death.  Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez  Under the dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez, Venezuelan authorities held little regard for the human rights of citizens. Police often raided homes without search warrants and individuals were imprisoned without evidence. While initially detained, individuals faced torture in instances of interrogation. Political police targeted, arrested, tortured and killed his opponents. Those who were attacked include future Venezuelan president R√≥mulo Betancourt, Jaime Lusinchi and Luis Herrera Campins. Lusinchi was jailed for two months in 1952 and was beaten with a sword.  Democratic era  According to Human Rights Watch, the Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez administration also tortured and executed opponents with a judicial branch that largely ignored abuses by his government. The and DISIP were used as tools to persecute dissenters. Following the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempts, a crackdown on alleged plotters resulted in accusations of torture by those arrested.  Bolivarian Revolution  La Tumba (The Tomb), a SEBIN prison where many prisoners have been tortured Under the Bolivarian governments, levels of torture occurred that had not been seen since the dictatorship of Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. Following the election of Hugo Ch√°vez, human rights in Venezuela deteriorated. According to Universidad Metropolitana in 2006, \\"the inquisitorial process\\" that was abolished in the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence returned to Venezuela. By 2009, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights released a report stating that Venezuela's government practiced \\"repression and intolerance\\". During the presidency of Nicol√°s Maduro, torture in Venezuela increased. In La Tumba (The Tomb), one of the headquarters and prisons of SEBIN, has been used for white torture and some of its prisoners have attempted suicide. Conditions in La Tumba have resulted with prisoner illnesses, though Venezuelan authorities refuse to medically treat those imprisoned. Bright lights are continuously left on and prison cells are set at near-freezing temperatures. In December 2014, the United States signed Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 to impose targeted sanctions on Venezuelan individuals responsible for human rights violations as a result of the 2014 Venezuelan protests. The law allows the freezing of assets and visa bans for those accused of using acts of violence or violating the human rights of those opposing the Venezuelan government. In March 2015, the United States froze assets and revoked visas of several senior officials connected to human rights abuses in Venezuela; these sanctions were condemned in Latin America. In November 2014, Venezuela appeared before the United Nations Committee Against Torture over cases between 2002 and 2014, which criticized the Venezuelan National Commission for the Prevention of Torture for being biased in favor towards the Bolivarian government. The Committee had also expressed concern with \\"beatings, burnings and electric shocks in efforts to obtain confessions\\" that occurred during the 2014 Venezuelan protests and that of the 185 investigations for abuses during the protests, only 5 individuals had been charged. United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture Juan E. M√©ndez stated on 11 March 2015 that Venezuela had ignored requests for information and that he had made \\"conclusions based on the lack of response\\" and \\"concluded that the government violated the rights of prisoners\\", further saying that the Maduro government failed \\"with the obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish all acts of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\\". During the 2017 Venezuelan protests, more than 290 cases of torture and thousands of extrajudicial executions were documented by the Organization of American States. = Foreign involvement = The Organization of American, with information provided by Casla, reported that some of the 46,000 members of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces assisting the government of Nicol√°s Maduro were involved with torturing Venezuelans who opposed Maduro. Prisoners reported that they recognized Cuban accents among those who were torturing them.

P. spinulosum is able to grow and reproduce in environment with low temperature and low water availability, and is known to be acidotolerant. P. spinulosum is ubiquitously distributed, and can often be isolated from soil. Each individual strain of P. spinulosum differs from others in their colony morphology, including colony texture, amount of sporulation and roughness of conidia and conidiophores.  History and taxonomy  Penicillium spinulosum was first discovered in 1910 by Dr. Charles Thom as a contaminant in another Penicillium culture sent to him by the German mycologist, Dr. Carl Wehmer. Classification and identification of the genus Penicillium were solely based on morphological traits before DNA sequencing was discovered. Key characteristics that are commonly involved in the grouping of P. spinulosm include vesiculate, rapid growth, spherical rough conidia and long conidiophores that projected from tangled mass of aerial hyphae. In 1949, Raper & Thom classified P. spinulosum as a member of the Penicillium section Monovertcillata due to its simple conidiospores branching pattern. In 1980 , Pitt modified their classification by only including species with conidiospore stipes that are strictly or predominantly monovertcillate in the subgenus Aspergilloides, and P. spinulosm was placed under one of his newly introduced sections called Aspergilloides due to the presence of an apical swelling on the conidiophore resembling members of the genus, Aspergillus. As classification based on morphology can be problematic, the taxonomy was repeatedly studied. P. spinulosm is phenotypically similar to P. glabrum and the related species P. purpurescens and P. montanense. Their categorization was studied by the international commission on Penicillium and Aspergillus in 1900, and the study indicated that the identification could be achieved based on width of the phialides, the conidial wall texture and the colony diameters, 4 out of the 15 strains, however, were still indistinguishable. The problem of phenotype-based identification was later solved by Peterson (2000) by using nuclear ribosomal RNA gene sequences.  Growth and morphology  Penicillium spinulosum has round, spiny or irregularly rough-walled conidia produced in loose columns. The diameter of a conidium ranges from 3.0 to 3.5 ¬µm. Penicillium spinulosum has thin-walled conidia with smooth or finely roughened texture terminating in a vesicle, the stipes of conidiospores generally range from 100 to 300 ¬µm long, occasionally the length can be shorter than that. The conidiophores of P. spinulosum can arise from submerged or aerial hyphae. For conidiophores arising from aerial hyphae, the size of the stipes is shorter, e.g., 25-30 ¬µm in length. The apex of conidiophores is inflated with simple (or monoverticilate) branching pattern. The conidiophores of P. spinulosum are terminated in 6 to 9 flask or bottom- shaped structure called phialides, these are not very abundant, and the length of individual phialide ranges from 2.5 to 3 ¬µm. Subdivision of the genus Penicillium into subgenera and sections has traditionally been based on the branching pattern of the conidiophore. The conidiophores of P. spinulosum do not branch and is described as monoverticillate. However, modern phylogenetic studies of the genus Penicillium have revealed that these morphological patterns can arise independently, and thus do not reliably predict evolutionary relationships. Growing colonies of P. spinulosum have broad white edges consist of white mycelium. Young colonies appears blue-green or grey-green and white to cream or faintly pink on the reverse. As the colonies mature, the colour becomes grey. The growth of P. spinulosum on czapek dox agar (CZ), malt extract agar (MEA) and Yeast Extract with Supplements (YES) occur rapidly. On CZ or MEA, colonies can spread broadly, reaching 20-30 mm in a week at 25 ¬∞C with light or moderate sporulation. The texture of the colony when grown on CZ is velutinous to floccose, which means that conidiophores can either arise like short velvet with little aerial mycelium or from a mass of tangled aerial hyphae.  Physiology  Penicillium spinulosum is psychrophilic, meaning that it is able to grow and reproduce at low temperature, and xerophile as it can germinate in decreased water activity environment (down to 0.8 Aw) by producing compatible solutes using enzyme systems. In vitro, P. spinulosum does not grow at 37 ¬∞C. Jussila stated that no mycotoxin production by P. spinulosum have been reported, however, based on the work of Overy and colleagues, a mixed culture of P. glabrum and P. spinulosum was involved in chestnuts spoilage and mycotoxin production. Colonies growth and germination of Penicillium spinulosum were extremely sensitive to several different disinfectants and preservatives, among them, potassium sorbate and Suma Bac imposed the strongest inhibition effect. Compare to the two other Penicillium species that isolated from baked products with P. spinulosm together (P. expansum and P. verruculosum), P. spinulosm shows better resistant to benzoic acid but more susceptible to sodium lactate during spore germination. P. spinulosm is able to survive in acidic environment although growth will be impeded. When grow in a chemically defined glucose or sucrose medium, can produce large amount of fat that is non-toxic to rats.  Habitat and ecology  Penicillium spinulosum is found world-wide, and is most commonly isolated from soil. P. spinulosum has also been isolated from dextrin paste, distilled water containers, cotton yarn, walnut kernels, chrome tanned leather, vinyl wall covering, paracetamol tablet, diesel fuel and emulsion paint treated with chromate. P. spinulosumis highly resistant to heavy metals, tannins and acids, and can be isolated from substrata contaminated by those materials.  Pathogenicity  The pathogenicity of P. spinulosum remains controversial. In vitro, spores produced by P. spinulosum were reported to cause toxic and inflammatory responses in mouse macrophages. However, according to an experiment done by Jussila, this fungus can induce inflammation due to the production of moderate pro-inflammatory cytokines. The response of which is dose- and time- dependent and not cytotoxic even at high spore dose, so it is not likely to cause acute respiratory inflammations. Respiratory tract infection due to P. spinulosm was reported by Delore et al. in 1955, but the isolate they described had smooth conidia and restricted growth; by contrast, P. spinulosm typically has conidia with small spines and its growth is rapid. P. spinulosm is thought to be unlikely to cause human infection due to its inability to grow at 37¬∞C.

It spreads through airborne spores and is often extremely abundant in outdoor air during the spring and summer seasons. It mainly feeds on decomposing organic matter in warmer climates, but can also be parasitic and feed on living plants. The airborne spores can occasionally cause cutaneous infections in humans, and the high prevalence of C. oxysporum in outdoor air during warm seasons contributes to its importance as an etiological agent of allergic disease and possibly human cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis in tropical regions.  History and taxonomy  This species was described by Reverend Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1868 in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.  Growth and morphology  Cladosporium oxysporum expands moderately, often floccose at the center of the fungus that consists of woolly tufts, and it can grow up to 650 Œºm long and 4-5 Œºm wide. The colony is colored olive to olive-green on top with velvety surface, and greenish black at the bottom. The conidiophores are either straight or slightly bent, and the conidia range from oval to lemon- shaped. C. oxysporum produces conidia in unbranched or branched chains arising from cylindrical base cells. After the first spores have formed on the conidiophore, they bud apically to form secondary spores. They have pores connected in very fragile chains that can fall apart at the slightest movement of air, the spores are wind-dispersed and often extremely abundant in outdoor air under warm temperature.  Habitat and ecology  Cladosporium oxysporum is mostly located Asia and Africa, but it can also be found distributed throughout tropical and the subtropical regions. The fungus is commonly found on dead herbaceous and woody plants in the tropics as they are sapotrophs in warmer climates. In general, most Cladosporium species are widely distributed throughout the world In tropical and subtropical regions, and growing In soil or on organic matters. In a study conducted by Guan Et al., C. oxysporum was found to produce extracellular xylanase when grown on decaying agricultural waste. Production of extracellular xylanase was enhanced by elevated levels of Mg2+ ion in the soil or the surrounding environment, but inhibited by the high levels of Cu2+ ion. In the wild, C. oxysporum grows on hosts like Alnus, Bambusa, Citrus, Helianthus, and Pseudotsuga.  Physiology  C. oxysporum is a saprobic secondary invader in warmer climates, meaning they invade and feed on organisms that are weakened or already dead. It breaks down cellulose from dead herbaceous or plants, which is then further turned into glucose to Be used by the fungi themselves, and it uses NH4Cl as a nitrogen source. In a study by Oxenb√∏ll et al., C. oxysporum catalyzed glucose oxidation by producing glucose oxidase, which it is mentioned in another study conducted by Viswanathan Et al. that the glucose oxidase helped protect against bacterial infection on the surface of fungi. The organism is also proven to be very osmotolerant in a laboratory environment, meaning it can tolerate extreme changes in water availability. C. oxysporum can be easily grown on agar media containing 10% glucose or 12 ‚Äì 17% NaCl, they rarely grow on media containing 24% NaCl or 50% glucose and never isolated from media containing 32% NaCl or greater. C. oxysporum exhibits high metal tolerance, allowing it to survive well in contaminated soil.  Pathogenicity  = Effects on humans = Cladosporium oxysporum is a low-risk microbe that usually poses little to No threat of infection In healthy adults As it has a Biosafety level of 1(BSL-1). However, there have been rare reports of this fungus causing infection in humans. Only a handful of other species in the Cladosporium genera contributed to human infections, including C. cladosporioides, C. herbarum, C. sphaerospermum, and C. elatum. Although it is a rare cause of disease in humans, C. oxysporum has been reported as a cause of keratitis and cutaneous infections. A study by Forster et al. reported on 16 cases of keratitis caused by C. oxysporum in which 9 patients were healed by the use of Natamycin (Pimaricin), suggesting that the damage caused by this fungus was reversible. It is also reported that C. oxysporum can also cause occasional cutaneous phaeohyphomycosis and invasion of the neck lymph nodes in humans. Several genera of fungi are found to cause phaeohyphomycosis, but it is a rare case caused by C. oxysporum. In a 2006 case report, a 30-year-old farmer in India was affected by phaeohyphomycosis due to the infection of C. oxysporum which caused large areas of lesion on the skin. It was also tested that phaeohyphomycosis occurred after implanting the fungus from the environment to exposed tissue. The patient was responded positively after receiving a treatment of saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI), showing dramatic regression of lesions within 3 weeks of the onset of therapy. = Effects on insects = In a study conducted by Samways Et al. In South Africa in 1986, C. oxysporum was observed to cause mortality In certain species of homoptera, suggesting that it can be used as a potential targeted insecticide. The pathogen was grown in submerged culture and then applied to 4 species of insects: Planococcus citri, Pseudococcus longispinus, Pulvinaria aethiopica and Trioza erytreae. C. oxysporum successfully caused mortality and hyphal growth In all four species. Field applications of the fungus had a considerable initial impact on the insect populations, which made it a potential biocontrol agent. = Effects on mice = In an experiment conducted in India in 1992 by Singh et al., an in vivo experiment was conducted on mice to determine the pathogenicity of C. oxysporum. No mortality occurred during the four-week period of the experiment, but the concentration of the microorganism inside of the body increased tremendously. The lungs were the most commonly infected organ As they presented with multiple nodules that had extensively invaded the endothelium of the bronchioles, and the surrounding tissues were heavily infiltrated with polymorphonuclear leucocytes. = Effects on plants = It is also found in multiple studies suggesting that C. oxysporum is pathogenic to many vegetables and fruits. A study performed by Lamboy et al. studied the pathogenic effects of C. oxysporum to tomatoes. The fungus creates dark brown, angular lesions on the tomato foliage known as \\"leaf spots\\", ultimately reducing the ability for the plant to survive. The study also describes C. oxysporum as a causal agent of a leaf spot disease of pepper and also a storage disease of ripe tomato fruit. Due to the high prevalence of this fungi in warm climax, they reproduce extremely well in a green house setting, which they were able to spread to healthy tomato plants in vicinity within three weeks. Other studies also provided insight on the pathogenic effect of C. oxysporum on other vegetation; it causes the formation of scabs on the surface of passion-fruits, and it also causes severe leaf blight in Prunus napaulensis, especially affecting the seedlings. = Treatment = In a study performed by Raj et al., the fungal metabolite, taxol, extracted from Cladosporium oxysporum induced apoptosis in T47D human breast cancer cell line, which suggested that the extract may exert its anti- proliferative effect on human breast cancer cell line by suppressing growth, and down-regulating the expression of NF-B, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax, cyt-C and caspase-3. This discovery allowed the medical field to test a new substance to study the ongoing battle with cancer. In another study, fungal taxol extracted from C. oxysporum can Be used against human pathogenic bacteria and human colon cancer cell line HCT 15. The taxol extracted could suppress the growth of the cancer cells As well as effectively combating both gram positive and gram negative bacteria.  Uses  It is proposed that C. oxysporum has a potential function in textile processes or paper/feed industries due to the xylanase resistance to most of tested neutral and alkaline proteases, meaning that xylanase would not be broken down by other protease, which allows it to continuously break down fiber into paper-making materials. C. oxysporum can also be used to make tempeh; traditional soy product originating from Indonesia. In multiple studies, C. oxysporum has been used in bioremediation. water bioremediation by targeting endosulfan and it exhibits metal tolerance and an ability to synthesize gold nanoparticles with superior catalytic activity for degradation of rhodamine B.

This behavior is found in reptiles, mammals, fish and amphibians. Arthropods can also bite. Biting can be a physical action in result of an attack, but it is also a normal activity or response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes ectoparasites from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratching itself, and grooming other animals. Animal bites often result in serious infections and some times even death. Dog bites are commonplace, with human children the most commonly bitten by dogs and the face being the most commonly bitten target. The muscle fibers in the jaw are responsible for the opening and closing of the mouth. They initially allow the organism to open their jaw, then contract to bring the teeth together, resulting in the action of a bite. This behavior can have many implications and is exhibited by many different types of organisms, typically dangerous species such as spiders, snakes, and sharks. Biting is one of the main functions in an organism's life, providing the ability to forage, eat, build, play, protect and much more. Types of teeth Teeth of a lion, showcasing the front canines, middle carnassials, and back molars The types of teeth that organisms use to bite varies throughout the animal kingdom. Different types of teeth are seen in herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores as they are adapted over many years to better fit their diets. Carnivores possess canine, carnassial, and molar teeth, while herbivores are equipped with incisor teeth and wide-back molars.Animal Teeth  Types of Teeth  DK Find Out. (2018). Retrieved October 28, 2018, from https://www.dkfindout.com/us/animals-and- nature/food-chains/types-teeth/ In general, tooth shape has traditionally been used to predict dieting habits. Carnivores have long, extremely sharp teeth for both gripping prey and cutting meat into chunks.Animal Teeth  Types of Teeth  DK Find Out. (2018). Retrieved October 28, 2018, from https://www.dkfindout.com/us/animals-and-nature/food-chains/types-teeth/ They lack flat chewing teeth because they swallow food in chunks. An example of this is shown by the broad, serrated teeth of great white sharks which prey on large marine animals. On the other hand, herbivores have rows of wide, flat teeth to bite and chew grass and other plants. Cows spend up to eleven hours a day biting off grass and grinding it with their molars. Omnivores consume both meat and plants, so they possess a mixture of flat teeth and sharp teeth. Carrying mechanism Biting can serve as a carrying mechanism for species such as beavers and ants, the raw power of their species-specific teeth allow them to carry large objects. In beavers specifically, they have a large tooth adapted for gnawing wood. Their jaw muscles are tuned to power through big trees and carry them back to their dam. In ant behavior, ants use their powerful jaws to lift material back to the colony. They can carry several thousand times their weight due to their bite and adapted to use this to forage for their colonies. Fire ants use their strong bite to get a grip on prey, and inject a toxin via its abdomen, then carry back to its territory. Dangerous bites Some organisms have dangerous bites that produce toxin or venom. Many snakes carry a neurotoxic venom from one of the three major groups of toxins: postsynaptically active neurotoxins, presynaptically active neurotoxins, and myotoxic agents. Spiders venom polypeptides target specific ion channels. This excites components of the peripheral, somatic, and autonomic nervous systems, causing hyperactivity of the channels and neurotransmitter release within the peripheral nervous system. Spider bites or, arachnidism, are mainly a form of predation, but also means of protection. When trapped or accidentally tampered with by humans, spiders retaliate with biting.\\"Workplace Safety & Health Topics Venomous Spiders\\". cdc.gov. February 24, 2012. Retrieved 28 October 2018 The recluse spider and widow species have neurotoxins or necrotic agents that paralyze prey.

Conversely, children above this age are expected to have verbal skills to explain their needs and dislikes, as biting is not seen as age appropriate. Biting may be prevented by methods including redirection, change in the environment and responding to biting by talking about appropriate ways to express anger and frustration. School-age children, those older than 30 months, who habitually bite may require professional intervention.Child Care Links,\\"How to Handle Biting \\", retrieved 14 August 2007 Some discussion of human biting appears in The Kinsey Report on Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.

It is a common soil fungus with a cosmopolitan distribution, although it is primarily found in subtropical regions. Found on a variety of organic materials, A. wentii is known to colonize corn, cereals, moist grains, peanuts and other ground nut crops. It is also used in the manufacture of biodiesel from lipids and is known for its ability to produce enzymes used in the food industry. History and taxonomy Aspergillus wentii was first described by German mycologist Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Wehmer in 1896. Following a morphology-based classification scheme he created in 1901, Wehmer grouped A. wentii under a category of large Aspergilli that he called the \\"Macroaspergilli\\" due to its large fruiting body structure (the conidial head). The taxonomic position of A. wentii remained unclear within the genus as A. wentii Wehmer synonyms (A. archaeoflavus Blochwitz and Aspergillus wentii var. minimus) were presented by Drs. Charles Thom and Kenneth Raper as possible variations or strains. The first A. wentii group was proposed by Drs. Thom and Raper in 1945. This original A. wentii group was classified under the Circumdati subgenus of the genus Aspergillus and included 4 fungal species currently known as A. avenaceus Smith, A. panamensis Raper and Thom, A. alliaceus Thom and Church, and A. wentii Wehmer. Presently, Aspergillus wentii Wehmer is the only remaining fungus of the four fungi that originally made up the \\"A. wentii group\\". The 3 former members of the A. wentii group (A. avenaceus, A. panamensis, and A. alliaceus) have since been reassigned to different Aspergillus subgenera (A. flavus group, A. ustus group, and A. ocheaceus group) respectively. Drs. Charles Thom and Dorothy Fennell revised the A. wentii group in 1965 to include Aspergillus thomii Smith and A. terricola Marchal along with A. wentii Wehmer. However, Aspergillus group classifications within subgenera became obsolete in the 1980s being replaced by sections. The new Aspergilli sections adapted and revised previously established morphological and physiological characteristics of Aspergillli groups and incorporated DNA sequencing analyses to confirm phylogenetic relationships among related Aspergilli. Many species were reassigned to new Aspergilli sections as phylogenetic relationships were confirmed by DNA and genome sequencing experiments. As a result, A. wentii and A. dimorphicus, previously described as synonyms within the A. wentii section, were later confirmed to be distinct species. Growth and morphology Diagram of the key morphological structures of Aspergillus wentii, including the conidiophore, conidia, conidial head, vesicle, phialides, metullae, stipe, and foot cell Aspergillus wentii produces single-celled, globose, conidia (singular conidium) in unbranched, filamentous chains. Young asexual conidia (also called spores) start off smooth, colourless, and ellipsoidal before maturing into rough, globose spores approximately 4.5-5 ¬µm in diameter. Aspergillus wentii conidia can appear anywhere from darker yellow to brown in colour when mature and have a single wall, unlike related species Aspergillus tamarii whose conidia have a double wall membrane. The elongating chains of conidia are dispersed through slightly pigmented, vase-shaped structures known as phialides that are around 6-8 ¬µm. The phialides sit on top of almond-shaped structures known as metulae that are about 10-20 ¬µm in length and also slightly pigmented. Together, these metulae and phialides structures radiate outward from a spheroid structure known as the vesicle, layering around its entire surface area. The vesicle can grow to a diameter of 80 ¬µm, with a completely fertile spheroid surface area. Collectively, this large globose complex made up of the vesicle at the centre with metulae and phialides radiating outward is called the conidial head. The conidial head can vary from tan-yellow to darker coffee-coloured brown and grow as big as 500-800 ¬µm in diameter. The conidial head is affixed atop of a thick, aseptate stalk known as a stipe. Aspergillus wentii stipes are notable for being interspersed and longer than average Aspergillus stalks. The stipe and conidial head together form a translucent, rod-shaped structure collectively known as the conidiophore that in turn, extends from the hyphal tip. The conidiophore can grow anywhere between 3-5 millimeters in length, has a glassy appearance (described as hyaline) and typically have a smooth texture, although granular conidiophores have been observed. Aspergillus wentii produces aerial hyphae, white or sometimes yellow in colour that can grow to a few millimeters in length. Aspergillus wentii foot cells have dense walls and are branched. Overall, Aspergillus wentii colonies appear dense, floccose (fluffy) to cottony, and are white in colour. Colonies can grow up to 2-3.5 cm in diameter on Czapek agar when grown under controlled conditions for a span of 7 days. Optimal growth of Aspergillus wentii in culture occurs on glucose media at pH 6.0 at a temperature of 30¬∞C for a duration of 7 days. Dr. Wehmer originally described seeing cleistothecia, however there have been no reports of such structures on Aspergillus wentii since. According to subsequent authors, it is believed that Wehmer misinterpreted densely packed masses of hyphae for cleistothecia which are structurally similar. =Reproduction= Aspergillus wentii is an asexual fungus with no known sexual state. Although Aspergillus wentii is currently a mitotic fungus, vestigial remnants found in the hyphae of A. wentii are evidence that ancestral Aspergilli once had the ability to sexually reproduce by meiosis. Morphological similarities observed between hyphal masses in Aspergillus wentii and young sexual structures (cleistothecia) found in Chaetosartorya chrysella are further vestigial evidence of meiotic ability in ancestral Aspergilli. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences revealed a strong phylogenetic relation between the obligate asexual species Aspergillus wentii and meiotic (sexual) species Chaetosartorya chrysella, suggesting that the two species are close relatives, having recently diverged from the same sexually-reproducing ancestor. Physiology Aspergillus wentii is a filamentous fungus. In culture, optimal growth of Aspergillus wentii occurs on glucose media at pH 6.0 at a temperature of 30 ¬∞C. Aspergillus wentii grows well on carbon-based media supplemented with mannitol, fructose, galactose, sucrose, lactose, or maltose. Generally, Aspergillus wentii exhibits the highest growth rates in carbon-based media, although it can be grown on nitrogen-based media with lower growth yields. Aspergillus wentii does not grow well on creatine sucrose agar (CREA) and produces sterile hyphae on malt extract agar. Aspergillus wentii is moderately xerophile, able to tolerate very dry conditions with low water activity (with an aW of 0.73‚Äì0.79 for growth and germination). In its natural environment, Aspergillus wentii is aerobic, able to grow, replicate, and produce metabolites optimally in an oxygen-rich environment. Under light exposure, Aspergillus wentii cultures have been observed to produce white aerial mycelium (at times expressing a pink hue) in large masses that can often expand to fit entire volumes of test tubes or culture plates. Aspergillus wentii mycelia have an 8-9 % glucosamine content and have an average doubling time of 4-8 hours in liquid culture. Like many Aspergillus fungi, Aspergillus wentii is resistant to amphotericin B and itraconazole. Thermal death time for Aspergillus wentii occurs after 25 minutes at a temperature of 63 ¬∞C. Conditions of 100% oxygen pressurized at 10 atm will also cease A. wentii fungal growth. =Metabolism= Aspergillus wentii is able to produce a wide range of metabolites characteristic of mold fungi including kojic acid, 2-hydroxymethylfuran-5-carboxylic acid, and citric acid. Aspergillus wentii Wehmer is also capable of producing the plant-growth inhibitor metabolite 1-amino-2-nitrocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (ANPCA), known for its ability to stunt growth and cause deformation in plants such as Chrysanthemum, pea plants, and Nicotiana (tobacco) plants. Aspergillus wentii strains produce numerous enzymes such as pectinases (in food sources), dextranase, lipases, cellulases, amylase, Œ≤-glucosidase and other common mold enzymes. Aspergillus wentii is a fungus capable of producing high quantities of lipase. Ideal lipase growth conditions in Aspergillus wentii (100% lipase activity) occur under media supplemented with glucose of pH 6.0 at a temperature of 30 ¬∞C. Aspergillus wentii grown in mannitol media produces the second largest lipase yield (with 84% lipase activity). Lipase activity for Aspergillus wentii grown on fructose media produces just under 50% lipase activity while media supplemented with galactose, sucrose, lactose or maltose all yielded moderate lipase activity (20-37%). Aspergillus wentii strain NRRL 2001 spores were found to naturally produce glucose from hydrolyzing soluble starch. Of all Aspergilli, A. wentii was found to produce the best yields of glucose, able to convert approximately 20-40% of original starch, with almost zero maltose conversions. Optimal glucose production from Aspergillus wentii NRRL 2001's starch degradation occurred from younger spores (glucose production decrease with spore age), in the presence of Iodoacetate (a compound that blocks glucose breakdown pathways), and at a pH 3.0 or higher. Toxins such as aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin B2 (in small traces), emodin and wentilacton are all made by Aspergillus wentii. Aspergillus wentii toxins are commonly found on plant, animal, or food sources. One intracellular metabolite secreted by Aspergillus wentii is toxic to mice as well as chicken embryos. Aspergillus wentii chloroform extracts of mycelium, moldy corn, and moldy rice all produce varying levels of toxicity when introduced to chicken embryos on yeast-extract sucrose (YES) medium. While moldy corn with Aspergillus wentii was unable to kill mice in one study, YES extracts of corn and mycelium were shown to be deadly to mice, with YES mycelium extract being the most potent to both chicken and mice. One Aspergillus wentii strain, Ras101, is known for its ability to produce biodiesel from the transesterification of lipids. Optimal yield of biodiesel from Aspergillus wentii is dependent upon factors such as the optimization of lipid production, pH, incubation time, temperature, and the medium composition. Under ideal conditions, Aspergillus wentii can optimize 31.65% biomass of biodiesel in 30 minutes of lipid transesterification at 70 ¬∞C. Habitat and ecology Aspergilli are collectively classified as indoor mold fungi. Aspergillus wentii is typically found as mold on various decomposing vegetable and organic material and is notorious for causing food spoilage in corns, cereals, ground nuts and peanuts. Aspergillus wentii can also be isolated from tobacco. As a common soil fungus and endosymbiont, Aspergillus wentii often lives in symbiosis with species in rhizospheres (an area of soil populated with roots and home to many microorganisms). Within these rhizospheres, Aspergillus wentii can be found amongst cottonseed, olives, barley, rice, pineapple, oats, Brazil nuts, pecans, groundnuts, wheat, fir tree leaf matter, and more. Not only limited to plant and vegetative sources, A. wentii has also been associated with bird and gerbil nests. Distributed in many different parts of the world, Aspergillus wentii has been found in countries such as China, Peru, Argentina, Japan, South Africa, France, Pakistan, Guyana, Turkey, India, Spain, Italy, Israel, the Bahamas, the United States and more. Aspergillus wentii is most commonly found in warm, subtropical areas such as South America. Aspergillus wentii has a tendency to colonize dry soils, especially in deserts and warm climates. However, A. wentii has been isolated from a variety of cultivated and uncultivated soil types including grassland soils, forest soils, clay isolated from caves and even alkaline soils. It is also common to find Aspergillus wentii near water sources such as in seawater, sediments of estuaries (partially enclosed coastal bodies), peat bogs, waste stabilization ponds, water treatment plants and in fresh water sources. In Hawaii, one study found that Aspergillus wentii only colonized roots of pineapple plants in regions with higher rainfall and lower soil pH. In addition to moist environments, Aspergillus wentii was also found to colonize dry plant stems of Coptis japonicus in soil. As an aerobic organism, Aspergillus wentii was cited as a rare, trivial component of spora found in the air in Europe. Disease Until recently, Aspergillus wentii was not known to be pathogenic in humans. The first case of a human disease caused by Aspergillus wentii was reported in 2009. This disease was described as Necrotising external otitis (also known as NEO), a fungal infection characterized by severe ear pains. Prior to this report, NEO was known to be primarily caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although cases of other fungal-origin NEO infections were previously described. In both Pseudomonas and Aspergillus wentii NEO, immunocompromised patients are more susceptible to disease. However, unlike classical NEO caused by P. aeruginosa, that is commonly found in diabetic elderly, NEO of Aspergillus wentii origin can infect diabetic or non-diabetic adults anywhere between the ages of 20 to 85 years old. In more severe cases of NEO, paralysis symptoms in cranial nerve VII appear uniquely in cases of fungal infection, including NEO of Aspergillus wentii origin. Generally, amphotericin B and itraconazole are used as treatment of Aspergillus wentii infection. Uses Widely used in the food industry, Aspergillus wentii is exploited for its ability to make enzymes (such as lipase) that create flavour byproducts in foods when degrading lipids. Aspergillus wentii is primarily used in Asian cuisines, often combined with other Aspergilli (such as Aspergillus oryzae and A. flavus) to create soy products through production of kojic acid and fermentation processes. Enzymes such as pectinase are also produced by Aspergillus wentii in several food sources such as salted fish, Chinese chestnuts, and popcorn. Like Aspergillus oryzae, A. tamarii and A. flavus, Aspergillus wentii can produce a wide range of mold enzymes. Proteolytic (protein degrading) enzymes, such as amylase, were also found to be produced by Aspergillus wentii when fermenting on cocoa beans. Aspergillus wentii fungal strain, Aspergillus wentii Ras101, is known for its ability to produce biodiesel through a transesterification process. As a fungus that produces lipids in high quantities, Aspergillus wentii was proposed as a favourable microorganism to produce large yields of biodiesel product. Optimal yield of biodiesel from Aspergillus wentii is dependent upon factors such as the optimization of lipid production, pH, incubation time, temperature, and the medium composition. Under ideal conditions, Aspergillus wentii can optimize 31.65% biomass of biodiesel in 30 minutes of lipid transesterification at 70 ¬∞C. Physiological properties of Aspergillus wentii biodiesel (density, water content, calorific value, and viscosity) are comparable to standards of ordinary biodiesel and fossil fuel requirements as an alternative fuel source, making this strain a potential feedstock for producing biodiesel as a renewable, alternative fuel source in the industrial sector.

The main bathing area contains a wave pool and several slides. there were nine water slides in the main indoor pool area with various levels of difficulty and speed, plus jacuzzis and outside areas. The thermal spa area has saltwater pools, and these pools are also used to offer physiotherapy. The sauna area is designated as a nudist/ () area, which is extended to the swimming and thermal spa areas on Tuesday evenings. History The original swimming bath complex owned by the Town of Weinheim was offered for sale. In late-1987 Miramar was purchased by the Steinhart family for the symbolic price of one Deutsche Mark, after which significant expansion and development followed. Each year of geothermal heating is used, with hot water at extracted from a borehole with a flowrate of .

Prior to May 2013, there had also been nudism/FKK in the other areas on Saturday evenings. In April 2018, a tree house sauna () looking out over the Waidsee Lake was opened, which had cost ‚Ç¨800,000 and took six months to build. The outside parts of sauna are built from special kelo wood imported from Finland. The internal support structure modelled as tree trunk is constructed from reinforced concrete covered with Fiberglass and artificial tree bark. The structure is high, with the access walkways fitted around the existing surrounding mature trees. Safety Miramar employed a former police officer to oversee visitor safety, with dedicated safety teams patrolling at busy times. In cooperation with the police force, staff and lifeguards at the Miramar pool are trained in safeguarding techniques. All incidents and reports are recorded to identify patterns. A ‚Ç¨250 fine, followed by Miramar site ban, is applied for breaches of the pool or sauna etiquette rules. twenty-nine bans were in place, including four for private masturbation on the premises. =Incidents= In August 2018 four teenagers were found guilty of sexually harassing a group other teenagers at Miramar and sentenced to community service.

Economic inequality in New Zealand is one of the social issues related to that country. Between 1982 and 2011, New Zealand's gross domestic product grew by 35%. Almost half of that increase went to a small group who were already the richest in the country. During this period, the average income of the top 10% of earners in New Zealand (those earning more than $72,000) almost doubled going from $56,300 to $100,200. The average income of the poorest tenth increased by 13% from $9700 to $11,000. Growing inequality is confirmed by Statistics New Zealand which keeps track of income disparity using the P80/20 ratio. This ratio shows the difference between high household incomes (those in the 80th percentile) and low household incomes (those in the 20th percentile). The inequality ratio increased between 1988 and 2004, and decreased until the onset of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, increasing again to 2011 and then declining again from then. By 2013, the disposable income of high-income households was more than two-and-a-half times larger than that of low-income households. Highlighting the disparity, the top 1% of the population now owns 16% of the country's wealth ‚Äì the richest 5% owns 38% ‚Äì while half the population, including beneficiaries and pensioners, earn less than $24,000.  Growth in numbers on welfare  Factors contributing to the growth in inequality include substantial cuts in the top income tax rate in 1986‚Äì88 combined with a surge in unemployment caused by Rogernomics and the stock market crash of 1987 which pushed more people onto welfare. Then in 1991, benefits were also cut back substantially as part of the 'reforms' and those on welfare have been struggling ever since. Professor Jonathan Boston of Victoria University says nearly 20% of poorer households in New Zealand now depend on welfare benefits. He says the growing gap between rich and poor enables the rich to \\"exercise disproportionate political influence\\", and that \\"if disadvantaged citizens are not to be excluded from political life, they must have access to education, healthcare and social assistance\\". British epidemiologists, Richard Pickett and Kate Wilkinson, argue that inequality is damaging for everyone in society, not just the poor. They say that when the gap between the top and the bottom levels of society becomes too wide, this erodes trust and empathy between citizens leading to alienation and social fragmentation. This exacerbates a multitude of health and social problems such as high infant mortality, obesity, teenage pregnancy, crime and imprisonment.  Impact on social indicators  In 2014, Pickett and Wilkinson were invited to Auckland and Dunedin to discuss the relevance of their research to New Zealand. They argued that as inequality in New Zealand has grown, there has been a dramatic increase in the youth suicides. However, both total and youth suicide rates have been fluctuating, but general stable from 2006 to 2015. The proliferation of food banks increased dramatically; and the number of families and children living in poverty has increased. However serious crimes causing injury and death decreased by 20% between 2012 and 2014, whilst assaults decreased by 3% over the same period. At the same time, health care spending has increased. In 2011 Health spending accounted for 10% of GDP, higher than the OECD average of 9.3%. As in many OECD countries, health spending in New Zealand slowed down post the GFC but still reached 3% in real terms in 2010 and 2011 ‚Äì higher than the OECD average. in 2012 New Zealand has 2.7 doctors per 1,000 population, and increase from 2.2 in the year 2000. In 2012, life expectancy at birth in New Zealand stood at 81.5 years, more than one year higher than the OECD average of 80.2 years.  Impact on growth  In December 2014, the OECD released the Global Income Inequality Report which said \\"[r]ising inequality is estimated to have knocked more than 10 percentage points off growth in ...New Zealand\\" between 1990 and 2010. The paper found no evidence that redistributive policies, such as taxes and social benefits, harm economic growth, provided these policies are well designed, targeted and implemented. It concluded that \\"focusing exclusively on growth and assuming that its benefits will automatically trickle down to the different segments of the population may undermine growth in the long run.\\"  Poverty  In the 21st century concern has been growing that an increasing number of New Zealanders, especially children, have been pushed into poverty where poverty is defined in income terms as households living at below 60% of the national median income. In 2005, an international report found that one in six children in New Zealand were being raised in poverty ‚Äì making New Zealand children 23rd out of 26 rich nations, the fourth poorest of those rated in the report. In 2009 according to NCCSS, over half a million New Zealanders, including 163,000 children were living in poverty. The Expert Advisory Group established by the Children's Commissioner found that the number of children falling below the threshold has continued to grow. In 2013, around 265,000 children, a quarter of all children in New Zealand, were now \\"mired in poverty\\". Statistics New Zealand also publishes a range of data on the economic well-being of New Zealanders and, in 2012, released a discussion paper highlighting the need for government agreement on the development of more useful criteria and statistics related to poverty. Currently the information that is collected is 'static data' ‚Äì it shows the percentage of citizens below a certain level of income. But New Zealand is unique among western OECD countries in that it does not collect 'dynamic' data which captures the extent to which people move in and out of poverty. In 2013 over a dozen different reports were released which focused on the issue and the need to develop agreed ways of describing and measuring poverty. However, the National Government resisted these attempts maintaining that \\"endless arguments about definition and measurement are a waste of time\\". Because of the Government's reluctance to define and measure the problem, in 2012 Children's Commissioner Dr Russell Wills, established an expert advisory group which produced a comprehensive report, called Solutions to Child Poverty in New Zealand: Evidence for Action which contains 78 recommendations to combat poverty. Dr Wills also set up the Child Poverty Monitor to highlight the living conditions of children in New Zealand on an ongoing basis.

The first fragment, preserved in the 13th-century Vat. gr. 2014 manuscript (interposed into descriptions of the Avaro-Persian siege of Constantinople and the Second Arab Siege of Constantinople, as well as hagiographical texts) in the Vatican Library, deals with the 811 campaign of Emperor Nikephoros I () against the Bulgars, which ended in the disastrous Battle of Pliska. Discovered and published in 1936 by I. Dujƒçev, it is also known as the Chronicle of 811, or the Dujƒçev Fragment. The second, which is preserved in the early 11th-century B.N. gr. 1711 manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris along with the chronicle of the so-called \\"Leo Grammaticus\\", deals with the reigns of Michael I Rhangabe () and Leo V the Armenian () that followed after Nikephoros I. The date of authorship is disputed, but the vividness of the narrative suggests that it was written by a contemporary of the events described. The two fragments were identified as forming part of the same work by Henri Gr√©goire based on similarities in style. Although generally an unreliable indicator, this hypothesis has since been commonly accepted. Both fragments provide information not included in the contemporary histories of Theophanes the Confessor and Theophanes Continuatus, and Gr√©goire hypothesized, again based on style, that the Scriptor Incertus was a continuation of the work of the 6th-century historian John Malalas. The second fragment was known to, and used by, the late 10th-century Pseudo-Symeon Magister, but he does not appear to have used it for the sections of his history before Michael I.

It is efficiently distributed in the air, where it exists as the most frequently occurring fungal species. It can grow over a wide range of temperatures including very cold environments, giving it the ability to grow on refrigerated meat and form \\"black spots\\". Its high prevalence in the air and production of allergens makes C. herbarum an important exacerbant of asthma and hay fever. Prevalence Cladosporium herbarum is the type species of the genus Cladosporium. Its spores are highly prevalent in the air; the genus Cladosporium is the dominant genus of spores found in the air, with the C. herbarum species contributing the highest percentage to this group. These airborne spores are more common during the summer and fall seasons; in the summer there can be as many as 15,000 spores per m3 air of C. herbarum. Cladosporium herbarum is also found all over the world on dead organic material, in the soil, and sometimes appears as a plant parasite. It is also a common fungus found in indoor environments. Growth In young cultures, newly-formed spores show growth by budding into a large, multi-branched mycelium. It has an optimal growth temperature between and , with a maximum growth temperature between and . It has been shown to grow at temperatures as low as , and ; allowing it to grow actively (albeit slowly) on frozen materials. Cladosporium herbarum can also grow in dry environments (xerophile). C. herbarum grows optimally at pH 6 but tolerates environments with a pH as low as 4.4. Conidium production is higher in wet than dry conditions. The production of spores is inhibited by rubratoxin B and aflatoxin. Its growth is inhibited in atmospheres of reduced oxygen and increased carbon dioxide. Mycosphaerella tassiana is the sexual reproductive stage (teleomorph) of C. herbarum. Morphology Spores produced by C. herbarum can be lemon-shaped or cone-shaped, often composed of 2-4 cells (3-23 mm). One-celled conidia (5.5-13 x 3.8-6 ¬µm) also exist. In culture, newly- formed spores appear mostly 1-celled, later forming tree-like colonies with multiple branches. The stalks which produce C. herbarum spores are 250 ¬µm long and 3-6 ¬µm wide. They appear swollen at the tip and in between cells, and have irregularly bent branches. Under microscopy, these stalks appear pale or dark brown in color and have smooth or rough walls. When submerged in fluid, they become brittle and break up completely into spores and rod-like fragments. Colonies grown on Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) and malt extract agar (MEA) appear velvety or fluffy, with smooth or slightly wrinkled walls, and are green or brown in color. The reverse side of the colony appears a darker green or grey/black. Colonies can appear both sparse or densely grown. At , colonies are 1-2 mm in diameter. Habitat and ecology This species is distributed worldwide, inhabiting polar, temperate, mediterranean, subtropical, tropical, forest, grassland, and arable soil regions. It is found frequently in wood exposed to soil, deep soil depths, and the highly nutritious soil directly surrounding the roots of plants (rhizosphere). It is one of the early colonizers on dying and dead plants (saprobe), especially the leaves and stems of both aquatic and desert plant species (for example ferns and mosses). It is the most common fungal species found on living leaves (given suitable conditions) and dead plant material in very moist environments. It also has an adaptation to high salt concentrations (has been found in high salinity sediments) and extremely dry areas (xerophilic). Cladosporium herbarum causes spoilage of fresh fruits and vegetables including yams, peaches, nectarines, apricots, plums, cherries, tomatoes, and melons. Its common occurrence on fresh apples can lead to contamination of apple juice and fruit based products. It has also been found in eggs, hazelnuts, cereals, chickpeas, soybeans, and frozen fruit pastries. Cladosporium herbarum can also spoil cheese and pasteurized soft cheese, causing problems during its manufacturing. Being able to survive at temperatures below freezing, C. herbarum can cause ‚Äúblack spot‚Äù spoilage of meat in cold storage (between and ). It has been isolated from fresh, frozen, and processed meats. Cladosporium herbarum has been isolated from caterpillars, nests, feathers, pellets of free-living birds, nests of gerbils, bee honeycombs, internal organs of frogs, and earthworms. It has also been found indoors on walls, wallpaper, textiles, rubber strips of window-frames, and bathrooms. Increased release of C. herbarum spores is correlated with increasing temperatures, daylight, and declining humidity. This species appears more frequently during the summer than the winter with peak concentrations of airborne spores found during the afternoon of a 24 hour cycle. The spores are easily carried through the air and can be transported long distances including over oceans. Pathogenicity This fungus is non-pathogenic, but its ability to freely produce spores that are easily dispersed in air currents adds to its effect as a fungal airway allergen; it is one of the main fungal causes of asthma and hay fever in the Western Hemisphere. More than 60 antigens derived from C. herbarum have been detected, and 36 of these have immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding properties. Most of these antigens are proteins found inside cells, and eight of these antigens are members of the World Health Organization's official allergen list. There is variation in allergen content between different strains of C. herbarum . Toxic effects of C. herbarum on warm-blood animals have been reported when they were fed with heavily infected wheat. It can produce a toxin causing mucosal damage in horses, and mycelium extracts are shown to have low-level toxicity in chicken embryos. C. herbarum is also fungal plant pathogen. Its hosts include Bryum, Buxbaumia, Gyroweissia, Tortula, and Dicranella. It can cause Cladosporium ear rot on corn. Molecular genetics Most often, C. herbarum conidia have 1 nucleus, but some can have 2 nuclei. During mitosis, 5 to 8 dot-like chromosomes have been observed. Based on DNA analysis, they have a guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) of 55%. Using molecular diagnostics, C. herbarum internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences have been found to be identical to those of Cyphellophora laciniata.''

Programs can be provided to children and young people, those employed in childcare, people who would have otherwise have abused a young person, and situations where abuse can take place.  Child sexual abuse prevention programs provided to children  Child sexual abuse prevention programs provided to children are said to be the most common type of primary prevention of child sexual abuse.Smallbone, S., Marshall, W.L. and Wortley, R., (2008) Preventing child sexual abuse: evidence, policy and practice, Culltompton, Devon: Willan Publishing. Child- focused, school-based sexual abuse prevention programs were first developed in the United States in the 1970s in response to growing concerns about the prevalence and effects of child sexual abuse. Studies had shown that offenders targeted children perceived as being more compliant and less likely to disclose any molestation.Barron, I. and Topping, K. (2008) School-based child sexual abuse prevention programs: the evidence on effectiveness, Journal of Children's Services, 3(3), 31-39. Such programs are now popular in America; one study suggests more children have been involved in such programs than not.Kaufman, K. L., Mosher, H., Carter, M., & Estes, L. (2006) An empirically- based situational prevention model for child sexual abuse. In S. Smallbone & R. Wortley (Eds.), Situational prevention of child sexual abuse, Crime prevention studies (Vol. 19).

Child-focused, school- based sexual abuse prevention programs aim to increase the knowledge and skills of children and to increase their confidence that they can do things to prevent abuse. Types of knowledge that programs try to improve include being able to identify abusers, potentially abusive situations, and boundary violations. Children are instructed in how to refuse approaches and invitations, break off interactions, and report abuse.Finkelhor, D. (2009) The Prevention of Childhood Sexual Abuse, The Future of Children, 19(2), 169-187. It has been argued that the programs \\"empower\\" children to act against attempts at abuse by teaching that CSA is wrong and not the victim's fault, and by reinforcing children's right to say who can touch them and where. It is suggested this strategy strengthens their sense of control in a sexual conflict, confirms children's preference for harmless refusal strategies, and demonstrates that disclosing abuse can lead to getting help for both the victim and the offender.Taal, M. and Edelaar, M. (1997) Positive and Negative Effects of a Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Program, Child Abuse & Neglect, 21(4), 399-410.Becker, J.V. and Reilly, D.W. (1999) Preventing Sexual Abuse and Assault, Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment, 11(4), 267-278. Some programs offer a safe and private context for children to talk to the teacher or trainer about incidents of abuse.

He has been described as \\"Belgium's principal Holocaust historian\\" and was best known for his three-part history of the subject entitled L'√âtoile et le Fusil (French; ), published in 1983‚Äì87. Biography Maxime Steinberg was born into a Jewish family in Brussels, Belgium, on 13 December 1936. His father had immigrated from Poland in 1930. During World War II, his parents were arrested and deported to Nazi concentration camps. His mother was killed. Maxime and his brother were hidden in rural Walloon Brabant. Steinberg studied at the Free University of Brussels (ULB) under Jean Stengers, initially interested in the history of the Belgian far-left. He worked as a teacher and was himself a communist. Steinberg was also active in Belgium's public sector trade union. In 1982, he returned to ULB to work as an associate professor at the Institute for the Study of Judaism (Institut d'Etudes du Juda√Øsme). He completed his doctoral thesis on the Holocaust in Belgium in 1987 under Stengers' supervision. He was the first historian in Belgium to address the Holocaust directly. His role in Belgian historiography has been compared to that of Serge Klarsfeld in France. Steinberg is best known for his magnum opus on the Holocaust in Belgium, published as L'√âtoile et le Fusil (\\"The Star and the Rifle\\") between 1983 and 1987 which grew out of his doctoral dissertation. The series \\"revolutionised historiography on the persecution of the Jews in Belgium\\". It was published in three volumes (four tomes), representing the first scholarly narrative on the subject. There had been approximately 66,000 Jews living in Belgium on the eve of the German invasion of May 1940 of whom at least 28,000 were deported and killed in Nazi concentration camps. Only perhaps 4,000 held Belgian citizenship.Maxime Steinberg, La Pers√©cution des Juifs en Belgique (1940‚Äì1945) (Brussels: Complexe, 2004), p. 132, 234, 279, 298; idem, L'√âtoile et le Fusil, vol. 2: 1942: les cent jours de la d√©portation des Juifs de Belgique(Brussels: Vie Ouvri√®re, 1984), p. 240‚Äì243; idem, L'√âtoile et le Fusil, vol. 3: La traque des Juifs, 1942‚Äì1944 (Brussels: Vie Ouvri√®re, 1987), tome 2, p. 259. According to the historian Lieven Saerens, L'√âtoile et le Fusil Steinberg was also known as a public historian. He served as a historical expert witness called during the much-publicized trial of Kurt Asche (1980‚Äì81) and was on the committee responsible for designing the permanent exhibition at the Museum of the Deportation and Resistance in Mechelen, Belgium in 1995. He was also consulted by the Auschwitz Museum. He was one of the experts consulted on the literary hoax Misha: A M√©moire of the Holocaust Years (1997) by Misha Defonseca. Steinberg was a member of the Union des Progressistes Juifs de Belgique. He was a vocal critic of Holocaust denial.

Chapman is a 1945 court case between Primus King, a religious leader and barber in Columbus, Georgia, and J. E. Chapman, Jr., the chair of the Muscogee County Democratic Party. It ruled the white primary as used by the Democratic Party of Georgia to be unconstitutional. This case followed the Smith v. Allwright case, which struck down the white primaries in Texas and began the downfall of white primaries in other Deep South states. Background and ruling On July 4, 1944, Primus E. King, an African-American registered voter, went to the Muscogee County Courthouse in Columbus to cast his vote in the Democratic Party‚Äôs primary election. He was turned away by law enforcement. Dr. Thomas Brewer, a local physician who co-founded the local branch of the NAACP, encouraged and financially supported Mr. King in his lawsuit filed in federal court. In a landmark ruling in 1945, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia found in Mr. King's favor, deciding that the exclusion of black voters was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Seventeenth Amendments. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal by Chapman,. which ended the white primary in Georgia. Impact The end of the white primary in Georgia allowed African Americans to pursue the right to vote in Georgia for the first time, although the enforcement of poll taxes, literacy tests and the County Unit System would remain a significant barrier to most African-American voters in Georgia until the 1960s. It would take nearly two decades before Leroy Johnson, the first African American to serve in the Georgia General Assembly, would be elected. King v.

It was published on October 2, 2018, by St. Martin's Press. Daniels had been writing her memoir for \\"about 10 years.\\" She announced the book on The View on September 12, 2018. She said that parts of her interview on 60 Minutes had been cut due to time constraints, and she believes that important details were cut from the broadcast. The book includes details of her alleged affair with Donald Trump. Though the book opens with a foreword from Daniels' then attorney Michael Avenatti and Daniels writes warmly of him in subsequent chapters their relationship would later sour. On May 22, 2019, Avenatti was charged with fraud as a result of allegations that he stole money from Daniels while helping her negotiate the book deal for Full Disclosure. Summary Daniels is born Stephanie Gregory to Sheila and Bill Gregory. She and her mother eventually settle in Baton Rouge, Louisiana while her father travels for work. After the death of her maternal grandmother her father returns to announce that he is leaving the family to remarry another woman. Daniels does not see her father for three years and in the meantime her mother struggles with depression and becomes a hoarder. At the age of nine Daniels is repeatedly raped by her friend's neighbor. Daniels believes she is protecting her friend by allowing herself to be raped in her place. A few years later when Daniels tries to reveal the abuse to her mother and a guidance counselor both dismiss her. To stay away from her neglectful mother and her increasingly drug filled neighborhood, Daniels takes up horse riding and works several small jobs to support her hobby. In high school her father divorces his second wife and moves to California, leaving Daniels with a car and abandoning her permanently. Her mother divorces her second husband as well and Daniels moves out of the family home at seventeen. Shortly after she has a chance encounter with a stripper and goes to see her where she works. Daniels is offered a job at the strip club and she takes it. Daniels eventually works her way into a more lucrative strip club and becomes interested in being a featured dancer, i.e. a stripper who is famous in her own right and who travels with her own tour. Mentored by Devon Michaels she creates her own act and goes on tour, eventually meeting and befriending the band Pantera. After two years, having become as successful as she can by doing only magazine work, Michaels suggests that she and Daniels go to California to work in the adult entertainment industry. While there Daniels immediately meets and begins a relationship with director Brad Armstrong who helps to build her career. Daniels quickly becomes a contract star at Wicked Pictures. After a dispute with Armstrong on one of their films she begins writing scripts and after further arguments with directors she begins to direct as well. Armstrong later cheats on her with fellow Wicked star Jessica Drake. Shortly after, Daniels drunkenly marries Pat Myne in Las Vegas. The two try to make their marriage work but divorce after a year. In 2006 while attending the American Century Championship, Daniels meets Donald Trump and is invited up to his suite. Stormy reluctantly has sex with him and keeps in contact with him for several months as he promises he will be able to feature her on The Apprentice. After he is unable to cast her for the upcoming season she cuts ties with him. Daniels marries her publicist, Mike Moz, but the marriage quickly collapses. Shortly after, while trying to transition to directing music videos, Daniels meets Glendon Crain the drummer for the band Hollywood Undead. Crain and Daniels embark on a whirlwind romance and eventually decide to marry and have a child, though Daniels tells Crain that he must do porn before she will agree to a pregnancy in order to ensure that her career in adult entertainment will never be used against her in a custody battle. Shortly after giving birth to her daughter, Daniels learns that news about her night with Trump has leaked. Still recovering from a traumatic birth and with her husband suffering from postpartum depression, Daniels denies everything. In 2011 she is once again approached by In Touch Weekly and decides to give an interview relating her sexual experiences with Trump. Daniels agrees but the story is killed. Sometime later she is approached and threatened by a stranger telling her to leave Trump alone. In 2015 Trump announces he is running for president. Daniels repeatedly struggles with whether to come forward or not and is instead offered money to sign an NDA which she accepts. In 2018 the Wall Street Journal publishes a story about Daniels and the hush payments she received. After Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, begins shopping around a memoir using her name, Daniels decides to hire a lawyer, Michael Avenatti, in order to release herself from her NDA. As she prepares to come forward she is repeatedly threatened with death and hounded by the paparazzi. To protect her daughter, Daniels pulls her from school and hires private tutors. Her marriage also suffers as a result as her husband is angered that Daniels never told him about the encounter with Trump. Daniels comes forward and speaks about her experiences with Trump in interviews with 60 Minutes and Rolling Stone. She is invited to appear on Saturday Night Live as herself. In an epilogue she reveals that she is still struggling with her newfound fame and that, while her husband filed for divorce acrimoniously, they are now co-parenting in a mutually supportive way. Reception The memoir drew positive reviews. Slate praised Daniels as \\"a witty, scrappy underdog\\" Kirkus Reviews called it \\"lively, candid\\".

In August 2018 the Garda S√≠och√°na announced that her disappearance was being treated as a murder case. Family Her parents are Michael and Bernadette Jacob and she was born on 14 October 1979. At the time of her disappearance, she had completed her first year as a student teacher at St Mary's University, Twickenham, United Kingdom. Disappearance Deirdre was last seen about 3pm on 28 July 1998. She had gone to the Newbridge branch of Allied Irish Banks to get a bank draft to pay for student accommodation at the university, then went to the post office to post the bank draft. She also visited her grandmother, who owned a shop. The last sighting of her was close to her house on Barretstown Road. At the time of her disappearance she wore a dark T-shirt with white shoes and was carrying a black bag with a yellow Caterpillar Inc logo. The bag has never been found. Aftermath Deirdre's parents have never been able to move on and still hope that someone with information on their daughter's disappearance will come forward. They have appealed to the public for information several times over the years. In 2016 her parents said that there was not as strong a link between their daughter's disappearance and convicted rapist Larry Murphy as was often supposed. Gardai were never able to place Murphy in Newbridge the day she disappeared. The only connection found was a piece of paper with Larry Murphy's name and phone number among the belongings of Deirdre's maternal grandmother after the latter's death. She had owned a shop in Newbridge and Murphy had left his contact details with her grandmother as he was making wooden children's toys, but this was years before Deirdre's disappearance. In July 2018, on the 20th anniversary of her disappearance, her father called for a dedicated missing-persons unit to be set up. Her parents were satisfied that the Gardai in Kildare were doing everything possible to locate their daughter, but that a dedicated unit would help investigations into missing persons cases. By 2018 Gardai had conducted 3,200 lines of inquiry and taken 2,500 witness statements. Case upgraded to murder investigation The case was reclassified as murder because of new information and a review of the case. Although Gardai did not reveal the new information, they said there was a definite line of inquiry. In October 2018 Gardai stated that they had 'significant' new leads in the murder probe and identified Larry Murphy as 'a person of interest'. Her family still live in Newbridge and although they knew the reclassification of her disappearance as murder was to happen they still found it heart-wrenching and shattering to hear the language of a murder investigation used about their daughter's disappearance.

All weights are predicted by the ATW CNN algorithm. The highly weighted video frames generally captures the most distinctive movements relevant to the action category. Visual temporal attention is a special case of visual attention that involves directing attention to specific instant of time. Similar to its spatial counterpart visual spatial attention, these attention modules have been widely implemented in video analytics in computer vision to provide enhanced performance and human interpretable explanation of deep learning models. As visual spatial attention mechanism allows human and/or computer vision systems to focus more on semantically more substantial regions in space, visual temporal attention modules enable machine learning algorithms to emphasize more on critical video frames in video analytics tasks, such as human action recognition. In convolutional neural network-based systems, the prioritization introduced by the attention mechanism is regularly implemented as a linear weighting layer with parameters determined by labeled training data.  Application in Action Recognition  ATW CNN architecture. Three CNN streams are used to process spatial RGB images, temporal optical flow images, and temporal warped optical flow images, respectively. An attention model is employed to assign temporal weights between snippets for each stream/modality. Weighted sum is used to fuse predictions from the three streams/modalities. Recent video segmentation algorithms often exploits both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. Research in human action recognition has accelerated significantly since the introduction of powerful tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, effective methods for incorporation of temporal information into CNNs are still being actively explored. Motivated by the popular recurrent attention models in natural language processing, the Attention-aware Temporal Weighted CNN (ATW CNN) is proposed in videos, which embeds a visual attention model into a temporal weighted multi-stream CNN. This attention model is implemented as temporal weighting and it effectively boosts the recognition performance of video representations. Besides, each stream in the proposed ATW CNN framework is capable of end-to-end training, with both network parameters and temporal weights optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with back-propagation. Experimental results show that the ATW CNN attention mechanism contributes substantially to the performance gains with the more discriminative snippets by focusing on more relevant video segments.

France is the author of The Toast of the Kit-Cat Club, a verse biography of the eighteenth-century traveler and social rebel, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. She has won numerous awards and fellowships, including the National Poetry Competition in 2013.  Early life and education Linda France was born in Wallsend, Newcastle upon Tyne on 21 May 1958. When France was five years old, her family moved to Dorset, when her father's employer established a new paint manufacturing business. In an interview in 2016, France revealed that moving to Dorset, with its own unique dialect, was an influential moment in her life. She stated: \\"The effect of that linguistic shift made a writer out of me ‚Äì the shedding of my native tongue (Geordie), and the language of the hearth to try to belong 'elsewhere' snapped a root that could never be mended and kept me, like most writers, on the edge, always the observer, the listener.\\" France attended the University of Leeds, studying English and History. After graduating, France lived in London and later moved to Amsterdam. In 1981, she returned to England, settling in Northumberland with her two sons. The family lived for ten years in a home without electricity. Career France's work includes themes of landscape, nature, love and identity. In 1988 and 1989, France was awarded First Prize in the Bloodaxe Books Evening Chronicle Poetry Competition. She won a Northern Arts Fellowship at the Tyrone Guthrie Centre in Ireland in 1990.

It is a common species with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Corallites with polyps extended A. myriophthalma is a colonial species which forms massive hemispherical or boulder-shaped colonies. The corallites are conical and evenly distributed over the surface; each has a circular, upright or outwardly-pointing opening. The colour of this coral varies but may be plain or mottled and cream, yellow or brownish-blue. It is similar in appearance to Astreopora gracilis and Astreopora listeri. Distribution and habitat A. myriophthalma has a wide distribution in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its range extends from East Africa and the Red Sea through Indonesia and northern Australia to Japan, the Philippines and various Pacific island groups. It occupies a variety of reef habitats at depths between , but avoids turbid water. Ecology Researchers found that where spionid worms had bored into heads of Astreopora myriophthalma, the areas surrounding their colonies had benefited; the researchers suggested that the faeces from the worms had provided extra nutrients for the coral's symbiotic zooxanthellae, and their increased photosynthetic activity had increased tissue growth in the coral in the immediate vicinity. The bivalve Lithophaga simplex also bores into the coral, often in dense populations. This may be a symbiotic relationship with the bivalve benefiting from protection and increased nutrition, and, despite its structure being weakened, the coral benefiting from the ammonium excreted by the molluscs. Status Astreopora myriophthalma is the most common species of coral in its genus and has a widespread distribution in the tropical and sub-tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is a comparatively resilient species with no species-significant threats. However its population is likely to be declining because of the degradation of coral reefs, with an estimated loss of around 20% in the reefs on which it grows. Climate change and ocean acidification are also likely to be threats going forward, and be associated with increased bleaching events and greater incidence of coral diseases as well as man-made hazards such as pollution, sedimentation, damage from fisheries and tourism. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

It is based on the rules of Germany's national game, Skat, and is played with a French-suited Skat pack of 32 cards.Spielesammlung mit 250 Spielm√∂glichkeiten. Game rules by ASS, pp. 28, 29. Retrieved 8 October 2018 Bidding is for the trump suit. Jacks are ranked within their respective suits and do not form additional trumps over and above the cards of the trump suit. Grupp describes it as \\"an entertaining game for a larger group.\\"  Play  The game is played with five people, although there are variants for four players or fewer. At the start of the game, the dealer shuffles the cards and offers them to be cut, he then deals six cards to each player. The remaining two cards are placed face-down in the middle of the table as the talon. The soloist is determined through a bidding process or auction. The player who bids the highest suit as trumps wins the auction. The suits rank, from highest to lowest, in the order: Clubs ‚ô£, Spades ‚ô†, Hearts ‚ô• and Diamonds ‚ô¶. In the auction the player to the left of the dealer (forehand) is the first to bid or pass. The player who is first with the highest bid wins the auction and becomes the soloist. He must then announce the bid or a higher game. He then picks up the two talon cards and may discard two cards of his choice into his pile of tricks. If no trumps are announced and all players pass, there are two options depending on what has been pre-agreed: either the cards are dealt again or a game is played without trumps, whereby the winner is the one who takes the last trick (regardless of his other tricks and card points). The forehand player leads to the first trick; all other players must either play a card of the same suit (Bedienpflicht) or, if that is not possible, must play a trump. Only if a player has neither a card of the led suit nor a trump may he discard a card of his choice. The player who plays the highest card of the led suit or the highest trump, wins the trick. The cards rank as follows: Ace > Ten > King > Queen > Jack > 9 > 8 > 7. In order to win the game the soloist must have scored more than half the available card points in his tricks by the end of the deal. The cards are valued as in Skat: the 7, 8 and 9 score zero, the Jack scores 2, the Queen scores 3, the King scores 4, the Ten scores 10 and the Ace scores 11 card points. Another 10 points is awarded to the player who takes the last trick, so that the maximum score is 130 points and the soloist must finish with at least 66 to win. Scoring may be agreed beforehand as follows: if the soloist wins, he scores the points he has taken; if he loses, twice the points are deducted from his score. If his opponents have less than 33 points, they are schneider and the winner gets double the normal points; if the defenders fail to take a trick at all (schwarz), the soloist gets triple the points. On the other hand, if he loses with less than 33 points, the triple value is deducted, and if he does not get a trick, he loses four times.  References   Literature  * Grupp, Claus D. (1975).

She is, in particular, known for her membership of Der Harem - described variously as a \\"virtual commune\\" or a \\"self-discovery group\\" - around Rainer Langhans.  Life  Brigitte Streubel was born in North-west Bavaria and grew up in Hagen in the Ruhr region. By the time she was nineteen she had already worked for a year as a photo-model in D√ºsseldorf, featured in various publications including the mass-circulation Brigitte junior. In 1969, accepting an invitation from a major Paris agency turned out to be the launch-pad for a career as an international photo-model, working between 1969 and 1976 in Milan, Rome and London. In 1972 Streubel met Rainer Langhans and his fellow \\"K1\\" commune member Uschi Obermaier, both of whom were (and remain) politically engaged members of \\"Generation '68\\". The three of them teamed up in 1976 with the photographer Anna Werner and the thespian polymath Jutta Winkelmann to establish an \\"experimental living community\\" in Munich - in many respects a small commune of their own - which became known as The Harem and received significant levels of media attention over the years. They were joined in 1978 by the film-maker and journalist Christa Ritter and in 1991 by Jutta Winkelmann's twin sister, the writer-photographer Gisela Getty. The primary focus of this experiment in community living at Munich- Schwabing by Rainer Langhans and the five women is a spiritual one. It has endured. Her first stage role came in 1974 when she appeared in Ulli Lommel's drama, \\"Wachtmeister Rahn\\" (1974), which took as its main theme a killer policeman. She also appeared briefly in one of Lommel's cinema films, \\"Der Zweite Fr√ºhling\\" (1975 - \\"Second Spring\\"), in which Curd J√ºrgens took the lead role. In 1978 she appeared a \\"Eva\\" in Uschi Reich's television drama \\"Keiner kann was daf√ºr\\" (loosely \\"No one can do anything about it\\"), also doubling up as the costume designer for the production. In 1979 she took a role in the short film \\"Smash - Gefahr aus der Unendlichkeit\\" (\\"Smash - The danger of endlessness\\"), directed by Gisela Weilemann. She worked as an assistant for the director Dominik Graf in 1989 on the comedy \\"Tiger, L√∂we, Panther\\". Streubel also works as a yoga teacher, and since 1982 has worked with video. In 2007 she published the video \\"Five Tibetans\\" with contributions from the author-translator Maruscha Magyarosy (who is another yoga teacher). She also provided contributions to a book produced by B√§rbel Sch√§fer and Monika Schuck entitled \\"Das Gl√ºcksgeheimnis: Paare erz√§hlen vom Gelingen ihrer Liebe\\" (\\"The secret of happiness: Couples on their successes in love\\").

She was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Belgium, but fled with her family to the United States in 1941, following the outbreak of World War II, and grew up in New York City. She earned a doctorate in educational psychology at the University of Chicago, and a law degree at Notre Dame University. She taught psychology at Indiana University, and later served as in-house legal counsel at Colorado College. In 2016, Rabinowitz was included in the BBC 100 Women list of most influential women. In 2017, she successfully sued El Al, after the airline forced her to move her seat on a Newark‚ÄìTel Aviv flight at the request of a Haredi Jewish man who refused to sit beside her due to his religious beliefs.  Early life and education  Rabinowitz was born in Belgium in 1934. Her family fled The Holocaust in 1941 to the United States. She grew up in New York City, before leaving the city to attend the University of Chicago, where she earned masters and doctoral degrees in educational psychology. Her 1969 Master's thesis was titled, The perceived locus of control of reinforcements among sixth-grade Negro children. Her 1974 dissertation was titled, Personal Causation, Role-Taking, and Effectiveness with Peers: A Study of Social Competence in Elementary School Children. She also earned a law degree from Notre Dame Law School.  Career  Rabinowitz taught psychology at Indiana University. She later served as in- house legal counsel at Colorado College, and as a professional volunteer at the Israel Center for the Treatment of Psychotrauma. El Al discrimination lawsuit In December 2015, Rabinowitz was flying business class on an El Al flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Tel Aviv, Israel. After being seated next to a Haredi Jewish man, the man complained to an onboard flight attendant that he did not want to sit next to a woman because of his religious beliefs. As a result, Rabinowitz was forced to move seats. After speaking to Anat Hoffman, director of the Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), the organization filed a court case on her behalf for unlawful discrimination. IRAC represented Rabinowitz at the trial. In June 2017, Rabinowitz was awarded 6,500 shekels (about $1,800). The trial also ruled that El Al's practice of requiring unwilling passengers to accommodate Haredi religious mores violated the country's Prohibition of Discrimination in Products law. The court required El Al to update its policy within six months to comply with Israeli discrimination law. After the verdict, IRAC lawyer Riki Shapira Rosenberg said they expected this to be extended to other airlines. = Related incidents = In 2018, the Israel Religious Action Center attempted to run an advertising campaign reminding Israeli women that they were not required to change seats at the request of men. The proposed advertisements were blocked by the authorities. In the same year, NICE Ltd. CEO Barak Eilam criticised El Al after they forced women to move seats at the request of Haredi men. Speaking about the incident, IRAC said that the incident was a violation of Rabinowitz's court decision. Personal life Rabinowitz had three children from her first marriage. She was divorced from her first husband in 1986, and married Rabbi Stanley M. Wagner of Denver, Colorado, in November 1990. She gained two stepchildren through her marriage to Wagner. Rabinowitz and Wagner made Aliyah to Israel in 2006, but frequently visited the United States. She lived the final years of her life in an assisted-living facility in Jerusalem. Rabinowitz died on May 19, 2020, in Jerusalem.  Awards and honors  In 2016, Rabinowitz was included in the BBC 100 Women list of most influential women.

Born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫‚Äîthen part of the Russian Empire‚Äîhe left his hometown as a young man as Jewish quotas and other anti-Jewish practices prevented Jewish students from attending university. After earning a degree in chemical engineering at the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon in France, he worked at Universal Oil Products (now UOP LLC) from 1930 to 1952. Pines also worked at Northwestern University beginning in 1941, and served from 1953‚Äì1970 as the Ipatieff Research Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Ipatieff High Pressure and Catalytic Laboratory. He is best known for his work with Vladimir Ipatieff on the catalytic conversion of high-octane aviation fuel, which was made available to the Royal Air Force during World War II, helping them win the Battle of Britain. Because of his scientific contributions, new processes were developed for the isomerization of paraffins, the alkylation of aromatic compounds, and base-catalyzed organic reactions. Biography Herman Pines was born on January 17, 1902 to Isaac and Eugenia (Grynfeld) Pines, a Jewish couple in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (then in the Russian Empire, now Poland). Pines left ≈Å√≥d≈∫ as a young man, because Jewish quotas and other anti-Jewish practices prevented Jewish students from attending university. Instead Pines went to France to study. In 1927, Pines received a degree in chemical engineering at the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon (now the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Physique √âlectronique de Lyon). In 1928 Pines emigrated to the United States. After working at routine jobs for a couple of years, he joined Universal Oil Products (now UOP LLC) in McCook, Illinois in 1930. He began by doing routine analyses, and was later transferred to the research department. By 1930 Pines was a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, and working at UOP. There he met Russian-born Vladimir Ipatieff. Pines became his assistant, beginning a twenty-two-year scientific collaboration. Initially, the two expatriates used French and Russian as working languages, since they spoke both of them better than English. Studying at night, Pines completed a Ph.D in organic chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1935 with the thesis A study of the electronegativities of organic radicals. In 1941, Pines received a part-time research professorship at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He continued to work for UOP, serving as OUP's full-time Coordinator of Exploratory Research from 1945 to 1951. After the death of Ipatieff in 1952, Pines left UOP to focus on his work at Northwestern University. In 1953 he became the Ipatieff Research Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Ipatieff High Pressure and Catalytic Laboratory. Pines retired from the position in 1970, but continued to be scientifically active as a professor emeritus until a few months before his death on April 10, 1996. Pines greatly appreciated the willingness of the United States to welcome refugees. Family Pines married Dorothy Mlolek in 1927. They had a daughter, Judith or Judy (Pines) Suessmaier. Pines' mother and other members of his family are believed to have been killed during The Holocaust. Work Pines and Ipatieff worked closely together for 22 years, until Ipatieff died and Pines succeeded him at Northwestern University. A modest man who tended to emphasize the contributions of others, Pines has nonetheless been described as \\"one of the towering scientists of this century\\". Throughout his career, Pines made significant contributions to the understanding of heterogeneous catalysis and the chemistry of petroleum hydrocarbons. Ipatieff encouraged each person on his staff to spend 10‚Äì15% of their time on a personal project, pleasing to their \\"chemical soul\\". Early on, Pines chose to test one of the dominant doctrines of the time: the belief that paraffin hydrocarbons or alkanes were inert substances that did not react with other substances at low temperatures. The very name paraffin reflected this belief, coming from the Latin \\"parum affinis\\" (limited affinity). Pines was able to demonstrate that catalysis could occur at low temperatures, counter to previous belief. At low temperatures, in the presence of sulfuric acid (H2SO4), isoparaffins such as isobutane reacted with olefins. This alkylation process was discovered in 1932 and commercialized in 1938. Ipatieff and Pines were trying to understand complex chemical reactions that were affected by many factors including temperature, concentration of acid used, and ratio of acid to other compounds. Such reactions often resulted in the formation of a complex mixture of products, including intermediate products which could participate in further reactions. By working with pure hydrocarbons rather than petroleum fractions, Pines was better able to isolate and understand specific chemical reactions. He emphasized that a reaction was not understood until all the products of the reaction were identified and understood. His student Herbert Appel later recalled being taught, \\"never to be satisfied with a mechanism until it explains all the products\\". Pines was able to understand and describe the isomerization of butanes and pentanes. Isomerization is a rearrangement reaction, in which one molecule is transformed into another that contains the same atoms in a different arrangement. Pines developed a method for the catalytic conversion of n-butane into isobutane. The first step was protonation of butene by sulfuric acid, forming a reactive but short-lived carbenium ion intermediate. The second step was alkylation of isobutane by the carbenium cations. Butane isomerization was discovered in 1935 and commercialized in 1941. Ongoing research into the chemical processes involved showed that it was impossible to achieve isomerization of paraffinic hydrocarbons without a chemical catalyst: heat alone could not be sufficient. Pure n-butane would not react without a source of olefin cations. The production of isobutane was a necessary step in the production of high-octane gasoline. The catalytic conversion of paraffins into isoparaffins has been described as \\"one of the cornerstones of the petroleum industry.\\" Combining the processes of alkylation and butane isomerization led to the development of high octane fuels for use in aviation gasoline. Isobutane and C3‚ÄìC4 olefins are by-products of fluid catalytic cracking and other catalytic and thermal conversion processes. During the alkylation process, light molecular weight iso-paraffins such as isobutane can be combined with C3‚ÄìC4 olefins to form higher weight iso-paraffins or alkylates that do not contain olefinic or aromatic hydrocarbons. Hawker Hurricane Mk I, July 1940 Groundcrew refuelling a Hawker Hurricane Mk I, August 1940 These methods of preparation were kept secret by the Americans during World War II, but the fuels were made available to the Allies for their Spitfires and Hurricanes, and are said to have given the Royal Air Force an advantage in the Battle of Britain. Another war-time accomplishment by Pines and his co-workers was the chemical analysis of the fuel of German aircraft. This enabled the Allies to target mines and other facilities that produced materials critical to the German war effort. Alkylation processes have since been used to produce gasoline for motors, as engines became more powerful. Alkylation can be a preferable process for environmental reasons as well. Having established that such reactions were possible, Pines and his co-workers explored the mechanisms involved in the catalysis of hydrocarbons. They studied a variety of transformations including \\"polymerization, alkylation, cyclization, additions, eliminations and hydride transfer reactions.\\" They made basic discoveries that furthered the understanding of mechanisms involving carbonium ions, carbanions, free radicals, intermediates, thermal reactions, and relationships between catalytic behavior and surface chemistry. Pines studied both acid and base catalysis; catalytic properties of aluminas; and aromatization, dehydrogenation and metal hydrogenation catalysts. He has contributed to understanding the mechanism of dehydration of alcohols on alumina as a catalyst and supporter. He has also examined mechanisms of aromatization of alkanes over chromia. He has analyzed hydrogen transfer reactions involving aromatic hydrocarbons. His work influenced Nobel winner George Andrew Olah, who was able to chemically stabilize carbocations and further investigate their structure and activity. Pines and Ipatieff's discoveries about the catalysis of hydrocarbon reactions laid fundamental groundwork for the oil refining and chemical industries. These industries use various types of catalysts to unlock the saturated hydrocarbons in natural gas and raw oil. Processes involving noble-metal, liquid- and solid-acid catalysts are essential to the production of energy and of widely-used industrial chemicals in the twentieth century. The work of Pines, Ipatieff, Louis Schmerling, Herman S. Bloch, Vladimir Haensel and others at Universal Oil Products (UOP)'s Riverside Laboratory has been recognized by the presentation of a National Historic Chemical Landmark at the laboratory building in McCook, Illinois on November 15, 1995. Pines was a founder of the Catalysis Club of Chicago. Since 1999, the Catalysis Club of Chicago and Honeywell-Universal Oil Products (UOP) have given an annual award, the Herman Pines Award, to recognize exceptional research in catalysis.

Burk House, colloquially known as the Burk Mansion, is a Gilded Age late Victorian Italian Renaissance style house located at 1500 North Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania now owned by Temple University. Designed by architects Edward P. Simon & David B. Basset and constructed between 1907 and 1909, the building was later altered and enlarged by Louis A. Manfredi first in 1949 and later in 1953. The house was initially commissioned and inhabited by industrialist and leather manufacturer Alfred E. Burk from 1909 until his death in 1921. From 1945-1970, the house served as the headquarters for the Upholsterers International Union of North America, an AFL-affiliated labor union of upholsters and textile workers, among others. In 1971, it was acquired by Temple University‚Äôs School of Social Administration. Temple University used the property as a daycare for faculty, staff, and students until its closure in 1995. The building currently sits unoccupied.  History  = Alfred E. Burk = The Burk Family originated from Knittlingen, W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The parents of Alfred E. Burk were David and Charlotte Reinman Burk who had eight children. The family emigrated to the United States in 1854 and settled in Philadelphia, PA. Alfred E. Burk, along with his two brothers Henry and Charles, started the Burk Brothers Company which specialized in the production of glazed-kid leather. Their factory complex was located at 919-961 North 3rd Street in Philadelphia in the old leather district and was sold after the death of Henry Burk in 1903. The complex consisted of 12 interconnected brick and reinforced concrete buildings and continued to produce leather products until it was demolished in the mid-20th century. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Alfred E. Burk was a prominent industrialist and politician. Along with his shared company Burk Brothers, he also developed and owned the Garden Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey with his brother Louis. Burk was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Pennsylvania in 1920. He was also a Freemason. He died in Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pa., May 13, 1921 (age 56 years, 189 days). = Industrial Development = Between 1945 and 1971, the Alfred E. Burk house served as the headquarters of the Upholsters' International Union (UIU). Founded in 1892, the UIU represented workers within industries such as caskets, mattress and bedding, furniture, window trimming and display installation. In the late 19th century North Broad Street in Philadelphia developed into a boulevard for the industrial wealthy. It was a convenient location for two reasons. First, many of their production places were located in adjoining industrial areas; a North Broad Street residence gave its entrepreneurial owner access to his thriving business, as well as the comforts of a rich social life. = Temple University = Temple University bought the 27-room Alfred E. Burk House in 1970 ‚Äì the year before the building was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. The university purchased the building from the Upholsters‚Äô International Union of North America for $375,000. Within one year of its acquisition, the building became the home of the recently created School of Social Administration. In 1975, the university moved its daycare program into the mansion‚Äôs carriage house. This daycare served the children of Temple students and employees for nearly twenty years until a July 1993 mechanical fire in the house forced the relocation of both the daycare program and the School of Social Administration. The fire caused an estimated $2.8 million worth of damages, and coupled with the declining state of appropriations from the Commonwealth for the upkeep of the mansion, led to Temple officials closing the house in 1995. The building has remained empty ever since.  Future of the Mansion  The Burk House currently stands empty and unused, vacant since 1995. Temple University released a Master Plan that makes no mention of the Burk House property, so speculation continues as to its future. Shortly before the 2008 economic crisis, Temple planned to use the building to house its Honors program, according to Ray Betzner, Temple‚Äôs assistant vice president of university communications. The economic crash put an end to the $44 million project before it began. In 2015, an image circulated of a proposed hotel at the site, sparking further questions as to Temple‚Äôs plans for the building. Temple architect Margaret Carney refuted the rumor that Temple planned to demolish, noting that over a million dollars had recently been invested in stabilizing the mansion‚Äôs roof, and that new lights, heating, and ventilation had been installed. According to Philadelphia Historical Commission executive director Jon Farnham, as of 2015 Temple University had not submitted a demolition application for the site.

These systems may be an independent technology for the pharmacy's use only, or in a hospital setting, pharmacies may be integrated within an inpatient hospital computer physician order entry (CPOE) system. Necessary actions for a basic, functioning pharmacy management system include a user interface, data entry and retention, and security limits to protect patient health information. Pharmacy computer software is usually purchased ready made or provided by a drug wholesaler as part of their service. Various pharmacy software operating systems are used throughout the many practice settings of pharmacy across the world.  Purpose  The pharmacy management system serves many purposes, including the safe and effective dispensing of pharmaceutical drugs. During the dispensing process, the system will prompt the pharmacist to verify the medication they have filled is for the correct patient, contains the right quantity and dosage, and displays accurate information on the prescription label. Advanced pharmacy management systems offer clinical decision support and may be configured to alert the pharmacist to perform clinical interventions, such as an opportunity to offer verbal counseling if the patient's prescription requires additional education in the pharmacy. Pharmacy management systems should also serve the pharmacist throughout the Pharmacists‚Äô Patient Care Process, a cycle developed by the Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPP). The process details the steps pharmacists take to practice tangible, proven care to their patients.  Pharmacist patient care process  The JCPP's pharmacist patient care process consists of five steps: collect, assess, plan, implement, and follow-up. Ideally, the pharmacy management system assists with each of these practices. The pharmacy system should Collect data at intake and continue to store and organize information as the pharmacist learns more about the patient's medications, their history, goals, and other factors that may affect their health. The technology within the pharmacy information system should allow the pharmacists to Assess the collected information to form a Plan and Implement creative strategies that address the patient's issues. After implementing a plan, the pharmacist should routinely Follow-Up with the patient and make adjustments as needed to further progress.  Core Features of Outpatient Pharmacy Management Systems  The outpatient pharmacy management system allows the pharmacy to carry out daily operations. Available features vary across different systems, but all pharmacies require core functions and capabilities to perform their duties. = Dispensing Workflow Management = The action most associated with pharmacy is the dispensing of medication. Dispensing occurs from receiving the prescription from the patient or prescriber to finalizing the prescription before it is picked up by the patient. * Intake: Also known as the Data Entry Station, this is the first step in a typical independent pharmacy's workflow. When the prescription is received by the pharmacy, the technician or pharmacist enters the data into the system. * Pre-Check: Before filling the prescription, the pharmacist has an opportunity to review it for potential drug interactions, appropriate dosage, duplicate therapies, or transcription errors that may result in multiple scenarios ranging from a third-party claim rejection to harming the patient. * Fill: Here, medications are dispensed. They can be counted and verified by hand, or a dispensing robot can be integrated into the workflow to complete this task. * Check: The pharmacist confirms the filled prescription contains the right medication, dosage, and supply. Once the prescription is verified, it is placed in the Will Call Bin. = Third Party Claims Adjudication = Pharmacists work alongside physicians and payers to coordinate patient insurance benefits. The pharmacy management system can be an asset in this process. In cases involving a medication not covered by the patient's insurance company, the pharmacist must receive prior authorization from payers to dispense the medication. Some available systems are capable of automatically generating prior authorization requests and completing claim adjudications. = Clinical Information Management = * The Patient Profile summarizes patient data in a cohesive display. Pharmacies use patient profiles to document basic information (age, address, phone number, allergies), known health conditions, insurance and prescriber information, laboratory values, immunization history, and other necessary details related to patient care management. * Prescription Profiles record patient fill histories (both prescription and non-prescription medications) so pharmacists can monitor adherence, prevent duplicate or conflicting therapies, and avoid negative drug interactions. * Medication Synchronization, or med sync, is ideal for patients with multiple maintenance medications. The pharmacist organizes all of the patient's medications to be filled on the same date each month, minimizing patient confusion and the number of visits to the pharmacy. = Inventory Management = Various systems provide inventory management tools that allow pharmacists to reorder items, return unused stock, and organize shelf labels. Ideally, pharmacies keep a lean inventory to avoid spending money on products that remain undispensed on their shelves. Pharmacy management systems also support the electronic data exchange (EDI) between pharmacies and wholesalers, which digitizes shipping and receiving orders, catalog updates, and pricing changes.  Usage-Based Ordering  A system feature that notifies the pharmacy when the balance on hand (BOH) has changed for an item and may need to be re-ordered. = Pricing and Billing = Within a pharmacy, financial intelligence is crucial for maintaining the store's business. Pharmacy management systems are capable of identifying profit losses from direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees, rebilling third parties for claims resubmissions, and tracking market changes so the pharmacy can continually offer competitive prices.  Accounts Receivable  Also known as ‚ÄúA/R Accounts‚Äù or ‚ÄúCharge Accounts,‚Äù these allow patients to pay the amount owed to the pharmacy at a later date. These patients are typically residents of long-term care facilities, or patients who receive prescription deliveries. = Reporting = Because pharmacies interact with patients and multiple facets of healthcare (payers, prescribers, facilities, etc.), they gather and store data within their pharmacy management systems. This data may be utilized for implementing business intelligence practices, documenting patient responses to new care strategies, or supplied to an auditor during an inspection or certification process.  Advanced searching  System users may employ the search capabilities to find broad selections of information, or use filters and specific standards to refine results and isolate the desired data.  User-customizable reporting  Cutting-edge pharmacy management systems offer customizable reports to their users. Reports may be based on pre-existing templates, or pharmacies may create their own tailored reports according to their needs.
