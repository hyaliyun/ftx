During the interwar period, the Polish High Command had placed considerable emphasis upon the role of armed aerial reconnaissance aircraft. To meet this interest, during 1931, PZL decided to embark on the development of a new combat aircraft to meet this role. An earlier proposal for a fast single-engine passenger airliner, designated the PZL.13, was adopted as the basis of the new design. The new aircraft, which was designated as the PZL.23, a relatively modern design, which integrated features such as an all-metal body and unconventional wing construction. As the British Bristol Pegasus radial engine was licensed for use in Poland only, export aircraft were instead equipped with the Gnome- Rh√¥ne 14K engine. Powered as such and along with some airframe changes, the PZL.23 became the PZL.43 Kara≈õ. It was the primary Polish reconnaissance bomber in use during the invasion of Poland. On 2 September 1939, a single PZL.23B of the 21st Escadrille was responsible for the bombing of a factory in Ohlau, inside Germany; the attack represented the first bombing raid to be conducted against a target in territory within the Third Reich. During the following days, the PZL.23 bomber escadrilles were deployed to attack several advancing German armoured columns; they often conducted these attacks at low altitudes, which made them vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. By the end of 1939, around 120 PZL.23s (86 per cent of the Polish Air Force's inventory of the type) were destroyed; however, of these, only 67 had been lost as a direct result of enemy actions. Development =Background= As a result of wartime experiences acquired by the Polish armed forces during the 1919-1921 Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, during the 1920s and 1930s (now known as the interwar period), a great emphasis was placed upon the role of armed aerial reconnaissance aircraft. According to aviation historian J. B. Cynk, the role was recognised by the Polish High Command as being, aside from the basic fighter aircraft, the most important type of aerial unit in their doctrine. As such, considerable resources and effort was placed upon the creation of sizable army cooperation escadrilles, which were initially principally equipped with foreign-built biplanes such as the French Breguet 19 and Potez 25.Cynk 1966, p. 3. During the late 1920s, it had become increasingly obvious that the existing types used for the aerial reconnaissance role would need to be replaced, which led to the Ministry of War's Aviation Department defining a set of a broad performance requirements desired in an aircraft to fulfil the role. Around the same time, at the Polish aviation company PZL, the aircraft designer Stanis≈Çaw Prauss had been studying options for a new fast single- engine airliner, to be designated the PZL.13. An advanced low-wing cantilever monoplane design proposal with an all-metal structure and a Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine was selected for further development, however during early 1931, the Ministry of Transport cancelled the project and terminated its sponsorship amid a lack of interest. Accordingly, PZL were keen to embark upon a replacement project in the place of the PZL.13 venture. Following a series of consultations between the company and the Aviation Department, it was decided to embark upon the design of a three-man armed reconnaissance-bomber, using the abortive PZL.13 passenger transport airliner as a starting point for the new aircraft. The resulting design, designated the PZL.23, was only one of several proposals to be produced; alternatives included the PWS.19, a high- wing monoplane, and the Lublin R.XVII, a clean twin-seat biplane with a retractable undercarriage. During late 1931, the Aviation Department decided to opt for the PZL submission. =Design phase= During early 1932, PZL were authorised to formally proceed with preliminary design work on what would become the PZL.23. An early key design decision was the selection of the British Bristol Pegasus radial engine to power the type, which was domestically produced by Skoda in their Warsaw plant. The emerging design was for a modern combat aircraft, integrating features such as an all-metal body and unconventional wing construction, being built around light closed profiles instead of spars (this wing design had been previously introduced on the PZL.19). During the spring of 1932, the preliminary design was approved in principal by the Aviation Department, however, in accordance with the department's expressed preferences, the ventral gun turret was redesigned for increased field of fire, as well as to accommodate more capable bomb-aiming equipment. During late 1932, authorisation to proceed with the construction of a batch of three prototypes along with one static-test airframe. However, development would not prove to be a straightforward venture. The diverse requirements of the PZL.23 imposed considerable hurdles in the design phase; in order to produce a relative fast aircraft, a heavy airframe was practically necessitated, however, it was also important for the type to be able to operate from constrained austere airstrips rapidly established on the front lines of warzones; producing a suitable compromise was not easy. The venture has been considered to be pioneering in some aspects of its design, which contributed to its design complications. Static testing by the Institute of Aviation Technical Research (ITBL) was both protracted and determined some components to process insufficient strength; these were not completed until 1933. However, completion of the prototypes was delayed to incorporate modifications to address the findings. The name Kara≈õ was selected for the type around this time.Cynk 1966, p. 4. =Into flight= On 1 April 1934, the P.23/I first prototype conducted its maiden flight; it was quickly followed by the second P.23/II prototype. Early flight testing revealed several issues that needed to be resolved, including tail flutter and vibration in the rear fuselage area; another difficulty identified even prior to the first flight was the inadequate visibility from the cockpit for both the pilot and observer. Various measures to rectify these issues were incorporated onto the second and third prototypes.Cynk 1966, pp. 4-5. During the following year, the third P.23/III prototype was completed; on this aircraft, various further refinements were included, such as the pilot's seat having been raised into a new fully glazed canopy arrangement and the engine being positioned lowered down, giving the aircraft a characteristic hump-nose, as to improve the pilot's external field of vision. The fuselage bomb bay of the earlier prototype was eliminated; instead, the entire payload was carried externally on racks fixed onto the underside of the wing's center-section. Various other alterations were made to the wings, including the adoption of more effective slotted ailerons, improved flaps and center-section slots, the latter feature served to smooth the airflow over the tail when flown at high angles of incidence.Cynk 1966, p. 5. During mid-1935, the second prototype was lost in a crash shortly after a take-off conducted at the maximum loading weight, killing the crew on board. The remaining airworthiness tests and service acceptance trials were completed successfully using the third prototype. Further refinements had been incorporated into the third prototype during the test programme to eventually conform with the standards of subsequent production-standard aircraft. Amongst the final changes were the adoption of a Pegasus VIII engine, after which it was used as the development aircraft for the PZL.23B variant of the type. As a consequence of its favourable flight test programme, the aircraft was approved to enter full-scale production during the second half of 1935. The first series, which was given the designation of PZL.23A, was fitted with a single Bristol Pegasus IIM2 engine, which possessed an upper thrust capability of 670 hp (500 kW) thrust. Early on, the limited availability of the Pegasus engine led to production delays.Cynk 1966, pp. 5-6. However, since this engine proved to be unreliable during testing, the final variant, which was designated PZL.23B, was fitted with the newer Pegasus VIII model, which was capable of generating a maximum of 720 hp (537 kW) of thrust.Cynk 1966, p. 6. =Further development= The Bristol engines were licensed for use in Poland only, so for export purposes the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K was used in a variety of PZL designs. In this case, the 14K-powered PZL.23, which featured some changes to the airframe, became the PZL.43 Kara≈õ.Cynk 1966, pp. 6-7. The final export variant to be developed was PZL.43A; it was furnished with a single 1,020 hp Gnome-Rhone 14N-01 engine. 52 PZL.43s were made in total, all for Bulgaria only. The new engine improved the aircraft's performance considerably, resulting in the maximum speed being increased to 365 km/h. During 1936, 40 PZL.23As were produced. Between late 1936 and February 1938, 210 PZL.23Bs were produced with the new engines. They were also known as Kara≈õ A and B or Kara≈õ I and II. All PZL.23s had military numbers from 44.1 to 44.250.Sometimes the aircraft is called the \\"PZL P.23\\", but despite an abbreviation P.23 painted on a tail fin, the letter \\"P\\" was generally reserved for fighters of Pulawski's design (like PZL P.11). In November 1936, one aircraft was shown at the Paris Air Show, where it was met with interest. During this period, PZL developed the PZL.46 Sum, a new light bomber, which was partly based on the PZL.23 design. However, only a pair of prototypes were completed during 1938. There was also a single experimental variant of the Kara≈õ, designated at the PZL.42; it featured a double tail fin configuration and a modified bombardier gondola which, amongst other things, was retractable into the fuselage. Design The PZL.23 Kara≈õ was a low-wing cantilever monoplane, featuring all-metal, metal-covered construction. The crew of three consisted of a pilot, a bombardier, and a rear gunner. The bombardier's combat station was situated in a gondola underneath the hull, where he could also operate an underbelly machine gun. The pilot was positioned within a fully enclosed air-conditioned and heated cockpit, while the observer was seated directly behind him and could descend into the ventral gondola during applicable parts of a given mission. The fixed undercarriage comprised a pair of cantilever struts and single tail skid, all of which were outfitted with pneumatic shock absorbers built by Czechoslovakian company Avia. When prepared for operating from rough or austere airfields, the streamlined fairings over the wheels would have to be removed in advance.Cynk 1966, pp. 3, 7-8. The aircraft were equipped with one of the following engines: Bristol Pegasus IIM2 normal: 570 hp (425 kW), maximum: 670 hp (500 kW) - PZL.23A; Pegasus VIII normal: 650 hp (485 kW), maximum: 720 (537 kW) - PZL.23B. Early Polish-built engines had encountered several common issues, including crankshaft fractures and reduction gears jamming; the original engine manufacturer, Bristol, had not amended the drawings and specifications provided to Poland to incorporate their latest improvements to the Pegasus, which addressed these issues. For the export market, it was outfitted with either the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K or Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N-01 engines. Regardless of the engine adopted, the aircraft was always outfitted with a two-blade propeller.Cynk 1966, p. 8. One of the more unusual features of the PZL.23 was the design of its three-piece low-mounted wing.Cynk 1966, p. 7. In order to produce a wing that was both light and strong, Prauss had opted to use a relatively new wing structure which had been recently designed by Polish engineer Fraciszek Misztal. This wing combined a revolutionary heavy-gauge corrugated duralumin center box and a multi-cellular trailing edge, along with a partially stressed exterior skin composed of duralumin; according to Cynk, it was one of the earliest implementations of a metal sandwidge structure in the field of aviation.Cynk 1966, pp. 3-4. The fuselage of the PZL.23 had an oval-section structure, composed of a mixture of duralumin frames and stringers, which were strengthened via several struts on the middle section. The exterior of the fuselage was covered with smooth duralumin sheet, which was internally reinforced in some areas by corrugated sheeting. The rear fuselage featured a semi-monocoque structure. A cantilever structure composed of ribs and spars was used for the tail unit; the fun and tailplane were covered by duralumin sheeting, while the rudder and elevators had finely corrugated exterior surfaces. The aircraft's offensive payload consisted of bombs. These were carried underneath the wings using racks; the maximum load was (6 x 100 kg and 2 x 50 kg). While plans to incorporate the Swiatecki bomb- release gear had been mooted, however, they were eliminated from the design during the prototype stage due to disagreements between the Aviation Department and the inventor regarding the manufacturing arrangements. The PZL.23 was also armed with several machine guns, including a defensive ventral gun turret; additional positions, such as a twin-gun mounting on the upper fuselage were considered but never pursued. A typical gun armament included either one or a pair of 7.7 mm fixed guns, along with two single 7.7 mm movable guns.Cynk 1966, pp. 3-8. Operational history PZL.23A of the production series PZL.23A Kara≈õ on the Warsaw Airport. Note lines of PZL P.11 or PZL P.7 fighters in the background During late 1936, a batch of 40 PZL.23As were delivered to the Polish Air Force. Due to engine faults, these aircraft were initially flown with a limited service ceiling and they were used exclusively in the training role, being fitted with dual controls to fit this usage.Cynk 1966, p. 9. From 1937, a total of 210 PZL.23Bs were delivered to the Air Force. Around this time, the time became the main armament of Polish bomber and reconnaissance \\"line squadrons\\", having replaced the majority of Breguet 19, Potez 25 and Potez 27 biplanes. By August 1939, there had been 23 reported crashes involving the type, which was deemed to have been an average safety result. However, due to rapid advances in the field of aviation during the late 1930s, by 1939 the aircraft was considered to be approaching obsolescence. There were increasing questions over the validity of prior air doctrine, leading to a major reorganisation of the PZL.23 squadrons during 1938-1939. The main deficiency of the PZL.23 was its relatively low speed compared to newer aircraft that were then entering service with neighbouring nations. Other issues with the aircraft included a lack of manoeuvrability and unfavourable characteristics when flown at high speeds (the maximum speed of the PZL.23B was 365 km/h, but it was forbidden to exceed 319 km/h due to dangerous flight characteristics). However, at the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland, it remained Poland's primary light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. During late August 1939, in anticipation of imminent hostilities with Nazi Germany, all Polish combat units were relocated from their peacetime bases to secret combat airfields, so they avoided destruction on the ground.Cynk 1966, p. 10. Some PZL.23s were also used in wartime improvised units with 114 PZL.23Bs deployed in combat units (a further 75 PZL.23B and 35 PZL.23A were in air schools, held in reserve or under repair). In total, the PZL.23B were operational with five bomber escadrilles (Eskadra Bombowa) of the Bomber Brigade and seven Army reconnaissance escadrilles, each of which equipped with ten aircraft. In Bomber Brigade there existed also bigger units (Dywizjon Bombowy), consisting of two escadrilles each, and traditionally translated as squadron (two other squadrons of the Bomber Brigade were equipped with the PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ bomber). In addition, a pair of PZL.43A bombers that had been produced for the Bulgarian order were impressed into Polish service in the 41st Escadrille. On 2 September 1939, a single PZL.23B of the 21st Escadrille was responsible for the bombing of a factory in Ohlau, inside Germany, the first bombing raid to be conducted against a target within the Third Reich. Over the following days, the PZL.23 bomber squadrons commenced attacks upon several advancing German armoured columns, which were responsible for knocking out as many as thirty per cent of the German ground vehicles. One such high-profile engagement occurred on 3 September 1939. Despite this offensive use of the type, the main task of the Army escadrilles was to perform reconnaissance missions.Cynk 1966, pp. 10, 12. The five escadrilles of the Bomber Brigade delivered about 52-60 tons of bombs during the campaign, while the Army escadrilles were responsible for the deployment of roughly another dozen tons. Due to the plane's low speed, light armour and, perhaps most importantly, a lack of supporting protection from friendly fighter aircraft, the PZL.23 suffered heavy combat losses.Cynk 1966, p. 12. Many were shot down by German fighter aircraft, but they were also able to fight back and were responsible for shooting down several in return. Despite the lack of protective armour, Polish aircrews often conducted attacks upon German columns while flying at low altitudes, which made their aircraft particularly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. Reportedly, around twenty aircraft were lost in crash landings on the improvised and rough airfields. During 1939, around 120 PZL.23s (86 per cent of the Polish Air Force's inventory) were destroyed. However, only 67 of these had been due to direct enemy action. Additionally, only a small number of PZL.23s were destroyed on the ground at various airfields; the only large- scale Luftwaffe success of this type occurred on 14 September, at Hutniki airfield, against the PZL.23Bs of the Bomber Brigade. During late 1939, at least 21 PZL.23s were evacuated to Romania, of which at least 19 were subsequently used by the Romanian Air Force against the Soviet Union (USSR) during Operation Barbarossa, the costly Axis invasion of the USSR. In addition to Romania's use of the type, a total of 50 PZL.43s and PZL.43As (one pair were delivered by the Germans) were used in Bulgaria for training purposes; the type, which was known by the Bulgarians as the \\"Chaika\\", were used in this role until 1946. There are no known PZL.23s survivors of the war.

It was proposed as an alternative to the Fourier transform by Ralph V. L. Hartley in 1942, and is one of many known Fourier-related transforms. Compared to the Fourier transform, the Hartley transform has the advantages of transforming real functions to real functions (as opposed to requiring complex numbers) and of being its own inverse. The discrete version of the transform, the discrete Hartley transform (DHT), was introduced by Ronald N. Bracewell in 1983. The two-dimensional Hartley transform can be computed by an analog optical process similar to an optical Fourier transform (OFT), with the proposed advantage that only its amplitude and sign need to be determined rather than its complex phase. However, optical Hartley transforms do not seem to have seen widespread use. Definition The Hartley transform of a function f(t) is defined by: : H(\\\\omega) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}f\\\\right\\\\\\\\}(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(t) \\\\operatorname{cas}(\\\\omega t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t, where \\\\omega can in applications be an angular frequency and : \\\\operatorname{cas}(t) = \\\\cos(t) + \\\\sin(t) = \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\sin (t+\\\\pi /4) = \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\cos (t-\\\\pi /4) is the cosine-and-sine (cas) or Hartley kernel. In engineering terms, this transform takes a signal (function) from the time- domain to the Hartley spectral domain (frequency domain). = Inverse transform = The Hartley transform has the convenient property of being its own inverse (an involution): :f = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H} \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{H}f \\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}. = Conventions = The above is in accord with Hartley's original definition, but (as with the Fourier transform) various minor details are matters of convention and can be changed without altering the essential properties: *Instead of using the same transform for forward and inverse, one can remove the {1}/{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} from the forward transform and use {1}/{2\\\\pi} for the inverse--or, indeed, any pair of normalizations whose product is {1}/{2\\\\pi}. (Such asymmetrical normalizations are sometimes found in both purely mathematical and engineering contexts.) *One can also use 2\\\\pi u t instead of \\\\omega t (i.e., frequency instead of angular frequency), in which case the {1}/{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} coefficient is omitted entirely. *One can use \\\\cos-\\\\sin instead of \\\\cos+\\\\sin as the kernel. Relation to Fourier transform This transform differs from the classic Fourier transform F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\\\\\{ f(t) \\\\\\\\}(\\\\omega) in the choice of the kernel. In the Fourier transform, we have the exponential kernel: \\\\exp\\\\left({-\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\omega t}\\\\right) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) - \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\sin(\\\\omega t), where \\\\mathrm{i} is the imaginary unit. The two transforms are closely related, however, and the Fourier transform (assuming it uses the same 1/\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi} normalization convention) can be computed from the Hartley transform via: :F(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{H(\\\\omega) + H(-\\\\omega)}{2} - \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\frac{H(\\\\omega) - H(-\\\\omega)}{2}. That is, the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform are simply given by the even and odd parts of the Hartley transform, respectively. Conversely, for real- valued functions f(t), the Hartley transform is given from the Fourier transform's real and imaginary parts: :\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{H} f \\\\\\\\} = \\\\Re \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{F}f \\\\\\\\} - \\\\Im \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{F}f \\\\\\\\} = \\\\Re \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{F}f \\\\cdot (1+\\\\mathrm{i}) \\\\\\\\} where \\\\Re and \\\\Im denote the real and imaginary parts of the complex Fourier transform.  Properties  The Hartley transform is a real linear operator, and is symmetric (and Hermitian). From the symmetric and self-inverse properties, it follows that the transform is a unitary operator (indeed, orthogonal). There is also an analogue of the convolution theorem for the Hartley transform. If two functions x(t) and y(t) have Hartley transforms X(\\\\omega) and Y(\\\\omega), respectively, then their convolution z(t) = x * y has the Hartley transform: :Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{H} (x * y) \\\\\\\\} = \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi} \\\\left( X(\\\\omega) \\\\left[ Y(\\\\omega) + Y(-\\\\omega) \\\\right] \\\\+ X(-\\\\omega) \\\\left[ Y(\\\\omega) - Y(-\\\\omega) \\\\right] \\\\right) / 2. Similar to the Fourier transform, the Hartley transform of an even/odd function is even/odd, respectively. = cas = The properties of the Hartley kernel, for which Hartley introduced the name cas for the function (from cosine and sine) in 1942, follow directly from trigonometry, and its definition as a phase-shifted trigonometric function \\\\operatorname{cas}(t)=\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\sin (t+\\\\pi /4)=\\\\sin(t)+\\\\cos(t). For example, it has an angle-addition identity of: : 2 \\\\operatorname{cas} (a+b) = \\\\operatorname{cas}(a) \\\\operatorname{cas}(b) + \\\\operatorname{cas}(-a) \\\\operatorname{cas}(b) + \\\\operatorname{cas}(a) \\\\operatorname{cas}(-b) - \\\\operatorname{cas}(-a) \\\\operatorname{cas}(-b). Additionally: : \\\\operatorname{cas} (a+b) = {\\\\cos (a) \\\\operatorname{cas} (b)} + {\\\\sin (a) \\\\operatorname{cas} (-b)} = \\\\cos (b) \\\\operatorname{cas} (a) + \\\\sin (b) \\\\operatorname{cas}(-a) and its derivative is given by: : \\\\operatorname{cas}'(a) = \\\\frac{d}{da} \\\\operatorname{cas} (a) = \\\\cos (a) - \\\\sin (a) = \\\\operatorname{cas}(-a).

PSFS was founded in December 1816, the first savings bank to organize and do business in the United States. The bank would develop as one of the largest savings banks in the United States and became a Philadelphia institution. Generations of Philadelphians first opened accounts as children and became lifelong depositors. The bank was organized by a group of men led by Condy Raguet, who had read about the concept of savings banks becoming popular in Great Britain. The bank quickly began to expand by adding services and branches, and moving into larger headquarters buildings. By the late 1910s, PSFS had the most depositors of any savings bank in the United States; it was second to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited. PSFS began programs in the 1920s that encouraged children to put money into savings accounts instead of spending it on treats and school programs, allowing children to open accounts with PSFS. In the 1970s, changes in the personal finance industry led to smaller banks struggling to stay open. A government solution had such banks merge with healthier ones and in 1982, the Western Savings Fund Society was merged with PSFS. The merger deal and changes in regulations allowed PSFS to expand into new business ventures. PSFS quickly began expanding into other fields such as corporate finance, mutual funds, and real estate development. In 1984 PSFS began doing business under the name Meritor Financial Group to emphasize its expansion into financial services. The new business venture led to the company losing millions of dollars; it was forced to sell off many of its subsidiaries and PSFS bank branches. Despite the effort, Meritor continued to lose money. On December 11, 1992, federal regulators seized the 176-year-old bank and placed it into the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC then sold its remaining assets to Mellon Financial for US$335 million. Mellon renamed the former PSFS branches Mellon PSFS, a name which lasted the end of 2001, when the branches were acquired by Citizens Financial Group. History Condy Raguet. =Founding= Founded in 1816, the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society was the first savings bank to organize and do business in the United States. Savings banks had existed in Europe for years and in the early 1810s had grown rapidly through Great Britain. This growth became the topic of numerous journals and pamphlets, some of which were brought to the attention of Philadelphia businessman Condy Raguet in late November 1816.A History of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society 1816 - 1916, pages 11 - 12 Interested in the idea, Raguet approached associates, Richard Peters, Clement C. Biddle and Thomas Hale on creating a similar institution in Philadelphia. A meeting was held on November 25 to discuss the plan. A total of twelve men agreed to work together to form the bank. Along with Raguet, Peters, Biddle, and Hale, the other men, called associate founders, were Charles N. Bancker, Andrew Bayard, Samuel Breck, John McCrea, William Schlatter, John C. Stocker, John Strawbridge and Roberts Vaux. Over several meetings the group figured out the bank's structure and positions. Andrew Bayard was elected the first president of the bank during the third meeting on November 28.A History of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society 1816 - 1916, pages 19 - 20, 23 - 24 The bank was named the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society because Raguet felt the name \\"bank\\" was unpopular and calling it a society would make it easier to receive a charter from the state legislature.A History of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society 1816 - 1916, page 18 The Society's 1840 headquarters On December 4, 1816, the Articles of Association, which contain the earliest written use of the name Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, were adopted. The Philadelphia Saving Fund Society (PSFS) opened two days before on December 2 in the office of the Saving Fund Society's first Secretary and Treasurer, George Billington. The office was located on the west side of South Sixth Street, between Chestnut and Market Streets.A History of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society 1816 - 1916, pages 25 - 27 Depositing five dollars, the first depositor was Curtis Roberts, Raguet's African American servant. On February 25, 1819 the Governor of Pennsylvania approved the Pennsylvania legislature's act of incorporating the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society. =Growth= PSFS grew slowly, but as early as August 1817 there were resolutions authorizing setting up branch offices outside of Philadelphia in Northern Liberties and Southwark.A History of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society 1816 - 1916, page 41 At first PSFS was open only on Mondays for receiving deposits and Thursdays for giving payments. While PSFS soon opened daily for business, deposits and payments were still only taken on those days. In 1835 PSFS expanded giving out deposits and payments on both Mondays and Thursdays, and in 1865 it was open for all business daily.Century of American Savings Banks, page 78 In 1818 PSFS issued its first home mortgage to architect William Strickland for US$7,000. That same year PSFS moved its offices to Sixth and Minor Streets. In the 1820s PSFS moved three more times, to Decatur Street in 1821 and Third and Walnut Streets in 1826. The latter office proved too small, so PSFS quickly bought its own building elsewhere on Walnut Street and moved there on October 2, 1827. By 1833 PSFS again needed more room and PSFS bought property on which the bank built a structure designed by Thomas U. Walter. PSFS moved into the new building in February 1840.A History of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society 1816 - 1916, pages 62 - 63 In 1865 PSFS again began looking for a new location and in 1866 a location was found on Seventh and Walnut Streets. Designed by architect Addison Hutton construction began in 1868 and the PSFS Headquarters building was opened for business on October 11, 1869. Forced to expand even more, additions were later made in 1885-86 by Hutton and in 1897-98, designed by Frank Furness., p.62A History of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society 1816 - 1916, pages 76 - 77 The Society's 1869 headquarters =20th century= By 1917 the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society had the largest number of depositors of any savings bank in the United States and was second to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited.Century of American Savings Banks, page 83 In 1923 PSFS began the first in-school banking program at William Penn School for Girls. The program was intended to teach children to save by allowing them to deposit money at the bank. In junior high schools PSFS had students work as tellers to collect and record deposits. PSFS also provided a separate counter just for student accounts at their headquarters. The School Accounts Counter included step stools for the youngest depositors. The program helped several generations of Philadelphians open up accounts as children, leading many to become lifelong customers. Another way PSFS taught children to save money in savings banks was a program that produced pageants for playgrounds and settlement houses. The pageants included songs about thriftiness set to popular music, cheers, speeches that quoted historical figures' opinions on thriftiness, and a play. In the plays, costumed children warned the audience about spending money on treats, movies, and penny arcades instead of putting the money in a savings bank where it would grow.Raising consumers: Children and the American Mass Market in the Early Twentieth Century, pages 65 - 67 By the end of the 1920s PSFS was the third largest savings bank in the United States and in 1935 was ranked thirty-fourth largest savings bank in the world. In 1932 PSFS built a new headquarters building on Market Street. The new PSFS Building was the first international style skyscraper built in the United States. The modern skyscraper was designed by George Howe and William Lescaze and is topped with the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society's initials in red neon letters. The PSFS Building In 1948 PSFS was the second largest savings bank in the United States with deposits totaling US$594,460,363. In the 1960s PSFS, along with three other Philadelphia savings banks, established a US$20 million pool to finance mainly low and moderate income minority families. =Expansion and crisis= The United States in the 1970s saw numerous changes to personal finance such as the advent of credit cards, money-market funds and automated teller machines. These changes resulted in a crisis for traditional community banks. The crisis prompted the government to step in with a solution to force mergers between troubled banks and healthy banks such as PSFS. In April 1982 PSFS merged with the Western Savings Fund Society, receiving US$294 million in assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The merger gained PSFS US$2 billion in assets. FDIC also credited PSFS with US$800 million in \\"supervisory goodwill\\". The deals also allowed the merged banks to expand into new business ventures. PSFS soon began expanding into new services such as equipment leasing, corporate finance and real estate development. In September 1983 PSFS converted from a mutual organization to a stock organization selling 35 million shares at US$11.25 each. In January 1984 PSFS began expanding into financial service by buying a loan portfolio and mortgage business from General Electric Credit Corp. for US$568 million. In April 1985 the company acquired four savings and loans in Florida and began paying five cents per share quarterly dividend to stockholders. In September of that year, PSFS began doing business under the name Meritor Financial Group to emphasize its expansion into financial services. In 1986 Meritor began operating mutual funds through a subsidiary, completing the transition to a full-service financial institution. In 1986, the bank went to the U.S. Supreme Court to defend itself against a claim sexual harassment. In Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, the court found the bank liable under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Things soon took a turn for the worse as the company began losing millions through its new business ventures as its competitors began encroaching on Meritor's home market. Meritor's stock prices continuously dropped from almost the moment they were first issued. In August 1985 Meritor revealed it invested $215 million in a Virginia mortgage company that went bankrupt and in October 1987 Meritor halts its dividend after announcing a third-quarter loss of $379.6 million. That same month the company also announced plans to sell some of its operations. PSFS Building's banking hall In January 1988 venture capitalist Frank Slattery bought 5.5 percent of Meritor's stock, becoming the controlling shareholder. Slattery began pushing for changes and in June, with help from others, was able to demote chairman and CEO Frederick S. Hammer to president and replace him with Roger S. Hillas. To try to stanch the losses Hillas sold Meritor's credit-card portfolio and some of its subsidiaries. Continuing to lose money, Meritor sold 54 suburban branches of PSFS, more than half of its branches, to Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank for US$335 million in 1989. The deal, which included selling Mellon Bank the right to use the name PSFS, shed US$4.9 billion in assets from Meritor. Earlier that year an extra \\"s\\" was added to the word \\"Saving\\" in the bank branches' name, becoming the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society. When the deal went into effect in 1990 Meritor turned off the PSFS on the PSFS Building saying it was inappropriate to use the sign. Turning off the sign provoked protest from the public, historians and architecture buffs and Meritor and Mellon Bank agreed to relight the sign. Despite the effort, conditions continued to deteriorate for Meritor and other banks around the United States. Not helping matters was a poor commercial real-estate market that left Meritor with empty Philadelphia office buildings and half-finished suburban strip shopping malls valued at fractions of their original cost. In February 1991 regulators demanded higher capital standards which Meritor failed to meet. A few months later in August, Meritor ending a troublesome dispute with bondholders by giving up 37 percent of its common stock plus cash to redeem US$115 million in debt. By October 1992 bank analysts had listed Meritor among institutions most likely to be seized by the end of the year. In the next month worried depositors withdrew more than US$100 million from PSFS branches, and on December 4 Meritor sold off its Florida-based savings and loan subsidiary, the company's last out-of- state banking operation. On December 11, 1992, regulators placed Meritor into the receivership of the FDIC, who sold Meritor's 27 remaining branches for US$181 million to Mellon Bank. Aftermath =Mellon PSFS= After purchasing the PSFS bank branches and the PSFS name from Meritor, Mellon began operating its bank branches as Mellon PSFS. Acquiring the remainder of the PSFS branches from Meritor in 1992, Mellon continued to expand in the 1990s including the construction of combination Mellon PSFS and Acme Markets branches, the first of which opened in 1994. In 2001 Mellon PSFS had 350 branches and 650,000 customers in Pennsylvania, South New Jersey and Delaware. Mellon PSFS's parent company, Mellon Financial, was interested in abandoning its retail banking assets and focus on high income investments. On July 17 Mellon Financial announced it was selling its retail banking business, including Mellon PSFS, to Citizens Financial Group for US$2 billion. At the end of November 2001, all Mellon PSFS branches became branches of the newly formed Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania. =Lawsuit= The money Mellon Bank paid went to the FDIC, leaving Meritor's stockholders with nothing. In 1993 Slattery, who despises government interference in business, sued the FDIC, claiming regulators reneged on their 1982 promise to permit goodwill in the company's merger with Western Savings Fund Society. The lawsuit kept the stock for the now defunct company alive with speculators buying shares for as little as 5 cents with hopes of a government payout to settle the case. Most of the 55 million outstanding Meritor shares are believed to be owned by speculators or PSFS depositors who had bought shares when the company first went public. Over the next decade there was little news on the progress of the case, with a website, meritorpsfs.com, the main source of information. On August 16, 2002 a judge ruled that the FDIC was wrong in seizing Meritor and that shareholders were entitled to damages. On February 10, 2006, Meritor investors were awarded US$371.7 million, totaling US$6.75 a share. In Slattery (Meritor Savings) v. U.S., after losing before a three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit, the government petitioned for a rehearing en banc. The court has agreed to review whether the trial court had the appropriate jurisdiction to hear the breach of contract dispute. The government is further arguing that the FDIC is Non- Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI), an agency created by the executive branch that receives no funding, and will not receive any funding, from the government. The FDIC receives funding by charging banks fees to member banks. If the en banc court agrees and finds that appropriated funds may not be used to pay judgments against NAFI's, then any judgment in the Meritor Savings case will be produced by the banks regulated by the FDIC and not by Treasury dollars. In other words, the FDIC could be found to be in breach, but it would be entitled to recover the judgment by member banks. In order to find the FDIC a NAFI, the government is arguing that Congress has no obligation to honor its promises to back deposits with the full faith and credit of the United States.

Paul Robeson's remarks in Paris, 1949 Robeson had given three earlier concerts in Peekskill without incident, but in recent years Robeson had been increasingly vocal against the Ku Klux Klan and other forces of white supremacy, both domestically and internationally. Robeson specifically made a transformation from someone who was primarily a singer into a political persona with a vocal support for what were at the time considered \\"communist\\" causes, including the decolonization of Africa, anti-Jim Crow legislation, and peace with the USSR.Robeson, Susan The Whole World in His Hands: A Pictorial Biography of Paul Robeson Chapter 5, The Politics of Persecution, p. 180 Robeson had also appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities to oppose a bill that would require communists to register as foreign agents and, just months before the concerts in 1949, he had appeared at the Soviet-sponsored World Peace Conference in Paris. Referring to the growing tensions between the USA and the USSR, he stated: > We in America do not forget that it was the backs of white workers from > Europe and on the backs of millions of blacks that the wealth of America was > built. And we are resolved to share it equally. We reject any hysterical > raving that urges us to make war on anyone.

Paul Robeson, 1958, p. 179Pages From History: Paul Robeson and the Paris Peace Conference of 1949 http://www.zikkir.com/index/188568 retrieved November 17, 2010: \\"What's fascinating about that dispatch is that it turns out from my research that the AP had put the dispatch on the wires as dad was stepping up on the rostrum. So, it appeared in American evening papers before he had any idea that he had been quoted like that and it was made up out of whole cloth, not quite out of whole cloth, they used bits and pieces of speeches he'd made elsewhere on this tour, stitched them together in a way that sounded like his style of speaking, added this phrase, Negroes will not fight for the United States in a war against the Soviet Union and put it on the wires. And immediately the State Department and the machinery of government here spread this Robeson has said thus and so, he's a traitor to the country and pressured black leaders to denounce him and pledge loyalty to the United States. Many did, some didn't, but it became issue number one. Paul Robeson, Communist traitor to the US.\\" The comment was not investigated by the American press for its veracity and there was nationwide condemnation of Robeson. In the early stages of the Cold War and its accompanying wide anti-communist sentiments in the West, this statement was seen by many as very anti-American. The local paper, the Peekskill Evening Star, condemned the concert and encouraged people to make their position on communism felt, but did not directly espouse violence. The riots were explicitly racist, with the rioters shouting racist terms for African Americans and Jews, burning crosses, and lynching effigies of Robeson both in Peekskill and in other areas of the United States.Robeson, Susan The Whole World in His Hands: A Pictorial Biography of Paul Robeson Chapter 5, The Politics of Persecution, p. 182 First concert The concert, organized as a benefit for the Civil Rights Congress, was scheduled to take place on August 27 in Lakeland Acres, just north of Peekskill. Before Robeson arrived, a mob of locals attacked concert-goers with baseball bats and rocks. The local police arrived hours later and did little to intervene. Thirteen people were seriously injured, Robeson was lynched in effigy and a cross seen burning on an adjacent hillside. The concert was then postponed until September 4.Ford, Carin T.

Robeson's longtime friend and Peekskill resident, Helen Rosen, who had agreed to collect Robeson at the train station, had heard on the radio that protesters were massing at the concert grounds. Robeson drove with Rosen and two others to the concert site and saw marauding groups of youngsters, a burning cross on a nearby hill and a jeering crowd throwing rocks and chanting \\"Dirty Commie\\" and \\"Dirty Kikes.\\"Duberman, Martin.

The Joint Veterans Council of Peekskill refused to admit any involvement, describing its activities as a \\"protest parade... held without disorder and... perfectly disbanded.\\" Peekskill police officials said the picnic grounds had been outside their jurisdiction; a state police spokesman said there had never been a request for state troopers. The commander of Peekskill Post 274 of the American Legion stated: \\"Our objective was to prevent the Paul Robeson concert and I think our objective was reached.\\"Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson Peekskill, p. 366 =Meetings to protest the first riot= Following a meeting of local citizens, union members, and Robeson supporters who formed \\"The Westchester Committee for Law and Order\\", it was unanimously determined that Robeson should be invited back to perform at Peekskill. Representatives from various left wing unions - the Fur and Leather Workers, the Longshoremen and the United Electrical Workers - all agreed to converge and serve as a wall of defense around the concert grounds. Ten union men slept on the property of the Rosens, effectively guarding it. A call was then put out by the \\"Emergency Committee to Protest the Peekskill Riot.\\" On Tuesday, August 30, an overflow crowd of three thousand people assembled peacefully and without incident at the Golden Gate Ballroom in Harlem to hear Robeson speak,Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson Peekskill, p. 367 Second concert The rescheduled September 4, 1949 concert itself was free from violence, though marred by the presence of a police helicopter overhead and the flushing out of at least one sniper's nest. The concert was located on the grounds of the old Hollow Brook Golf Course in Cortlandt Manor, near the site of the original concert. Twenty thousand people showed up. Security was organized by the Communist Party and Communist dominated labor unions. The men were directed by the Communist Party and some unions to form a line around the outer edge of the concert area and were sitting with Robeson on the stage. They were there to fight any protestors who objected to Robeson's presence. They effectively kept the local police from the concert area. The musicians performed without incident. =Setlist= * Sylvia Kahn: \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\"Blecha, Peter. Taboo Tunes: A History of Banned Bands & Censored Songs, p. 146\\\\.

The beating was captured on film and can be seen in the 1970s documentary The Tallest Tree in Our Forest and the Oscar- winning, Sidney Poitier-narrated documentary Paul Robeson: Tribute to an Artist. Despite recorded evidence of the beating, no one was ever prosecuted for the assault. Graphic photos of Eugene Bullard being beaten by two policemen, a state trooper and concert-goer were later published in Susan Robeson's pictorial biography of her grandfather, The Whole World in His Hands: a Pictorial Biography of Paul Robeson.Robeson, Susan. Paul Robeson:The whole World in His Hands Chapter 5, The Politics of Persecution, pp. 182‚Äì183 =Protests afterwards= Following the riots, more than 300 people went to Albany to voice their indignation to Governor Thomas Dewey, who refused to meet with them, blaming communists for provoking the violence.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, Peekskill, p. 367. Twenty-seven plaintiffs filed a civil suit against Westchester County and two veterans' groups. The charges were dismissed three years later. =Reactions in the U.S. House of Representatives= Following the Peekskill riots, Democratic House Representative John E. Rankin of Mississippi condemned Robeson on the house floor. When Republican New York Congressman Jacob Javits spoke to the United States House of Representatives, deploring the Peekskill riots as a violation of constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and free assembly,Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, Peekskill, p. 373. Rankin replied angrily. \\"It was not surprising to hear the gentlemen from New York defend the Communist enclave,\\" Rankin bellowed, saying that he wanted it known that the American people are not in sympathy \\"with that Nigger Communist and that bunch of Reds who went up there.\\" On a point of order, American Labor Party House Representative Vito Marcantonio protested to House Speaker Sam Rayburn that \\"the gentlemen from Mississippi used the word 'nigger.' I ask that the word be taken down and stricken from the RECORD inasmuch as there are two members in this house of Negro race.\\" Rayburn claimed that Rankin had not said \\"nigger\\" but \\"Negro\\" but Rankin yelled over him saying \\"I said Niggra! Just as I have said since I have been able to talk and shall continue to say.\\"United States Congressional Record, September 21, 1949, p. 13375, Speaker Rayburn then defended Rankin, ruling that \\"the gentlemen from Mississippi is not subject to a point of order... referred to the Negro race and they should not be afraid of that designation.\\"United States Congressional Record, September 21, 1949, p. 13375 Then Democratic Representative Edward E. Cox of Georgia denounced Robeson on the House floor as a \\"Communist agent provocateur.\\" =Aftermath= Within a few days, hundreds of editorials and letters appeared in newspapers across the nation and abroad, by prominent individuals, organizations, trade unions, churches and others. They condemned not only the attacks but also the failure of Governor Dewey and the State Police to protect the lives and property of citizens, and called for a full investigation of the violence and prosecution of the perpetrators. Despite condemnation from progressives and civil rights activists, the mainstream press and local officials overwhelmingly blamed Robeson and his fans for \\"provoking\\" the violence. Following the Peekskill riots, other cities became fearful of similar incidents, and over 80 scheduled concert dates of Robeson's were canceled. On September 12, 1949, in response to Robeson's controversial status in the press and leftist affiliations, the National Maritime Union convention considered a motion that Robeson's name be removed from the union's honorary membership list. The motion was withdrawn for lack of support among members. Later that month, the All-China Art and Literature Workers' Association and All-China Association of Musicians of Liberated China protested the Peekskill attack on Robeson. On October 2, 1949, Robeson spoke at a luncheon for the National Labor Conference for Peace, Ashland Auditorium, Chicago, and referenced the riots. Legacy and reconciliation ceremonies In recent years, Westchester County has gone to great lengths to make amends to the survivors of the riots by holding a commemorative ceremony, at which an apology was made for their treatment. In September 1999, county officials held a \\"Remembrance and Reconciliation Ceremony, 50th anniversary commemoration of the 1949 Peekskill riots.\\" It included speakers Paul Robeson, Jr., folk singer Peter Seeger and several local elected officials.\\"Paul Robeson Remembrance and Reconciliation Ceremony,\\" 50th anniversary commemoration of the 1949 ‚ÄúPeekskill riots‚Äù in Cortlandt, Westchester County, NY, includes speakers Paul Robeson, Jr., folk singer Peter Seeger and several local elected officials.

He joined the navy aged 25 years, seeing action against Algerian pirates before leaving and joining the merchant navy where he traded until the Glorious Revolution of 1688, whereupon he returned to the Royal Navy and was commissioned. Benbow fought against France during the Nine Years War (1688‚Äì97), serving on and later commanding several English vessels and taking part in the battles of Beachy Head, Barfleur and La Hogue in 1690 and 1692. He went on to achieve fame during campaigns against Sal√© and Moor pirates; laying siege to Saint-Malo; and fighting in the West Indies against France during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714). Benbow's fame and success earned him both public notoriety and a promotion to admiral. He was then involved in an incident during the Action of August 1702, where a number of his captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of the captains involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture.  Family and early years  Benbow was born the son of William and Martha Benbow. The astrologer John Partridge recorded the exact time and date of his birth as being at noon on 10 March 1653, and this is the date used by the National Museum of the Royal Navy, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and the local historical accounts of Joseph Nightingale published in 1818.Nightingale, pp. 167‚Äì175. A biography within an 1819 publication of The Gentleman's Magazine, however, records in a short biography entitled Life and Exploits of Admiral Benbow by D. Parkes that he was born in 1650, as does the 1861 Sea kings and naval heroes by John George Edgar.Edgar, pp. 206‚Äì214. Edgar records that Benbow's father died when Benbow was very young, while Parkes' account describes his father as being in the service of the Army under Charles I and not dying until Benbow was in his teens. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica writes that Benbow's father was in fact a tanner. Meanwhile, his uncle, Thomas, was executed by Charles I. Both Parkes and the National Museum of the Royal Navy concur that Benbow was born in Coton Hill in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and Nightingale asserts that the death of both uncle and father, and the family's association with Charles I in the years following his execution, ensured that the \\"family were brought very low.\\" Benbow's lack of possessions, Nightingale writes, turned him to a career at sea.  Naval career  = Early years = Benbow entered the Royal Navy on 30 April 1678, aged 25 years. He became master's mate aboard the 64-gun under the command of Captain Arthur Herbert, whilst she was fitting out at Portsmouth. He sailed with her to the Mediterranean, where Herbert was promoted to the rank of vice- admiral whilst serving under the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, Admiral Sir John Narborough.le Fevre, pp. 22‚Äì27. During this period the English fleet was often in action against the Barbary pirates of North Africa that were actively preying upon European shipping. Rupert herself captured an Algerine warship in 1678, which was later commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Tiger Prize. Benbow distinguished himself well in a number of actions against the Algerine vessels, and won Herbert's approval. On Narborough's return to England, Herbert was appointed acting commander-in-chief, and made Benbow master aboard on 15 June 1679.Stephen, p. 211. Nonsuch would remain at Tangiers and off the African coast and had a number of successive captains who would go on to achieve flag rank, including George Rooke, Cloudesley Shovell and Francis Wheler. All were impressed by Benbow, and would afterwards help to advance his career. Nonsuch was next in action on 8 August 1681, this time against the Algerine warship Golden Horse. Golden Horse had been engaged by , under the command of Captain William Booth, and when Nonsuch arrived on the scene Golden Horse surrendered.Allen, pp. 76‚Äì81. A dispute then arose over the question of the prize money and how it should be shared out, and comments were made amongst Nonsuchs crew against those of Adventure. Benbow's repetition of these eventually came to Booth's knowledge, and the captain brought a court- martial against Benbow, however this revealed that Benbow had only been repeating these words rather than being their originator. Benbow was ordered to forfeit three months' pay, amounting to ¬£12 15s., to Adventures crew, and to \\"ask Captain Booth's pardon on board His Majesty's ship Bristol, declaring that he had no malicious intent in speaking those words; all the commanders being present, and a boat's crew of each ship's company\\". = Merchant trading = Nonsuch then returned to England and was paid off on 9 November 1681. Benbow left the Royal Navy and entered the merchant service, sailing a merchant vessel from London and Bristol to ports in Italy and Spain. By 1686 he was a \\"tough merchant seaman\\" and the owner and commander of a frigate named Benbow, trading with the Levant. In May 1687 he commanded a merchant vessel, Malaga Merchant,Clowes, p. 460. and was aboard her when she was attacked by a Sal√© pirate. He mounted a successful defence and beat off the attack. It was claimed afterwards that he cut off and salted the heads of thirteen Moors who were slain aboard his ship, and then took them into Cadiz to claim a reward from the magistrates.Campbell, p. 206. A Moorish skull-cap, \\"coated with varnish and set in silver\\" and bearing the inscription \\"First adventure of Captain John Benbow, and gift to Richard Ridley, 1687\\" is referred to in 1844 by Charles Dickens in Bentley's Miscellany where he speaks of Shrewsbury's history, and the 1885 Dictionary of National Biography also relates the story.Stephen, p. 208. = Return to the Navy = Thomas Phillips (left), John Benbow (centre) and Sir Ralph Delaval (right). The three had been important figures in British fleet operations against the north coast of France during 1692‚Äì93. Benbow only returned to the Royal Navy after the Glorious Revolution in 1688. His first recorded commission was to the post of third lieutenant of on 1 June 1689, under the command of Captain David Mitchell. His first command came on 20 September of that year, when he was appointed captain of . He was transferred to on 26 October and then to on 12 November. Benbow's next post was as Master Attendant of Chatham Dockyard. He then moved to become Master Attendant at Deptford Dockyard in early March 1690, a post he intermittently held for the next six years. He was master of HMS Sovereign in summer 1690, under his old commander Arthur Herbert, now Lord Torrington. He was assigned to act as master of the fleet, and took part in the English defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head. After the defeat, a Royal Commission was held into the circumstances that led to it. Benbow was highly regarded as a specialist in both navigation and pilotage, and his evidence given in July 1690 to the preliminary investigation strongly favoured his old patron, Torrington. He did not however testify during Torrington's court- martial in December that year.Stephen, p. 172. Benbow continued aboard Sovereign throughout 1691, and by the summer of 1692, was again master of the fleet, this time under Admiral Edward Russell, then aboard Britannia. Benbow worked closely with his old colleague David Mitchell, then serving as Russell's first captain, and Josiah Burchett, Russell's clerk. Benbow may have advised Russell to take the Gull Passage inside the Goodwin Sands to the Downs, where they linked up with the Dutch forces.Aubrey, p. 82. Benbow served as master of the fleet during the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue. After the battles, Benbow returned to Deptford to resume his duties as master attendant, spending a brief period at Portsmouth Dockyard helping to oversee repairs to the fleet.Merriman, p. 37 He had already had his pay upgraded to that of a master attendant, he was now to be paid as a master, in addition to his master attendant's wage, presumably as an acknowledgement of his special services. = With the bomb flotillas = Benbow returned to active naval service in September 1693, joining Thomas Phillips, the second engineer of the ordnance, in jointly commanding a flotilla of bomb vessels to attack Saint-Malo. Benbow went aboard the 48-gun and began the bombardment on 16 November.Stephen, p. 214. It continued intermittently until 19 November when a large fireship was sent into the harbour. An attempt was made to bring her alongside the town walls, but she ran aground, was set on fire, and exploded. Despite the failure of the initial plan, considerable damage was done, and Benbow's forces were able to take the fort on Quince Rock and disabled it, carrying artillery and prisoners away and bringing them to Guernsey.Stephen, pp. 208‚Äì214. Benbow was still dissatisfied with the overall result and initiated a court-martial against Captain Henry Tourville, accusing him of cowardice for not bringing his ship in closer. There was no conviction though, as the mortars were proved to be defective. Benbow's experience led to him being promoted to a similar flotilla, this time to be deployed against Dunkirk under the command of Vice- Admiral Shovell. A number of converted merchant vessels, rigged like fireships but designed to explode rather than burn, were assigned to support the expedition. Benbow had a hand in preparing these vessels for the operation throughout 1694, and worked closely with the principal storekeeper of the ordnance, Willem Meesters.Clowes, p. 477.Harris, p. 190. Benbow's attacking fleet was covered by Shovell's fleet on the Downs and the attack was planned for 12 and 13 September. However, the French were able to block the entrance to the port, preventing Benbow's squadron from entering, and a storm further disrupted operations. Benbow drew back from Dunkirk, and instead sailed around to Calais, where he carried out a further bombardment on 27 September. He returned to the Downs and then resumed his duties at Deptford Dockyard. He spent December organising a convoy for a fleet of merchant vessels due to sail to Cadiz. = Rise to admiral = Benbow as an admiral, engraved by John Chapman and published in 1797 Benbow was soon at sea again in March 1695, being appointed commander-in-chief of His Majesty's ships which were then off the coast of France. His squadron was highly successful, taking a number of French merchants in early April and bringing them to England as prizes. Benbow was recommended by Lord Berkeley, who had served with Benbow at Saint-Malo, to be promoted to rear-admiral at the next opportunity, and in the meantime he was appointed to the command of the 70-gun . He was soon joined by a volunteer ‚Äì his then fourteen-year-old son ‚Äì also named John Benbow. Benbow then sailed with Berkeley and the Dutch lieutenant-admiral Philips van Almonde to Saint- Malo, intending to operate against privateering operations being conducted from the area. Benbow moved to command , to direct the inshore operations of ten English and Dutch warships, nine English bomb vessels, and seventeen small boats and vessels.Clowes, pp. 477‚Äì480. They began operations on their arrival off Saint-Malo on 4 July, remaining in action until evening the next day when they withdrew, without having achieved any decisive result. Several houses had been destroyed for the damage and loss of a few of the bomb vessels. Benbow was given eight bomb vessels and seven or eight frigates and was dispatched down the coast. He attacked Granville on 8 July, shelling it with over 900 bombs over several hours, and departed having set the town ablaze. = Public and private reception = The outcome of the operations had left Benbow in a tense relationship with his immediate superiors. Berkeley had been accused of excessive timidity in his actions, which it was believed had led to the failure of the attack on Dunkirk. Benbow on the other hand was widely lauded for his fearless inshore attacks with his bomb vessels.Stephen, pp. 208‚Äì211. Berkeley wrote on 28 July: > As to Captain Benbow, I know of no difference between him and me, nor have > we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called in some of > the foolish printed papers ‚Äòthe famous Captain Benbow‚Äô, I suppose has put > him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in > some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but > time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an > ungrateful man. However the Admiralty approved of Benbow's conduct and ordered him \\"to be paid as Rear-Admiral during the time he has been employed this summer on the coast of France ... as a reward for his good service.\\" Benbow was then appointed to the grand committee of sixty men to oversee the plans for Greenwich Hospital in December 1695, but the issue dragged on until 1 May 1696. The Admiralty again stepped in and Benbow was finally promoted and appointed commander-in- chief of the squadron before Dunkirk as \\"Rear-Admiral of the Blue for the duration of this present expedition\\" and moved aboard the 70-gun .Matthew, pp. 50‚Äì68. His orders were to protect English and Dutch shipping, especially from the squadron of the privateer Jean Bart. Bart was mostly successful in evading pursuit however, usually escaping into Dunkirk when Benbow's force drew near. Benbow was appointed to command a squadron in the Soundings in December 1696.Stephen, p. 87. He carried out a number of cruises between March and August 1697, protecting allied trade and escorting the West Indian and Virginian merchant fleets into port. These activities marked the last English naval expedition of the war. He also carried out reconnaissance activities on the French fleet in port in Brest in July, before resuming patrol operations off Dunkirk, this time in concert with a number of Dutch ships under Rear- Admiral Philips van der Goes, until the end of the war in September 1697.Treves, pp. 289‚Äì295. = Appointment to the West Indies = Benbow was made commander-in-chief of the King's ships in the West Indies on 9 March 1698 and instructed to tackle the issue of piracy. He sailed in November, the first leg taking him from Portsmouth to Madeira. Sailing under his protection from the Sal√© pirates was Paramore, under Edmond Halley, then sailing to the North Atlantic to carry out experiments to observe magnetic variations. Benbow finally reached Barbados in February 1699, and moved to the Spanish Main aboard his flagship, the 60-gun . He threatened the governor of Cartagena with a blockade, and so compelled him to restore two English merchant ships that he had detained.Stephen, p. 453. These ships had been intended to take part in an expedition against the Scottish Dari√©n scheme. Without the ships, this became impossible and the colonists were saved for the time being. This was counter to the English government's desire to see the end of the Scottish colonising efforts, and in June Benbow and the other West Indies governors received orders \\"not to assist the Scotch colony in Darien.\\"Stephen, p. 209. Benbow then sailed as far north as Newfoundland in order to drive the pirates away, but they evaded capture. Benbow returned to England in the summer of 1700, and was appointed to the command of a fleet in the Downs. Benbow served there until summer 1701, under the command of Admiral Sir George Rooke. He was promoted to rear-admiral of the red on 14 April, followed by vice-admiral of the blue on 30 June. He then flew his flag in the 70-gun . = Spanish treasure fleet, West Indies, the Action of 1702 = With the peace becoming increasingly uneasy, the English government became concerned over the possible fate of the Spanish silver fleet, due to arrive in European waters from America. They were worried that the French would intercept the ships and use the treasure for war preparations. Benbow was issued secret instructions to find the fleet, and then \\"to seize and bring them to England, taking care that no embezzlement be made\\".Japikse, pp. 477‚Äì9 Benbow's squadron was detached on 2 September and sailed for the West Indies, arriving on 14 November, and was at the Jamaica Station in mid-December.Cundall, p. xx He remained there for several months, being joined on 8 May 1702 by several vessels under Captain William Whetstone. Whetstone was made Rear-Admiral under Benbow, who had been promoted to Vice-Admiral of the White on 19 January 1702 By now, the War of the Spanish Succession had broken out, and news of its declaration reached Benbow on 7 July. He detached Whetstone and six ships to search off Port St Louis in Hispaniola for a French squadron under Admiral Jean du Casse, which he believed would call at the port on his voyage to Cartagena, and from there he might raid English and Dutch shipping. After Whetstone had left, Benbow took his squadron and sailed for Cartagena, anticipating that either he or Whetstone would find Du Casse and bring him to battle. The legend of 'Brave Benbow', \\"Adml Benbow courageously commanding his Men to fight after his Leg was shattered to Pieces, St Martha (West Indies) 19‚Äì24 July 1702.\\" By the time that Whetstone had reached Hispaniola, Du Casse had already departed. Benbow's force subsequently sighted the French on 19 August, sailing off Cape Santa Marta. The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns, while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns. The English forces were heavily scattered, and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup. They did not achieve a form of collective order until four in the afternoon, after which a partial engagement was fought, lasting about two hours, until nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily break off. The action quickly revealed a breakdown in discipline amongst Benbow's captains. He had intended that the 64-gun under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow decided to take the lead himself, and Breda pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron. Ruby was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action at two in the morning on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on Breda from astern and pounding her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke his leg and he was carried below.James, p. 57. Benbow was determined to continue the pursuit, despite his wounds and despite Captain Kirkby's arrival on board, attempting to persuade Benbow to abandon the pursuit. Benbow summoned a council of war, and the other captains agreed, signing a paper drafted by Kirkby which declared that they believed \\"that after six days of battle the squadron lacked enough men to continue and that there was little chance of a decisive action, since the men were exhausted, there was a general lack of ammunition, the ships' rigging and masts were badly damaged, and the winds were generally variable and undependable.\\" They recommended breaking off the action and following the French to see if the situation improved. Benbow had \\"seen the cowardly behaviour of some of them before, [and] had reason to believe that they either had a design against him or to be traitors to their country if an opportunity happened that the French could have destroyed the Admiral\\". He, therefore, ordered the squadron to return to Jamaica. On their arrival, he ordered the captains to be imprisoned, awaiting a trial by court-martial. Benbow received a letter from du Casse after the engagement: > Sir, > I had little hopes on Monday last but to have supped in your cabin: but it > pleased God to order it otherwise. I am thankful for it. As for those > cowardly captains who deserted you, hang them up, for by God they deserve > it. > Yours, > Du Casse. = Trial of the captains = Acting Rear-Admiral Whetstone returned to Port Royal, having spent 62 days cruising off Hispaniola, and preparations were made for the trial. Before it could begin, Captain Thomas Hudson died, who had commanded . The remaining captains appeared at the court-martial which convened on Breda, held between 19 and 23 October. Due to his injuries, Benbow passed to Whetstone the role of presiding over the court, but he was present at the trial. The court found Captain Kirkby of and Cooper Wade of guilty of breach of orders, neglect of duty, and the \\"ill signed paper and consultation ... which obliged the Admiral ... to give over the chase and fight\\", and condemned them to be shot. John Constable of was found guilty of breach of orders and drunkenness and was cashiered. Samuel Vincent of Falmouth and Christopher Fogg of Breda were initially sentenced to be cashiered for signing the six captains' resolution, but Benbow personally declared that they had fought bravely, and their sentences were remitted by the Lord High Admiral. The sentences were deferred so that Queen Anne could have a chance to examine the proceedings. After her consideration in January 1703, she allowed the sentences to proceed and Constable, Kirkby, and Wade were returned to England as prisoners. Constable was imprisoned until 1704, when the Queen pardoned him. Kirkby and Wade were shot aboard on 16 April 1703 while she was anchored in Plymouth Sound under Captain Edward Acton.Trevelyan, pp. 252‚Äì253. Controversy slowly began to develop over the events of August 1702. Supporters of the disgraced Kirkby and Wade sought to discredit Benbow by publishing their own account of the action.Woodman, p. 48.  Death and burial  Admiral Benbow's tomb in the Parish Church, Kingston, Jamaica Benbow died at Port Royal, Kingston, Jamaica on 4 November 1702. Whetstone reported that the cause of death was \\"the wound of his leg which he received in battle with Monsieur Du Casse, it never being set to perfection, which malady being aggravated by the discontent of his mind, threw him into a sort of melancholy which ended his life as before.\\" He was buried on 16 November in the chancel of St Andrew's Church, Kingston. A marble slab was later laid over the grave, emblazoned with a coat of arms and inscribed: > Here lyeth the Body of John Benbow, Esq., Admiral of the White, a true > pattern of English Courage, who lost his life in Defence of his Queene & > Country, November the 4th, 1702, In the 52nd year of his age, by a wound in > his Legg. Received in an Engagement with Monsr. Du Casse; being Much > Lamented.Verrill, p. 282. Secretary of State Lord Nottingham wrote to Benbow in January 1703, before news of his death had reached London, to inform him that the queen was \\"extremely well pleased with your conduct and much offended with the baseness of those officers who deserted and betrayed you.\\" Meanwhile, the cabinet was preparing to promote him to vice-admiral of the white and to dispatch him to transport troops to Newfoundland. Personal life and legacy Benbow married a woman named Martha (died 1722) after his return to England in 1681. The couple had at least seven children, including daughter Martha and sons Richard and John. Another son Solomon was baptised in 1686 but died in infancy.Laughton, p. 200. There are also records of two more sons named Richard who were born in Kent, and another daughter named Katherine. Son John went on to serve in the Royal Navy. The family lived in the parish of St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. In 1709, Katherine married Paul Calton of Milton, Berkshire, where Benbow is said to have stayed in the 1690s. According to Parish Records William Benbow son of Admiral John Benbow was buried at St Nicholas Parish Church, Deptford, Kent (now SE London) on 7 April 1729. One of the admiral's granddaughters married the Rev. John Simpson, who commissioned the current Stoke Hall, Derbyshire, following his acquisition of the estate upon their marriage. =Unruly behaviour= Benbow signed a three-year lease on Sayes Court in June 1696, a house belonging to diarist John Evelyn.Welcher, pp. 130‚Äì133. Six months later, Evelyn wrote to a friend complaining, \\"I have let my house to Captain Benbow, and have the mortification of seeing everyday much of my former labours and expenses there impairing for want of a more polite tenant.\\"Evelyn, p. 359. In January 1698, Tsar Peter of Russia arrived in London to study British shipbuilding and seamanship. He and his entourage were provided with Sayes Court to reside in during their stay by William III. The Russians spent three months in London before leaving to tour the country. Benbow promptly asked for reparations from the Treasury, in order to be able to reimburse Evelyn and recover his own losses. He complained that the Russians had caused considerable damage to his house, with \\"much of the furniture broke, lost or destroyed\\".Morfill, p. 143. Christopher Wren was instructed to survey the property and declared it \\"entirely ruined\\". Benbow lost \\"twenty fine paintings\\" and \\"several fine draughts and other designs relating to the Sea\\" from his personal property. The Treasury eventually allowed payment of ¬£350 9s. 6d. in compensation.Cross, p. 25. =\\"Brave Benbow\\"= An engraving produced in 1804 that helped to promote the legend of the event, entitled The gallant Benbow defeating the French Squadron. It shows Benbow's leg as completely shot away. Underneath another hand has written Benbow gives chase to de Grasse. Benbow's fame led to his name entering popular culture. A monument by sculptor John Evan Thomas was erected in 1843 by public subscription in St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury commemorating Benbow as \\"a skillful and daring seaman whose heroic exploits long rendered him the boast of the British Navy and still point him out as the Nelson of his times.\\"Pidgeon, p. 85. A 74-gun ship of the line and two battleships were named . Robert Louis Stevenson named a tavern the \\"Admiral Benbow\\", where Jim Hawkins and his mother live, in his romantic adventure novel Treasure Island. He also titled the first chapter \\"The Old Sea Dog at the Admiral Benbow\\".Watson, pp. 25‚Äì27. There are a number of real life Admiral Benbow public houses around the world, and other institutions have also borne his name.Maxwell, p. 59. The incident of August 1702 also took hold on the popular imagination, and was celebrated in an alehouse song: > Come all you seamen bold and draw near, and draw near, Come all you seamen > bold and draw near. It's of an Admiral's fame, O brave Benbow was his name, > How he fought all on the main, you shall hear, you shall hear. Brave Benbow > he set sail For to fight, for to fight Brave Benbow he set sail for to > fight. Brave Benbow he set sail with a fine and pleasant gale But his > captains they turn'd tail in a fright, in a fright.

Its musical theme forms one of the three arrangements on which English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams based his Sea Songs, originally arranged for military band in 1923 as the second movement of his English Folk Song Suite,Timothy Reynish, notes for British Wind Band Classics, Chandos Records 9697, 1999 and subsequently re-arranged for full orchestra in 1942 by the composer.Philip Lane, notes for British Light Miniatures, Naxos 8.570332 (released 2007) Another song has survived from the period with different air and rhythm but also known as Admiral Benbow, and it is often sung by folksingers. It begins We sailed from Virginia and thence to Fayal.

Brook of Sorek), also Soreq, is one of the largest, most important drainage basins in the Judean Hills.Protecting The Environment It is mentioned in the Book of Judges 16:4 of the Bible as the border between the ancient Philistines and the Tribe of Dan of the ancient Israelites. It is known in Arabic as Wadi es-SarƒÅr, sometimes spelled Surar, and by various names along different segments, such as Wadi Qalunya near Motza, Wadi al-Tahuna, and Nahr Rubin further downstream. Etymology The Midrash (Numbers Rabbah 9) states that the sorek is a \\"fruitless tree\\" (the word ◊®◊ô◊ß req means \\"empty\\" in Hebrew), implying a moral lesson and metaphor suggesting that Samson's involvement in his affair with Delilah was eventually \\"fruitless\\". However, another etymology suggests that \\"sorek\\" means \\"special vine\\" and refers to the grapes and wines grown in the area. In the Hebrew Bible Nahal Sorek was the place where Delilah lived, and Samson came to meet her for the first time. It was also the place she enticed him to tell her the secret of his strength, and where he was eventually captured by the Philistines: Land property along the river In 1921, lands that bounded Nahal Sorek (Wadi es Surar / Wad Issarar) which passed to the south of Artuf were designated as \\"Mara land,\\" meaning, pasture land reserved primarily for the use of the adjoining villages.Israel Government Archives (Land Registry Office of Jerusalem - Register of Deeds), p. 39 (Mandatory Organizations); letter written by M. Doukhan, Advocate, on 19 January 1941. \\"Mara lands,\\" same as \\"Arazi Metruk√©\\" in the Ottoman Land Code, of which there were two kinds: the first being \\"pasture land\\" that has been allotted to a village or number of villages, and which cannot be cultivated or turned into private property or belong to individuals (Art. 97 of the Ottoman Land Code). Such lands were used principally as pasture land for grazing; the second being \\"pasture land\\" that was privately owned, and which could be used for general cultivation, such as ploughing and sowing (Article 5 of the Law of Disposition of Immovable Property of the year 1913 (1331)), without the necessity of obtaining special authority. Road and railway Remains of the Nahal Sorek Railway Station In the 19th century, Nahal Sorek served as an important connection between the two major cities in the area, Jaffa and Jerusalem. Because railways at the time were reliant on water sources, several surveyors who planned the first railway in the Middle East, the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem line, decided to use Nahal Sorek as the main route for the line. The line was inaugurated in 1892, following Nahal Sorek until its junction with the Valley of Rephaim, after which it follows the Valley of Rephaim into Jerusalem. While the Tel Aviv-to- Jerusalem high-speed railway line, which is expected to open for passenger service in the fourth quarter of 2018, is designed to avoid the Nahal Sorek route and shorten the line, the older railway along Nahal Sorek has been refurbished and remains in use. It connects the country's two largest cities and its main international airport, running in an westerly-easterly direction between Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport, Lod, Ramla, Beit Shemesh and Jerusalem. However, today the rail line mainly serves as a scenic route used by tourists. Several small water reservoirs exist along its route, notably near Tal Shahar and Yesodot. Waterfalls are located on several of its tributaries, including Ayanot Dekalim in Beit Shemesh, Ein Sifla on Nahal HaMe'ara, and others. Nature Reserve The Nahal Sorek Nature Reserve, first declared in 1965, and since expanded, spans over 11000 dunams, from the Avshalom Cave Nature Reserve near Beit Shemesh, to moshav Nes Harim. Desalination plants Near the mouth of the Sorek River are two large seawater desalination plants, Palmachim and Sorek, the latter being, when used at full capacity, the largest of its kind in the world (as of 2013).Sales, Ben (May 30, 2013) With desalination, a once unthinkable water surplus is possible.

It is at the south-east corner of Clew Bay, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean on the west coast of Ireland. Westport is a popular tourist destination and scores highly for quality of life. It won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition three times in 2001, 2006 and 2008. In 2012 it won the Best Place to Live in Ireland competition run by The Irish Times. The design for the town was commissioned in the 1780s by the John Browne of the nearby stately home, Westport House, as a place for his workers and tenants to live. John Browne cleared the original village of Cahernamart, that had 700 inhabitants, to make way for his gardens at Westport House.Antiquities of West Mayo\\", Christiaan Corlett, pp87 & Cathair na Mart No 26 2008, Journal of the Westport Historical Society, pp124 The current town centre was originally designed by William Leeson in 1780, in the Georgian architectural style.William Leeson Its layout follows the medieval principles of urban design introduced by the Normans in the 13th century. A particular feature is the incorporation of the river into the composition, contained for two blocks by low stone walls producing, on each side of the river, tree lined promenades (The Mall) with several stone bridges over the river Carrow Beg. The famous pilgrimage mountain of Croagh Patrick, known locally as \\"the Reek\\", lies some 10 km west of the town near the villages of Murrisk and Lecanvey. The mountain forms the backdrop to the town. History The Clock Tower in the town centre Westport originates and gets its name, in Irish, from a 16th-century castle - Cathair na Mart (meaning \\"the stone fort of the beeves\\" or \\"the city of the fairs\\") - and surrounding settlement, belonging to the powerful local seafaring √ì M√°ille clan, who controlled the Clew Bay area, then known as Umaill. The original village of Cathair na Mart existed somewhere around what is now the front (east) lawn of Westport House. It had a high street, alleys down to the river and a population of around 700.Peadar O'Flanagain \\"An Outline History of the Town of Westport\\" Cathair na Mart Journal A small port also existed at the mouth of the Carrowbeg river. Roads lead from the village to the west (West Road), the south (Sandy Hill Road) and the east (Old Paddock Road). The town was moved to its present site in the 1780s by the Browne family of Westport House to make way for their gardens and was renamed Westport. Westport is designated as a heritage town and is unusual in Ireland in that it is one of only a few planned towns in the country. A feature of his town plan is the tree-lined boulevard, the Mall, built on the Carrowbeg River. James Wyatt finished Westport House, the stately home of the Marquess of Sligo and designed its dining room.James Wyatt Westport House was originally built by Richard Cassels (also known as Richard Castle), the German architect, in the 1730s, near the site of the original √ì M√°ille Castle.Richard Castle Since the late 20th century, Westport has expanded with several new housing estates. Some of these include Springfield, the Carrowbeg Estate, Horkans Hill, Cedar Park, Fairways, Knockranny Village and Sharkey Hill. Westport House Westport House 2008 Designed by the famous architects Richard Cassels and James Wyatt in the 18th century, Westport House is situated in a parkland setting with a lake, terraces, gardens and views overlooking Clew Bay, the Atlantic Ocean, Achill, Clare Island and Ireland's Holy Mountain, Croagh Patrick. In October 2015 it was revealed that the Westport House Estate was in the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) for debts secured on the 380 acre estate, but not the house, for almost 10 million Euros. In January 2017, it was announced that a local family had purchased the house and grounds. In 2007 the privately owned estate received a grant of 1.34 million Euros for repairs to Westport House, from the state funded Heritage Council. The previous owners, the Browne family, are direct descendants of wealthy slave plantation owners in Jamaica, Howe Peter Browne (2nd Marquess of Sligo) and his wife Lady Sligo (Hester Catherine De Burgh), as well as the 16th-century pirate, Gr√°inne N√≠ Mh√°ille, Queen of Umaill. An exhibition at Westport House styles Howe Peter Browne as 'Champion of the Slaves',http://www.westporthouse.ie/westport-house- and-gardens/exhibitions/ a suggestion that one historian refers to as 'hyperbole', pointing out that \\"Browne benefited from slavery from the cradle to the grave and did not free his slaves until the institution of slavery was abolished by an act of parliament\\" and that Howe Peter Browne also claimed, and received, substantial compensation from the British government for the loss of his slaves. The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the Siege of Limerick, and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was N√≠ Mh√°ille's great-great granddaughter. The house then did not have the lake or a dam, and the tide rose and fell against the walls.Westport House A Brief History published by Westport House 2008 Demographics Between the censuses of 2011 and 2016, the town showed a limited growth from 5,543 to 6,198 inhabitants.

There are several different devices a physician may use to perform the procedure, including the traditional metal devices, endoscopic banding, and the CRH O'Regan System. With rubber band ligation, a small band is applied to the base of the hemorrhoid, stopping the blood supply to the hemorrhoidal mass. The hemorrhoid will shrink and die within a few days with shriveled hemorrhoidal tissue and band falling off during normal bowel movements - likely without the patient noticing. Rubber band ligation is a popular procedure for the treatment of hemorrhoids, as it involves a much lower risk of pain than surgical treatments of hemorrhoids, as well as a shorter recovery period (if any at all). It is a very effective procedure and there are multiple methods available. When done with the CRH O‚ÄôRegan System, it is also associated with a recurrence rate of 5% at 2 years. The procedure is typically performed by gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, and general surgeons. History Ligation of hemorrhoids was first recorded by Hippocrates in 460 BC, who wrote about using thread to tie off hemorrhoids. In modern history, ligation using rubber band was introduced in 1958 by Blaisdell and refined in 1963 by Barron, who introduced a mechanical, metal device called the Barron ligator (similar to the McGivney). Dr. Patrick J. O‚ÄôRegan, a laparoscopic surgeon, invented the disposable CRH O‚ÄôRegan System. In 1997, the ligator was approved by the FDA for the treatment of hemorrhoids. Procedure Rubber band ligation procedure is as follows: #Pre-treatment diagnosis and prescribed medications #*A physician diagnoses the condition of hemorrhoids during a colonoscopy, or an anoscopy/proctoscopy #Preparation #*RBL does not require any patient preparation #Positioning #*The patient is generally placed on a proctology table in the kneeling position or, less commonly, on the left side on an exam table, with knees drawn up (fetal position) #Application of the band #*With traditional RBL, a proctoscope is inserted into the anal opening. The hemorrhoid is grasped by forceps and maneuvered into the cylindrical opening of the ligator. The ligator is then pushed up against the base of the hemorrhoid, and the rubber band is applied. Reusable instruments have also been available for many decades to use suction rather than forceps to draw tissue into the instrument so the rubber band can be deployed. #*The CRH O'Regan ligation system also eliminates the use of forceps. It is much more expensive on a per-case basis than the reusable suction ligator. It is rarely used by full-time colon and rectal surgeons (Proctologists), but recently has been adopted by many Gastroenterologists to increase the revenue to their practice. The device applies gentle suction which allows the doctor to place a small rubber-band around the base of the hemorrhoid. Three banding sessions are typically required at 2 week intervals for a complete treatment. More bands can be applied if the patient is under general anesthetic, although the recovery time may be prolonged and be more painful. Complications Possible complications from rubber band ligation include: *Pain *Bleeding *Infection and pelvic sepsis *Thrombosed hemorrhoids *Non-healing ulcer Post-procedure instructions for patients *In some cases, patients may experience some bleeding, especially after bowel movements, up to 2 weeks after the banding (though this may be from the untreated hemorrhoids as well). This may last for several days or more. If the patient thinks it is severe or persistent (more than one tablespoon of blood), the patient should contact their doctor immediately. *Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) can be taken for any discomfort the patient may feel (typically a feeling of fullness in the rectum). Ibuprofen should be avoided. A warm bath for about 10 minutes, 2-3 times a day, may help. *No heavy lifting or strenuous activities the day of the procedure (and up to 4 days in some cases). *A stool softener such as Surfak is recommended once a day for about 3 days. Stool softeners are available over the counter at any drug store. *Patient should avoid straining to have a bowel movement. If patient does not succeed at first, he/she should try getting in a warm bath for about 10 minutes. *In order to avoid constipation, a fiber supplement should be taken daily while increasing water intake to 8 glasses daily (circa 2 liter/ 4 pints).

The city was founded in 43 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus. It served as the capital of the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis and was an important city in the western half of the Roman Empire for centuries. Two emperors, Claudius and Caracalla, were born in Lugdunum. In the period AD 69‚Äì192 the city's population may have numbered 50,000 to 100,000, and possibly up to 200,000 inhabitants. The original Roman city was situated west of the confluence of the Rh√¥ne and Sa√¥ne, on the Fourvi√®re heights. By the late centuries of the empire much of the population was located in the Sa√¥ne River valley at the foot of Fourvi√®re. Name The Roman city was founded as Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as Lugdunum (and occasionally LugudunumCassius Dio, Roman History, 46.50.4) by the end of the 1st century AD. During the Middle Ages, Lugdunum was transformed to Lyon by natural sound change. Lugdunum is a latinization of the Gaulish *Lugudunon, meaning \\"Fortress (or hill) of (the god) Lugus\\" or, alternately \\"Fortress of the champion\\" (if *lugus is a common noun cognate with Old Irish lug \\"warrior, hero, fighter\\"). The Celtic god Lugus was apparently popular in Ireland and Britain as is found in medieval Irish literature as Lug(h) and in medieval Welsh literature as Lleu (also spelled Llew). According to Pseudo-Plutarch, Lugdunum takes its name from an otherwise unattested Gaulish word lugos, that he says means \\"raven\\" (Œ∫œåœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±), and the Gaulish word for an eminence or high ground (œÑŒøœÄŒøŒΩ Œ≠ŒæŒ≠œáŒøŒΩœÑŒ±), dunon.Delattre, Charles (ed.), Pseudo-Plutarque. De fluviorum et montium nominibus et de iis quae in illis inveniuntur, Presses Univ. Septentrion, 2011, pp. 109-111. An early interpretation of Gaulish Lugduno as meaning \\"Desired Mountain\\" is recorded in a gloss in the 9th-century Endlicher's Glossary,Lugduno - desiderato monte: dunum enim montem Lugduno: \\"desired mountain\\"; because dunum is mountain\\"Endlicher Glossary but this may in fact reflect a native Frankish speaker's folk-etymological attempt at linking the first element of the name, Lugu- (which, by the time this gloss was composed, would have been pronounced lu'u, the -g- having become silent) with the similar-sounding Germanic word for \\"love\\", *luŒ≤.Toorians, Lauran, ‚ÄúEndlicher‚Äôs Glossary, an attempt to write its history‚Äù, in: Garc√≠a Alonso (Juan Luis) (ed.), Celtic and other languages in ancient Europe (2008), pp. 153‚Äì184. Another early medieval folk-etymology of the name, found in gloss on the Latin poet Juvenal, connects the element Lugu- to the Latin word for \\"light\\", lux (luci- in compounds) and translates the name as \\"Shining Hill\\" (lucidus mons).Lugdunum est civitas Gallie quasi lucidum dunam, id est lucidus mons, dunam enim in Greco mons.Andreas Hofeneder, Die Religion der Kelten in den antiken literarischen Zeugnissen: Sammlung, √úbersetzung und Kommentierung, Volume 2, Austrian Academy of Sciences Press, 2008, pp. 571-572. Pre-Roman settlements and the area before the founding of the city Archeological evidenceMathieu Poux, Hugues Savay- Guerraz, Lyon avant Lugdunum, Infolio √©ditions, 2003, 151 p. () shows Lugdunum was a pre-Gallic settlement as far back as the neolithic era, and a Gallic settlement with continuous occupation from the 4th century BC. It was situated on the Fourvi√®re heights above the Sa√¥ne river. There was trade with Campania for ceramics and wine, and use of some Italic-style home furnishings before the Roman conquest. Gaul was conquered for the Romans by Julius Caesar between 58 and 53 BC. His description, De Bello Gallico, is our principal written source of knowledge of pre-Roman Gaul, but there is no specific mention of this area. Founding of the Roman city In 44 BC, ten years after the conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar was assassinated and civil war erupted. According to the historian Cassius Dio, in 43 BC, the Roman Senate ordered Munatius Plancus and Lepidus, governors of central and Transalpine Gaul respectively, to found a city for a group of Roman refugees who had been expelled from Vienne (a town about 30 km to the south) by the Allobroges and were encamped at the confluence of the Sa√¥ne and Rh√¥ne rivers. Dio Cassius says this was to keep them from joining Mark Antony and bringing their armies into the developing conflict. Epigraphic evidence suggests Munatius Plancus was the principal founder of Lugdunum. Lugdunum seems to have had a population of several thousand at the time Roman foundation. The citizens were administratively assigned to the Galerian tribe. The aqueduct of the Monts d'Or, completed around 20BC, was the first of at least four aqueducts supplying water to the city. Within 50 years Lugdunum increased greatly in size and importance, becoming the administrative centre of Roman Gaul and Germany. By the end of the reign of Augustus, Strabo described Lugdunum as the junction of four major roads (the Via Agrippa): south to Narbonensis, Massilia and Italy, north to the Rhine river and Germany, northwest to the sea (the English Channel), and west to Aquitania. Antoninianus struck under Florianus in Lugdunum mint. The proximity to the frontier with Germany made Lugdunum strategically important for the next four centuries, as a staging ground for further Roman expansion into Germany, as well as the \\"de facto\\" capital city and administrative centre of the Gallic provinces. Its large and cosmopolitan population made it the commercial and financial heart of the northwestern provinces as well. The imperial mint established a branch in 15 BC, during the reign of Augustus, and produced coinage for the next three centuries (see picture). Attention from the Emperors Ancient Theatre of Fourvi√®re In its 1st century, Lugdunum was many times the object of attention or visits by the emperors or the imperial family. Agrippa, Drusus, Tiberius, and Germanicus (born himself in Lugdunum) were among the gubernatorial generals who served in Lugdunum. Augustus is thought to have visited at least three times between 16 and 8 BC. Drusus lived in Lugdunum between 13 and 9 BC. In 10 BC his son Claudius (the future emperor) was born there. Tiberius stopped in Lugdunum in 5‚Äì4 BC, on his way to the Rhine, and again in 21 AD, campaigning against the Andecavi. Caligula's visit in 39‚Äì40 was longer, stranger, and better documented by Suetonius. Claudius and Nero also contributed to the city's importance and growth. In 12 BC, Drusus completed an administrative census of the area and dedicated an altar to his stepfather Augustus at the junction of the two rivers. Perhaps to promote a policy of conciliation and integration, all the notable men of the three parts of Gaul were invited. Caius Julius Vercondaridubnus, a member of the Aedui tribe, was installed as the first priest of the new imperial cult sanctuary, which was subsequently known as the Junction Sanctuary or the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls. The altar, with its distinctive vertical end poles, was engraved with the names of 60 Gallic tribes, and was featured prominently on coins from the Lugdunum mint for many years. The \\"council of the three Gauls\\" continued to be held annually for nearly three centuries, even after Gaul was divided into provinces. Amphith√©√¢tre des Trois-Gaules in Lyon Southeastern Gaul became increasingly Romanized. By 19 AD at least one temple, and the first amphitheater in Gaul (now known as the Amphith√©√¢tre des Trois-Gaules) had been built on the slopes of the Croix-Rousse hill. In 48 AD, emperor Claudius asked the Senate to grant the notable men of the three Gauls the right to accede to the Senate. His request was granted and an engraved bronze plaque of the speech (the Claudian Tables) was erected in Lugdunum. Today, the pieces of the huge plaque are the pride of the Gallo-Roman Museum in Lyon. Suetonius reported Caligula's visit to Lugdunum in 39-40 AD at the beginning of his third consulate as characteristic of his reign. Spectacles were staged at the amphitheater to honor and entertain him and his guest, Ptolemy, king of Mauretania (whom Caligula later had murdered). A rhetoric contest was held in which the losers were required to expunge their work with their tongues. He auctioned furniture brought from the palace in Rome, assigning prices and purchasers. When Caligula wanted to get rid of Herod Antipas, King of Judaea, he sent him to exile in Lugdunum. Claudius was born in Lugdunum in 10 BC and lived there for at least two years. As emperor, he returned in 43 AD en route to his conquest of Britain and stopped again after its victorious conclusion in 47. A fountain honoring his victory has been uncovered. He continued to take a supportive interest in the town, making the notables of the town eligible to serve in the Roman Senate, as described above. During Claudius' reign, the city's strategic importance was enhanced by the bridging of the Rh√¥ne river. Its depth and swampy valley had been an obstacle to travel and communication to the east. The new route, termed the compendium, shortened the route south to Vienne and made the roads from Lugdunum to Italy and Germany more direct. By the end of his reign, the city's official name had become Colonia Copia Claudia Augusta Lugudunenisium, abbreviated CCC AVG LVG. Nero also took an interest in the city. Citizens of Lugdunum contributed four million sesterces to the recovery after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. In reciprocal appreciation, Nero contributed the same amount to the rebuilding of Lugdunum after a similarly devastating fire a few years later. Although the destructiveness of the fire is described in a letter from Seneca to Lucilius,Epistulae ad Lucilium, 91. archeologists have not been able to uncover a confirmatory layer of ash. The Lyonnais admiration of Nero was not universally shared; tyranny, extravagance, and negligence fostered resentment, and coups were planned. In March 68 AD, a Romanized Aquitainian named Caius Julius Vindex, who was governor of Gallia Lugdunensis led an uprising intended to replace Nero with Galba, a Roman governor of Spain. The citizens of Vienne, however, responded more enthusiastically than the Lyonnais, most of whom remained loyal to Nero. A small force from Vienne briefly besieged Lugdunum, but withdrew when Vindex was defeated by the Rhine legions a few weeks later at Vesontio. Despite the defeat of Vindex, rebellion grew. Nero committed suicide in June and Galba was proclaimed emperor. The loyalty of Lugdunum to Nero was not appreciated by his successor, Galba, who punished some of Nero's supporters by confiscations of property. In another turnabout for Lugdunum, Galba's policies were immediately unpopular, and in January, 69 AD, the Rhine legions quickly threw their support to Vitellius as emperor. They arrived at friendly Lugdunum, where they were persuaded by the Lyonnais to punish nearby Vienne. Vienne quickly laid down weapons and paid a \\"ransom\\" to forestall plundering. Meanwhile, Vitellius arrived in Lugdunum, where, according to Tacitus, he formally declared himself Imperator, punished unreliable soldiers, and celebrated with feasts, and with games in the amphitheater. Fortunately for Lugdunum, the would-be emperor and his army hurried into Italy, defeated Otho, and was in turn defeated by Vespasian and the army of the East, bringing the chaos of the Year of the Four Emperors to an end. Despite a lack of imperial visits for most of the next century, Lugdunum prospered, until Septimius Severus and the Battle of Lugdunum (see below) brought devastation in 197 AD. Growth and prosperity in the first centuries of the Empire Aqueduct of the Gier In the 2nd century, Lugdunum prospered and grew to a population of 40,000 to 200,000 persons.See the magazinz L'Express n¬∞3074 Four aqueducts brought water to the city's fountains, public baths, and wealthy homes. The aqueducts were well engineered and included several siphons. It continued to be a provincial capital with additional government functions and services such as the mint and customs service. Lugdunum had at least two banks and became the principal manufacturing center for pottery, metal working, and weaving in Gaul. Lyonnais terra cotta, pottery and wine were traded throughout Gaul, and many other items were crafted for export. The city itself was run by a \\"senate\\" of decurions (the ordo decurionum) and a hierarchy of magistrates: quaestors, aediles, and duumvirs. The social classes of the time consisted of the decurions at the top, who could aspire to Senate status, followed by the knights (equites), and the Augustales, six of whom were in charge of the municipal imperial cult. This latter status was the highest distinction to which a wealthy freedman could aspire. Many of the wealthy merchants and craftsmen were freedmen. Below them were the workmen and slaves. The Rh√¥ne and Sa√¥ne rivers were navigable, as were most of the rivers of Gaul, and river traffic was heavy. The Lyonnais company of boatmen (nautae) was the largest and \\"most honored\\" in Gaul. Archeological evidence suggests the right bank of the Sa√¥ne had the largest concentration of wharves, quays and warehouses. Lyonnais boatmen dominated the wine trade from Narbonensis and Italy, as well as oil from Spain, to the rest of Gaul. The heavy concentration of trade made Lugdunum one of the most cosmopolitan cities of Gaul, and inscriptions attest to a large foreign-born population, especially Italians, Greeks, and immigrants from the oriental provinces of Asia Minor and Syria-Palestine. There is evidence of numerous temples and shrines in Lugdunum. Traditional Gallic gods like mallet-bearing Sucellus and the mother goddesses called the Matres (depicted with cornucopiae) continued to be worshiped somewhat syncretistically along with the Roman gods. Additional religious cults came with the oriental immigrants, who brought the eastern mystery religions to the Rh√¥ne valley. A major shrine of the Phrygian goddess Cybele was built in nearby Vienne, and she also seems to have found special favor in Lugdunum in the late 1st century and 2nd century. Christianity and the first martyrs The cosmopolitan hospitality to eastern religions may have allowed the first attested Christian community in Gaul to be established in Lugdunum in the 2nd century, led by a bishop Pothinus (:fr:Pothin de Lyon)‚Äîwho probably was Greek. In 177 it also became the first in Gaul to suffer persecution and martyrdom. The event was described in a letter from the Christians in Lugdunum to counterparts in Asia, later retrieved and preserved by Eusebius. There is no record of a cause or a triggering event but mob violence against the Christians in the streets culminated in a public interrogation in the forum by the tribune and town magistrates. The Christians publicly confessed their faith and were imprisoned until the arrival of Legate of Lugdonensis, who gave his authority to the persecution. About 40 of the Christians were martyred - dying in prison, beheaded, or killed by beasts in the arena as a public spectacle. Among the latter were Bishop Pothinus, Blandina, Doctor Attalus, Ponticus, and the deacon Sanctus of Vienne. Their ashes were thrown into the Rh√¥ne. Nevertheless, the Christian community either survived or was reconstituted, and under Bishop Irenaeus it continued to grow in size and influence. Battle of Lugdunum The 2nd century ended with another struggle for imperial succession. The emperor Pertinax was murdered in 193, and four generals again \\"contended for the purple\\". Two of the rivals, Clodius Albinus and Septimius Severus, initially formed a political alliance. Albinus was a former legate of Britannia and commanded legions in Britain and Gaul. Septimius Severus commanded the Pannonian legions, and led them successfully against Didius Julianus near Rome in 193, and defeated Pescennius Niger in 194. Severus consolidated his power in Rome and broke his alliance with Albinus. The Senate supported Severus and declared Albinus a public enemy. Clodius Albinus had settled with his army near Lugdunum early in 195. There, he had himself proclaimed Augustus and made plans to counter Severus. Under his control, the Lugdunum mint issued coins celebrating his \\"clemency\\", as well as one dedicated to the \\"Genius of Lugdunum.\\" He was joined by an army under Lucius Novius Rufus, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis. They successfully attacked the German troops of Virius Lupus but were unable to deter them from supporting Severus. Severus brought his army from Italy and Germany toward the end of 196. The armies fought an initial, inconclusive engagement at Tinurtium (Tournus), about 60 km up the Sa√¥ne from Lugdunum. Albinus retreated with his forces toward Lugdunum. On the 19th of February, 197, Severus again attacked Clodius Albinus to the northwest of the city. Albinus' army was defeated in the bloody and decisive Battle of Lugdunum. Dio Cassius described 300,000 men involved in the battle: although this was one of the largest battles involving Roman armies known, this number is assumed to be an exaggeration. Albinus committed suicide in a house near the Rh√¥ne; his head was sent to Rome as a warning to his supporters. His defeated cohorts were dissolved and the victorious legions punished those in Lugdunum who had supported Albinus, by confiscation, banishment, or execution. The city was plundered or at least severely damaged by the battle. Legio I Minervia remained camped in Lugdunum from 198 to 211. Decline of Lugdunum and the Empire Historical and archeological evidence indicates that Lugdunum never fully recovered from the devastation of this battle. A major reorganization of imperial administration begun at the end of the 3rd century during the reign of Diocletian and completed a few decades later by Constantine further reduced the importance of Lugdunum. This reorganization standardized size and status of provinces, splitting many of the larger. The new provinces were grouped in larger administrative districts. Lugdunum became the capital of a much smaller region containing only two cities besides Lugdunum: Autun and Langres. The new governor bore the title of consularis. The mint was retained at Lugdunum, as was an administrative tax office and a state-run wool clothing factory. Lugdunum was no longer the chief city and administrative capital of Gaul. Although the city continued, there seems to have been a population shift from the Fourviere heights where the original Roman city was situated to the river valley below. Other evidence suggests other cities surpassed Lugdunum as trading centers. Though the Western Empire persisted another century and a half, the border regions extending along the Rhine River in Germany to the Danube River in Dacia became far more important from a military and strategic standpoint. Cities like Augusta Treverorum (Trier) eclipsed Lugdunum in importance. The status of the western provinces declined further when Constantine made Byzantium (later named Constantinople after his death) the capital of the Eastern part of the Empire. As the Western Empire disintegrated in the 5th century, Lugdunum became the principal city of the Burgundian kingdom. See also * History of Lyon * Abascantus References Sources *Dio Cassius.

STS-29  Bagian training to use the IMAX camera prior to STS-29. Bagian first flew on the crew of STS-29, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, aboard the Orbiter Discovery, on March 13, 1989. During this highly successful five- day mission, the crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a Space Station -heat pipe\\" radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment, and a chromosome and plant cell division experiment. Bagian was the principal investigator and performed Detailed Supplementary Objective 470 which described, by the use of transcranial Doppler, the changes of cerebral blood flow and its relationship to Space Adaptation Syndrome (SAS) and Space Motion Sickness (SMS). Bagian was the first person to treat SMS with the drug Phenergan by intramuscular injection. This represented the first successful treatment regimen for SMS and has now been adopted by NASA as the standard of care for the control of SMS in Shuttle crews and is routinely used. In addition, the crew took over 3,000 photographs of the Earth using several types of cameras, including the IMAX 70 mm movie camera. Mission duration was 80 orbits and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on March 18, 1989. With the completion of this mission, he logged over 119 hours in space.  STS-40  Bagian served as the Lead Mission Specialist on the crew of STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences, the first dedicated space and life sciences mission, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 5, 1991. SLS-1 was a nine-day mission during which crew members performed experiments that explored how the heart, blood vessels, lungs, kidneys, and hormone-secreting glands respond to microgravity, the causes of space sickness, and changes in muscles, bones, and cells which occur in humans during space flight. Other payloads included experiments designed to investigate materials science, plant biology and cosmic radiation. In addition to the scheduled payload activities on STS-40, Bagian was successful in personally devising and implementing repair procedures for malfunctioning experiment hardware which allowed all scheduled scientific objectives to be successfully accomplished.

During Joseph Stalin's rule (1922‚Äì1953), many places, mostly cities, in the Soviet Union and other communist countries were named or renamed in honour of him as part of the cult of personality surrounding him.

Every subset of a compact topological space is relatively compact (since a closed subset of a compact space is compact). And in an arbitrary topological space every subset of a relatively compact set is relatively compact. Every compact subset of a Hausdorff space is relatively compact. In a non-Hausdorff space, such as the particular point topology on an infinite set, the closure of a compact subset is not necessarily compact; said differently, a compact subset of a non-Hausdorff space is not necessarily relatively compact. In the case of a metric topology, or more generally when sequences may be used to test for compactness, the criterion for relative compactness becomes that any sequence in has a subsequence convergent in . Some major theorems characterize relatively compact subsets, in particular in function spaces. An example is the Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem. Other cases of interest relate to uniform integrability, and the concept of normal family in complex analysis. Mahler's compactness theorem in the geometry of numbers characterizes relatively compact subsets in certain non-compact homogeneous spaces (specifically spaces of lattices). The definition of an almost periodic function at a conceptual level has to do with the translates of being a relatively compact set. This needs to be made precise in terms of the topology used, in a particular theory. As a counterexample take any neighbourhood of the particular point of an infinite particular point space. The neighbourhood itself may be compact but is not relatively compact because its closure is the whole non-compact space. Every compact subset of a (possibly non-Hausdorff) topological vector space is complete and relatively compact.  See also  * Compactly embedded * Totally bounded space  References  * page 12 of V.

It succeeded the Ferrari F355 and was replaced by the Ferrari F430 in 2005.  Development history  Ferrari partnered with Alcoa to produce an entirely new all-aluminium space-frame chassis that was 40% stiffer than its predecessor's which had utilized steel. The design was 28% lighter despite a 10% increase in overall dimensions. Along with a lightweight frame the new Pininfarina body styling deviated from traditions of the previous decade's sharp angles and flip-up headlights. The new V8 engine utilises a 3.6-litre capacity, a flat-plane crankshaft, and titanium connecting rods. The engine generates a power output of . According to Ferrari, weight was reduced by and the 0 to acceleration time improved from 4.7 to 4.5 seconds. The first model to be produced was the 360 Modena, followed later by the 360 Spider and a special edition, the Challenge Stradale. The Challenge Stradale was the high- performance road-legal version of the 360 produced by the factory, featuring carbon ceramic brakes (from the Enzo), track-tuned suspension, aerodynamic gains, weight reduction, power improvements and revised gearbox software among its track-focused brief. There were 8,800 Modenas and 7,565 Spiders produced worldwide. There were 4,199 built for the US market‚Äî1,810 Modenas (coupes) and 2,389 Spiders (convertibles). Of those numbers, there were only 469 Modenas and 670 Spiders that were produced with a gated 6-speed manual transmission as opposed to the \\"F1\\" single-clutch automated manual transmission. In addition to this were the low-volume factory race cars and a one-off Barchetta variant. The race cars were all derived from the 360 Modena and for the first time produced as a separate model in their own right (compared to being a retrofit kit in previous years). While the Barchetta was based on the Spider variant. The first race car was the 360 Modena Challenge, used in a one-make series; the factory-built racing cars were prepared by the official tuner, Michelotto, who also developed the 360 N-GT. The N-GT was a 360 Challenge car evolved even further to compete in the FIA N-GT racing class alongside other marques such as Porsche. Road models =Modena= The first model of the 360 to be produced was the Modena, named after the town of Modena, the birthplace of Enzo Ferrari. Transmission choice ranges from 6-speed manual transmission, or the electrohydraulic-actuated \\"F1\\" automated manual transmission. The 360 Modena went into production in 1999 and remained in production until 2005 when it was replaced by the F430. The Modena was followed two years later by the 360 Spider, Ferrari's 20th road-going convertible which at launch overtook sales of the Modena. Other than weight, the Spider's specifications matched those of the Modena almost exactly. =Spider= The Ferrari 360 Spider was unveiled at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show. The 360 was designed with a convertible variant in mind; since removing the roof of a coupe reduces the torsional rigidity, the 360 was built for strength in other areas. Ferrari designers strengthened the sills, stiffened the front of the floorpan and redesigned the windscreen frame. The rear bulkhead had to be stiffened to cut out engine noise from the cabin. The convertible's necessary dynamic rigidity is provided by additional side reinforcements and a cross brace in front of the engine. Passenger safety is ensured by a strengthened windscreen frame and roll bars. The 360 Spider displays a curvilinear waistline. The fairings imply the start of a roof, and stable roll bars are embedded in these elevations. Due to use of light aluminium construction throughout, the Spider weighs in only heavier than the coup√©. As with the Modena version, its V8 generating a power output of is on display under a glass engine cover. The engine ‚Äî confined in space by the convertible's top's storage area ‚Äî acquires additional air supply through especially large side air intakes. The intake manifolds were moved towards the centre of the engine between the air supply conduits in the Spider's engine compartment, as opposed to lying apart as with the Modena. In terms of performance, the 0- acceleration time was slightly slower due to the slight weight increase, and the top speed was reduced. Despite the car's mid-mounted V8 engine, the electrically operated top is able to stow into the compartment when not in use. The convertible top was available in black, blue, grey and beige colours.

The car bears heavy resemblance to its donor with the only differences being the removal of the soft top system and roll bars, different engine cover and the addition of a visor in place of a windshield for better airflow over the car. Performance of the car remains the same as its donor and the car features Argento Nurburgring exterior paint with red pinstriping. The interior is black leather with cream fabric and features fabric seats with matching stitching, the words 360 Barchetta embroidered on the dashboard and a paddle-shift gearbox. =Challenge Stradale= Inspired by the 360 Modena Challenge racing car series, the Challenge Stradale is the track focused iteration of the 360 Modena. The focus in development of the car was primarily on improving its track performance credentials by concentrating on handling, braking and weight reduction characteristics, which are essential in pure racing cars. Ferrari engineers designed the car from the outset with a goal of 20% track day use in mind and 80% road use. With only a small improvement in engine power from the Modena (and boasting an improved power- to-weight ratio), the Challenge Stradale accelerates from 0 to in 4.1 seconds according to Ferrari. Systematic improvements were achieved to the setup and feel of the whole car; throttle response from the digital throttle was ratcheted up and feedback through the steering wheel was enhanced. Ceramic brakes borrowed from the Enzo, some lower weight parts and a FHP handling pack, enabled the Challenge Stradale to claim a 3.5 second improvement per lap of its Fiorano Circuit compared to the Modena. In total, the Challenge Stradale is up to lighter than the standard Modena if all the lightweight options are specified such as deleted radio, lexan (plexiglass) door windows and Alcantara fabric (instead of the leather option). As much as was saved by lightening the bumpers, stripping the interior of its sound deadening and carbon mirrors and making the optional Modena carbon seats standard. Resin Transfer Moulding was utilised for the bumpers and skirts, a carry over from the Challenge cars which resulted in lighter bumpers than those on the Modena. The engine and transmission weight was lightened by through the use of a smaller, lighter weight sports exhaust back box and valved exit pipes. The Challenge Stradale also got Brembo carbon ceramic brakes as standard (which later became standard fitment on the F430) which shaved off the curb weight and improved handling by reducing unsprung weight and completely eliminating brake fade. Cars fitted with the centre console stereo option, sub speaker box behind the seats and glass side windows re-gained approximately over the best selected options.

It was only available with the electrohydraulic-actuated automated manual transmission. At the time of launch, Ferrari claimed the 360 Modena Challenge accelerated from 0 to in 3.9 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the standard 360 Modena F1) and could corner and brake significantly faster than the road car due to added aerodynamic elements. Brembo racing provided the upgraded Gold coloured calipers and larger floating 2-piece discs, while Bosch provided the race-oriented ABS software. The exhaust system was lightened substantially and was one of the main contributions to the increased power output over the standard engine (as ignition mapping was claimed to virtually be the same). For the road cars (even the Challenge Stradale) Ferrari used a valve system that made the car more socially acceptable at lower revs (and therefore able to pass drive-by noise tests). Less than 200 were made and marketed by Ferrari as a pure race car, requiring purchasers to enter the Ferrari F360 Challenge into the Ferrari Challenge race series as a condition of sale. Unlike the previous Challenge race series, which utilised an F355 road car with a dealer-installed 'challenge upgrade' kit, the 360 Modena Challenge was a factory-built track car. The enhanced driving characteristics and substantial weight reduction meant the car could comfortably outperform its road-going counterpart even though power from the 3.6-litre engine was claimed to be similar. The 360 Modena Challenge featured a stripped-down race-oriented interior with the stereo, electric windows and locks, soundproofing, airbags, air-conditioning, and even the handbrake removed. The seats and restraints were replaced by a single carbon-fibre racing seat and FIA approved restraint harnesses, and a roll cage was fitted for safety along with a fire suppression system.

It was the fastest version of the Ferrari 360 with the engine generating a power output of over when derestricted. The 360 N-GT was capable of a top speed of around with a 0- acceleration time of around 3 seconds. It was the final car built through a Ferrari-Michelotto collaboration. The car is still raced internationally with success to this day. The most recent major victory achieved by a 360 Michelotto was by SB Race Engineering at the 2011 Britcar Championship, where the 360 N-GT, as on many occasions, outperformed the newer F430 GT. In 2002, a 360 N-GT was driven in the Australian Nations Cup Championship for GT style cars. Run by Prancing Horse Racing to replace the teams 360 Challenge and driven by highly successful Australian race driver John Bowe, the car would eventually place 3rd in the 2002 championship.

Team JMB Giesse raced the cars during the 2001 FIA GT Championship season and won the N-GT Cup for Drivers and the N-GT Cup for Teams. From 2002‚Äì2004, Ferrari produced and sold 20 360 GTs to customers through their Corse Clienti department. The 3.6-litre V8 engine was tuned to generate a power output of which was a significant improvement over the 360 Challenge cars. Significant additional weight reduction efforts were taken over the regular 360 Challenge cars such as lightening the wiring loom (saving 7 kg alone) as well as removing all unnecessary weight like air-conditioning brackets and doors which were now made from one-piece of carbon fibre along with the front compartment lid. The Final results of all the weight reduction in the 360 GT's kerb weight was over the 360 Challenge cars (1,070 kg or 2,354 lbs). Ballast was used to bring the car back up to the regulation limit of . =360 GTC= 360 GTC The Ferrari 360 GTC has been developed to replace the previous 360 GT. With a kerb weight of (with ballast), it was built since 2004 by Ferrari Corse Clienti department in collaboration with Michelotto Automobili to compete in the N-GT class. It made use of recent evolutions successfully race tested on the Ferrari 360 GT, with a sequential six-speed gearbox and a further improved Magneti Marelli electronics package. The aerodynamics are substantially different from the 360 GT, given that the 360 GTC had been newly homologated by FIA/ACO from the Challenge Stradale, taking up from its basic elements: front bumper, side skirts, engine cover and double rear end. Wind tunnel research has led to a new system for the rear wing, with a notable improvement in vertical downforce. The performance of the 90-degree V8 engine has been improved in terms of fuel consumption. In 2009, a privately owned Veloqx-Prodrive Racing 360 raced de-restricted, fully tuned variations of the GT-C in endurance races around the world including; Silverstone, Sebring and Le-Mans. The original 360GT's power output was at 8,750 rpm, the GTC bettered that raising peak power to while still breathing through the mandatory air restrictors.

NASA career Selected by NASA in March 1992, Barry reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and qualified for assignment as a mission specialist on Space Shuttle flight crews. Dr. Barry has worked on primary payload development, the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), portable computing issues for Space Shuttle, Chief of Astronaut Appearances, flight clinic ombudsman, source board member for the NASA Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI), Astronaut Office representative to NASDA, the Japanese Space Agency, and a tour of duty with the Office of Biological & Physical Research, NASA Headquarters, Washington D.C. A veteran of three space flights, STS-72 (1996), STS-96 (1999), and STS-105 (2001), Barry logged over 734 hours in space, including 4 spacewalks totaling 25 hours and 53 minutes. He retired from NASA in April 2005 whereupon he started Denbar Robotics and continues to serve as president. Spaceflight experience Barry performing a spacewalk during STS-72. STS-72 Endeavour (January 11‚Äì20, 1996) was a 9-day flight during which the crew retrieved the Space Flyer Unit (launched from Japan 10-months earlier) and deployed and retrieved the OAST- Flyer. Barry performed a 6-hour, 9 minute spacewalk designed to demonstrate and evaluate techniques to be used in the assembly of the International Space Station. Mission duration was 142 Earth orbits, traveling 3.7 million miles in 214 hours and 41 seconds. On this mission, Barry and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata were the first people to play Go in space; for this achievement, Barry received the honorary award of Ni Dan rank by the Nihon Kiin making him one of only four Western Go players to receive such an award. Barry and Wakata used a special Go set, which was named Go Space, designed by Wai-Cheung Willson Chow. STS-96 Discovery (May 27 to June 6, 1999) was the first mission to dock with the International Space Station. It was a ten-day mission during which the crew delivered four tons of logistics and supplies in preparation for the arrival of the first crew to live on the station. The mission was accomplished in 153 Earth orbits, traveling 4 million miles in 235 hours and 13 minutes. Barry performed a spacewalk for 7 hours and 55 minutes.

Barry and Patrick G. Forrester performed two spacewalks totaling 11 hours and 45 minutes of EVA time. STS-105 also brought home the Expedition 2 crew. The STS-105 mission was accomplished in 186 orbits of the Earth, traveling over 4.9 million miles in 285 hours and 13 minutes. Survivor In 2006, Barry was a contestant on Survivor: Panama ‚Äî Exile Island, the 12th season of the reality competition series Survivor. He started in the older male tribe and immediately bonded with Terry Deitz due to their common flying backgrounds. When the four tribes were reduced to two, Barry and Deitz made an all-male alliance with Austin Carty and Nick Stanbury from the younger tribe. Barry also bonded with Ruth-Marie Milliman, which led to her being blindsided when she was voted out in Episode Four. He reconciled with his alliance-mates and finally revealed to Stanbury his background as an astronaut in Episode Six. When the Casaya tribe won the combined Reward/Immunity Challenge in that episode and sent Sally Schumann to Exile Island (making her immune from the Tribal Council vote), Barry's fate was sealed. Carty and Stanbury were allied, so when Deitz voted against him, Barry was voted out 3‚Äì1. Personal information Barry is married to neurobiologist and author Susan R. Barry.

The main condition is the equicontinuity of the family of functions. The theorem is the basis of many proofs in mathematics, including that of the Peano existence theorem in the theory of ordinary differential equations, Montel's theorem in complex analysis, and the Peter‚ÄìWeyl theorem in harmonic analysis and various results concerning compactness of integral operators. The notion of equicontinuity was introduced in the late 19th century by the Italian mathematicians Cesare Arzel√† and Giulio Ascoli. A weak form of the theorem was proven by , who established the sufficient condition for compactness, and by , who established the necessary condition and gave the first clear presentation of the result. A further generalization of the theorem was proven by , to sets of real-valued continuous functions with domain a compact metric space . Modern formulations of the theorem allow for the domain to be compact Hausdorff and for the range to be an arbitrary metric space. More general formulations of the theorem exist that give necessary and sufficient conditions for a family of functions from a compactly generated Hausdorff space into a uniform space to be compact in the compact-open topology; see .  Statement and first consequences  By definition, a sequence of continuous functions on an interval is uniformly bounded if there is a number such that :\\\\leftf_n(x)\\\\right \\\\le M for every function belonging to the sequence, and every . (Here, must be independent of and .) The sequence is said to be uniformly equicontinuous if, for every , there exists a such that :\\\\leftf_n(x)-f_n(y)\\\\right < \\\\varepsilon whenever for all functions in the sequence. (Here, may depend on , but not , or .) One version of the theorem can be stated as follows: :Consider a sequence of real- valued continuous functions defined on a closed and bounded interval of the real line. If this sequence is uniformly bounded and uniformly equicontinuous, then there exists a subsequence that converges uniformly. :The converse is also true, in the sense that if every subsequence of itself has a uniformly convergent subsequence, then is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. = Examples =  Differentiable functions  The hypotheses of the theorem are satisfied by a uniformly bounded sequence of differentiable functions with uniformly bounded derivatives. Indeed, uniform boundedness of the derivatives implies by the mean value theorem that for all and , :\\\\leftf_n(x) - f_n(y)\\\\right \\\\le K x-y, where K is the supremum of the derivatives of functions in the sequence and is independent of . So, given , let to verify the definition of equicontinuity of the sequence. This proves the following corollary: * Let {fn} be a uniformly bounded sequence of real-valued differentiable functions on such that the derivatives {fn‚Ä≤} are uniformly bounded. Then there exists a subsequence {fnk} that converges uniformly on . If, in addition, the sequence of second derivatives is also uniformly bounded, then the derivatives also converge uniformly (up to a subsequence), and so on. Another generalization holds for continuously differentiable functions. Suppose that the functions are continuously differentiable with derivatives . Suppose that fn‚Ä≤ are uniformly equicontinuous and uniformly bounded, and that the sequence is pointwise bounded (or just bounded at a single point). Then there is a subsequence of the converging uniformly to a continuously differentiable function. The diagonalization argument can also be used to show that a family of infinitely differentiable functions, whose derivatives of each order are uniformly bounded, has a uniformly convergent subsequence, all of whose derivatives are also uniformly convergent. This is particularly important in the theory of distributions.  Lipschitz and H√∂lder continuous functions  The argument given above proves slightly more, specifically * If is a uniformly bounded sequence of real valued functions on such that each f is Lipschitz continuous with the same Lipschitz constant : ::\\\\leftf_n(x) - f_n(y)\\\\right \\\\le Kx-y :for all and all , then there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on . The limit function is also Lipschitz continuous with the same value for the Lipschitz constant. A slight refinement is * A set of functions on that is uniformly bounded and satisfies a H√∂lder condition of order , , with a fixed constant , ::\\\\leftf(x) - f(y)\\\\right \\\\le M \\\\, x - y^\\\\alpha, \\\\qquad x, y \\\\in [a, b] :is relatively compact in . In particular, the unit ball of the H√∂lder space is compact in . This holds more generally for scalar functions on a compact metric space satisfying a H√∂lder condition with respect to the metric on .  Euclidean spaces  The Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem holds, more generally, if the functions take values in -dimensional Euclidean space , and the proof is very simple: just apply the -valued version of the Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem times to extract a subsequence that converges uniformly in the first coordinate, then a sub-subsequence that converges uniformly in the first two coordinates, and so on. The above examples generalize easily to the case of functions with values in Euclidean space.  Generalizations  = Compact metric spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces = The definitions of boundedness and equicontinuity can be generalized to the setting of arbitrary compact metric spaces and, more generally still, compact Hausdorff spaces. Let X be a compact Hausdorff space, and let C(X) be the space of real-valued continuous functions on X. A subset is said to be equicontinuous if for every x ‚àà X and every , x has a neighborhood Ux such that :\\\\forall y \\\\in U_x, \\\\forall f \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F} : \\\\qquad f(y) - f(x) < \\\\varepsilon. A set is said to be pointwise bounded if for every x ‚àà X, :\\\\sup \\\\\\\\{  f(x)  : f \\\\in \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\\\\\} < \\\\infty. A version of the Theorem holds also in the space C(X) of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space X : :Let X be a compact Hausdorff space. Then a subset F of C(X) is relatively compact in the topology induced by the uniform norm if and only if it is equicontinuous and pointwise bounded. The Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem is thus a fundamental result in the study of the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space. Various generalizations of the above quoted result are possible. For instance, the functions can assume values in a metric space or (Hausdorff) topological vector space with only minimal changes to the statement (see, for instance, , ): :Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and Y a metric space. Then is compact in the compact-open topology if and only if it is equicontinuous, pointwise relatively compact and closed. Here pointwise relatively compact means that for each x ‚àà X, the set is relatively compact in Y. The proof given can be generalized in a way that does not rely on the separability of the domain. On a compact Hausdorff space X, for instance, the equicontinuity is used to extract, for each Œµ = 1/n, a finite open covering of X such that the oscillation of any function in the family is less than Œµ on each open set in the cover. The role of the rationals can then be played by a set of points drawn from each open set in each of the countably many covers obtained in this way, and the main part of the proof proceeds exactly as above. Necessity Whereas most formulations of the Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem assert sufficient conditions for a family of functions to be (relatively) compact in some topology, these conditions are typically also necessary. For instance, if a set F is compact in C(X), the Banach space of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space with respect to its uniform norm, then it is bounded in the uniform norm on C(X) and in particular is pointwise bounded. Let N(Œµ, U) be the set of all functions in F whose oscillation over an open subset U ‚äÇ X is less than Œµ: :N(\\\\varepsilon, U) = \\\\\\\\{f  \\\\operatorname{osc}_U f < \\\\varepsilon\\\\\\\\}. For a fixed x‚ààX and Œµ, the sets N(Œµ, U) form an open covering of F as U varies over all open neighborhoods of x. Choosing a finite subcover then gives equicontinuity.  Examples  * To every function that is -integrable on , with , associate the function defined on by ::G(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t. :Let be the set of functions corresponding to functions in the unit ball of the space . If is the H√∂lder conjugate of , defined by , then H√∂lder's inequality implies that all functions in satisfy a H√∂lder condition with and constant . :It follows that is compact in . This means that the correspondence defines a compact linear operator between the Banach spaces and . Composing with the injection of into , one sees that acts compactly from to itself. The case can be seen as a simple instance of the fact that the injection from the Sobolev space H^1_0(\\\\Omega) into , for a bounded open set in , is compact. *When is a compact linear operator from a Banach space to a Banach space , its transpose is compact from the (continuous) dual to . This can be checked by the Arzel√†- Ascoli theorem. :Indeed, the image of the closed unit ball of is contained in a compact subset of . The unit ball of defines, by restricting from to , a set of (linear) continuous functions on that is bounded and equicontinuous. By Arzel√†-Ascoli, for every sequence in , there is a subsequence that converges uniformly on , and this implies that the image T^*(y^*_{n_k}) of that subsequence is Cauchy in . *When is holomorphic in an open disk , with modulus bounded by , then (for example by Cauchy's formula) its derivative has modulus bounded by in the smaller disk If a family of holomorphic functions on is bounded by on , it follows that the family of restrictions to is equicontinuous on . Therefore, a sequence converging uniformly on can be extracted. This is a first step in the direction of Montel's theorem.

It pursued a policy of expanding its area of influence, especially in reaching west to Liverpool, which it ultimately did through the medium of the Cheshire Lines Committee network in joint partnership with the Great Northern Railway and the Midland Railway. Its dominant traffic was minerals, chiefly coal, and the main market was in London and the south of England. It was dependent on other lines to convey traffic southward. The London and North Western Railway was an exceptionally hostile partner, and in later years the MS&LR; allied itself with the Great Northern Railway. Passenger traffic, especially around Manchester, was also an important business area, and well-patronised express trains to London were run in collaboration with the GNR. Nevertheless, the MS&LR; was never greatly profitable. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway system in 1897 For many years its General Manager, and then Chairman, was Edward Watkin, a dynamic leader who sometimes allowed personal vanity to drive his priorities. Watkin was determined that the MS&LR; should get its own route to London, and this became the scheme for the London Extension, a fearfully expensive project that risked alienating friendly companies. The London extension scheme changed the character of the MS&LR; completely and dominated its final years. In 1897 the company changed its name to \\"The Great Central Railway\\", and it was under that company name that the London Extension was opened in 1899. Origin The Sheffield, Ashton under Lyne and Manchester Railway had opened throughout on 23 December 1845. Its line ran through the Woodhead Tunnel, a little over 3 miles in length. The line connected with the Manchester and Birmingham Railway at its western end, and had a basic terminus in Sheffield at Bridgehouses. There was a branch from Dinting to Glossop, and another from Guide Bridge to Stalybridge. The SA&MR; had been short of money during construction, and the Woodhead Tunnel was built as a single track to save money.Dow, George, The First Railway Across the Pennines, published by the London and North Eastern Railway, York, 1945, pages 5 to 20 As the Railway Mania took hold, it became evident that enlargement of the network dominated by a railway company was key to competitive survival, and in 1846 the SA&MR; had been authorised (by Act of 27 July 1846Grant, Donald J, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 359) to amalgamate with three as-yet unbuilt railways: they were: * The Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway had been authorised by Act of 30 June 1845 to build from Gainsborough to Grimsby. At Gainsborough it was to connect with the proposed Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, and this justified the word \\"Sheffield\\" in its title. A further Act of 26 June 1846 authorised a branch from Wrawby South Junction at Barnetby down to Lincoln, and an extension from there to Newark, on the Great Northern Railway; and in addition a branch to Barton-on-Humber from Brocklesby and a branch to Cleethorpes from Grimsby.Grant, pages 233 and 234 * The Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway was authorised by Act of 3 August 1846 to build from Sheffield to Gainsborough.Grant, pages 497 and 498 * The Sheffield and Lincolnshire Extension Railway was also authorised on 3 August 1846, connect with the S&LJR; at Clarborough Junction, east of Retford, and to run south-east to Sykes Junction, north of Lincoln, where it joined the Great Northern Railway and ran by running powers into Lincoln. The amalgamation took effect on 1 January 1847, and the combined company was named the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. It had headquarters at Manchester London Road station. The first board meeting of the amalgamated company took place on 6 January 1847.Dow, George, Great Central: vol I: The Progenitors, 1813‚Äì1863, Locomotive Publishing Company, London, 1959, page 111Holt, Geoffrey and Biddle, Gordon, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 10: the North West, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1986, , page 152 Canals As well as the railway interest, the new MS&LR; acquired a considerable canal network. The Sheffield, Ashton under Lyne and Manchester Railway had acquired three canals in March 1846; they were * the Ashton Canal (connecting Manchester, Ashton, Stalybridge and Stockport); * the Peak Forest Canal, which ran from Ashton to Whaley Bridge, and which had a plateway extension to Dove Holes; and * the Macclesfield Canal, which left the Peak Forest Canal at Marple and had a long southward main line through Macclesfield and Congleton to join the Trent and Mersey Canal. These canals cost the company ¬£33,608 annually in guaranteed payments to the original proprietors. The Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway had already purchased the Sheffield Canal and it was vested in the MS&LR; on 22 July 1848, and the MS&LR; acquired the Chesterfield Canal on 9 July 1847.Dow, pages 114 to 116 First years 1847‚Äì1849 In 1847 the railway network of the MS&LR; consisted of nothing more than the network of the SA&MR;, with one small addition. On the first day of 1847 a short spur connection was opened from the Sheffield terminal to the Sheffield station of the Midland Railway (former Sheffield and Rotherham Railway). At this time the Midland approached from the Rotherham direction only, and it had a terminal station adjacent to Wicker, and named after that thoroughfare. The short connecting link was steeply graded and almost entirely in tunnel; it was only used for wagon exchange purposes.Dow, First Railway, page 28Joy, David, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume VIII: South and West Yorkshire, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1984, , pages 164 and 165 Having now taken over three large railway schemes that were authorised but not yet started, the MS&LR; had to let large contracts for construction. In February 1847 nearly half a million pounds worth of work was commissioned; the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway main line from Woodhouse (near Sheffield) to Gainsborough, the Grimsby line to Market Rasen, and a second bore of the Woodhead Tunnel. The eastward construction from the Bridgehouses terminus across Sheffield was started in May 1847. The MS&LR; soon ran short of money, and a loan of ¬£250,000 had to be negotiated; deliveries of locomotives were slowed, as were certain infrastructure improvements; the stations at Dog Lane, Hazlehead, Oxspring and Thurgoland were closed to passenger traffic as from 1 November 1847. One new station was provided, at Dinting, at the Glossop branch junction. The original Dinting station was closed after an interval.Dow, page 118 In its first year of operation, the MS&LR; had paid a 5% dividend on ordinary stock. This fell to % for the first half of 1848, since when there were no further payments for six years.Dow, page 157Holt, pages 146 and 147 Progress continued on building the line between Grimsby and New Holland. The Grimsby-Louth line of the East Lincolnshire Railway (now leased to the Great Northern Railway) was nearing completion too, and both lines opened on 1 March 1848. There was a through train service between New Holland and Louth, operated equally by both companies. A pier 1,500 feet in length had been provided at New Holland, which was the terminal of a ferry service to Hull. It was promised that \\"the rails of the New Holland line will be continued to the extremity of the pier\\".Leleux, Robin, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume IX: The East Midlands, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1976, , pages 213 and 214 Next opening was from a junction at Ulceby (about halfway between New Holland and Grimsby) to Brigg, and a second arm of that line to Market Rasen. These sections opened on 1 November 1848.Dow, pages 121 and 122 Notwithstanding the difficult financial conditions, the MS&LR; network as originally planned was completed during 1849, except for the new station at Sheffield (still under construction), the Leverton branch (as the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Extension Railway was now called) and certain dock works at Grimsby. There was an impressive succession of openings: the Barnetby-Lincoln line was opened on 1 February 1849, and the section from Sheffield to Beighton, where a junction was made with the Midland Railway, was opened on 12 February 1849.A locomotive and two carriages had traversed it on 16 December 1848. MS&LR; passenger trains ran through to Eckington on the Midland Railway from Beighton. A triangular junction was formed at New Holland, leading to a branch to Barton on Humber, opened on 1 March 1849. On 2 April 1849 the section between Brigg and Gainsborough was opened. There was a triangular junction at Ulceby: the eastern side of the triangle had been in use since before July 1848. The final link, from Woodhouse junction, on the Sheffield- Beighton junction section, to Gainsborough, was formally opened on 16 July 1849. A special train conveying the Directors ran from Liverpool to Grimsby in five hours. The line was opened to the public the following day, 17 July 1849.Dow, page 127Joy, pages 164 and 165 There were two stations at Stalybridge: the former SA&MR; station and one belonging to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. The companies agreed to rationalise, with the MS&LR; station handling all passenger business, and the L&YR; all the goods business. The necessary junctions between the two routes at Stalybridge were ready on 1 July 1849, and on 1 August two new junctions with the London and North Western Railway were brought into use as well, end-on at Stalybridge with the new line from Huddersfield, and at Guide Bridge station, with the line from Heaton Norris. At the end of 1849, the MS&LR; network amounted to 159 miles, with an additional 110 miles of canal.Dow, page 130 Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway The Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Junction Railway had originally been conceived to connect the Sheffield, Ashton under Lyne and Manchester Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The Manchester and Birmingham Railway would benefit too from the connection. It was authorised on 21 July 1845Grant, pages 360 and 361 as an independent private company, with three shareholders: the SA&MR;, the M&BR; and the Earl of Ellesmere. His share was bought out in 1847 and the two railway companies had merged into the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway respectively, so that the MSJ&AR; was wholly and equally owned by the MS&LR; and the LNWR.Dixon, Frank, The Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1994, , page 139 The line was to be in two parts. The South Junction part was to connect the London Road station of the LNWR (used by the MS&LR;) with the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway (now LNWR) at Ordsall Lane. This connected the hitherto separate networks east and west of Manchester. The other part was the seven-mile line to Altrincham.Dixon, pages 19 to 22 The line opened between Oxford Road, Manchester, and Altrincham on 20 July 1849,Dow, pages 127 to 129 and it was extended back to London Road in July 1849, and from Altrincham to Bowdon in August 1849,Bairstow, Martin, The Manchester South Junction & Altrincham Railway, published by Martin Bairstow, Leeds, 2014, , pages 13 and 15 or September 1849. The MSJ&AR; network was now complete. As well as enabling a busy local passenger service, in time the MSJ&AR; line formed a strategic link, later enabling the MS&LR; to pass Manchester and penetrate westwards. James Allport In May 1849, George Hudson, the so- called Railway King, had fallen from power as his underhand methods were exposed. The politics of the large railway companies shifted considerably, as Hudson's successors, particularly Captain Mark Huish of the London and North Western Railway, engaged in schemes to gain advantage over neighbouring lines. The MS&LR; directors saw that it was no longer practicable to control their company's day-to-day activities from the Board, and the decided to appoint a General Manager. The Board selected James Joseph Allport, appointed at a salary of ¬£1,200 a year. Due to existing commitments he was not able to take up the post until 1 January 1850.Dow, pages 137 to 140 Allport's appointment at what seemed to some to be a high salary caused some shareholder disquiet.Dow, pages 140 and 141 The Great Northern Railway The Great Northern Railway was building its main line in stages, and on 4 September 1849 it opened its Doncaster-Retford line. At Retford the GNR trains used the MS&LR; station until its own station there was opened. This took place on 1 August 1852 after completion of the Retford-Peterborough section of the GNR main line, which crossed that of the MS&LR; on the flat. An Act of 24 July 1851 permitted the GNR to run over the MS&LR; to cross the River Trent at Gainsborough, and also to enter the eastern end of the Great Northern Railway station at Lincoln by means of a spur from Durham Ox Junction, on the line from Market Rasen. On 1 July 1859 the MS&LR; brought into use the Whisker Hill curve at Retford, which enabled its passenger trains to use the Great Northern station: the MS&LR; Retford station closed on the same date.Dow, page 132Joy, pages 165Joy, page 209 The Euston Square Confederacy Mark Huish had taken over at the LNWR; he was a master of commercial chicanery. He achieved domination of the Midland Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway by means of traffic pooling agreements, and the alliance became known as the Euston Square Confederacy. There were good relations between the Great Northern Railway and the MS&LR;, and Huish saw that completion of the GNR line from Peterborough to Doncaster, connecting with the MS&LR; at Retford, as well as the Gainsborough connection, would encourage a co-operation that would abstract traffic from his allies. He manipulated Allport and the MS&LR; into joining a traffic agreement that contained clauses hostile to any collaboration with the GNR; this was approved on 16 January 1850.Dow, page 144 Improvements 1850 to 1852 The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway opened a line from Huddersfield to Penistone on 1 July 1850; MS&LR; passenger trains began to run over it into Huddersfield.Joy, page 145 The Leverton line, leading towards Lincoln, was opened on 7 August 1850, forming a shortened route between Retford and Lincoln. It was supposed to enable MS&LR; trains to run through to Lincoln over the GNR, and in return for the GNR to reach Sheffield; however because of its traffic agreement with the LNWR, the MS&LR; felt obliged to try to frustrate the arrangement.Dow, page 145 At the end of May 1851 a contract was concluded with the Electric Telegraph Company which, for about ¬£5 per mile per annum, undertook to install lines between Manchester, Sheffield, New Holland, Grimsby and Lincoln, providing not only the equipment but the clerks to operate it at the principal stations. In July 1851 through carriages by three trains a day were introduced between Sheffield (Bridgehouses) and London (Euston Square) via Beighton, Eckington and the Midland Railway and the LNWR.Dow, page 147 A considerable step forward was taken when the new Sheffield station (in due course named \\"Victoria\\") was opened on 15 September 1851. It was very commodious; the Bridgehouses station was converted to a goods depot.Dow, page 148 The second bore of the Woodhead tunnel opened for traffic on 2 February 1852;Joy, page 164 its beneficial effect on train operating was felt immediately, and the removal of the pilot engine alone saved ¬£800 a year.Dow, paeg 151 On 18 March 1852 a banquet was held at Grimsby to celebrate the completion of the MS&LR;'s dock; it entered public use in May and a branch from Grimsby Town station to the Docks and Pier stations, with two miles of internal dock lines, were ready on 1 August 1853.Dow, pages 151 and 152 The Etherow and Dinting Vale viaducts on the original SA&MR; line had both been strengthened with extra tie rods in the middle 1850s. They were insured respectively for ¬£4,000 and ¬£6,000, but now drastic repairs were required: all of the timber arches in both structures were to be replaced by wrought iron girders at a cost of ¬£28,700 from November 1859. Not long afterwards the contractor system of permanent way maintenance came to an end when it was discovered that a contractor had got into serious financial difficulty; the work was brought in-house.Dow, pages 256 and 257 The first quadruple-track section of the MS&L;, between Gorton and Ashburys, were drawn up in 1860. Negotiations were required with the LNWR over the use of the proposed widened lines between Ardwick junction and London Road. The MS&L; were to vacate the original pair of tracks and be given the exclusive use of the two new lines on the northern side, except in the case of accidents, and have access across the LNWR to the MSJ&AR; line. Although this seemed to be agreed smoothly enough with the LNWR, that company later used its primacy at London Road and the need for MS&LR; trains to cross to the southern side there, as a means of obstructing MS&LR; expansion. Edward Watkin James Allport resigned on 20 July 1853, effective at the end of September; he went to the Midland Railway. A shareholders' consultative committee had been set up and was require to be involved in strategic decisions of the company; it appears that Allport considered this to be an infringement of his role. Edward William Watkin took over in his place on 1 January 1854.Dow, page 156 He had been the assistant of Huish at the LNWR and he revealed that the latter, in spite of the Euston Square agreement, had been negotiating with the GNR for a territorial division between the two companies, to the detriment of the MS&LR.; Dow refers to this as \\"deplorable duplicity\\" by Huish.Dow, pages 158 to 160 Watkin had a challenge before him; at this time traffic receipts were falling short of fixed obligations by about ¬£1,000 a week. Huish resumed his attempts at coercion. Members of the LNWR and MS&LR; boards met at Rugby on 20 July 1854. It was agreed that the two railways should be worked as one interest with a scheme for sharing income and expenses. The treaty was regarded as continuous and subject only to seven years' notice of termination by either side. The agreement was finalised on 29 July 1854. Later in the year the LNWR offered to perform the whole of the MS&LR;'s passenger and parcels business at London Road station, including collection and delivery by van, for ¬£600 a year. This was accepted and the MS&LR; withdrew its staff. It was a move that the MS&LR; came to regret. Financially, 1855 was not a good year for the MS&LR.; Trade generally had been adversely affected by the blockade of the Baltic ports, owing to the Crimean War. Passenger traffic showed decreases in all categories except second class. In the same year the maintenance of permanent way was changed from direct to contractors.Dow, pages 164 and 165 The end of the Euston Confederacy In the 1856 session of Parliament, the North Western Railway (a small company unconnected with the London and North Western Railway) was applying for running powers over part of the LNWR. In the course of the examination of witnesses, the illegal \\"common-purse\\" agreement which existed between the London and North Western and the Midland Railway was exposed. Euston Square was now vulnerable to a Chancery suit, and, in the spring of 1857 a director of the Great Northern Railway filed a petition in Chancery. The LNWR position was indefensible and Euston Square had no option but to terminate the arrangement; this was done on 12 May 1857. The Euston Square Confederacy was neutralised.Dow, pages 180 and 181 Huish attempted further duplicity in trying to agree a sharing of traffic with the Great Northern Railway, but that company saw the danger and refused. The MS&LR; decided to sever all agreements with the LNWR, and to form an alliance with the Great Northern Railway. The process to conclude these things took some time, but it resulted in transfer of the Manchester to London express passenger service to the route via Retford and the Great Northern Railway, in the same journey time as formerly via the LNWR. Of course much mineral traffic followed this transfer. Some of the track between Wadsley Bridge and Oughty Bridge still had the original stone-block sleepered track, and this had to be hastily modernised.Dow, pages 186 to 191 (At the beginning of 1858 an inspection indicated that the last of the stone block sleepers in the main line had gone).Dow, page 256Joy, page 166 The LNWR continued to use underhand tactics of all kinds to frustrate the smooth operation of MS&LR; and GNR trains, especially at Manchester. The warfare continued despite the efforts of neutral railway companies to mediate, and it was not until 12 November 1858 that a peaceful agreement was concluded. Throughout the process, Huish had been pursuing personal antagonistic objectives, and had steadily lost the confidence of his own Board, and on 11 September 1858 his resignation was accepted.Dow, pages 186 to 191 Domestic branch lines =Penistone to Barnsley branch= Towards the end of 1851 the Board had considered the restarting of the Barnsley branch construction, which had been promised but never proceeded with. In the meantime, other companies had connected the town: the Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley, Wakefield, Huddersfield and Goole Railway and the South Yorkshire Railway.Dow, page 150 It was at last completed, opening in three stages, from 15 May 1854 to 12 February 1857.Joy, page 154 =Birley coal branch= The Birley coal branch, turning west from Woodhouse and miles in length, was brought into use in June 1855.Joy, page 265 =Hyde branch and extension to New Mills= The MS&LR; opened a branch to Hyde from Newton, on the main line on 1 March 1858. Newton station had been called Newton & Hyde (now Hyde North), and an omnibus service to Hyde itself had been operated at one time.Dow, page 194 (The Hyde station is now Hyde Central.) Parliamentary sanction was given in 1858 to extend the Hyde branch to Compstall Bridge, then a local centre of industry. In fact the extension was from Hyde to Marple, with intermediate stations at Woodley and Romiley; it opened on 5 August 1862.Dow, page 261 A further extension looked advantageous, and this was conceived as a nominally independent company, the Marple, New Mills and Hayfield Junction Railway. Sponsored by the MS&LR; it was authorised on 15 May 1860.Dow, pages 194 and 195Grant, page 363 It was to extend to New Mills with a branch from there to Hayfield. From Marple to New Mills the line opened for goods on 1 July 1865 and for passengers on 1 February 1867. Meanwhile, the Midland Railway was building a line up from near Miller's Dale, joining the MNM&HJR; at New Mills; it opened on 1 October 1866. This gave the Midland Railway access to the MS&LR; system, and thereby to Manchester. The MNM&HJR; company was acquired by the MS&LR; on 5 July 1865.Holt, pages 126 and 127 Oldham, Ashton and Guide Bridge Railway The MS&LR; had sought the support of the LNWR and L&YR; for the construction of a south-to-north line from Guide Bridge to Oldham, connecting with those companies' lines. The Oldham, Ashton and Guide Bridge Railway was authorised on 10 August 1857,Grant, page 431 with capital of ¬£140,000. The MS&LR; was anxious to secure the commitment of the LNWR to the project, partly to disarm LNWR plans to build their own line there. The L&YR; had at first expressed preparedness to support the line, but in negotiations which dragged into 1858 the L&YR; as clearly determined to keep the LNWR out, and the L&YR; withdrew. Accordingly, on 30 June 1862 the OA&GBR; was leased to the MS&LR; and LNWR. Each subscribed ¬£50,000. By the end of March 1860 the line had been finished between Guide Bridge and the junction with the L&YR; near Ashton-under-Lyne, but unusually wet weather delayed the completion of the remainder. On 31 July 1861 the line was opened formally. Passenger trains started running on 26 August, the MS&LR; providing the locomotives and carriages; goods traffic did not start until 1 February 1863.Dow, pages 254 and 255> Reaching toward Liverpool Liverpool was a prime seaport with a huge volume of international and coastwise trade, and was consequently of strategic importance for railways in the region. The MS&LR; reached as far west as Manchester, and was joint owner of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway. The MS&LR; began to consider how it might reach Liverpool without dependency of the LNWR, which was generally hostile and obstructive. =St Helens Railway= The St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway had been built to convey minerals south from St Helens to the River Mersey. It had opened on 21 February 1833, and its route included rope worked inclines.Holt, page 60Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, pages 39 and 40 It amalgamated with the Sankey Brook Navigation, forming the St Helens Canal and Railway by Act of 21 July 1845.From Grant; 21 May 1845 according to Holt.Grant, page 484Carter, page 133 The construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway showed that merely acting as a feeder to waterborne transport was no longer competitive. John Meadows Rendel, the engineer of Birkenhead docks, recommended the development of a dock at Garston, on the Mersey south of Liverpool, and a connecting railway. This was authorised in 1846; it diverged from the original line to Runcorn Gap just north of the Mersey and ran west to Garston.Holt, page 62 It opened on 1 July 1852, and the dock at Garston opened on 21 July 1853. A line eastwards to Warrington was built from a junction with the new line, and was opened on 1 February 1853. =Warrington and Altrincham Junction Railway= The Warrington and Altrincham Junction Railway was authorised on 3 July 1851.Grant, pages 583 and 584 It was to make a line from the St Helens Railway at Warrington to Timperley Junction (facing Manchester) on the MSJ&AR.;Dixon, page 23 The W&AJR; and the St Helens Railway were closely associated, sharing directors. The W&AJR; changed its name to the Warrington and Stockport Railway by Act of 4 August 1853 when it got powers to extend eastwards to Stockport. On 1 May 1854 it opened its line between Timperley, on the MSJ&AR;, and Warrington, and the St Helens Railway was extended a short distance from its Warrington terminal to meet the Warrington and Stockport line at Arpley station, in 1854. On 13 August 1859 the Warrington and Stockport Railway was leased to the LNWR and St Helens companies jointly, and on 14 June 1860 the St Helens company's line from Warrington to Garston was leased to the LNWR.Holt, page 64 = Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway = The Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway was authorised on 15 May 1860 to make a line from Woodley, on the line between Newton & Hyde and Marple stations. It opened on 12 May 1863, giving access to Stockport round the south side of Manchester.Dow, page 261Holt, pages 127 and 128 An east to south connection from Godley to Woodley was later constructed, enabling through running from the Sheffield direction to Woodley; it opened on 1 February 1866. This short line was vested in the CLC on 10 August 1866.Dow, George, Great Central: volume II: Dominion of Watkin, 1864 ‚Äì 1899, Locomotive Publishing Co, London, 1962, page 12Holt, page 130 =MS&LR; trains to Liverpool= The MS&LR; now had access to Garston over the St Helens line, from the MSJ&AR.; At first the St Helens company worked the line, but the working was taken over by the MS&LR; from 1 October 1856. From 1 February 1858 the MS&LR; in collaboration with the GNR ran express trains between Garston and London; an \\"express omnibus\\" connection was provided over the five miles between Garston and Liverpool. In 1858 and 1859 an MS&LR; steamer, brought round from the River Humber service, made the connection instead. Yet the LNWR could set London passengers and goods down in the centre of Liverpool, and the gap from Garston made the MS&LR; and GNR service unattractive.Bairstow, page 36Anderson, pages 53 to 59 From September 1859, the GNR changed its routing: through coaches and goods wagons were worked over the LNWR's Liverpool & Manchester line, via Newton-le-Willows, and both the GNR and MS&LR; opened offices at various stations in Liverpool, including Lime Street, Wapping and Waterloo. This arrangement was better than the use of the Garston terminal, but it involved a heavy dependency on the LNWR, and that company was not a comfortable partner. In March 1861 the MS&LR; held a meeting to generate support for a new railway northwards from Garston. The outcome was the Garston and Liverpool Railway, which received its Act of Parliament on 17 May 1861. It was to be a four-mile double track line with a terminus at Queen's Dock, although this was altered to Brunswick Dock in 1862.Grant, page 215 Meanwhile, the LNWR had leased the St Helens Railway from 1860, and absorbed it in 1864, as part of its own plan for an improved route from Liverpool to the south, avoiding the detour via Newton le Willows.Holt, page 38Griffiths, R Prys, The Cheshire Lines Railway, Oakwood Press, 1947 The line from Garston to Brunswick Dock opened on 1 June 1864.Grant, page 215 This was still not entirely satisfactory, for Brunswick Dock station was not in central Liverpool. An Act of 29 July 1864 permitted a \\"difficult and costly\\" further extension to a new Liverpool Central Station. The extension line was floated as a separate company named the Liverpool Central Station Railway. Negotiations for land acquisition in the prime districts of Liverpool were protracted, and took until 1869, and the first construction contract was not awarded until July 1870, six years after authorisation, and the \\"daunting\\" task began. =LNWR hostility= The Great Northern Railway and the MS&LR; had running powers from Timperley to Garston over the LNWR, mandated in the original Garston & Liverpool Act; this gave the partners a through Manchester ‚Äì Liverpool route; they already had powers for access to Lime Street, Waterloo and Wapping. These various running powers and the impending extension to Liverpool Central began to antagonise the LNWR, which became belligerent. In October 1864 it locked the GNR/MS&LR; booking clerks out of their offices at Waterloo; this was followed by closure of the Wapping office; papers there were ransacked. In January 1865 the allies were told to withdraw staff from Lime Street and send traffic only via Warrington. Two daily passenger trains continued to use Lime Street, but the LNWR did not show them in the timetable, refused to service the coaches, and would not allow local Liverpool ‚Äì Manchester passengers to board them. They were withdrawn in October 1865, losing money heavily. Cheshire Lines As well as the push towards Liverpool, Watkin wanted the MS&LR; to expand into the industrial, chemical and mineral areas of the Cheshire Plain as well. It did so by encouraging a number of apparently independent companies. =Cheshire Midland Railway= The Cheshire Midland Railway was authorised by Act of 14 June 1860, to build a line from Altrincham on the MSJ&AR; to Northwich. It opened from Altrincham to Knutsford on 12 May 1862, and from Knutsford to Northwich on 1 January 1863.Grant, page 110Griffiths, page 2 =West Cheshire Railway= The West Cheshire Railway was incorporated on 11 July 1861. Although a line from Northwich to Chester had been proposed, the powers were limited to a line as far as Mouldsworth, then running north to Helsby. In 1862 a second attempt to get approval for the line to Chester was also refused, although a short branch to Winsford was allowed. Construction was rather delayed, and the line from Northwich to Helsby opened for goods traffic on 1 September 1869, and for passenger trains on 22 June 1870; the Winsford branch opened in 1870.Grant, pages 594 and 595 =Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway= In concert with the Great Northern Railway, the MS&LR; promoted the Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway. It was authorised by an Act of 22 July 1861, to build from Stockport (on the Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway) to a junction at Broadheath on the Warrington and Stockport Railway, with a spur to Timperley on the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, facing away from Manchester. The ST&AJR; opened from Portwood, east of Stockport, to Deansgate Junction, on the MSJ&AR;, on 1 December 1865. A short spur (Skelton Junction to Broadheath Junction) connected to the Warrington and Stockport Railway, opening on 1 February 1866. This line gave access south-west of Manchester avoiding the congestion of the approaches to the conurbation. The line was managed by a joint committee of the GNR and the MS&LR.;Grant, page 536Griffiths, pages 2 and 3 Resignation of Watkin Watkin had interests in railways outside the MS&LR; and, being granted three months leave of absence to recover his health, agreed to examine the affairs of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. The MS&LR; was once again on the verge of an association with the GNR and, possibly the LNWR, that would resolve its financial problems. However an event in the final months of 1861, during his absence, upset his plans. The Midland Railway was determined to find a path into Manchester. It was already building an extension to Buxton from Rowsley but the LNWR was proceeding into Buxton from the other direction. One day, it is said,Dow, pages 200 to 205 some directors of the MS&LR; met James Allport and others, while the latter were prospecting an alternative route. The upshot was that the MS&LR; agreed to share their line from New Mills with the Midland, the latter extending their line to meet it. This, which was later approved as the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee, threatened to cause a schism with the GNR, who saw this as bad faith regarding their co-operative agreement with the MS&LR.; Clearly the MS&LR; could not countenance another major line in their territory, but Watkin was incensed, and tendered his resignation. Dow refers to Watkin's behaviour as \\"petulance which smacked unpleasantly of his departed tutor Huish\\". Robert George Underdown was immediately appointed General Manager. It was obvious that Watkin regretted his departure from the General Managership of the MS&LR.; He retained directorial posts but was glad to attain the Chairmanship of the company on 27 January 1864.Dow, volume II, pages 1 and 2 The company's financial performance had long been disappointing: ordinary dividends from 1846 until 1899 never exceeded % for a whole year and for nine years were in default. Establishment of the Cheshire Lines Committee The Great Northern (Cheshire Lines) Act of 1863 allowed the GNR and the MS&LR; to regulate traffic on lines built, or proposed to be built in the Cheshire area. The Midland Railway was something of a latecomer to the area and became a natural ally of the MLS&R; and the GNR locally, and was admitted to the controlling group.Grant, page 109 The Cheshire Lines Transfer Act of 5 July 1865 therefore allowed the Midland Railway to join in the committee which it did in 1866. The Cheshire Lines Act of 15 August 1867 named the resultant group as the Cheshire Lines Committee and gave it complete autonomy.Although referred to as a \\"Committee\\" the CLC was an incorporated body, and the owner of physical assets. The constituent companies absorbed by the committee were; * The Stockport and Woodley Junction Railway; * The Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway; * The West Cheshire Railway; * The Cheshire Midland Railway; * The Garston and Liverpool Railway.Griffiths, pages 1 to 4 The powers of the Liverpool Central Station Railway were acquired on 30 July 1866. Smith and Anderson describe the rolling stock: > Initially the CLC hired carriages and wagons from the owning partners, but > soon purchased its own rolling stock. By the grouping of 1923 it had nearly > 600 coaches and over 4,000 goods vehicles on its books. Many of the former > were used on Liverpool-Manchester expresses and they exuded luxury. Handsome > composites built by the Lancaster Carriage & Wagon Company had first class > compartments lined in mahogany and upholstered with green or brown velvet, > whilst the exceptionally fine coaches supplied by Great Central workshops > (in 1914) featured first class accommodation finished in walnut and sycamore > with fittings of oxidised copper and deep blue cloth seats. Such opulence > was understandable in view of the popularity of the CLC service, but this > was only possible because of the extension to Liverpool Central.Anderson, > page 56 Chester and West Cheshire Junction Railway The West Cheshire Railway had been denied direct access to Chester in 1861 and 1862. Finally an Act of 5 July 1865 authorised the Chester and West Cheshire Junction Railway to build from the West Cheshire Railway at Mouldsworth to a new Chester station, named Northgate. The company was acquired by the Cheshire Lines Committee on 10 August 1866. Construction was greatly delayed, and the line was opened on 2 November 1874 for goods trains and on 1 May 1875 for passengers.Griffiths, page 7 Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee The Marple, New Mills and Hayfield Junction Railway, sponsored by the MS&LR; was incorporated on 15 May 1860.Holt, page 126 It opened as far as New Mills on 1 July 1865 (goods) and 1 February 1867 (passengers). Meanwhile, the Midland Railway had built a line up from Miller's Dale, joining the MNM&HJR; at New Mills, and opening on 1 October 1866. This gave the Midland Railway access to Manchester, and the MS&LR; regarded it as an ally. The inbound journey for Midland trains was via Romiley, Hyde and Guide Bridge. The MNM&HJR; company was acquired by the MS&LR; on 5 July 1865.Holt, pages 126 and 127 On 16 July 1866 the Manchester and Stockport Railway was incorporated, sponsored by the MS&LR.; This sanctioned a line of miles from Ashburys to Brinnington Junction on the Stockport & Woodley (now CLC) line, with a branch of miles from Reddish junction to Romiley on the New Mills line. It was conceived chiefly to give the Midland Railway access into Manchester, and it was intended that the Midland would adopt joint ownership of the line, as well as the existing line between Hyde Junction and New Mills. Midland trains started to use London Road from 1 February 1867. On 24 June 1869 the still unfinished Manchester and Stockport Railway, and the line from Hyde to New Mills, and the branch from New Mills to Hayfield, were vested jointly in the MS&LR; and the Midland, from then onwards known as the Sheffield and Midland Committee Lines. Like the CLC, this committee was a corporate body owning physical assets.Grant, page 363Dow, pages 194 and 195Dow, volume II, pages 14 to 16 South Yorkshire Railway The South Yorkshire Railway had established a small network primarily oriented to mineral traffic, opened from Doncaster to Swinton in 1849, and to Barnsley in 1851. On 10 September 1859 the SYR opened from Doncaster and Keadby. Already in 1861 the SYR had carried a million tons of coal.Leleux, page 223 On 23 June 1864 the MS&LR; was authorised to lease the SYR for 999 years.Dow, volume II, page 2 The MS&LR; got a follow-up Act on 5 July 1865 which provided for an extensive interchange of running powers with the Midland Railway. The MS&LR; was to connect from Barnsley on to the Midland main line by means of a new branch to Cudworth, and then continue northwards to the West Riding & Grimsby Railway near Oakenshaw.Joy, page 195 The SYR had started the process of reaching Hull, having agreed with the North Eastern Railway to construct such a line, the SYR portion finishing at Thorne. That line opened on 2 August 1869 and the MS&LR; started running through to Hull over the NER. The southern fork to Keadby opened on the same day.Joy, page 219 On 16 July 1874 the South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company's Vesting Act dissolved the SYR, transferring it to the MS&LR; absolutely.Holt, page 276 76 route miles of railway and 60 miles of canal transferred to MS&LR; ownership.Dow, volume II, page 43 =Cleethorpes= On 6 April 1863 the Cleethorpes extension from Grimsby was opened; it was a single line, later doubled in 1874.Joy, page 221 =Scunthorpe line= In 1858 ironstone deposits were discovered at Frodingham, a few miles east of the River Trent, where Keadby was located on the west side. The Trent, Ancholme and Grimsby Railway was sponsored by the MS&LR; and the SYR together to fill in the gap from Keadby to Barnetby. It was authorised in 1861, and required a bridge at Althorpe to cross the Trent. The line opened to goods on 1 May 1866 and passengers on 1 October 1866. The Frodingham ironstone resource gave rise to the massive Scunthorpe ironworks.Leleux, pages 223 and 224 West Riding and Grimsby Joint Railway The West Riding and Grimsby Joint Railway was promoted by the South Yorkshire Railway in 1862 as the West Riding, Hull & Grimsby Railway, extending from Wakefield to a junction with the SYR at Stainforth, with a branch from Adwick to Doncaster. Hull and Grimsby were included in the title as distant objectives, rather than places to be included in the network: the SYR was separately planning a line to Hull, and already ran to Keadby with aspirations to continue to Grimsby. Hull was omitted from the title by the time of incorporation on 7 August 1862. The Great Northern Railway was alarmed by the interest that the MS&LR; was taking in the line: it was leasing the SYR. The MS&LR; appeared to be friendly with the Great Eastern Railway, which the GNR was at pains to keep out of the area. After much negotiation an 1866 Act authorised the GNR and the MS&LR; to become joint owners of the line. The settlement gave the MS&LR; running powers over existing GNR lines north-west of Wakefield. The direct benefit to the GNR was a route from Doncaster to Wakefield avoiding dependency on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.Joy, pages 219 and 220 The Doncaster ‚Äì Adwick ‚Äì Wakefield part of the WR&GR; was opened in February 1866, but the section from Adwick junction to Stainforth junction was delayed until the SYR finished its Doncaster ‚Äì Thorne direct line, in November 1866. Independent access to Liverpool Notwithstanding the construction of the Garston and Liverpool line, the MS&LR; could only get access to Liverpool by running over a lengthy section of the LNWR from Timperley Junction to Garston. Watkin saw that this was untenable, and determined to build an independent line. He deposited a Bill for a new line from Old Trafford (on the MSJ&AR; on the edge of Manchester) to a junction with the Garston and Liverpool line near Cressington, as well as a link from Timperley to Glazebrook, joining the proposed line. The Old Trafford to Garston line was sanctioned by the MS&LR; (Extension to Liverpool) Act of 6 July 1865.Dow, volume II, pages 8, 11, 12 and 13Grant, pages 109 and 110Griffiths, page 4 In 1866 authorisation was given for a slight change to the point of junction at Old Trafford, and for a loop line to give a Warrington station in the town; the original plan was a straight route some distance out on the north side. The (unbuilt) line was vested in the CLC on 16 July 1866, thus making the Midland and Great Northern each responsible for one-third of its ¬£750,000 share capital. The construction was not easy; at last on 1 March 1873 the first section, from Timperley to Cressington junction, near Garston, was opened for goods traffic; on 14 May a short spur to the LNWR at Allerton was opened. Passenger services started on 1 August 1873. The remaining section, from Cornbrook junction to Glazebrook junction was opened on 2 September. The two sections added 33 route miles of line to the system.Dow, volume II, page 132Holt, page 131 After a difficult construction period, Liverpool Central station opened on 1 March 1874. The passenger service from there to Manchester was sixteen trains each way, increasing steadily over subsequent decades. The passenger business at Brunswick station was discontinued from 1 March 1874. A connection to the dock lines was put in during 1884: a major traffic was bunkering coal for liners: in Great Central days the RMS Lusitania and RMS Mauretania needed 6,000 tons of coal for a trans-Atlantic crossing. North Liverpool Lines The CLC still lacked practicable access to the northern docks at Liverpool, and having spent several years considering how an affordable route could be created, obtained the CLC North Liverpool Lines Act of 30 July 1874. This sanctioned an eleven- mile branch from Hunt's Cross on the main line to a terminus at Sandhills and a two and a quarter-mile connection from Fazakerley to the L&YR; at Aintree. Triangular junctions were to be created by spurs from Hunt's Cross East to Halewood North and Fazakerley West to North. In 1878 the name Huskisson was adopted in place of Sandhills for the terminus. The line opened on 1 December 1879, although the spurs at the junctions took until 1888. The two-mile section from Walton on the Hill to Huskisson opened for goods traffic on 1 July 1880. Passenger trains from Liverpool Central via Walton on the Hill were run from 2 August 1880, but they were an abject failure and were discontinued on 1 May 1885.Anderson, pages 60 to 63 Macclesfield The Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway was incorporated on 14 June 186414 June 1864 according to Holt; 14 July 1864 according to Grant. to build a line from Marple Wharf Junction, on the Sheffield & Midland Joint line, to its own Macclesfield terminus, a distance of ten miles. It opened the line to passengers on 2 August 1869, and to goods in March 1870. A connection to the North Staffordshire Railway for goods traffic was made on 3 August 1871.Dates from Holt; Grant has \\"The line was opened throughout on 3 July 1871 for goods and on 1 July 1873 for passengers.\\"Grant, page 350 The company was vested in the MS&LR; and NSR on 25 May 1871, and the joint owners opened a new station, Macclesfield Central, on 1 July 1873.Holt, pages 123 and 124 Manchester Central station and the South District Railway The CLC was progressing towards having its own independent terminus, Manchester Central, authorised by an Act of 1872. The station opened on 9 July 1877. Immediately the CLC introduced an hourly express service to Liverpool, with a journey time of 45 minutes. The first station was a temporary building and the permanent structure was opened on 1 July 1880. The South District Railway Act had been authorised by an Act of 5 August 1873, to build from the CLC Liverpool Extension Railway at Throstle Nest Junction (east of Trafford Park Station) via Chorlton-cum-Hardy, and Didsbury to Alderley. It never reached Alderley, and the company was acquired by the Midland Railway on 12 August 1877. It opened to Heaton Mersey (CLC) on 1 January 1880, giving the Midland Railway access to the CLC lines and Central station. The MS&LR; was able to build a line from Fairfield junction (facing east) to Chorlton junction passing round the south of Manchester giving the MS&LR; direct access from the east to the South District Line and Manchester Central station. It opened on 1 October 1891 from Chorlton Junction to Fallowfield, and the portion of the South District Line between Chorlton Junction and Throstle Nest Junction was transferred to the CLC on the same day. The line was extended to Fairfield Junction on 2 May 1892.Holt, pages 132 and 133Dow, volume II, page 211Stretton, Clement E, History of the Midland Railway, Methuen & Co, London, 1901 Wigan Junction Railways Expanded colliery activity around West Leigh and Wigan encouraged the MS&LR; and the Midland Railway, working collaboratively as the Sheffield and Midland Committee to plan a line to get access. The scheme materialised as the Wigan Junction Railways, making a junction with the CLC west of Glazebrook and running north-west; junctions were planned with the LNWR and Lancashire Union Railway on the approach to Wigan. The company was incorporated on 16 July 1874. It was slow to make progress and the Midland withdrew its financial support; the MS&LR; ensured that the line was solvent, to prevent it from falling into the hands of the LNWR. It opened from Glazebrook to Strangeways Hall Colliery, immediately west of Hindley, 16 October 1879; the MS&LR; working the goods and mineral traffic. Connections with the LNWR at Amberswood East and West Junctions were made in July 1880. A passenger service was started on 1 April 1884; the line was extended to a temporary terminus at Darlington Street, on the edge of Wigan. A quarter-mile extension of the line to Wigan Central station was opened on 3 October 1892. The company was later taken over by the Great Central Railway.Holt, pages 103 and 104 Southport and Cheshire Lines Extension Railway In 1878 municipal authorities in Southport asked the CLC to extend the North Liverpool line from Aintree to Southport. In 1880 the CLC set up a separate company for the purpose and a Bill was prepared for a Southport and Cheshire Lines Extension Railway; it passed on 11 September 1881. The line opened on 1 September 1884, to Birkdale, and throughout on 18 August 1882. It was worked by the Cheshire Lines Committee although it retained its separate identity.Griffiths, pages 19 and 20 The Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway After the Wigan Junction Railways opened in 1879, a branch from them to St Helens was promoted locally, as the St Helens and Wigan Junction Railway. It was authorised on 22 July 1885, and the MS&LR; supported it financially. It was renamed the Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway on 26 July 1889, but the possibility extending it beyond St Helens to Liverpool gradually faded. It opened for goods traffic on 1 July 1895, and a passenger service started on 3 January 1900. It was worked by the MS&LR.;Holt, pages 71 and 72 Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway The Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway had established itself as a carrier of minerals from the Brymbo area west of Wrexham to the River Dee and to the main lien railways nearby. In 1881 it proposed to cross the river and expand into the Wirral, but the scheme was unsuccessful for the time being.Boyd, James I C, The Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1991, , page 173 It was revived and in 1884 a crossing of the Dee was authorised. The London and North Western Railway was unhelpful, and the WM&CQR; asked the MS&LR; for financial assistance. The MS&LR; agreed to build from the WM&CQR; at Hawarden, on the south side of the Dee, crossing the river and swinging east to run to Chester. The MS&LR; part of this was called the Chester and Connah's Quay Railway; it was authorised on 31 July 1885. At Chester it connected to the Cheshire Lines Committee network giving the MS&LR; access from its own network further east. The Dee crossing, by means of the Hawarden Bridge, was a huge structure: it was opened on 3 August 1889, and the line from Chester to Connah's Quay, crossing the bridge, was opened on 31 March 1890. A Chester to Wrexham passenger service of three trains a day was started, worked by the MS&LR.;Boyd, page 191 The MS&LR; and the WM&CQR; together built a line from Hawarden to Bidston, connecting there with the Wirral Railway. The line was called the North Wales and Liverpool Railway. The WM&CQR; relied on heavy financial support from the MS&LR;, which had acquired a majority share holding in the Wrexham company. The Bidston line opened for goods trains on 16 March 1896, and passenger services (to Seacombe via Bidston) followed on 18 May 1896, worked by the WM&CQR; but using hired MS&LR; locomotives. The MS&LR; did not have running powers over the Wirral Railway at Bidston, so the WM&CQR; worked the line itself, using hired MS&LR; engines hired to them, but with their numbers painted out and WM&CQR; numbers added.Boyd, page 216 Growth of mineral traffic Mineral traffic, especially coal, had long been dominant in the business of the MS&LR.; In the final three decades of the nineteenth century, the volume of mineral trade expanded considerably, and overwhelmed the capacity of the network to carry it. Following serious complaint by the business community, a series of widenings was carried out.Dow, volume II, page 100 The London extension From 1883 at the latest Watkin had considered that the MS&LR; should try to extend to London, which was the principal market for coal from its area. The means of achieving this were not obvious, but on 26 July 1889 Parliamentary permission was obtained for a line from Beighton, where the MS&LR; crossed the Midland Railway, to Annesley, and a branch to Chesterfield. This was the first step on the road to London. The years 1890‚Äì1894 were dominated by the campaign for the London extension. When it had been won, Watkin withdrew from the centre of the railway stage. Dow says: \\"To his successors Watkin left the well-nigh impossible task of making pay a line which Sir John Clapham, a contemporary economic historian, described as 'a belated, and almost entirely superfluous, product of the original era of fighting construction'.\\"Dow, volume II, page 221 Construction of the so-called Derbyshire lines, which were to extend the MS&LR; to the Great Northern at Annesley junction and its trains to Nottingham proceeded: the first section from Beighton to Staveley Works opened on 1 December 1891; on 4 June 1892 the section from Staveley Town to Chesterfield was opened. Then from Staveley Town to Annesley junction was opened on 24 October 1892; MS&LR; coal and goods trains began running to Nottingham; Colwick, instead of Doncaster, now became the exchange point with the LNWR for coal bound for the south.Dow, volume II, pages 232 and 233 Watkin's clear intention now was to get a line to London, using the Metropolitan Railway for the southernmost lap, but he knew that he risked warfare with allied railways, especially the Great Northern, if he did not tread carefully. On 16 September 1889 he wrote to the Great Northern Railway, consulting its Chairman about the GNR's possible reaction. He suggested that the GNR could avoid necessary piecemeal widenings of its own main line by joining a traffic agreement with the MS&LR; for London traffic. Watkin's diplomacy deserted him, however, when he wrote again adding a second \\"string to your bow would give great strength and profit to the Great Northern, and would in all senses be better than wasting your shareholders' capital on the plastering of your old line.\\"Dow, volume II, pages 236 and 239 The MS&LR; went ahead on its own, and after a false start obtained the Royal Assent for the line to Marylebone on 28 March 1893.Dow, volume II, pages 246 to 250 The line would need ¬£6 million of capital. (In fact the outturn was about double that figure.) The times were bad for raising money. By now Watkin had had enough of railway politics, and his health was imperfect. He wrote resigning his chairmanship on 19 May 1894; it was accepted on 25 May. In 1896 the London extension was progressing, and thought was given to changing the company's name. On 27 March 1896 \\"Manchester, Sheffield & London\\" was considered, but then \\"Central\\" or \\"Great Central\\". The Central London Railway objected, but to no avail. \\"Great Central Railway\\" was decided upon, and the new title was assumed on 1 August 1897 under section 80 of the company's Act of that year.Dow, volume II, pages 296 and 297Grant, page 232 There was still much to do on the London extension and associated railways. The ordinary dividend paid by the MS&LR; had been poor for many years, and the huge expenditure on the London extension would need to be serviced. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had been a west-to-east railway, handing over much of its lucrative traffic to partner railways or in some cases to hostile companies. Soon it would have its own line to London, and would earn revenue from mineral traffic to the southern counties. In addition it would serve some of the great towns of the Midlands and the northern Home Counties. The narrative of the next years appears in the article Great Central Railway.

Principal railway stations *Manchester Central *Sheffield Victoria *Lincoln Central *Grimsby Docks Grimsby docks, in later days named \\"the largest fishing port in the world\\" (but also with a large trade in timber) became part of the Railway at its inception.

Once it became railway property, the MS&LR; increased the facilities by starting to construct a New Dock covering 25 acres (10 ha) in 1846; it was opened on 18 April 1852. Over the years more docks were added. At Hull the MS&LR; had a goods depot on Kingston Street, established 1879,Hull Times, 2 August 1879, p. 7 built by and rented from the North Eastern Railway.Tomlinson, The North Eastern Railway, pp. 664, 685 The site of the goods station has been redeveloped as an ice arena, Hull Arena.

Wang Center, located at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, is a building dedicated to understanding Asian and American cultures, and the interactions of these cultures with other world cultures. The center was completed in 2002, and was designed by P.H. Tuan. Building of the center was intended to be funded by Charles B. Wang through a $52 million donation to Stony Brook University, which was then the largest ever private donation to a school in the State University of New York system. Actual construction costs far exceeded the original donation, becoming a source of controversy among students and faculty at the time. The building covers 120,000 square feet (11,000 m¬≤), and is noted for its interior architecture. The building holds numerous conference halls, classrooms (although no classes have been held in the building), auditoriums, a chapel, and an East Asian food court for students. Thus far, the center has been the location for numerous presentations, as well as films, and conferences that deal with multicultural issues.  History  In 1996, Wang announced a donation of $25 million for the construction of an Asian American center on the campus of Stony Brook University. Wang, a graduate of Queens College, chose to donate to Stony Brook University because of its internationally renowned computer science program and its location near the Long Island headquarters of Computer Associates, Inc., his company. Wang was also close friends with Shirley Strum Kenny, Stony Brook's president at the time and the former Queens College president. The donation was the largest ever to a State University of New York campus, and Stony Brook University leased a four-acre plot to Wang for the construction of a 25,000-square-foot building. The construction of the center was met with delays and ultimately fell three years behind schedule as the original plan of a 25,000-square-foot building increased to a 120,000-square-foot complex. The building became controversial for appearing to prioritize Asian cultures over others, Computer Associates' business practices, and Wang's close ties to Kenny. The center formally opened on Tuesday, October 22, 2002 with a ceremony from New York governor George Pataki.  Architecture  The building was designed by architect P.H. Tuan of Oyster Bay, New York. The building is made of brick and white translucent glass panels designed to symbolize rice paper, which were used for windows in ancient Asian architecture. An 80-foot octagonal tower protruding from the center of the building's roof, which contains 20 roof lights and 56 layers of steel, was designed after an abstract pagoda. In the center's outdoor gardens, an arched bridge with steps is reminiscent of Shanghai temples. On the first floor of the Wang Center is an East Asian food court named Jasmine, which includes dining options such as bibimbap, poke bowls and other Chinese, Japanese and Korean foods. In 2019, a 550-square foot Pan-Asian mini grocery store, the Jasmine Market, opened, selling international grocery items, snacks, and beverages.  Mission  The Charles B. Wang Center initiates and collaborates with academic departments, student groups, community organizations, and individuals in presenting the public with a multifaceted, intellectually sound, and humane understanding of East Asian cultures, and their relationship to other cultures. The Wang Center is also a presenting venue for events of cultural, professional and intellectual calibre that are initiated by and involve the various components of Stony Brook University, Long Island communities and organizations, as well as other regional, national, and international constituencies. The Wang Center is non-partisan and non-sectarian, and upholds the values of pluralism, democracy, and equality.  Bridge across cultures  The Charles B. Wang Center building is adorned with a 100-foot octagonal pagoda, a structure traditionally associated with Chinese temples. The Center is an international hub bringing East Asians and Americans into a common space, a marketplace of ideas for the 21st Century. Architect PH Tuan has captured Wang's ideals in a building resonant with the traditions of East Asian design. Spare gray walls, pierced with three red trellis entrances, invite the visitor to explore the treasures of the interior. Within, Tuan has unified the elements of interior space, the outdoors, and the enclosing sky, using wide expanses of glass to frame traditional East Asian gardens, pools, and bridges. The Center has the capability to link scholars and researchers from all over the world in real time, and it welcomes many cultural and artistic activities, especially those that reflect the cultures of East Asia. Scholars, students, international business people, and East Asian-American communities use the facility to build bridges of understanding, exchange information, and celebrate their cultural identities. The main ceremonial entrance leads across an ornamental pool into a spacious reception area. The three-story space is filled with natural light and the sound of fountains that flow from 12 Chinese Zodiac sculptures into the south pool. To the north of the lobby is an expansive outdoor garden, while more intimate interior galleries lie west and south. These are designed as a showcase for cultural displays and art exhibitions of varying sizes. A 239-seat theater hosts audiences for the performing arts and other events. Well equipped with conference facilities, the Center holds two mid-sized lecture halls that are wired for laptops and the most current audiovisual presentations.

There he became a flight surgeon, serving with the Blue Angels flight demonstration squad from 1988‚Äì1990. In 1992 he was selected for NASA's astronaut program and completed training to prepare for space flight. After serving in the astronaut program, he returned full-time to the Navy and served as flight surgeon at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in the San Juan Islands before retiring in the Pacific Northwest. Early life and education Brady was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, to Ann and Charles Brady, Sr. He grew up in the small town of Robbins, where his father was a physician. Brady attended local public schools, graduating from North Moore High School in Robbins in 1969. He had become an Eagle Scout and received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. Brady studied pre-med at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1971. He received his medical degree from Duke University in 1975. From Duke, he went to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville for his internship. Career In 1978 Brady started as the team physician in sports medicine for Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. He continued in sports medicine and family practice for the next seven years, working as a team physician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. =Military career= He joined the U.S. Navy in 1986, receiving training as a flight surgeon at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. In June 1986 Brady reported to Carrier Air Wing Two on board the aircraft carrier USS Ranger; he was assigned to Attack Squadron 145 (VA-145) and Aviation Electronic Countermeasures Squadron 131 (VAQ-131). In 1988 Brady was selected for the Blue Angels, the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, and served with them as flight surgeon through 1990. He was serving in Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) when he learned he had been selected for the astronaut program. =NASA career= Brady was selected by NASA in March 1992 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He was qualified for selection as a Mission Specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Technical assignments included: working technical issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); astronaut representative to the Human Research Policy and Procedures Committee; deputy chief for Space Shuttle astronaut training; and chief for Space Station astronaut training in the Mission Operations Division. He flew on STS-78 in 1996 and logged over 405 hours, more than 16 days, in space. As an astronaut and amateur radio enthusiast, callsign N4BQW, Brady was one of the pioneers of the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX), and a member of the American Radio Relay League. STS-78 STS-78 launched on June 20, 1996, and landed 16 days and 21 hours later on July 7, 1996, becoming the longest Space Shuttle mission to date. (Later that year the STS-80 mission broke that record by nineteen hours). The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station. The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations, and five space agencies, and the international crew included a Frenchman, a Canadian, a Spaniard, and an Italian. While with NASA, Brady held a number of jobs with the agency's astronaut office. He was chief of space station astronaut training before leaving to return to Navy duty, where he reached the rank of captain. He enjoyed canoeing, kayaking, tennis, biking, and amateur radio operating. Later years In 2000, Brady was assigned as flight surgeon to Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Washington state. He retired from the Navy in March 2006, after suffering for years from a severe kind of arthritis.\\"Deaths: Charles Brady, 54, former astronaut\\", Houston Chronicle, 1 August 2006; accessed 30 October 2017 He had enjoyed an active outdoor life and made several expeditions with a ham radio group to small islands in the South Pacific. Brady died on July 23, 2006. He was survived by his fianc√©e, Susen Oseth, their son, Charles \\"Charlie\\" Brady III, his mother Ann Brady, and sister Jery Ann Kennedy. His father was deceased. When NASA announced his death, it said he had suffered from a lengthy illness, and this was reported by most major sources. A few days later, the Houston Chronicle reported the county sheriff's statement that Brady had died of self-inflicted wounds after suffering a long illness related to arthritis. He was buried near his father in Robbins, North Carolina. It was not until a year later, in the context of reporting on other astronauts, that the media reported more widely that Brady had committed suicide. NASA internal emails related to Brady, which were released under the Freedom of Information Act, documented health issues and noted there was an investigation of his suicide, including interviews with family and friends.

It follows the mishaps and adventures of three bachelors as they attempt to adapt their lives to pseudo-fatherhood with the arrival of the love child of one of them. The script was based on the 1985 French film (Three Men and a Cradle). The film was the biggest American box office hit of that year, surpassing Fatal Attraction and eventually grossing $167 million in the United States and Canada and $240 million worldwide. The film won the 1988 People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy Motion Picture. Plot Architect Peter Mitchell (Tom Selleck), satirist Michael Kellam (Steve Guttenberg), and actor Jack Holden (Ted Danson) are happy bachelors in their shared New York City apartment, with frequent parties and flings with women. One day, a baby named Mary arrives on their doorstep with a note revealing she is the result of Jack‚Äôs tryst with an actress named Sylvia during a Stratford Festival Shakespearean production a year prior. Jack is in Turkey shooting a B movie, and made arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment. Jack asked Peter and Michael to keep the delivery a secret per his friend's wishes; when Mary arrives, they mistakenly believe she is the ‚Äúpackage.‚Äù Peter and Michael are totally befuddled how to care for Mary, and Peter leaves to buy supplies. Their landlady Mrs. Hathaway (Cynthia Harris) delivers a small box ‚Äì the actual \\"package\\" of heroin ‚Äì which Michael tosses aside. Peter and Michael learn to properly care for Mary, including diaper changes, baths, and feedings. The next day, two drug dealers arrive at the apartment to retrieve the package. Peter and Michael mistakenly give them Mary, along with a can of powdered milk the dealers believe is the heroin. Peter discovers the actual package; realizing the mix-up, he runs downstairs but trips, spilling the package's contents. He gathers up the drugs and confronts the men outside, causing a scuffle. A police officer on horseback intervenes; Peter rescues Mary, but the dealers flee with the can of powdered milk. The officer detains Peter and Michael at the apartment until Sgt. Melkowitz (Philip Bosco), a narcotics officer, arrives to question them. Jack calls from Turkey, but Peter and Michael are unable to talk openly as they are being recorded. They successfully hide the drugs and learn that Jack's friend Paul Milner is also a drug dealer. A suspicious Melkowitz puts them under surveillance. Mrs. Hathaway is persuaded to babysit Mary while Peter and Michael leave for work. Returning home, they find Mrs. Hathaway bound and gagged and the apartment ransacked by the dealers, but Mary safe; a note threatens, \\"Next time we'll take the baby\\". Peter and Michael continue to care for Mary, adjusting to surrogate fatherhood and growing attached to her. Peter incapacitates an intruder, who turns out to be Jack, returning early after his movie role was cut. Jack assures Peter and Michael he knew nothing about the heroin. He initially denies his connection to Mary, but Sylvia‚Äôs note convinces him he is Mary‚Äôs father. Peter and Michael pass all parenting responsibility to Jack, who quickly grows to love her. They receive a news clipping in the mail ‚Äì Milner has been attacked by the drug dealers and hospitalized ‚Äì with another threat: ‚ÄúDon't let this happen to you!‚Äù Peter, Michael, and Jack formulate a plan to trap the dealers, and arrange a meeting. Jack, disguised as a pregnant woman, leaves the building with Mary, while Peter and Michael leave in a cab, followed by undercover officers, but manage to lose them in another cab driven by Jack. The three meet the dealers at the top floor of a construction site. Michael, hidden in the vents, records Peter‚Äôs conversation with the dealers but falls into the room, and a chase ensues. They manage to trap the dealers in an elevator as the police arrive. With the recording, they prove their innocence to Melkowitz and the dealers are arrested. Peter, Michael, and Jack fully embrace their role as Mary's guardians, until Sylvia (Nancy Travis) arrives to take Mary with her to London. After Sylvia leaves with Mary, the three realize how desperately they miss the baby. They race to the airport just as Sylvia‚Äôs British Airways plane, a Boeing 747 called the City of Belfast, departs for London. Defeated, they return home to find Sylvia and Mary at the door. Sylvia tearfully explains she doesn‚Äôt want to give up her acting career but must if she has to raise Mary alone. The three invite her and Mary to move in with them; she accepts, and the four of them live happily with the baby. Cast Production Mary was played by twins Lisa and Michelle Blair. The soundtrack included the Peter Cetera song \\"Daddy's Girl\\", which was used for the movie's big music montage sequence, the Miami Sound Machine song \\"Bad Boy,\\" which opened it, and the John Parr song \\"The Minute I Saw You\\", which ended the film. Urban legend Shots from the film showing what some believe are a shotgun and a young boy Just over an hour into the final cut of the film, there is a scene that shows Jack and his mother (played by Celeste Holm) walking through the house with Mary. As they do so, they pass a background window on the left-hand side of the screen, and a black outline that appears to resemble a rifle pointed downward can be seen behind the curtains. As they walk back past the window 40 seconds later, a human figure can be seen in that window. A persistent urban legend began circulating August 1990 (shortly before the sequel, Three Men and a Little Lady, premiered) that this was the ghost of a boy who had been killed in the house where the film (or this scene) was filmed. The most common version of this rumor was that a nine-year-old boy committed suicide with a shotgun there, explaining why it was vacant: because the grieving family left. This notion was discussed on the first episode of TV Land: Myths and Legends in January 2007, and was referenced in \\"Hollywood Babylon\\", a second-season episode of the TV series Supernatural. Danson's character standing next to a cardboard cutout of himself. The figure is actually a cardboard cutout \\"standee\\" of Jack, wearing a tuxedo and top hat, that was left on the set. It was created as part of the storyline, in which he, an actor, appears in a dog food commercial, but this portion was cut from the final version of the film. The standee does show up later in the film, however, when Jack stands next to it as Sylvia comes to reclaim Mary. Snopes.com contends that the one in the first scene looks smaller from its appearance in the later scene because of the distance and angle of the shot, and because the curtains obscure its outstretched arms. As for the contention that a boy died in the house, all the indoor scenes were shot on a Toronto sound stage, and no kind of residential dwellings were used for interior filming. Reception =Critical response= The critical response to Three Men and a Baby was generally positive. The film holds a 75% \\"fresh\\" rating on the movie review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 36 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"The American remake of the popular French comedy mostly works a charm under the combined talents of the three leads, who play nicely against type ‚Äì although forced plot elements and sentimentality at times dampen the fun.\\" The film critic Roger Ebert, despite noting several aspects he saw as flaws, praised the film, remarking, \\"Because of Selleck and his co-stars... the movie becomes a heartwarming entertainment\\". He gave it 3 (out of four) stars. Metacritic gave the film a score of 61 based on 16 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. =Box office= The film opened in theaters on Wednesday, November 25, 1987. It grossed $168 million in the United States and Canada and $72 million overseas for a worldwide gross of $240 million. It was notable for the Walt Disney Studios since it was the first production from the studio to gross over $100 million domestically in its initial run. It was the highest- grossing film of 1987 domestically, with an estimated 42 million tickets sold in the US. Sequel The film was followed by a 1990 sequel, Three Men and a Little Lady. In June 2010 it was announced that Disney was interested in filming a third film, tentatively titled Three Men and a Bride. , the film was still listed as being in development. Remakes This film was remade as Thoovalsparsham (1990) in Malayalam, which was remade as Chinnari Muddula Papa (1990) in Telugu, as Thayamma (1991) in Tamil, as Asathal (2001) in Tamil and Heyy Babyy (2007) in Hindi. An American remake is being produced for Disney+, starring Zac Efron.

They are primarily used in commercial applications. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.Pankaj Gupta, Ashish Goel, Jimmy Lin, Aneesh Sharma, Dong Wang, and Reza Bosagh Zadeh WTF:The who-to-follow system at Twitter, Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts,H. Chen, A. G.

Overview  Recommender systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering (also known as the personality-based approach),Hosein Jafarkarimi; A.T.H. Sim and R. Saadatdoost A Na√Øve Recommendation Model for Large Databases, International Journal of Information and Education Technology, June 2012 as well as other systems such as knowledge-based systems. Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.Prem Melville and Vikas Sindhwani, Recommender Systems, Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, 2010. Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. Current recommender systems typically combine one or more approaches into a hybrid system. The differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two early music recommender systems ‚Äì Last.fm and Pandora Radio. * Last.fm creates a \\"station\\" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique. * Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the Music Genome Project) to seed a \\"station\\" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user \\"dislikes\\" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user \\"likes\\" a song. This is an example of a content-based approach. Each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the cold start problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems. Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start, it is far more limited in scope (for example, it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed). Recommender systems are a useful alternative to search algorithms since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise. Of note, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data. Recommender systems were first mentioned in a technical report as a \\"digital bookshelf\\" in 1990 by Jussi Karlgren at Columbia University,Karlgren, Jussi. 1990. \\"An Algebra for Recommendations.\\" Syslab Working Paper 179 (1990). and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from 1994 onwards by Jussi Karlgren, then at SICS, Karlgren, Jussi. \\"Newsgroup Clustering Based On User Behavior-A Recommendation Algebra.\\" SICS Research Report (1994). and research groups led by Pattie Maes at MIT, Shardanand, Upendra, and Pattie Maes. \\"Social information filtering: algorithms for automating ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù.\\" In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems, pp. 210-217.

Approaches  = Collaborative filtering = An example of collaborative filtering based on a ratings system One approach to the design of recommender systems that has wide use is collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past. The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood. Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is the user- based algorithm, while that of model-based approaches is the Kernel-Mapping Recommender. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \\"understanding\\" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) approach, and the Pearson Correlation as first implemented by Allen. When building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and implicit forms of data collection. Examples of explicit data collection include the following: * Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale. * Asking a user to search. * Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite. * Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them. * Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes (see Rocchio classification or other similar techniques). Examples of implicit data collection include the following: * Observing the items that a user views in an online store. * Analyzing item/user viewing times.. * Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online. * Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer. * Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes. Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: cold start, scalability, and sparsity.Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem, Discovery Science, 2007. * Cold start: For a new user or item, there isn't enough data to make accurate recommendations. * Scalability: In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations. * Sparsity: The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings. One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by Amazon.com's recommender system.Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings Many social networks originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook, Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35 Collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems. = Content-based filtering = Another common approach when designing recommender systems is content-based filtering. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences. These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user- specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features. In this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present. It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in information retrieval and information filtering research. To create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information: 1\\\\. A model of the user's preference. 2\\\\. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system. Basically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the tf‚Äìidf representation (also called vector space representation).D.H. Wang, Y.C. Liang, D.Xu, X.Y. Feng, R.C. Guan(2018), \\"A content-based recommender system for computer science publications\\", Knowledge-Based Systems, 157: 1-9 The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as Bayesian Classifiers, cluster analysis, decision trees, and artificial neural networks in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item. A key issue with content- based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing. To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of hybrid system. Content-based recommender systems can also include opinion-based recommender systems. In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and users' evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved meta-data of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like meta-data, extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users' rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including text mining, information retrieval, sentiment analysis (see also Multimodal sentiment analysis) and deep learning X.Y. Feng, H. Zhang, Y.J. Ren, P.H. Shang, Y. Zhu, Y.C. Liang, R.C. Guan, D. Xu, (2019), \\"The Deep Learning‚ÄìBased Recommender System ‚ÄúPubmender‚Äù for Choosing a Biomedical Publication Venue: Development and Validation Study\\", Journal of Medical Internet Research, 21 (5): e12957. = Multi-criteria recommender systems = Multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria. Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion value, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems. See this chapter for an extended introduction. = Risk-aware recommender systems = The majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information, yet do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications. It is important to consider the risk of upsetting the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process. One option to manage this issue is DRARS, a system which models the context-aware recommendation as a bandit problem. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm. = Mobile recommender systems = Mobile recommender systems make use of internet-accessing smart phones to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations. This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with. It is heterogeneous, noisy, requires spatial and temporal auto- correlation, and has validation and generality problems. There are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results: the context, the recommendation method and privacy. Additionally, mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem ‚Äì recommendations may not apply in all regions (for instance, it would be unwise to recommend a recipe in an area where all of the ingredients may not be available). One example of a mobile recommender system are the approaches taken by companies such as Uber and Lyft to generate driving routes for taxi drivers in a city. This system uses GPS data of the routes that taxi drivers take while working, which includes location (latitude and longitude), time stamps, and operational status (with or without passengers). It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits. Mobile recommendation systems have also been successfully built using the \\"Web of Data\\" as a source for structured information. A good example of such system is SMARTMUSEUM The system uses semantic modelling, information retrieval, and machine learning techniques in order to recommend content matching user interests, even when presented with sparse or minimal user data. = Hybrid recommender systems = Most recommender systems now use a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other approaches . There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies that empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem, as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in knowledge-based approaches.Rinke Hoekstra, The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck, Semantic Web ‚Äì Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems. The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering). Some hybridization techniques include: *Weighted: Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically. *Switching: Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one. *Mixed: Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation. *Feature Combination: Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm. *Feature Augmentation: Computing a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique. *Cascade: Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones. *Meta-level: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.Robin Burke, Hybrid Web Recommender Systems , pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.  The Netflix Prize  One of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the Netflix Prize. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules. The most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction. As stated by the winners, Bell et al.: > Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple > predictors. Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in > deriving substantially different approaches, rather than refining a single > technique. Consequently, our solution is an ensemble of many methods. Many benefits accrued to the web due to the Netflix project. Some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets. Some members from the team that finished second place founded Gravity R&D;, a recommendation engine that's active in the RecSys community. 4-Tell, Inc. created a Netflix project‚Äìderived solution for ecommerce websites. A number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by Netflix for the Netflix Prize competition. Although the data sets were anonymized in order to preserve customer privacy, in 2007 two researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database.Rise of the Netflix Hackers As a result, in December 2009, an anonymous Netflix user sued Netflix in Doe v. Netflix, alleging that Netflix had violated United States fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act by releasing the datasets. This, as well as concerns from the Federal Trade Commission, led to the cancellation of a second Netflix Prize competition in 2010.  Performance measures  Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms. To measure the effectiveness of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of evaluations are available: user studies, online evaluations (A/B tests), and offline evaluations. The commonly used metrics are the mean squared error and root mean squared error, the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: Temporal diversity in recommender systems. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210‚Äì217. ACM, New York However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized. User studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as conversion rate or click-through rate. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies. The effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers. For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests. A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms. Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction. This is probably because offline training is highly biased toward the highly reachable items, and offline testing data is highly influenced by the outputs of the online recommendation module. Researchers have concluded that the results of offline evaluations should be viewed critically. = Beyond accuracy = Typically, research on recommender systems is concerned about finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. However, there are a number of factors that are also important. *Diversity ‚Äì Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity, e.g. items from different artists. *Recommender persistence ‚Äì In some situations, it is more effective to re-show recommendations, or let users re-rate items, than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time, for instance, because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully. *Privacy ‚Äì Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns because users have to reveal sensitive information. Building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view. Many European countries have a strong culture of data privacy, and every attempt to introduce any level of user profiling can result in a negative customer response. Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space. The Netflix Prize is particularly notable for the detailed personal information released in its dataset. Ramakrishnan et al. have conducted an extensive overview of the trade-offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties (an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations) and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset. *User demographics ‚Äì Beel et al. found that user demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations. In their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users. *Robustness ‚Äì When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed. *Serendipity ‚Äì Serendipity is a measure of \\"how surprising the recommendations are\\". For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate, but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy. *Trust ‚Äì A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system. Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item. *Labelling ‚Äì User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations. For instance, in the cited study click-through rate (CTR) for recommendations labeled as \\"Sponsored\\" were lower (CTR=5.93%) than CTR for identical recommendations labeled as \\"Organic\\" (CTR=8.86%). Recommendations with no label performed best (CTR=9.87%) in that study. = Reproducibility crisis = The field of recommender systems has been impacted by the replication crisis as well. A systematic analysis of publications applying deep learning or neural methods to the top-k recommendation problem, published in top conferences (SIGIR, KDD, WWW, RecSys), has shown that on average less than 40% of articles are reproducible, with as little as 14% in some conferences. Overall the study identifies 18 articles, only 7 of them could be reproduced and 6 of them could be outperformed by much older and simpler properly tuned baselines. The article also highlights a number of potential problems in today's research scholarship and calls for improved scientific practices in that area. Similar issues have been spotted also in sequence-aware recommender systems. Previous research was also found had little impact on the practical application of recommender systems. By 2011, Ekstrand, Konstan, et al. criticized that \\"it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results,‚Äù and that evaluations are ‚Äúnot handled consistently\\". Konstan and Adomavicius conclude that \\"the Recommender Systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge [‚Ä¶] often because the research lacks the [‚Ä¶] evaluation to be properly judged and, hence, to provide meaningful contributions.\\" As a consequence, much research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible. Hence, operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question, which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems. Said & Bellog√≠n conducted a study of papers published in the field, as well as benchmarked some of the most popular frameworks for recommendation and found large inconsistencies in results, even when the same algorithms and data sets were used. Some researchers demonstrated that minor variations in the recommendation algorithms or scenarios led to strong changes in the effectiveness of a recommender system. They conclude that seven actions are necessary to improve the current situation: \\"(1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research.\\"  See also  * Rating site * Cold start * Collaborative filtering * Collective intelligence * Content discovery platform * Enterprise bookmarking * Filter bubble * Personalized marketing * Preference elicitation * Product finder * Configurator * Pattern recognition  References  Further reading  ;Books Kim Falk (January 2019), Practical Recommender Systems, Manning Publications,  ;Scientific articles * Prem Melville, Raymond J.

See https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/170  Exclusions of certain amounts from deduction  Certain portions of the market value of non-cash donations, such as short-term capital gains, are made non-deductible by I.R.C. 170(e)(1)(A).  Organization eligibility  An organization must meet certain requirements set forth in the code. Some organizations must also file a request with the Internal Revenue Service to gain status as a tax-exempt non- profit charitable organization under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code. A non- exhaustive list of organizations that may meet the Federal requirements are as follows: *Synagogues, churches and other religious organizations; *A fraternal order or lodge *An organization of war veterans *Any level of government if the contribution is made for exclusively public purposes *An organization dedicated to the improvement of public health in the U.S. or abroad There are both public and private charities. Public charities are far more common.  Effect of benefit to donor  Contributions to charitable organizations are deductible to the donor, unless the donee organization uses any of its net earnings to benefit a private shareholder, or if it attempts to in any way influence political campaigns or legislation. A contribution to a charitable organization need not be fully a \\"gift\\" in the statutory sense of the word to be deductible to the donor. The donor's allowable deduction will be reduced, however, by the amount of the \\"substantial benefit\\" conferred upon them as a result of their contribution. To illustrate, suppose that the American Cancer Society is hosting a formal dance as a fund-raiser (the ACS is a certified charitable organization). Further suppose that the fair market value of a ticket to the dance is $75, and that the donor pays $375 to purchase a ticket. The donor may claim only a $300 deduction, because the amount contributed ($375) is reduced by the amount of the benefit that he received ($75, the fair market value of the ticket). This holds true even if the donor does not actually attend the dance. The taxable income of the donor is reduced by $300. If the donor's income was in the 35% income tax bracket both before and after the deduction, the donor's tax liability (amount of taxes owed to the government) is reduced by $105.  Types of contributions  The particular tax consequences of a donor's charitable contribution depends on the type of contribution that he makes. A taxpayer may contribute services, cash, or property to a charity. There are a number of traps, especially that donations of short-term capital gains are generally not tax deductible. = Services = If the donor is contributing his services to a charity, he is not entitled to a deduction for those services. He is however, entitled to deduct his unreimbursed expenses that he incurred in rendering them (except for child care expenses, which are considered non-deductible personal expenses). Example Joy is a professional soccer player who lives in San Diego. She decides to volunteer her time at a non-profit (certified charity) soccer camp, located in Los Angeles for a week. In the ordinary course of things, Joy would charge $10,000 for these services, plus costs of transportation, board, and child care. Assume that Joy's driving costs (gas money, oil change, etc.) amount to $150, the cost of a hotel room for the week is $400, and the cost of child care for her two kids is $500 for the week. Joy is not entitled to deduct the $10,000 value of \\"free services\\" that she performed. Nor is she entitled to deduct the $500 of child care expenses incurred in the week she was volunteering. However, Joy may deduct the $150 car expenses, as well as the $400 hotel expenses incurred in her time volunteering at the camp, for a total deduction of $550. = Cash = If the donor is contributing cash to the charity, the general rule is that there is only one limitation on the total amount that he is entitled to deduct: He may only deduct his contribution to the extent that it does not exceed 50% of his adjusted gross income. Any amount not deducted in the year he makes the contribution may be carried forward and taken the next year for up to 5 years. Ordinary assets and short- term capital gain assets (see below) are treated like cash for purposes of the 50% cap. Example To illustrate, suppose that the donor has an adjusted gross income of $100,000. In the year 2004, he gives $60,000 in cash to the American Cancer Society. The donor may deduct only $50,000 in 2004. Why? Because anything over that amount is in excess of 50% of his adjusted gross income (100,000 adjusted gross income √ó 50% = 50,000). The remaining $10,000 (60,000 total donation ‚àí 50,000 deducted in 2004 = 10,000) carries forward to 2005, at which point he may deduct it. = Property = If the donor is contributing appreciated property, he is entitled to deduct the value of that property on his tax return for that year. Neither he nor the donee organization will pay tax on the appreciation in the property. As is common in federal income taxation, there are several special rules and limitations that apply: Ordinary income-producing property and short-term capital gain property If the property that the donor is contributing would have produced either only an ordinary gain or a short-term capital gain had he sold it, then he may deduct only his adjusted basis in the contributed property. The taxpayer may not deduct contributions in an amount greater than 50% of his adjusted gross income (AGI) in the year of donation. Any excess may be carried forward for up to 5 years and may be deducted subject to the same limitations. =Example= Abby, our taxpayer, owns a sporting goods store. Her business is doing well so she decides to donate some of last season's inventory to The Women's Sports Foundation, a certified charitable organization. Abby's adjusted gross income this year is $700,000. The fair market value of Abby's donated inventory is $600,000. Her adjusted basis in the inventory is $400,000. If Abby had sold the inventory, she would have recognized an ordinary gain of $200,000 (fmv of $600,000 ‚àí adjusted basis of $400,000 = $200,000). To determine the amount that she may deduct as a charitable contribution, Abby must subtract the ordinary gain inherent in the inventory (the $200,000) from the inventory's fair market value (the $600,000). Thus, the amount of Abby's gift is $400,000 (fmv of $600,000 ‚àí inventory's inherent ordinary gain of $200,000 = $400,000 gift). But remember, Abby may not deduct any contributions over 50% of her adjusted gross income. Recall that Abby's AGI is $700,000. The amount of her gift is $400,000. The result? Since 50% of her AGI equals $350,000 ($700,000 √ó .50 = $350,000), Abby may only deduct $350,000 of the 400,000 gift in the year that she donated it. However, assuming her AGI in year two remains at least $100,001, and assuming that Abby makes no charitable contributions in year two, she may carry over the $50,000 (400,000 gift ‚àí 350,000 year one deduction = 50,000 carry over) to year two, and deduct it on her tax return that year. Long-term capital gain property Charitable donations to public charities and private foundations are subject to overall caps of 50% and 30%, respectively. For example, if a taxpayer contributes cash or short term capital gain property to a public charity, and that cash and property is greater than 50% of his or her adjusted gross income, then any additional contribution (including long term capital gain property) to any charity in that same year can not be deducted. If a donor is contributing property that would have yielded a long-term capital gain in a sale, then the deduction for the contribution is limited to 30% of donor's adjusted gross income in the year of donation if the donee is a public charity, and limited to 20% if the donee is a private foundation. Contributions over the respective AGI thresholds may be carried forward for five years, and may be deducted in subsequent years pursuant to the same restrictions. This restriction helps certain investors avoid giving themselves into such a low bracket that the tax value of the donation is impaired. Short-term capital gain property A trap for the unwary U.S. investor with an asset on which there have been gains in value who contributes the asset before the gains become long-term. The premature gift forfeits deduction of the short-term gains. The asset can be deducted only up to the amount of its basis, and not up to the amount of its appreciated market value. Only an investor who holds the asset until the capital gains have become long-term is allowed to deduct the appreciated market value. Internal Revenue Code 170(e)(1)(A) provides: (e) Certain contributions of ordinary income and capital gain property (1) General rule The amount of any charitable contribution of property otherwise taken into account under this section shall be reduced by the sum of‚Äî (A) the amount of gain which would not have been long-term capital gain if the property contributed had been sold by the taxpayer at its fair market value (determined at the time of such contribution) ... Short-term capital loss property A further trap awaits the unwary U.S. investor who donates depreciated assets‚Äîassets on which there have been losses in value‚Äîto charity. The gift actually forfeit the tax deductibility of the capital losses, and only the depreciated (low) market value at the time of the gift is allowed to be deducted, rather than the higher basis. However an investor can instead sell the depreciated assets before considering a donation. An investor who sells can realize the resultant capital loss, which may then be deducted under the applicable capital loss rules. The cash proceeds after liquidating the depreciated asset may of course be donated to charity and deducted following the sale, but the tax advantages of making such donation are no better or worse than in any cash donation to charity. In any case, such a course leaves the investor more after-tax assets to donate if so inclined. See also * Davis v.

His recreational interests include fishing, hiking, jogging, all sports and chess. He married the former Lynne A. Anderson of River Grove, Illinois; they have two daughters: Kristin Elizabeth (born October 21, 1981) and Karin Alison (born May 18, 1986). Education * 1969: Graduated from Valparaiso High School, Valparaiso, Indiana * 1973: Received a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana * 1980: Received a Master of Science degree in astronautical engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology, Dayton, Ohio Air Force experience Following graduation from Purdue in 1973, Brown was commissioned in the U.S. Air Force and received his pilot wings at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, in 1974. He was then assigned to the 87th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base, Michigan, where he flew both T-33 and F-106 aircraft. Brown graduated from the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in 1975. He was transferred to the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and earned his master's degree in astronautical engineering in 1980. Two years later, he graduated from the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. NASA career Brown was assigned to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1980. Assigned as an engineer in the Flight Activities Section, he participated in the development of contingency procedures for use aboard the Space Shuttle and served as an attitude and pointing officer. Brown supported STS flights 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 41-C in the Flight Activity Officer/Staff Support Room of the Mission Control Center. Selected by NASA in May 1984, Brown became an astronaut in June 1985, and qualified for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. In December 1985, he was assigned to the crew of STS-61-N, a Department of Defense mission which was subsequently canceled due to the Challenger disaster. During 1986 and 1987, he was an astronaut member of the solid rocket booster redesign team. In February 1988, Brown was assigned to a new flight crew. He flew on STS-28 (August 8‚Äì13, 1989), following which he served as astronaut member on the Space Station Freedom Program. He next flew on STS-48 (September 12‚Äì18, 1991). With the completion of his second mission, Brown had logged over 249 hours in space. On his first space flight, Brown was a mission specialist on the crew of STS-28. The orbiter Columbia was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 8, 1989. The mission carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 13, 1989. Brown next flew on the crew of STS-48 aboard the orbiter Discovery which was launched from Kennedy Space Center on September 12, 1991. This was a five- day mission during which the crew deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) which is designed to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere's chemistry, winds and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. The mission was accomplished in 81 orbits of the Earth and concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base on September 18, 1991.

Musically, Red Abyss drew on jazz, funk and rock influences dominated by singer Julie Worland's Janis Joplin‚Äìinfluenced vocals. In time, their music took on harder punk and metal influences. Red Abyss became Rockbitch with the lineup change of Jo Heeley on drums. The lineup varied over the years to include 'Luci the Stage Slut', 'The Haema-Whore', and Kali and Erzulie‚Äîthe 'Sex Magik Priestesses'. The former two were primarily a combination of sexual performance artists and gonzo-camera team, capturing closeups of stage action projected on the wall behind the band while performing. They were also responsible for the cued playing of prepared art videos of subject matter relating to the songs. This included female genital mutilation, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and menstruation taboos. The band toured Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, the UK (but were banned from venues in Scotland), Italy, Spain, Finland, Slovenia, Czech Republic and Estonia, as well as a promotional tour in Canada. Rockbitch became infamous not only for performing live sex acts but also doing so with audience members via \\"The Golden Condom\\". During their shows, a condom was tossed into the crowd; whoever caught it (male or female) was taken backstage for sexual acts with band members. The members of the band lived together as a polyamorous commune in a house in France. Rockbitch toured widely from approximately 1998 until 2002, meeting increasing resistance from authorities, particularly English, German and Norwegian town councils who often banned their concerts. The band were often forced to find alternative venues to perform. After an event in Almelo, Netherlands, TVAmsterdam arranged a concert in Zaandam, recording the experience and adding extra footage to create the documentary \\"Bitchcraft\\". Babe stated in 2002, \\"Rockbitch had no problem with lads out for seeing breasts, as they were a component of the audience, there were always others seeing the deeper meaning and both groups had a good time. They generally made up for a great combined atmosphere\\". The Rockbitch line-up became entirely female in 2000. Original lead guitarist Tony \\"The Beast\\" Skinner retired, taking over management/production. Lisa \\"Babe\\" Wills took lead guitar duties, while Luci, previously \\"Stage Slut\\" (one of the nude dancers and sexual band/crowd liaisons), took over rhythm guitar. In 1997, Rockbitch made tabloid headlines after they played at a school for pre- teen children, although for this particular concert they changed their name to \\"Rocky Beaches\\", wore modest clothes, and sang non-sexual songs. Activism Members lent their voices to female and sexual issues, were winners of the yearly prize at the Sex Maniacs Ball (now Night of the Senses) founded by Tuppy Owens, openly voiced their admiration for sexual politics icons such as Annie Sprinkle and Betty Dodson, and generally advocated for open female sexuality as a healthy part of human nature. In an extension of the 1970s feminist statement that ‚Äòthe personal is the political‚Äô, they stated that no feminist movement was complete without female sexuality being reexamined, redefined and expressed in whatever shape it took by women themselves. They saw rock music as the perfect medium to do so, as it had been the arena for the expression of masculine sexuality for so long, whereas women's bodies were often a marketing spice to add interest to a product rather than a source of personal empowerment. Dissolution After the release of its first studio album, Motor Driven Bimbo, Rockbitch were increasingly pressured to censor their stage performances by their record company. They refused and successfully negotiated a release from their contract. A second, goth- influenced album, titled Psychic Attack, was never released. The band took care never to break any laws regarding the content of their stage shows in any country or territory. Continued attention from British police about their sexually driven themes and performances combined with local council opposition to their adult-only shows. Underhanded pressure on venue owners regarding liquor and performance licenses resulted in difficulties performing live‚Äîeven when venue owners were positive towards the band. Tours were booked and then dates pulled with only days to spare. The frustration and problems this created led to Rockbitch ceasing performing live in 2002. Rockbitch were the subject of many documentaries and featured in many shows. Amongst others, Rockbitch were the subject of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Choice the same year. A further, hour-long documentary was broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK in 2003. Award-winning director Norman Hull made ‚ÄòThis is Rockbitch‚Äô in 2003. They can still be spotted in repeats of ‚ÄòSexcetera‚Äô. In 2005, the entire latter-day Rockbitch lineup emerged under the name MT-TV. This was a music- only project‚Äîno sex or nudity of the Rockbitch days‚Äîbut it incorporated stage theatrics and provided sociosexual-based political comment through its lyrics. After a UK tour in summer 2005, they performed throughout the United States. The first part of their US tour was documented on the DVD 'Shevolution', released by Blackwing Films in 2006. The most recent program, released in 2017, is a Swedish documentary on the rise in popularity of witchcraft and its feminist connections. The first film crew to be allowed access behind the commune walls since the cessation of the Rockbitch live performances, the documentary contains a recap of their musical career, and provides insight into their pagan/witchcraft roots with how it underpinned their music and interviews with Babe. Amanda and Jo subsequently went on to form the band Syren with singer/songwriter Erin Bennett, who joined the Rockbitch commune in 2006. In 2012, Jo died of breast cancer. Amanda gave up her musical career shortly after. Erin Bennett subsequently continued as a solo artist with a backing band that contains some ex-members of Rockbitch, discarding the name Syren and performing as Erin Bennett and the EB Band. In the last two years, the band have undergone a complete rebranding and are now touring as a ProgRock band under the name EBB. Julie, the lead singer of Rockbitch, continues her musical career under the name Krow, creating hard dance music in the style of Noise Terror Punk EDM. Her music and video were also featured in the Swedish documentary.

Its name is associated with the mythical condition of lycanthropy, a supernatural affliction in which humans are said to physically shapeshift into wolves. It is purported to be a rare disorder. Signs and symptoms Affected individuals believe that they are in the process of transforming into an animal or have already transformed into an animal. It has been associated with the altered states of mind that accompany psychosis (the mental state that typically involves delusions and hallucinations) with the transformation only seeming to happen in the mind and behavior of the affected person. A study on lycanthropy from the McLean Hospital reported on a series of cases and proposed some diagnostic criteria by which lycanthropy could be recognised: * A patient reports in a moment of lucidity or reminiscence that they sometimes feel as an animal or have felt like one. * A patient behaves in a manner that resembles animal behavior, for example howling, growling, or crawling. According to these criteria, either a delusional belief in current or past transformation or behavior that suggests a person thinks of themselves as transformed is considered evidence of clinical lycanthropy. The authors note that, although the condition seems to be an expression of psychosis, there is no specific diagnosis of mental or neurological illness associated with its behavioral consequences. It also seems that lycanthropy is not specific to an experience of human-to-wolf transformation; a wide variety of creatures have been reported as part of the shape-shifting experience. A review of the medical literature from early 2004 lists over thirty published cases of lycanthropy, only the minority of which have wolf or dog themes. Canines are certainly not uncommon, although the experience of being transformed into a hyena, cat, horse, bird or tiger has been reported on more than one occasion. Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was usual (:ja:ÁãêÊÜë„Åç, :ja:Áä¨Á•û). A 1989 case study described how one individual reported a serial transformation, experiencing a change from human to dog, to horse, and then finally cat, before returning to the reality of human existence after treatment. There are also reports of people who experienced transformation into an animal only listed as \\"unspecified\\". There is a case study of a psychiatric patient who had both clinical lycanthropy and Cotard delusion.Nejad, A. G., Toofani, K. (2005). \\"Co-Existence of Lycanthropy and Cotard's Syndrome in a Single Case\\". Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica 111: 250‚Äì252. The term ophidianthropy refers to the delusion that one has been transformed into a snake. Two case studies have been reported.Kattimani, S, Menon, V., Srivastava, M.K. & Aniruddha Mukharjee, A. (2010). \\"Ophidianthropy: The Case of a Woman Who 'Turned into a Snake . Psychiatry Reports.Mondal et al. (2014). \\"The 'Snake' Man: Ophidianthropy in a Case of Schizophrenia, Along With Literature Review\\". Asian Journal of Psychiatry 12: 148‚Äì149. Proposed mechanisms Clinical lycanthropy is a very rare condition and is largely considered to be an idiosyncratic expression of a psychotic episode caused by another condition such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or clinical depression. However, there are suggestions that certain neurological conditions and cultural influences may result in the expression of the human- animal transformation theme that defines the condition. =Neurological factors= One important factor may be differences or changes in parts of the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image). A neuroimaging study of two people diagnosed with clinical lycanthropy showed that these areas display unusual activation, suggesting that when people report their bodies are changing shape, they may be genuinely perceiving those feelings. Related disorders In rare cases, individuals may believe that other people have transformed into animals.Nejad, A. G. (2007). Belief in Transforming Another Person into a Wolf: Could it be a Variant of Lycanthropy? Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica 115: 159‚Äì161. This has been termed \\"lycanthropic intermetamorphosis\\" and \\"lycanthropy spectrum\\". A 2009 study reported that, after the consumption of the drug MDMA (Ecstasy), a man displayed symptoms of paranoid psychosis by claiming that his relatives had changed into various animals such as a boar, a donkey and a horse.Nasirian et al. (2009). \\"Rare Variant of Lycanthropy and Ecstasy\\" . Addiction and Health 1: 53‚Äì56. History Catherine Clark Kroeger has written that several parts of the Bible refer to King Nebuchadnezzar's behavior in the book of Daniel 4 as a being manifestation of clinical lycanthropy. Neurologist Andrew J. Larner has written that the fate of Odysseus's crew due to the magic of Circe may be one of the earliest examples of clinical lycanthropy. It is believed that the king of Armenia, Tiridates III, also suffered from this disorder. He was cured by Gregory the Illuminator. According to Persian tradition, the Buyid prince Majd ad-Dawla was suffering from an illusion that he was a cow. He was cured by Avicenna. Notions that lycanthropy was due to a medical condition go back to the seventh century, when the Alexandrian physician Paulus Aegineta attributed lycanthropy to melancholia or an \\"excess of black bile\\". During 1563, a Lutheran physician named Johann Weyer wrote that werewolves suffered from an imbalance in their melancholic humour and exhibited the physical symptoms of paleness, \\"a dry tongue and a great thirst\\" as well as sunken, dim and dry eyes. Even King James VI and I in his 1597 treatise Daemonologie does not blame werewolf behaviour on delusions created by the Devil but \\"an excess of melancholy as the culprit which causes some men to believe that they are wolves and to 'counterfeit' the actions of these animals\\". The perception of an association between mental illness and animalistic behaviour can be traced throughout the history of folklore from many different countries.Metzger, N. (2013). \\"Battling Demons with Medical Authority: Werewolves, Physicians and Rationalization\\" . History of Psychiatry 24: 341‚Äì355.  Case example  A 20-year old man was admitted to a mental hospital due to his increasingly agitated and erratic behaviors. During his initial evaluation, he was guarded and preoccupied. He had no previous psychiatric history. Over the next few days, he displayed increasingly psychotic, animal-like behaviors. These behaviors included howling loudly, running abruptly, and crawling on all fours. He appeared to be internally stimulated. When asked about these behaviors, he was initially evasive but eventually admitted that he believed he was a werewolf and would periodically transform into a wolf. He started believing this after having visions of \\"the Devil\\" years before and reported hearing random voices. The patient was started on ziprasidone and his symptoms gradually responded and his animal- like behaviors eventually ceased all together.

It is named for the father of philanthropist Ward Melville, who donated 400 acres of land and money to establish Stony Brook University in 1957. It originally opened in July 1963 and has massively expanded since its original construction. The library was dedicated to Melville in 1971. The library currently holds over two million volumes, over 300 databases, 70,000 electronic journals, 10,000 electronic books, 10,000 compact disks and 6,000 films. The six-story building encompasses roughly 682,000 square feet of space and is in use by over fifty different administrative and academic departments. Numerous retail companies ranging from Shop Red West (one of the university's bookstores) to Starbucks are housed in the Melville Library. History Originally constructed in 1962 as a modest sized three-story building, the library opened its doors as the State University Library in July 1963 with capacity for 700 students. It was renovated almost immediately with numerous construction projects shortly after; in 1967, work began on the \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\", connecting the library to the Stony Brook Union. Plans to connect the two buildings with the Fine Arts Center were not completed until 10 years after ground was broken, giving the structure its name. The Bridge to Nowhere was completed in 1977 and demolished in 2002. In 1969, architect Ervin Y. Galantay spearheaded a new design for the library, adding four separate five-story wings around the original structure as well as a glass atrium that connected the original building to its new areas. After another massive renovation in 1971 that nearly quadrupled the square footage of the library, it was dedicated to Frank Melville Jr., Ward Melville's father. Glaser's structure In April 2002, a steel sculpture by graphic designer Milton Glaser was installed outside the library facing the Academic Mall. It holds more than 2.1 million bound volumes and over four million rolls of microfilm. The library is a member of the Association of Research Libraries, a consortium of the top 120 research libraries in the country. The library has a Special Collections Department which houses over 16,000 rare books, 800 antique and hand-drawn maps, and over 150 collections, including the papers of Senator Jacob K. Javits, the Environmental Defense Archive, and the William Butler Yeats Microfilmed Manuscripts Collection. In 2016 the North and Central Reading Rooms were renovated and modernized with new furniture and technology improvements to become a \\"knowledge commons.\\" The redesign included adding new independent study areas, more natural light, better acoustics, new flooring, more electrical outlets, and new computer workstations. Description Commuter lounge Shop Red West The building consists of six floors, and a commuter lounge, and is located on the Academic Mall of the university. There are also separate branch libraries in Math, Physics & Astronomy, Chemistry, Music, Computer Science, and Marine Science. The Library also contains offices for different academic departments, as well as classrooms, computer labs, a career center and a bookstore. Shop Red West, one of the university's bookstores, is located in the basement of the Melville Library. After a longtime partnership with Barnes & Noble, the university reached a contract with Follett Corporation in 2018 to manage its bookstores and electronic catalog. The bookstore, then a Barnes & Noble, moved to the Melville Library from the Stony Brook Union in 1986. In 2016, Amazon@StonyBrook opened, becoming the first Amazon pick-up location in the state of New York and only the 15th college in the United States to offer an Amazon pick-up location. In 2017, a Starbucks coffee shop opened in the basement adjacent to Shop Red West. The 2,842-square foot location cost $1.4 million to make and seats 70. An existent storage facility had to be demolished in order to make room.

October 1945) was an American with German ancestry who broadcast Nazi propaganda from Germany during World War II. Early life Kaltenbach was born in Dubuque, Iowa, and was raised in Waterloo, Iowa. His father was John Kaltenbach, who had emigrated to the United States from Germany in 1891 and was naturalized in 1896. After graduating from East High School, Waterloo, Kaltenbach and his brother Gustav went on a cycling tour of Germany and were there when World War I broke out in August 1914. They were detained on suspicion of espionage until December 1914, when they were released. Despite that experience, Kaltenbach became an admirer of Germany and its people. On his return Kaltenbach enrolled in Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, and studied there for three years. In June 1918, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Coastal Artillery. Kaltenbach was honorably discharged from the U. S. Army in April 1919. He resumed his education at Iowa State Teachers College, earning a bachelor's degree in 1920. Kaltenbach worked for the next seven years as an appraiser before becoming a teacher. His first teaching post was in Manchester, Iowa. In 1931 he was offered a position at Dubuque's Senior High School teaching business law, economics, and debate. In the early 1930s he earned a master's degree in history from the University of Chicago. Introduction to Nazism In 1933, Kaltenbach won a scholarship at the University of Berlin and took a two-year leave of absence from his employment to pursue his doctorate. While in Germany he became an ardent follower of the Nazi movement. On his return to the United States, Kaltenbach resumed teaching in Dubuque. In 1935 he started a club for boys based on the Hitler Youth movement, The Militant Order of Spartan Knights. It held secret initiation rituals and the boys wore brown military-style uniforms. Because of the concern of parents, Kaltenbach's teaching contract was terminated in June 1936. Kaltenbach then left for Germany where he worked as a freelance writer and translator and on occasion for the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft, German State Radio. In February 1939 he married a German national, Dorothea Peters, and they honeymooned in the United States. There he took every opportunity to speak in favor of the Nazi cause, but, after a hostile confrontation at a lecture he gave at the Russell-Lamson Hotel in Waterloo in May 1939, he hastily returned to Germany. He was soon hired as a broadcaster for Nazi propaganda. Propaganda for Nazi Germany Back in Germany, Kaltenbach became a full-time broadcaster reading news bulletins for the RRG's U.S.A. Zone. From 1940 to 1941 Kaltenbach broadcast ‚ÄôLetters to Iowa‚Äô to the United States directed at the American Midwest. His programs consisted of anti-Roosevelt, anti-British and pro-isolationism propaganda in the form of fictional letters back home. Kaltenbach believed that his role was also to warn Americans of the dangers of Bolshevism and saw himself as one who could clarify the Nazi philosophy while minimizing criticism of Hitler.Goebbels 's Iowan: Frederick W. Kaltenbach State Historical Society of Iowa 1994 He cultivated a simple and homey style and was one of several English-speaking propagandists for Germany that were referred to by the nickname Lord Haw-Haw although Kaltenbach was more frequently referred to as Lord Hee-Haw. He opened each program with ‚ÄòGreetings to my old friend, Harry in Iowa‚Äô, and delivered his propaganda messages in the form of advice,http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763172,00.html Radio: Canine Cat ‚ÄìTIME Magazine, January 8, 1940 such as, \\"Don't let the British drag America into this thing [the war in Europe], Harry.\\" Kaltenbach's objectives were to prevent President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs re-election to a third term of office, to block the pro-interventionist faction in the U.S. and to stop the enactment of the Lend-Lease Bill. He sought to persuade Americans that supporting Britain was a lost cause and that taking sides could only embroil the United States in a ruinous and unnecessary war with Germany. After the United States entered the war against Germany on December 11, 1941, Kaltenbach‚Äôs broadcasts aimed at undermining U.S. morale and the national will to prosecute a protracted war with Germany. Kaltenbach also broadcast with another American collaborator, Max Koischwitz, as Jim of 'Jim and Johnny', a humorous dialogue program in which the title characters traded propaganda- laden wisecracks. Disillusionment with Nazism In the months following Kaltenbach‚Äôs U.S. indictment for treason in 1943, the frequency of his radio broadcasts diminished and his position as the leading American broadcaster was taken by two collaborators, Mildred Gillars and Douglas Chandler. From 1944, Kaltenbach‚Äôs health declined as he began to suffer from heart problems and asthma. He also became disenchanted with Hitler and Nazism, often refusing to broadcast and going on strike, sometimes for months at a time. This alienated his fellow American collaborators and resulted in confrontation, especially with their British colleague, William Joyce, on whom the Lord Haw-Haw nickname had finally settled. Towards the end of the war, Kaltenbach attempted to ingratiate himself with anti-Nazi elements and religious elements associated with Pastor Martin Niem√∂ller. He could still be heard intermittently in North America and by American forces in Europe up to early 1945. Charges of treason On July 26, 1943, Kaltenbach, along with Max Otto Koischwitz, Jane Anderson (\\"The Georgia Peach\\"), Edward Delaney, Constance Drexel, Robert Henry Best, Douglas Chandler and Ezra Pound, was indicted by a District of Columbia grand jury on charges of treason. Capture and death After Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945, his wife reported to the U.S. Army that her husband had been arrested at the family home in Berlin by Soviet troops on May 15, 1945. The Soviets refused American requests to surrender custody and later reported that Kaltenbach had died in Soviet Special Camp 2 in Buchenwald at an unspecified date in October 1945.Reds Report 'Lord Hee Haw' Died as Captive Last Year - Los Angeles Times Archives, July 21, 1946 The State Department agreed and the U.S. District Court dismissed the indictment against Kaltenbach on April 13, 1948.

The term is used more commonly for the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft Internet Information Services, Internet Explorer, and other Active Directory aware applications. IWA is also known by several names like HTTP Negotiate authentication, NT Authentication, NTLM Authentication, Domain authentication, Windows Integrated Authentication, Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication, or simply Windows Authentication. Overview Integrated Windows Authentication uses the security features of Windows clients and servers. Unlike Basic or Digest authentication, initially, it does not prompt users for a user name and password. The current Windows user information on the client computer is supplied by the web browser through a cryptographic exchange involving hashing with the Web server. If the authentication exchange initially fails to identify the user, the web browser will prompt the user for a Windows user account user name and password. Integrated Windows Authentication itself is not a standard or an authentication protocol. When IWA is selected as an option of a program (e.g. within the Directory Security tab of the IIS site properties dialog) this implies that underlying security mechanisms should be used in a preferential order. If the Kerberos provider is functional and a Kerberos ticket can be obtained for the target, and any associated settings permit Kerberos authentication to occur (e.g. Intranet sites settings in Internet Explorer), the Kerberos 5 protocol will be attempted. Otherwise NTLMSSP authentication is attempted. Similarly, if Kerberos authentication is attempted, yet it fails, then NTLMSSP is attempted. IWA uses SPNEGO to allow initiators and acceptors to negotiate either Kerberos or NTLMSSP. Third party utilities have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to UNIX, Linux and Mac systems. Supported web browsers Integrated Windows Authentication works with most modern web browsers, http://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/Gino/Integrated+Windows+Authentication but does not work over some HTTP proxy servers. Therefore, it is best for use in intranets where all the clients are within a single domain. It may work with other web browsers if they have been configured to pass the user's logon credentials to the server that is requesting authentication. Where a proxy itself requires NTLM authentication, some applications like Java may not work because the protocol is not described in RFC-2069 for proxy authentication. * Internet Explorer 2 and later versions. * In Mozilla Firefox on Windows operating systems, the names of the domains/websites to which the authentication is to be passed can be entered (comma delimited for multiple domains) for the \\"network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris\\" (for Kerberos) or in the \\"network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris\\" (NTLM) Preference Name on the about:config page. On the Macintosh operating systems this works if you have a kerberos ticket (use negotiate). Some websites may also require configuring the \\"network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris\\". * Opera 9.01 and later versions can use NTLM/Negotiate, but will use Basic or Digest authentication if that is offered by the server. * Google Chrome works as of 8.0. * Safari works, once you have a Kerberos ticket. * Microsoft Edge 77 and later. Supported mobile browsers * Bitzer Secure Browser supports Kerberos and NTLM SSO from iOS and Android. Both KINIT and PKINIT are supported.

He co-founded Mahindra & Mohammed in 1945 (later Mahindra & Mahindra in 1948) with Jagdish Chandra Mahindra and Kailash Chandra Mahindra. Educated at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), he joined the Indian Civil Service as a chartered accountant at the Indian Railway Accounts Service before being promoted to join the Ministry of Finance under Liaquat Ali Khan in 1946. After the Independence of Pakistan in 1947, he joined the Liaquat administration as the country's first Finance Minister where he helped draft the first five-year plans to alleviate the national economy. Following the assassination of Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan in 1951, he was invited to be the Governor-General by Khawaja Nazimuddin who himself took over the government as Prime Minister. Nationwide violence as the aftermath of the language movement in Dacca and religious riots in Lahore made him dismiss Nazimuddin administration using the reserve powers to restore control of the Law and order in Pakistan. In 1955, he was forced to resign from the post of Governor-General due to worsening of his health conditions by then-Interior Minister Iskander Ali Mirza, who himself took control of the office. After resignation, he fought a brief but unsuccessful battle with his illness, that ultimately resulted in his death in 1956. His personal image is viewed negatively by Pakistan's historians, criticized for giving rise to political intrigue, undermining the civilian control of the military by authorizing the Martial law in Pakistan, and devaluing nascent democratic norms by sacking the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan during Prime Minister Bogra's tenure.Ghulam Muhammad - Story of Pakistan, Retrieved 8 June 2017 Biography =Family background and education= Malik Ghulam Muhammad was born in a Kakazai family, in suburban neighborhood near Mochi Gate, in Lahore, Punjab, India.

At AMU he gained a BA degree in accountancy. =Civil service and business interests= After graduating from AMU, he joined the Audit and Accounts Service in March 1920. In January 1921, he received his first official appointment as assistant audit officer with the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Upon its merger into the East Indian Railway in 1925, Muhammad was briefly appointed a government executor of accounts with the Bengal and North Western Railway, serving in this capacity from January to November. Having earned a reputation as an able and competent accountant, he was then appointed to the Indian Railway Board before becoming the Controller of General Supplies and Purchase of the Indian Railways. From June 1932 to February 1934, he was attached to the administration of Bhopal State, and worked under its nawab, Hamidullah Khan. In March 1934, he returned to government service and was appointed deputy accountant-general (posts and telegraphs); in May, he was appointed as officiating deputy director-general (posts and telegraphs, finance), and was confirmed in the appointment in January 1935. In July 1936, he was appointed as officiating financial officer in the same department, was confirmed in his appointment in April 1937 and was promoted to financial officer (communications) in October. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Muhammad was successively appointed to increasingly important positions: chief controller of stores in March 1940, controller-general of purchase in September 1940 and additional secretary to the Department of Supply in March 1941. His wartime services as a professional accountant were recognized by the British government that year when he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1941 Birthday Honours list. In May 1942, Muhammad was assigned to the Hyderabad State administration, in which he served as an advisor to the Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1945, he helped co-found the Mahindra and Mohamed Steel Company together with steel industrialists, JC Mahindra and KC Mahindra where Muhammad served the company's chartered accountant. In 1945‚Äì47, the company initially registered as the Mahindra & Mohammad, and started the licensed production of the Willys jeeps in Bombay as Muhammad looked after the company's revenue and finances. After World War II, he was asked by Nawab of Bahawalpur, Lord Sadeq Mohammad Khan V to represent him at the Round Table Conferences, and during this time, he began formatting political relations with Liaquat Ali Khan. He left Hyderabad left to join the Ministry of Finance in 1946. In the 1946 King's Birthday Honours List, the last honours list in which Indian civil servants were recognised, he received a knighthood. Finance Minister (1947‚Äì51) In 1946‚Äì47, Muhammad left Mahindra & Mahindra and joined the Ministry of Finance as a Cabinet Secretary under Finance Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, assisting him in drafting and preparing India's first union budget. After witnessing the Partition of India in 1947, he decided to acquire the citizenship of Pakistan and permanently settled in his native city, Lahore, on 14 August 1947. He was brought up in the Liaquat administration when Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan appointed him as country's first Finance Minister. He presented the first budget and submitted the draft of the First Five-Year Plans in 1948. In 1949, Muhammad invited leaders of the Muslim world to the International Islamic Economics Organization in Pakistan, where he emphasised the idea of a Muslim economic bloc. During this time, he survived the fatal attack of paralysis that made him unable to talk or move effectively and began suffering with poor health conditions. Governor-General (1951-55) As early as 1951, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan had made a decision of removing Finance Minister Muhammad due to his continuing worsening health conditions. However, the decision was not taken due to the assassination of Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan in October 1951. Governor-General Khawaja Nazimuddin nominated him in his capacity while taking control over the government as the Prime Minister, appointing his own cabinet. In 1953, he represented Pakistan as head of state at the Coronation of Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey alongside with the Governors-General from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Ceylon. Upon returning to Pakistan, he witnessed the agitation caused by the language movement in Dacca in East Pakistan, and the series of anti-Qadiyani protests in Lahore, Punjab in Pakistan. Both events led him to use the reserve powers awarded by the Government of India Act 1935 against Prime Minister Nazimuddin, effectively dismissing his administration only to be replace with diplomat M. A. Bogra. In 1954, the Constituent Assembly made legislative attempts to try changing the 1935 act to establish checks and balances on the Governor-General's powers. In response, Muhammad again dismissed the Constituent Assembly, an action that was challenged in the Sindh High Court by Maulvi Tamizuddin, the Speaker of the Assembly. The Sindh High Court's Chief Justice Sir George Constantine ruled the Governor-General's decision illegal, but the ruling was overturned by Supreme Court of Pakistan, led by Chief Justice Muhammad Munir, in a split decision. Historians consider this action the beginning of viceregal politics in Pakistan, in which the military and civil bureaucracy, not elected officials, would gain increasing influence over the country's policymaking. During this time, his health began to deteriorated as paralysis spread in his whole body, forcing him to take a leave of absence to seek treatment in the United Kingdom in 1955. In his capacity, he appointed Interior Minister Iskander Mirza as acting Governor-General but Mirza dismissed him from his post in order to take his place, supported by the Constituent Assembly's legislators. On 29 August 1956, Malik Sir Ghulam Muhammad died and was buried in Karachi in Gora Qabrastan, Christian's Graveyard, next to Fauji Qabristan.

It was the directorial debut of special effects artist Stan Winston. The film has built up a cult following in the years since its release. The first in the Pumpkinhead franchise, it was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, two TV film sequels, and a comic book series.  Plot  In 1957, Tom Harley waits inside his farm cabin with his wife and young son, Ed. A doomed man seeks sanctuary at Tom's cabin, but Tom refuses and threatens to shoot him if he does not leave. Watching through a window, Ed witnesses the man caught and killed by a monster. In the present, Ed Harley is a widowed father and owns a small store in the country. He leaves his young son Billy alone while he runs an errand. A group of teenage campers stop by Harley's, and, while riding their dirt bikes, they mortally injure Billy. One teen, Steve, stays with the boy until his father's return; the rest flee the scene. At their cabin, the campers fight about whether or not to call the police. Joel, who is personally responsible for the boy's injury and is on probation for a similar incident, rips out the phone cord, knocks one of his friends unconscious and locks him and a girl in the closet to stop them from contacting the authorities. Ed goes to see a witch and offers her gold, but she says resurrecting the dead is not within her power. Instead, Ed says that he wants revenge; the witch agrees to help, but warns him that vengeance comes with a terrible price. On her orders, Ed goes to an old graveyard in the mountains, digs up a corpse, and brings it back to the witch's home. The witch uses blood from father and son to resurrect the corpse, which rises as a gigantic, spindly demonic monster named Pumpkinhead. Back at the cabin, Joel begins to experience remorse for his actions and determines to turn himself in to the police. The monster, however, has already arrived. One of the girls, Maggie, hears a voice whispering her name. Seemingly hypnotized, she follows the voice outside the cabin. Steve brings her out of her trance, but Pumpkinhead kills him. Ed experiences the murder through the monster's eyes. While the campers search for Steve, Pumpkinhead drags away Maggie, and Ed again experiences the ensuing murder. He returns to the witch and begs her to stop the monster's actions. The witch says that Pumpkinhead cannot be stopped, and Ed will die if he interferes with the killing spree. Joel confronts Pumpkinhead with a machete, but it swats him aside and drags off Kim, whom it drops from a fatal height. The three remaining campers unsuccessfully beg the locals for help. Ed arrives and shoots Pumpkinhead, but when Joel checks to see if the creature is still alive, it grabs a fallen rifle and impales him with it. A local boy, Bunt, helps the two remaining campers, Tracey and Chris, reach an abandoned church. Bunt relates the legend of the monster Pumpkinhead, explaining that the monster avenges one who was wronged. If anyone tries to stop Pumpkinhead or help his victims, that person becomes marked, too. Chris' dirt bike fails to start after Pumpkinhead removes the drive chain; he lifts up the bike, with Chris still on it, and throws it against a tree. He then drags Chris back to Harley's house, where Tracey, Bunt, and Ed have taken shelter. Pumpkinhead captures Bunt. Ed stumbles out of the barn but is accidentally stabbed in the arm by a pitchfork. Both Ed and Pumpkinhead cry out in pain, and Pumpkinhead releases Bunt. Ed notices that Pumpkinhead's head is turning more human, then realizes that he and Pumpkinhead are one: the only way to kill the monster is to die himself. Pumpkinhead grabs Tracey by the neck, but before he can kill her, Ed shoots himself in the head. Pumpkinhead momentarily collapses to the ground, then grabs Bunt again. Tracey takes the gun and Ed begs her to finish him off. Ed, now fully metamorphosed, tries to attack Tracey. She shoots him until both he and Pumpkinhead fall to the ground dead. Tracey, Bunt, and Chris then watch as Pumpkinhead bursts into flames. Later that night, the witch buries Ed in Pumpkinhead's grave, ready for the next person seeking vengeance, and still wearing the necklace his son Billy made him.

The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group sent Stan Winston the script only expecting him to do the creature effects, but Winston instead saw in the project an opportunity to make a directorial debut. Given Winston was then busy refining the story, he gave free reins regarding design to artists Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant and Tom Woodruff, Jr., the last of whom also wore the Pumpkinhead suit. Winston‚Äôs experience regarding creature work enabled the effects not to use too much of the limited $3 million budget.PUMPKINHEAD - THE MAKING OF STAN WINSTON'S DEMON OF VENGEANCE Filming took place in Los Angeles, California.  Release  The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by United Artists in October 1988 and again in January 1989. In total, it grossed $4,385,516 total at the domestic box office. The film was released on VHS in the US by MGM/UA Home Entertainment in May 1989 and again in April 1995. MGM released the film on DVD twice: once in 2000 as a standard edition and again in 2008 in a 20th Anniversary Edition featuring an audio commentary and over an hour of featurettes. It was released on Blu-ray in September 2014.  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Pumpkinhead holds an approval rating of 65%, based on 23 reviews, and an average rating of 5.73/10. Its consensus reads: \\"With effects work and solid direction from Stan Winston -- and Lance Henriksen adding welcome gravitas -- Pumpkinhead is a creature feature that stands a cut above\\". Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"As a technician, Winston clearly knows how to make a monster, but as a director he's yet to learn how to bring one to life\\". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post wrote that the film has poor writing and acting, but it is surprisingly polished for a B movie. Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times wrote that, despite its poor writing, the premise is interesting, but it's not executed as well as Forbidden Planet. Empire rated it 2/5 stars and called it a Friday the 13th clone with \\"little atmosphere and no surprises\\". TV Guide rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the film's second half becomes tedious because of its overdone slasher formula. In a 1992 retrospective, Jon Nalick of the Los Angeles Times described it as \\"a well-executed film in a genre that is littered with dimwitted slasher flicks\\". Bloody Disgusting rated the film 4/5 stars and called it \\"a gothic story of love, loss, vengeance, and redemption\\". Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated the film 4/5 stars and wrote that film \\"stands as a timeless, dark fairy tale\\". Reviewing the 2000 DVD release, G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote that the film is \\"too good to pass over\\", despite its lackluster presentation. Nick Nunziata also criticized the 2000 DVD release and wrote that the film does not hold up. Nick Schager of The A.V. Club called it an endearing, pulp film that lacks subtlety. Reviewing the film on Blu-ray, Ken Hanley of Starlog said it is \\"one hell of an impressive directorial debut\\". Writing in Horror Films of the 1980s, critic John Kenneth Muir called it \\"a meditation on vengeance\\" that is \\"surprising and rewarding\\" for its rejection of vigilante justice, a popular theme in the 1980s.  Legacy  Despite its poor box office results, Pumpkinhead has become a cult film. In 2013, Tyler Doupe included Pumpkinhead in his list of Underrated Horror Killers at Fearnet, and Fangoria included it in their 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen. = Sequels and reboot = A sequel, Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings, was released directly to video in 1994. It was directed by Jeff Burr. Two additional sequels, Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes and Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud, were filmed in 2006 as made for television movies. They were broadcast on Syfy in October 2006 and on February 10, 2007, respectively. A reboot of the series has been reported and is to be produced by Saw executive producer Peter Block. Block told Entertainment Weekly that Nate Atkins will write the script for the reboot and that filming would begin in 2017. As of 2020 there has been no update on the reboot's development. = Comic book = In 1993, Dark Horse Comics published a Pumpkinhead comic book series called Pumpkinhead: The Rites of Exorcism. The comic was supposed to be a four-part mini-series but only two issues were published. The second one ended in a cliffhanger leaving readers with the prospect of a winged Pumpkinhead that would have appeared in the third issue. Dynamite Entertainment began publishing a five issue Pumpkinhead limited series, written by Cullen Bunn and illustrated by Blacky Shepherd, in February 2018. = Video game = In 1995, Electronic Arts published a first-person shooter computer game for Microsoft Windows called Bloodwings: Pumpkinhead's Revenge. The game was poorly received. = Model kits = In 1991, GEOmetric Design, Inc. produced and marketed the first licensed Pumpkinhead model kit. It featured the demon on a display base depicting a portion of a burned out church. The model kit was sculpted by American artist Randy Bowen. The kit was discontinued when GEOmetric Design released its Pumpkinhead: The Metamorphosis kit in 1994. Sculpted by Japanese artist Takayuki Takeya (Á´πË∞∑ ÈöÜ‰πã), the second kit was based on the Pumpkinhead sequel story written by Carducci and Gerani and published in the Dark Horse Comics series. The kit included a glossy, full-color booklet that concluded the cancelled comic. In 2005, Sideshow Collectibles released a Pumpkinhead maquette. = Music = The horror punk band The Misfits released a song entitled \\"Pumpkin Head\\", which was featured on their album Famous Monsters, released in 1999.

Typical uses of GC include testing the purity of a particular substance, or separating the different components of a mixture (the relative amounts of such components can also be determined). In some situations, GC may help in identifying a compound. In preparative chromatography, GC can be used to prepare pure compounds from a mixture. In gas chromatography, the mobile phase (or \\"moving phase\\") is a carrier gas, usually an inert gas such as helium or an unreactive gas such as nitrogen. Helium remains the most commonly used carrier gas in about 90% of instruments although hydrogen is preferred for improved separations. The stationary phase is a microscopic layer of liquid or polymer on an inert solid support, inside a piece of glass or metal tubing called a column (an homage to the fractionating column used in distillation). The instrument used to perform gas chromatography is called a gas chromatograph (or \\"aerograph\\", \\"gas separator\\"). The gaseous compounds being analyzed interact with the walls of the column, which is coated with a stationary phase. This causes each compound to elute at a different time, known as the retention time of the compound. The comparison of retention times is what gives GC its analytical usefulness. Gas chromatography is in principle similar to column chromatography (as well as other forms of chromatography, such as HPLC, TLC), but has several notable differences. First, the process of separating the compounds in a mixture is carried out between a liquid stationary phase and a gas mobile phase, whereas in column chromatography the stationary phase is a solid and the mobile phase is a liquid. (Hence the full name of the procedure is \\"Gas‚Äìliquid chromatography\\", referring to the mobile and stationary phases, respectively.) Second, the column through which the gas phase passes is located in an oven where the temperature of the gas can be controlled, whereas column chromatography (typically) has no such temperature control. Finally, the concentration of a compound in the gas phase is solely a function of the vapor pressure of the gas. Gas chromatography is also sometimes known as vapor-phase chromatography (VPC), or gas‚Äìliquid partition chromatography (GLPC). These alternative names, as well as their respective abbreviations, are frequently used in scientific literature. Strictly speaking, GLPC is the most correct terminology, and is thus preferred by many authors.  History  Chromatography dates to 1903 in the work of the Russian scientist, Mikhail Semenovich Tswett, who separated plant pigments via liquid column chromatography. German physical chemist Erika Cremer in 1947 together with Austrian graduate student Fritz Prior developed the theoretical foundations of GC and built the first liquid-gas chromatograph, but her work was deemed irrelevant and was ignored for a long time. Archer John Porter Martin, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in developing liquid‚Äìliquid (1941) and paper (1944) chromatography, is therefore credited for the foundation of gas chromatography. The popularity of gas chromatography quickly rose after the development of the flame ionization detector.  GC analysis  A gas chromatograph is a chemical analysis instrument for separating chemicals in a complex sample. A gas chromatograph uses a flow- through narrow tube known as the column, through which different chemical constituents of a sample pass in a gas stream (carrier gas, mobile phase) at different rates depending on their various chemical and physical properties and their interaction with a specific column filling, called the stationary phase. As the chemicals exit the end of the column, they are detected and identified electronically. The function of the stationary phase in the column is to separate different components, causing each one to exit the column at a different time (retention time). Other parameters that can be used to alter the order or time of retention are the carrier gas flow rate, column length and the temperature.Diagram of a gas chromatograph.In a GC analysis, a known volume of gaseous or liquid analyte is injected into the \\"entrance\\" (head) of the column, usually using a microsyringe (or, solid phase microextraction fibers, or a gas source switching system). As the carrier gas sweeps the analyte molecules through the column, this motion is inhibited by the adsorption of the analyte molecules either onto the column walls or onto packing materials in the column. The rate at which the molecules progress along the column depends on the strength of adsorption, which in turn depends on the type of molecule and on the stationary phase materials. Since each type of molecule has a different rate of progression, the various components of the analyte mixture are separated as they progress along the column and reach the end of the column at different times (retention time). A detector is used to monitor the outlet stream from the column; thus, the time at which each component reaches the outlet and the amount of that component can be determined. Generally, substances are identified (qualitatively) by the order in which they emerge (elute) from the column and by the retention time of the analyte in the column.  Physical components  = Autosamplers = The autosampler provides the means to introduce a sample automatically into the inlets. Manual insertion of the sample is possible but is no longer common. Automatic insertion provides better reproducibility and time-optimization.An autosampler for liquid or gaseous samples based on a microsyringeDifferent kinds of autosamplers exist. Autosamplers can be classified in relation to sample capacity (auto-injectors vs. autosamplers, where auto-injectors can work a small number of samples), to robotic technologies (XYZ robot vs. rotating robot ‚Äì the most common), or to analysis: * Liquid * Static head- space by syringe technology * Dynamic head-space by transfer-line technology * Solid phase microextraction (SPME) = Inlets = Split/splitless inlet. The column inlet (or injector) provides the means to introduce a sample into a continuous flow of carrier gas. The inlet is a piece of hardware attached to the column head. Common inlet types are: * S/SL (split/splitless) injector; a sample is introduced into a heated small chamber via a syringe through a septum ‚Äì the heat facilitates volatilization of the sample and sample matrix. The carrier gas then either sweeps the entirety (splitless mode) or a portion (split mode) of the sample into the column. In split mode, a part of the sample/carrier gas mixture in the injection chamber is exhausted through the split vent. Split injection is preferred when working with samples with high analyte concentrations (>0.1%) whereas splitless injection is best suited for trace analysis with low amounts of analytes (<0.01%). In splitless mode the split valve opens after a pre-set amount of time to purge heavier elements that would otherwise contaminate the system. This pre-set (splitless) time should be optimized, the shorter time (e.g., 0.2 min) ensures less tailing but loss in response, the longer time (2 min) increases tailing but also signal. * On-column inlet; the sample is here introduced directly into the column in its entirety without heat, or at a temperature below the boiling point of the solvent. The low temperature condenses the sample into a narrow zone. The column and inlet can then be heated, releasing the sample into the gas phase. This ensures the lowest possible temperature for chromatography and keeps samples from decomposing above their boiling point. * PTV injector; Temperature-programmed sample introduction was first described by Vogt in 1979. Originally Vogt developed the technique as a method for the introduction of large sample volumes (up to 250 ¬µL) in capillary GC. Vogt introduced the sample into the liner at a controlled injection rate. The temperature of the liner was chosen slightly below the boiling point of the solvent. The low- boiling solvent was continuously evaporated and vented through the split line. Based on this technique, Poy developed the programmed temperature vaporising injector; PTV. By introducing the sample at a low initial liner temperature many of the disadvantages of the classic hot injection techniques could be circumvented. * Gas source inlet or gas switching valve; gaseous samples in collection bottles are connected to what is most commonly a six-port switching valve. The carrier gas flow is not interrupted while a sample can be expanded into a previously evacuated sample loop. Upon switching, the contents of the sample loop are inserted into the carrier gas stream. * P/T (Purge-and-Trap) system; An inert gas is bubbled through an aqueous sample causing insoluble volatile chemicals to be purged from the matrix. The volatiles are 'trapped' on an absorbent column (known as a trap or concentrator) at ambient temperature. The trap is then heated and the volatiles are directed into the carrier gas stream. Samples requiring preconcentration or purification can be introduced via such a system, usually hooked up to the S/SL port. The choice of carrier gas (mobile phase) is important. Hydrogen has a range of flow rates that are comparable to helium in efficiency. However, helium may be more efficient and provide the best separation if flow rates are optimized. Helium is non-flammable and works with a greater number of detectors and older instruments. Therefore, helium is the most common carrier gas used. However, the price of helium has gone up considerably over recent years, causing an increasing number of chromatographers to switch to hydrogen gas. Historical use, rather than rational consideration, may contribute to the continued preferential use of helium. = Detectors = The most commonly used detectors are the flame ionization detector (FID) and the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Both are sensitive to a wide range of components, and both work over a wide range of concentrations. While TCDs are essentially universal and can be used to detect any component other than the carrier gas (as long as their thermal conductivities are different from that of the carrier gas, at detector temperature), FIDs are sensitive primarily to hydrocarbons, and are more sensitive to them than TCD. However, a FID cannot detect water. Both detectors are also quite robust. Since TCD is non-destructive, it can be operated in- series before a FID (destructive), thus providing complementary detection of the same analytes. Other detectors are sensitive only to specific types of substances, or work well only in narrower ranges of concentrations. Thermal conductivity detector (TCD) relies on the thermal conductivity of matter passing around a tungsten -rhenium filament with a current traveling through it. In this set up helium or nitrogen serve as the carrier gas because of their relatively high thermal conductivity which keep the filament cool and maintain uniform resistivity and electrical efficiency of the filament. However, when analyte molecules elute from the column, mixed with carrier gas, the thermal conductivity decreases and this causes a detector response. The response is due to the decreased thermal conductivity causing an increase in filament temperature and resistivity resulting in fluctuations in voltage. Detector sensitivity is proportional to filament current while it is inversely proportional to the immediate environmental temperature of that detector as well as flow rate of the carrier gas. In a flame ionization detector (FID), electrodes are placed adjacent to a flame fueled by hydrogen / air near the exit of the column, and when carbon containing compounds exit the column they are pyrolyzed by the flame. This detector works only for organic / hydrocarbon containing compounds due to the ability of the carbons to form cations and electrons upon pyrolysis which generates a current between the electrodes. The increase in current is translated and appears as a peak in a chromatogram. FIDs have low detection limits (a few picograms per second) but they are unable to generate ions from carbonyl containing carbons. FID compatible carrier gasses include helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon. Alkali flame detector (AFD) or alkali flame ionization detector (AFID) has high sensitivity to nitrogen and phosphorus, similar to NPD. However, the alkaline metal ions are supplied with the hydrogen gas, rather than a bead above the flame. For this reason AFD does not suffer the \\"fatigue\\" of the NPD, but provides a constant sensitivity over long period of time. In addition, when alkali ions are not added to the flame, AFD operates like a standard FID. A catalytic combustion detector (CCD) measures combustible hydrocarbons and hydrogen. Discharge ionization detector (DID) uses a high-voltage electric discharge to produce ions. The polyarc reactor is an add-on to new or existing GC-FID instruments that converts all organic compounds to methane molecules prior to their detection by the FID. This technique can be used to improve the response of the FID and allow for the detection of many more carbon-containing compounds. The complete conversion of compounds to methane and the now equivalent response in the detector also eliminates the need for calibrations and standards because response factors are all equivalent to those of methane. This allows for the rapid analysis of complex mixtures that contain molecules where standards are not available. Flame photometric detector (FPD) uses a photomultiplier tube to detect spectral lines of the compounds as they are burned in a flame. Compounds eluting off the column are carried into a hydrogen fueled flame which excites specific elements in the molecules, and the excited elements (P,S, Halogens, Some Metals) emit light of specific characteristic wavelengths.Higson, S. (2004). Analytical Chemistry. OXFORD University Press The emitted light is filtered and detected by a photomultiplier tube. In particular, phosphorus emission is around 510‚Äì536 nm and sulfur emission is at 394 nm. With an atomic emission detector (AED), a sample eluting from a column enters a chamber which is energized by microwaves that induce a plasma. The plasma causes the analyte sample to decompose and certain elements generate an atomic emission spectra. The atomic emission spectra is diffracted by a diffraction grating and detected by a series of photomultiplier tubes or photo diodes. Electron capture detector (ECD) uses a radioactive beta particle (electron) source to measure the degree of electron capture. ECD are used for the detection of molecules containing electronegative / withdrawing elements and functional groups like halogens, carbonyl, nitriles, nitro groups, and organometalics. In this type of detector either nitrogen or 5% methane in argon is used as the mobile phase carrier gas. The carrier gas passes between two electrodes placed at the end of the column, and adjacent to the cathode (negative electrode) resides a radioactive foil such as 63Ni. The radioactive foil emits a beta particle (electron) which collides with and ionizes the carrier gas to generate more ions resulting in a current. When analyte molecules with electronegative / withdrawing elements or functional groups electrons are captured which results in a decrease in current generating a detector response. Nitrogen‚Äìphosphorus detector (NPD), a form of thermionic detector where nitrogen and phosphorus alter the work function on a specially coated bead and a resulting current is measured. Dry electrolytic conductivity detector (DELCD) uses an air phase and high temperature (v. Coulsen) to measure chlorinated compounds. Mass spectrometer (MS), also called GC-MS; highly effective and sensitive, even in a small quantity of sample. This detector can be used to identify the analytes in chromatograms by their mass spectrum. Some GC-MS are connected to an NMR spectrometer which acts as a backup detector. This combination is known as GC- MS-NMR. Some GC-MS-NMR are connected to an infrared spectrophotometer which acts as a backup detector. This combination is known as GC-MS-NMR-IR. It must, however, be stressed this is very rare as most analyses needed can be concluded via purely GC-MS. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) represents the most recent development in gas chromatography detectors. Most chemical species absorb and have unique gas phase absorption cross sections in the approximately 120‚Äì240 nm VUV wavelength range monitored. Where absorption cross sections are known for analytes, the VUV detector is capable of absolute determination (without calibration) of the number of molecules present in the flow cell in the absence of chemical interferences. Other detectors include the Hall electrolytic conductivity detector (ElCD), helium ionization detector (HID), infrared detector (IRD), photo-ionization detector (PID), pulsed discharge ionization detector (PDD), and thermionic ionization detector (TID).  Methods  This image above shows the interior of a GeoStrata Technologies Eclipse Gas Chromatograph that runs continuously in three-minute cycles. Two valves are used to switch the test gas into the sample loop. After filling the sample loop with test gas, the valves are switched again applying carrier gas pressure to the sample loop and forcing the sample through the column for separation. The method is the collection of conditions in which the GC operates for a given analysis. Method development is the process of determining what conditions are adequate and/or ideal for the analysis required. Conditions which can be varied to accommodate a required analysis include inlet temperature, detector temperature, column temperature and temperature program, carrier gas and carrier gas flow rates, the column's stationary phase, diameter and length, inlet type and flow rates, sample size and injection technique. Depending on the detector(s) (see below) installed on the GC, there may be a number of detector conditions that can also be varied. Some GCs also include valves which can change the route of sample and carrier flow. The timing of the opening and closing of these valves can be important to method development. = Carrier gas selection and flow rates = Typical carrier gases include helium, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen and air. Which gas to use is usually determined by the detector being used, for example, a DID requires helium as the carrier gas. When analyzing gas samples, however, the carrier is sometimes selected based on the sample's matrix, for example, when analyzing a mixture in argon, an argon carrier is preferred, because the argon in the sample does not show up on the chromatogram. Safety and availability can also influence carrier selection, for example, hydrogen is flammable, and high-purity helium can be difficult to obtain in some areas of the world. (See: Helium‚Äîoccurrence and production.) As a result of helium becoming more scarce, hydrogen is often being substituted for helium as a carrier gas in several applications. The purity of the carrier gas is also frequently determined by the detector, though the level of sensitivity needed can also play a significant role. Typically, purities of 99.995% or higher are used. The most common purity grades required by modern instruments for the majority of sensitivities are 5.0 grades, or 99.999% pure meaning that there is a total of 10 ppm of impurities in the carrier gas that could affect the results. The highest purity grades in common use are 6.0 grades, but the need for detection at very low levels in some forensic and environmental applications has driven the need for carrier gases at 7.0 grade purity and these are now commercially available. Trade names for typical purities include \\"Zero Grade,\\" \\"Ultra-High Purity (UHP) Grade,\\" \\"4.5 Grade\\" and \\"5.0 Grade.\\" The carrier gas linear velocity affects the analysis in the same way that temperature does (see above). The higher the linear velocity the faster the analysis, but the lower the separation between analytes. Selecting the linear velocity is therefore the same compromise between the level of separation and length of analysis as selecting the column temperature. The linear velocity will be implemented by means of the carrier gas flow rate, with regards to the inner diameter of the column. With GCs made before the 1990s, carrier flow rate was controlled indirectly by controlling the carrier inlet pressure, or \\"column head pressure.\\" The actual flow rate was measured at the outlet of the column or the detector with an electronic flow meter, or a bubble flow meter, and could be an involved, time consuming, and frustrating process. It was not possible to vary the pressure setting during the run, and thus the flow was essentially constant during the analysis. The relation between flow rate and inlet pressure is calculated with Poiseuille's equation for compressible fluids. Many modern GCs, however, electronically measure the flow rate, and electronically control the carrier gas pressure to set the flow rate. Consequently, carrier pressures and flow rates can be adjusted during the run, creating pressure/flow programs similar to temperature programs. = Stationary compound selection = The polarity of the solute is crucial for the choice of stationary compound, which in an optimal case would have a similar polarity as the solute. Common stationary phases in open tubular columns are cyanopropylphenyl dimethyl polysiloxane, carbowax polyethyleneglycol, biscyanopropyl cyanopropylphenyl polysiloxane and diphenyl dimethyl polysiloxane. For packed columns more options are available. = Inlet types and flow rates = The choice of inlet type and injection technique depends on if the sample is in liquid, gas, adsorbed, or solid form, and on whether a solvent matrix is present that has to be vaporized. Dissolved samples can be introduced directly onto the column via a COC injector, if the conditions are well known; if a solvent matrix has to be vaporized and partially removed, a S/SL injector is used (most common injection technique); gaseous samples (e.g., air cylinders) are usually injected using a gas switching valve system; adsorbed samples (e.g., on adsorbent tubes) are introduced using either an external (on-line or off-line) desorption apparatus such as a purge-and-trap system, or are desorbed in the injector (SPME applications). = Sample size and injection technique =  Sample injection  The rule of ten in gas chromatography The real chromatographic analysis starts with the introduction of the sample onto the column. The development of capillary gas chromatography resulted in many practical problems with the injection technique. The technique of on-column injection, often used with packed columns, is usually not possible with capillary columns. In the injection system in the capillary gas chromatograph the amount injected should not overload the column and the width of the injected plug should be small compared to the spreading due to the chromatographic process. Failure to comply with this latter requirement will reduce the separation capability of the column. As a general rule, the volume injected, Vinj, and the volume of the detector cell, Vdet, should be about 1/10 of the volume occupied by the portion of sample containing the molecules of interest (analytes) when they exit the column. Some general requirements which a good injection technique should fulfill are that it should be possible to obtain the column's optimum separation efficiency, it should allow accurate and reproducible injections of small amounts of representative samples, it should induce no change in sample composition, it should not exhibit discrimination based on differences in boiling point, polarity, concentration or thermal/catalytic stability, and it should be applicable for trace analysis as well as for undiluted samples. However, there are a number of problems inherent in the use of syringes for injection. Even the best syringes claim an accuracy of only 3%, and in unskilled hands, errors are much larger. The needle may cut small pieces of rubber from the septum as it injects sample through it. These can block the needle and prevent the syringe filling the next time it is used. It may not be obvious that this has happened. A fraction of the sample may get trapped in the rubber, to be released during subsequent injections. This can give rise to ghost peaks in the chromatogram. There may be selective loss of the more volatile components of the sample by evaporation from the tip of the needle. = Column selection = The choice of column depends on the sample and the active measured. The main chemical attribute regarded when choosing a column is the polarity of the mixture, but functional groups can play a large part in column selection. The polarity of the sample must closely match the polarity of the column stationary phase to increase resolution and separation while reducing run time. The separation and run time also depends on the film thickness (of the stationary phase), the column diameter and the column length. = Column temperature and temperature program = A gas chromatography oven, open to show a capillary column The column(s) in a GC are contained in an oven, the temperature of which is precisely controlled electronically. (When discussing the \\"temperature of the column,\\" an analyst is technically referring to the temperature of the column oven. The distinction, however, is not important and will not subsequently be made in this article.) The rate at which a sample passes through the column is directly proportional to the temperature of the column. The higher the column temperature, the faster the sample moves through the column. However, the faster a sample moves through the column, the less it interacts with the stationary phase, and the less the analytes are separated. In general, the column temperature is selected to compromise between the length of the analysis and the level of separation. A method which holds the column at the same temperature for the entire analysis is called \\"isothermal.\\" Most methods, however, increase the column temperature during the analysis, the initial temperature, rate of temperature increase (the temperature \\"ramp\\"), and final temperature are called the temperature program. A temperature program allows analytes that elute early in the analysis to separate adequately, while shortening the time it takes for late-eluting analytes to pass through the column.  Data reduction and analysis  = Qualitative analysis = Generally, chromatographic data is presented as a graph of detector response (y-axis) against retention time (x-axis), which is called a chromatogram. This provides a spectrum of peaks for a sample representing the analytes present in a sample eluting from the column at different times. Retention time can be used to identify analytes if the method conditions are constant. Also, the pattern of peaks will be constant for a sample under constant conditions and can identify complex mixtures of analytes. However, in most modern applications, the GC is connected to a mass spectrometer or similar detector that is capable of identifying the analytes represented by the peaks. = Quantitative analysis = The area under a peak is proportional to the amount of analyte present in the chromatogram. By calculating the area of the peak using the mathematical function of integration, the concentration of an analyte in the original sample can be determined. Concentration can be calculated using a calibration curve created by finding the response for a series of concentrations of analyte, or by determining the relative response factor of an analyte. The relative response factor is the expected ratio of an analyte to an internal standard (or external standard) and is calculated by finding the response of a known amount of analyte and a constant amount of internal standard (a chemical added to the sample at a constant concentration, with a distinct retention time to the analyte). In most modern GC-MS systems, computer software is used to draw and integrate peaks, and match MS spectra to library spectra.  Applications  In general, substances that vaporize below 300 ¬∞C (and therefore are stable up to that temperature) can be measured quantitatively. The samples are also required to be salt-free; they should not contain ions. Very minute amounts of a substance can be measured, but it is often required that the sample must be measured in comparison to a sample containing the pure, suspected substance known as a reference standard. Various temperature programs can be used to make the readings more meaningful; for example to differentiate between substances that behave similarly during the GC process. Professionals working with GC analyze the content of a chemical product, for example in assuring the quality of products in the chemical industry; or measuring toxic substances in soil, air or water. GC is very accurate if used properly and can measure picomoles of a substance in a 1 ml liquid sample, or parts-per-billion concentrations in gaseous samples. In practical courses at colleges, students sometimes get acquainted to the GC by studying the contents of Lavender oil or measuring the ethylene that is secreted by Nicotiana benthamiana plants after artificially injuring their leaves. These GC analyse hydrocarbons (C2-C40+). In a typical experiment, a packed column is used to separate the light gases, which are then detected with a TCD. The hydrocarbons are separated using a capillary column and detected with a FID. A complication with light gas analyses that include H2 is that He, which is the most common and most sensitive inert carrier (sensitivity is proportional to molecular mass) has an almost identical thermal conductivity to hydrogen (it is the difference in thermal conductivity between two separate filaments in a Wheatstone Bridge type arrangement that shows when a component has been eluted). For this reason, dual TCD instruments used with a separate channel for hydrogen that uses nitrogen as a carrier are common. Argon is often used when analysing gas phase chemistry reactions such as F-T synthesis so that a single carrier gas can be used rather than two separate ones. The sensitivity is reduced, but this is a trade off for simplicity in the gas supply. Gas chromatography is used extensively in forensic science. Disciplines as diverse as solid drug dose (pre-consumption form) identification and quantification, arson investigation, paint chip analysis, and toxicology cases, employ GC to identify and quantify various biological specimens and crime-scene evidence.  In popular culture  Movies, books and TV shows tend to misrepresent the capabilities of gas chromatography and the work done with these instruments. In the United States' TV show CSI, for example, GCs are used to rapidly identify unknown samples. For example, an analyst may say fifteen minutes after receiving the sample: \\"This is gasoline bought at a Chevron station in the past two weeks.\\" In fact, a typical GC analysis takes much more time; sometimes a single sample must be run more than an hour according to the chosen program; and even more time is needed to \\"heat out\\" the column so it is free from the first sample and can be used for the next. Equally, several runs are needed to confirm the results of a study ‚Äì a GC analysis of a single sample may simply yield a result per chance (see statistical significance). Also, GC does not positively identify most samples; and not all substances in a sample will necessarily be detected. All a GC truly tells you is at which relative time a component eluted from the column and that the detector was sensitive to it. To make results meaningful, analysts need to know which components at which concentrations are to be expected; and even then a small amount of a substance can hide itself behind a substance having both a higher concentration and the same relative elution time. Last but not least the results of the sample must often be checked against a GC analysis of a reference sample containing only the suspected substance. A GC-MS can remove much of this ambiguity, since the mass spectrometer will identify the component's molecular weight. But this still takes time and skill to do properly. Similarly, most GC analyses are not push- button operations. You cannot simply drop a sample vial into an auto-sampler's tray, push a button and have a computer tell you everything you need to know about the sample. The operating program must be carefully chosen according to the expected sample composition. A push-button operation can exist for running similar samples repeatedly, such as in a chemical production environment or for comparing 20 samples from the same experiment to calculate the mean content of the same substance. However, for the kind of investigative work portrayed in books, movies and TV shows, this is clearly not the case.

(1974). Expectancy Theory Predictions of Salesmen's Performance. Journal of Marketing Research 11(3), 243-253. In essence, the motivation of the behavior selection is determined by the desirability of the outcome. However, at the core of the theory is the cognitive process of how an individual processes the different motivational elements. This is done before making the ultimate choice. The outcome is not the sole determining factor in making the decision of how to behave. Expectancy theory is about the mental processes regarding choice, or choosing. It explains the processes that an individual undergoes to make choices. In the study of organizational behavior, expectancy theory is a motivation theory first proposed by Victor Vroom of the Yale School of Management. > \\"This theory emphasizes the needs for organizations to relate rewards > directly to performance and to ensure that the rewards provided are those > rewards deserved and wanted by the recipients.\\"Montana, Patrick J; Charnov, > Bruce H, Management ‚Äì 4th edition; (2008) ‚Äì Barron's Educational Series, > Inc. Victor H. Vroom (1964) defines motivation as a process governing choices among alternative forms of voluntary activities, a process controlled by the individual. The individual makes choices based on estimates of how well the expected results of a given behavior are going to match up with or eventually lead to the desired results. Motivation is a product of the individual's expectancy that a certain effort will lead to the intended performance, the instrumentality of this performance to achieving a certain result, and the desirability of this result for the individual, known as valence (S.E. Condrey, 2005, p. 482) Author In 1964, Victor H. Vroom developed the expectancy theory through his study of the motivations behind decision making. This theory is relevant to the study of management. Key elements The expectancy theory of motivation explains the behavioral process of why individuals choose one behavioral option over the other. This theory explains that individuals can be motivated towards goals if they believe that there is a positive correlation between efforts and performance, the outcome of a favorable performance will result in a desirable reward, a reward from a performance will satisfy an important need, and/or the outcome satisfies their need enough to make the effort worthwhile. Vroom introduced three variables within the expectancy theory which are valence (V), expectancy (E) and instrumentality (I). The three elements are important behind choosing one element over another because they are clearly defined: effort-performance expectancy (E>P expectancy), performance-outcome expectancy (P>O expectancy).P. Subba Rao, Personnel and Human Resource Management ‚Äì Text and cases; (2000) ‚Äì Himalaya Publishing House Expectancy theory has three components: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence. # Expectancy: effort ‚Üí performance (E‚ÜíP) # Instrumentality: performance ‚Üí outcome (P‚ÜíO) # Valence: V(R) outcome ‚Üí reward =Expectancy: effort ‚Üí performance (E‚ÜíP)= Expectancy is the belief that one's effort (E) will result in attainment of desired performance (P) goals. Usually based on an individual's past experience, self- confidence (self efficacy), and the perceived difficulty of the performance standard or goal. # Self efficacy ‚Äì the person's belief about their ability to successfully perform a particular behavior. The individual will assess whether they have the required skills or knowledge desired to achieve their goals. # Goal difficulty ‚Äì when goals are set too high or performance expectations that are made too difficult. This will most likely lead to low expectancy. This occurs when the individual believes that their desired results are unattainable. # Perceived control ‚Äì Individuals must believe that they have some degree of control over the expected outcome. When individuals perceive that the outcome is beyond their ability to influence, expectancy, and thus motivation, is low. =Instrumentality: Performance ‚Üí Outcome (P‚ÜíO)= Instrumentality is the belief that a person will receive a reward if the performance expectation is met. This reward may present itself in the form of a pay increase, promotion, recognition or sense of accomplishment. Instrumentality is low when the reward is the same for all performances given. Another way that instrumental outcomes work is commissions. With commissions performance is directly correlated with outcome (how much money is made). If performance is high and many goods are sold, the more money the person will make. Factors associated with the individual's instrumentality for outcomes are trust, control and policies: * Trusting the people who will decide who gets what outcome, based on the performance, * Control of how the decision is made, of who gets what outcome, and * Policies understanding of the correlation between performance and outcomes. =Valence V(R)= Valence is the value an individual places on the rewards of an outcome, which is based on their needs, goals, values and sources of motivation.Maslow‚ÄîMove Aside! A Heuristical Motivation Model for Leaders in Career and Technical Education Pg. 10 ‚Äì 11 http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JITE/v44n2/pdf/kroth.pdf Influential factors include one's values, needs, goals, preferences and sources that strengthen their motivation for a particular outcome. Valence is characterized by the extent to which a person values a given outcome or reward. This is not an actual level of satisfaction rather the expected satisfaction of a particular outcome. The valence refers to the value the individual personally places on the rewards. -1 ‚Üí0‚Üí +1 -1= avoiding the outcome 0 = indifferent to the outcome +1 = welcomes the outcome In order for the valence to be positive, the person must prefer attaining the outcome to not attaining it. Valence is one behavioral alternative, where the decision is measured on the value of the reward. The model below shows the direction of motivation, when behavior is energized: Motivational Force (MF) = Expectancy x Instrumentality x Valence When deciding among behavioral options, individuals select the option with the greatest amount of motivational force (MF). Expectancy and instrumentality are attitudes (cognitions), whereas valence is rooted in an individual's value system. Examples of valued outcomes in the workplace include, pay increases and bonuses, promotions, time off, new assignments, recognition, etc. If management can effectively determine what their employee values, this will allow the manager to motivate employees in order to get the highest result and effectiveness out of the workplace. Current research =Management= Victor Vroom's expectancy theory is one such management theory focused on motivation. According to Holdford and Lovelace-Elmore (2001, p. 8), Vroom asserts, \\"intensity of work effort depends on the perception that an individual's effort will result in a desired outcome\\". In order to enhance the performance-outcome tie, managers should use systems that tie rewards very closely to performance. Managers also need to ensure that the rewards provided are deserved and wanted by the recipients.Montana, Patrick J; Charnov, Bruce H, Management - 4th edition; (2008) - Barron's Educational Series, Inc. In order to improve the effort- performance tie, managers should engage in training to improve their capabilities and improve their belief that added effort will in fact lead to better performance. \\\\- Emphasizes self-interest in the alignment of rewards with employee's wants. \\\\- Emphasizes the connections among expected behaviors, rewards and organizational goals Expectancy Theory, though well known in work motivation literature, is not as familiar to scholars or practitioners outside that field. =Computer users= Lori Baker-Eveleth and Robert Stone, University of Idaho in 2008 conducted an empirical study on 154 faculty members' reactions to the use of new software.Baker-Eveleth L., Stone,R.W.(2008) Expectancy theory and behavioral intentions to use computer applications - Interdisciplinary Journal of Information It was found that ease of system use affects both self-efficacy (self-confidence) and anticipated usefulness. These in turn influenced the decision, or anticipated decision, to use the software. Self-efficacy and outcome expectancy impact a person's affect and behavior separately: \\\\- Self-efficacy is the belief that a person possesses the skills and abilities to successfully accomplish something. \\\\- Outcome expectancy is the belief that when a person accomplishes the task, a desired outcome is attained. Self-efficacy has a direct impact on outcome expectancy and has a larger effect than outcome expectancy. Employees will accept technology if they believe the technology is a benefit to them. If an employee is mandated to use the technology, the employees will use it but may feel it is not useful. On the other hand, when an employee is not mandated, the employee may be influenced by these other factors (self-confidence and confidence in outcome) that it should be used. The self-efficacy theory can be applied to predicting and perceiving an employee's belief for computer use (Bandura, 1986; Bates & Khasawneh, 2007). This theory associates an individual's cognitive state with effective behavioral outcomes (Staples, Hulland, & Higgins, 1998). Other constructs of the self-efficacy theory that impact attitudes and intentions to perform are: \\\\- past experience or mastery with the task; \\\\- vicarious experience performing the task; \\\\- emotional or physiological arousal regarding the task; \\\\- and social persuasion to perform the task. =Models of teacher expectancy effects= Jere Brophy and Thomas GoodJere Brophy, Thomas Good (1974) Teacher-Student Relationships: Causes and Consequences New York, Holt, Rinehart and Winston.Jere Brophy, Thomas Good (1987)Looking in classrooms (4th ed.), New York, Harper and Row provided a comprehensive model of how teacher expectations could influence children's achievement. Their model posits that teachers' expectations indirectly affect children's achievement: \\"teacher expectations could also affect student outcomes indirectly by leading to differential teacher treatment of students that would condition student attitudes, expectations, and behavior\\" (Brophy, 1983, p. 639). The model includes the following sequence. Teachers form differential expectations for students early in the school year. Based on these expectations, they behave differently toward different students, and as a result of these behaviors the students begin to understand what the teacher expects from them. If students accept the teachers' expectations and behavior toward them then they will be more likely to act in ways that confirm the teacher's initial expectations. This process will ultimately affect student achievement so that teachers' initial expectancies are confirmed.Schunk, Dale H.; Meece, Judith L.. Student Perceptions in the Classroom. Mahwah: Routledge, 2012. Ebook Library. pp. 96-97. In discussing work related to this model, Brophy (1983) made several important observations about teacher expectation effects. First and foremost, he argued that most of the beliefs teachers hold about student are accurate, and so their expectations usually reflect students' actual performance levels. As a result, Brophy contended that self- fulfilling prophecy effects have relatively weak effects on student achievement, changing achievement 5% to 10%, although he did note that such effects usually are negative expectation effects rather than positive effects. Second, he pointed out that various situational and individual difference factors influence the extent to which teacher expectations will act as self- fulfilling prophecies. For instance, Brophy stated that expectancy effects may be larger in the early elementary grades, because teachers have more one-on- one interactions with students then, as they attempt to socialize children into the student role. In the upper elementary grades more whole-class teaching methods are used, which may minimize expectation effects. Some evidence supports this claim; expectancy effects in Rosenthal and Jacobson's (1968) study were strongest during the earlier grades. Raudenbush's (1984) meta-analysis of findings from different teacher expectancy studies in which expectancies were induced by giving teachers artificial information about children's intelligence showed that expectancy effects were stronger in Grades 1 and 2 than in Grades 3 through Grade 6, especially when the information was given to teachers during the first few weeks of school. These findings are particularly relevant because they show a form of the expectancy theory: how teachers have certain expectations of students, and how they treat the students differently because of those expectations. Criticisms Critics of the expectancy model include Graen (1969), Lawler (1971), Lawler and Porter (1967), and Porter and Lawler (1968). Their criticisms of the theory were based upon the expectancy model being too simplistic in nature; these critics started making adjustments to Vroom's model. Edward Lawler claims that the simplicity of expectancy theory is deceptive because it assumes that if an employer makes a reward (such as a financial bonus or promotion) enticing enough, employees will increase their productivity to obtain the reward. However, this only works if the employees believe the reward is beneficial to their immediate needs. For example, a $2 increase in salary may not be desirable to an employee if the increase pushes her into a tax bracket in which she believes her net pay is actually reduced (a belief that is typically fallacious, especially in the United States). Similarly, a promotion that provides higher status but requires longer hours may be a deterrent to an employee who values evening and weekend time with their children. As an additional example, if a person in the armed forces or security agencies is promoted, there is the possibility that he or she will be transferred to other locations. In such cases, if the new posting is far from their permanent residence where their family resides, they will not be motivated by such promotions and the results will backfire. As such, the reward is valued negatively to the person receiving it. Lawler's new proposal for expectancy theory does not contradict Vroom's theory. Lawler argues that since there have been a variety of developments of expectancy theory since its creation in 1964 that the expectancy model needs to be updated. Lawler's new model is based on four claims. First, whenever there are a number of outcomes, individuals will usually have a preference among those outcomes. Second, there is a belief on the part of that individual that their action(s) will achieve the outcome they desire. Third, any desired outcome was generated by the individual's behavior. Fourth and finally, the actions generated by the individual were generated by the preferred outcome and expectation of the individual. Instead of simply looking at expectancy and instrumentality, W.F. Maloney and J.M. McFillen found that expectancy theory could explain the motivation of those individuals who were employed by the construction industry. For instance, they used worker expectancy and worker instrumentality. Worker expectancy is when supervisors create an equal match between the worker and their job. Worker instrumentality is when an employee knows that any increase in their performance leads to achieving their goal. In the chapter entitled \\"On the Origins of Expectancy Theory\\" published in Great Minds in Management by Ken G. Smith and Michael A. Hitt, Vroom himself agreed with some of these criticisms and stated that he felt that the theory should be expanded to include research conducted since the original publication of his book.

It was owned by Peoples Broadcasting and shared studio space with its AM sister station, WRFD 880 AM. At first, the two stations simulcast their programming. But part of the day and evening, WRFD-FM began airing a separate classical music format. In 1967, Peoples Broadcasting sold the FM station to Nationwide Communications, a subsidiary of Nationwide Insurance. =WNCI Young Sound= In early 1967, Nationwide sought a change in the station's call sign, switching to WNCI, representing Nationwide Communications, Incorporated. In mid 1968, WNCI began programming a syndicated format supplied by CBS Radio known as the \\"Young Sound.\\" It was an easy listening sound, a mix of vocals and instrumentals, a bit more contemporary and upbeat compared with the more typical beautiful music format heard on many FM stations. In 1972, WNCI moved to the sixth floor of the new Scot's Inn, later the Carousel Inn, at 4900 Sinclair Road. Since that time, the studios of WNCI have been relocated to various places in the Columbus area, including the Nationwide Building, The Continent, \\"Broadcast Lake\\" (a former quarry overlooked by several Clear Channel radio studios and the television studios of WSYX), and the current location at 2323 West Fifth Avenue. =Contemporary Hits= In 1970, WNCI switched to a Top 40 format, in an era where most contemporary stations were found on the AM dial. At first, the station also broadcast an evening \\"progressive rock\\" album-based show, which had begun in the fall of 1969. From 1979 to 1982, the station attempted a full-service adult contemporary music format to compete with WTVN, adding a 5-person news staff. Its slogan at the time was \\"The Best Is At The Center,\\" playing on its location on the FM dial. The format was abandoned in 1982 and the station returned to the Top 40 format. In June 1993, WNCI again morphed into a Hot Adult Contemporary sound to compete with rival Sunny 95 WSNY, which had a softer AC format. This lasted for nearly a year before WNCI moved back into a CHR/Top 40 direction.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-10-28.pdf Jacor Communications acquired the broadcasting assets of Nationwide Communications in 1997 for $620 million. WNCI was once the flagship for the 17 radio station group owned by Nationwide Communications, a division of the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company. Nationwide continues to be an advertiser with the station. WNCI was named the \\"Top 40 Station of the Year\\" in 2005, 2006 and 2007 for market sizes 26 to 100 at the annual Radio & Records convention.Other stations applaud WIXX in national radio judging; Warren Gerds; November 19, 2007 Green Bay Press- Gazette; Retrieved November 19, 2007 For much of the last four decades, WNCI has been quite successful in the ratings, sometimes hitting #1 and stopping other owners from trying Top 40 or Hot AC format to compete with WNCI. WNCI's name recognition in the Columbus radio market has meant that iHeartMedia has had no need to convert the station to its KISS-FM branding, found on iHeart Top 40 stations in Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas, as well as such Ohio cities as Cleveland, Cincinnati and Toledo. However, WNCI's current logo features the print style of most KISS-FM stations. =Superpower Status= The station has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 175,000 watts horizontal polarization and 105,000 vertical. That is 3.5 times what would normally be permitted, but is grandfathered at that high power level. This is because WNCI was established before current Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations were enacted. There are only six FM stations in the United States that operate with more power. Most FM stations in Ohio and much of the Northeastern United States are limited to 50,000 watts. =Air Personalities= Weekdays: *Mornings - Dave & Jimmy *Middays - On Air with Ryan Seacrest *Afternoons - Chris Davis *Evenings - Sol Tsonis Weekends: * On The Move with Enrique Santos (Saturdays) * Most Requested Live with Romeo (Saturdays) * American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest (Sundays) * Remix Top 30 with Hollywood Hamilton (Sundays) * The Vibe with Tanya & EJ (Sundays) References External links Contemporary hit radio stations in the United States Nationwide Communications Radio stations established in 1961 NCI IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WNCI"},{"id":"596733","title":"Mohammad Ali Bogra"},{"id":"596736","text":"The Taurus Mountains (Turkish: Toros Daƒülarƒ±), are a mountain complex in southern Turkey, separating the Mediterranean coastal region from the central Anatolian Plateau.

The highest point in the Central Taurus is Mt. Demirkazƒ±k (3,756m). The Cilician Gates or G√ºlek Pass has been the principal pass through the Eastern Taurus since ancient times, connecting the coastal plain of Cilicia with Central Anatolia.

They include the Nurhak Mountains, Malatya Mountains, Maden Mountains, Gen√ß Mountains, and Bitlis Mountains. They are in the watershed of the Euphrates River and Tigris River. Image:Kale.jpg  Malatya's Castle district and the Southeastern Taurus Image:Karakaya dam-GAP.jpg  Karakaya Dam. Geology The Taurus Mountains were formed by the collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates. The predominant underlying rock is limestone. In the Aladaglar and Bolkar mountains, limestone has eroded to form karstic landscapes of waterfalls, underground rivers, and some of the largest caves of Asia. The Manavgat River originates on the southern slopes of the Beydaglari range. Climate The mountains have a Mediterranean climate, with a dry summer and rainy winters. Temperatures vary with elevation, with warm winters on the lower coastal slopes and cold winters in the high mountains and in the interior. Flora and fauna At lower elevations, the predominant vegetation forest and woodland of evergreen oaks and Calabrian Pine (Pinus brutia), and areas of maquis shrubland. Above 1200 meters elevation are montane forests of black pine (Pinus nigra), Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani), Taurus fir (Abies cilicica), and juniper (Juniperus spp.). The high peaks are home to alpine meadows. History Gulf of Issus and Antioch =Pre-history and early Roman period= The bull was commonly the symbol and depiction of ancient Near Eastern storm gods, hence Taurus the bull, and hence the name of the mountains. The mountains are a place of many ancient storm-god temples.Ravinell, Alberto and Green, Whitney The Storm-god in the Ancient Near East, p.126. Torrential thunderstorms in these mountains were deemed by the ancient Syrians to be the work of the storm-god Adad to make the Tigris and Euphrates rivers rise and flood and thereby fertilise their land.Saggs, H.W.F. The greatness that was Babylon: a survey of the ancient civilization of the Tigris-Euphrates Valley, Sidgwick & Jackson, 2nd Revised edition, 1988, p.380. The Hurrians, probably originators of the various storm-gods of the ancient Near East, were a people whom modern scholars place in the Taurus Mountains at their probable earliest origins. A Bronze Age archaeological site, where early evidence of tin mining was found, is at Kestel.Yener, K.A. (2000) The Domestication of Metals: The Rise of Complex Metal Industries in Anatolia Brill, Leiden, p. 91 The pass known in antiquity as the Cilician Gates crosses the range north of Tarsus. The Amanus range in southern Turkey is where the Taurus Mountains are pushed up as three tectonic plates come together. The Amanus is a natural frontier: west is Cilicia, east is Syria. There are several passes, like the Amanian Gate (Bah√ße Pass), which are of great strategical importance. In 333 BC at the Battle of Issus, Alexander the Great defeated Darius III Codomannus in the foothills along the coast between these two passes. In the Second Temple period, Jewish authors seeking to establish with greater precision the geographical definition of the Promised Land, began to construe Mount Hor as a reference to the Amanus range of the Taurus Mountains, which marked the northern limit of the Syrian plain. = Late Roman period to present = During World War I, the German and Turkish railway system through the Taurus Mountains proved to be a major strategic objective of the Allies. This region was specifically mentioned as a strategically controlled objective slated for surrender to the Allies in the Armistice, which ended hostilities against the Ottoman Empire.Price, Ward (16 December 1918) \\"Danger in Taurus Tunnels\\" New York Times Attractions In addition to hiking and mountain climbing, there are two ski resorts on the mountain range, one at Davras about from the two nearest towns of Egirdir and Isparta, the second is Saklƒ±kent from the city of Antalya. The Varda Viaduct, situated on the railway lines Konya-Adana at Hacƒ±kƒ±rƒ± village in Adana Province, is a railway bridge constructed in the 1910s by Germans.

G. Keulemans) (8 June 1842 ‚Äì 29 March 1912) was a Dutch bird illustrator. For most of his life he lived and worked in England, illustrating many of the best-known ornithology books of the nineteenth century.  Biography  Keulemans was born in Rotterdam. As a young man he collected animal specimens for museums such as the Natural History Museum in Leiden, whose director, Hermann Schlegel, encouraged Keulemans and sent him on the 1864 expedition to West Africa. In 1869, he was persuaded by Richard Bowdler Sharpe to illustrate his Monograph of the Alcedinidae, or Family of Kingfishers (1868-1871) and to move to England, where he lived for the rest of his life. He was married twice, and had eight children by his first wife and seven children by his second wife. Only nine of his children reached adulthood. He also wrote topics on spirituality, and claimed he had a premonition at the moment of death of one of his sons. He died in Ilford, Essex (now part of Greater London) and is buried in Buckingham Road cemetery, Ilford, in an unmarked grave.  Work  Keulemans regularly provided illustrations for The Ibis and The Proceedings of the Zoological Society. He illustrated many important bird books, including Buller's A History of the Birds of New Zealand (1873, 1888), William Vincent Legge's History of the Birds of Ceylon (1880), Daniel Giraud Elliot's Monograph of the Bucerotidae (hornbills) (1887‚Äì1892), Henry Seebohm's Monograph of the Turdidae (thrushes) (1902), Osbert Salvin's Biologia Centrali-Americana (1879‚Äì1904), Edgar Leopold Layard's Birds of South Africa (1887) and Henry Eeles Dresser's History of the Birds of Europe (1871‚Äì1896), and a single illustration in The Journal of the Linnean Society. One of his last great achievements was his contribution of over one hundred plates for Frederick Du Cane Godman's Monograph of the Petrels (1907‚Äì1910). He also spent some time collecting birds in Cape Verde and West Africa. An illustration of the extinct great auk by Keulemans Keulemans is credited with describing the Cape Verde swamp-warbler, Calamodyta (Acrocephalus) brevipennis.Nederl. Tijdschr. Dierk. 3, 1866; ex Dohrn. This is a drab bird about 14‚Äì16 cm., light brown above and on its flanks, and buff below. He did not publish an illustration of it, but his plate for Acrocephalus brunnescens in George Henderson's Lahore to Yarkand (pl. XVI) is similar. His notes and findings on the island of Principe, along with those of his colleague Dr. H. Dohrn, would eventually become the basis for a later description of a rare ibis, Lampribis rothschildi Bannerman. The only significant biography of Keulemans is by Jan Coldewey and Tony Keulemans, Feathers to Brush, a book that includes a bibliography of the artist's publications, a genealogical tree and appendices detailing his spiritualism, with a sample of his financial correspondence. Also of note is a contemporary obituary of Keulemans in the journal British Birds (1912). Tony Keulemans later wrote Beyond the grave, which tells the story of a remarkable discovery of a painting John Gerrard had made of his own gravestone. And finally, Tony Keulemans wrote an errata list to Feathers to Brush, which includes additional literature references and new genealogical findings. Keulemans's work is characterised by its consistency, showing little change over the course of his career, and focused to an extraordinary degree on the rendering of fine detail. These generalisations have also proven to be the basis for unjustified criticism of his work,Lambourne, The Art of Bird Illustration since the nature of scientific illustration places a premium on consistency. Aside from this, a number of critics have rightly placed Keulemans above his contemporaries;Errol Fuller, Extinct Birds rev. ed. his ability to create accurate and vivid representations of birds gave him prominence in his field. Red-banded fruiteater (Pipreola whitelyi), 1886 Keulemans was prodigious in his output - he was commissioned to paint pictures of birds extensively throughout his career, and his prints were published continuously from 1867 to 1911. Keulemans' first prints appeared in two books by Francois Pollen, Contributions a l'histoire naturelle des Lemuriens (1867) and Een blik in Madagascar (1867). Some appeared after his death until 1915 (Mathews, Birds of Australia); he had rendered the images on stone well before publication of these works. A calculation of his total output gives about 4,000-5,000 published illustrations. The vast majority of these were vignettes published within octavo-size books and publications, and a great number of his works also appeared in quarto (Dresser/Europe) and in folio (Seebohm/Turdidae and DuCane Godman/Petrels). While the subject of his illustrations was almost entirely avian, he was also commissioned to create portraits of mammals, insects, and shells. Most of the illustrations by Keulemans were produced through traditional lithography, allowing for a finished product that depicts a vivid, lifelike figure through depth and tone. Printing was carried out by the two firms of Mintern and Hanhart, and early in his career, some were printed by P. M. W. Trap. Often, the published lithographs were not coloured, and perhaps some (Journal of the Linnean Society, 1878) were not intended to be coloured. The technique of lithography made it necessary for the print to be coloured by hand. This was done by semi-skilled artisans working in an assembly line in a manner similar to stencilling. While Keulemans' talents as a draughtsman were hardly disputed by his contemporaries, often the finished, coloured plates were the subject of criticism (Sharpe/Alcedinidae). If the depicted colours did not match those of the birds, the value of the finished product was diminished. Keulemans painted remarkable pictures of extinct birds, including Walter Rothschild's Avifauna of Laysan, Extinct Birds (1907). Examples in the American Museum of Natural History in New York include the Choiseul crested pigeon, Kangaroo Island emu, huia, Lyall's wren, Hawaii oo, Hawaii mamo, Oahu oo, Guadalupe petrel, and the laughing owl. = Onze vogels in huis en tuin (Our birds in home and garden) = The only work that was not only illustrated but also written by Keulemans, was Onze vogels in huis en tuin (Our birds in home and garden). It was a three volume work in Dutch that appeared between 1869 and 1876. * 1869: Onze vogels in huis en tuin vol. 1. 242 text pages; 70 images; 3 pages contents.alt=Wikisource logo Onze vogels in huis en tuin, vol.

In this work Keulemans does write about a number of native birds, but he also describes (and paints) a number of cagebirds and aviary birds. Keulemans is famous for his illustrations, but in this book he shows that he is a very able observer of birds in the field as well.Voous 1995, p. 300 The chapter on the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus in vol. 2,Keulemans 1873, De koekoek (the cuckoo). for instance, has 13 pages of text, with a number of field observations by Keulemans. In vol. 2 he describes the grey parrot (grijze roodstaartpapegaai) Psittacus erithacus in vol. 2, giving an extensive account of field observations done on the island of Pr√≠ncipe in de Gulf of Guinea.Keulemans 1873, De roodstaartpapegaai (the African grey parrot). Keulemans stayed there around 1865 during a year.He wrote a report in: , 1866. Opmerkingen over de vogels van de Kaap-Verdische Eilanden en van Prins-Eiland (Ilhado Principe) in de bogt van Guinea gelegen. Ned. Tijdschr. Dierk., 3(11-12): 363-401 - Vogels van de Kaap-Verdische Eilanden (birds of Cape Verde islands) on alt=Wikisource logo Dutch Wikisource. Many other chapters of Onze vogels in huis en tuin also show that Keulemans was a careful observer of the species he painted and described.  Interest in spiritualism  An older Keulemans According to the authors of Keulemans' biography Feathers to Brush, the artist's interest in spiritualism began with a premonition of his son Isidore's death. In an article in the Bristol Mercury and Daily Post of 3 March 1883, Keulemans tells how he and his family were living in Paris in December 1880 when there was an outbreak of smallpox. The parents sent three of their children to London to live with their grandparents; one of the children was his favorite son Isidore, aged four. In the morning of 24 January 1881, Keulemans woke up and heard Isidore's voice and saw his face. The apparition returned the next day, which made Keulemans very uneasy. A few days later he received a letter from London to tell him Isidore was ill, when in fact he had died exactly on the day of the first appearance of Isidore in John Gerrard's dream.Keulemans and Coldewey, 1982. [See Further reading for full details.] Subsequently, Keulemans experienced further incidents increasing his belief in the supernatural, in particular which he claimed could be awakened via the painting of a bird's eye. Keulemans began an association with the Society for Psychical Research; later he became disenchanted with the prevalence of fraud in spiritualist society, and used his scientific training to expose the trickery he saw performed by mediums. > Keulemans claimed to have visited nearly 400 seances and gave some examples > of the alleged trickery in support of his criticisms. He seems not to have > been opposed to Spiritualism in its philosophical or metaphysical bases, but > against its pretensions as a science based on demonstrable fact.

Such non-polar solvents are themselves lipophilic (translated as \\"fat-loving\\" or \\"fat-liking\\"Compendium of Chemical Terminology, lipophilic, accessed 15 Jan 2007.), and the axiom that \\"like dissolves like\\" generally holds true. Thus lipophilic substances tend to dissolve in other lipophilic substances, but hydrophilic (\\"water-loving\\") substances tend to dissolve in water and other hydrophilic substances. Lipophilicity, hydrophobicity, and non-polarity may describe the same tendency towards participation in the London dispersion force, as the terms are often used interchangeably. However, the terms \\"lipophilic\\" and \\"hydrophobic\\" are not synonymous, as can be seen with silicones and fluorocarbons, which are hydrophobic but not lipophilic. Surfactants Hydrocarbon-based surfactants are compounds that are amphiphilic (or amphipathic), having a hydrophilic, water interactive \\"end\\", referred to as their \\"head group\\", and a lipophilic \\"end\\", usually a long chain hydrocarbon fragment, referred to as their \\"tail\\". They congregate at low energy surfaces, including the air-water interface (lowering surface tension) and the surfaces of the water-immiscible droplets found in oil/water emulsions (lowering interfacial tension). At these surfaces they naturally orient themselves with their head groups in water and their tails either sticking up and largely out of water (as at the air-water interface) or dissolved in the water-immiscible phase that the water is in contact with (e.g. as the emulsified oil droplet). In both these configurations the head groups strongly interact with water while the tails avoid all contact with water. Surfactant molecules also aggregate in water as micelles with their head groups sticking out and their tails bunched together. Micelles draw oily substances into their hydrophobic cores, explaining the basic action of soaps and detergents used for personal cleanliness and for laundering clothes. Micelles are also biologically important for the transport of fatty substances in the small intestine surface in the first step that leads to the absorption of the components of fats (largely fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides). Cell membranes are bilayer structures principally formed from phospholipids, molecules which have a highly water interactive, ionic phosphate head groups attached to two long alkyl tails. By contrast, fluorosurfactants are not amphiphilic or detergents because fluorocarbons are not lipophilic. Oxybenzone, a common cosmetic ingredient often used in sunscreens, is particularly penetrative because it is not very lipophilic.Hanson KM, Gratton E, Bardeen CJ. 2006. Sunscreen enhancement of UV-induced reactive oxygen species in the skin.

He was a prominent poet of the New York School of poetry. This was a loose group of poets including Frank O'Hara and John Ashbery that eschewed contemporary introspective poetry in favor of an exuberant, cosmopolitan style that drew major inspiration from travel, painting, and music. Life Koch (pronounced coke) was born Jay Kenneth Koch in Cincinnati, Ohio. He began writing poetry at an early age, discovering the work of Shelley and Keats in his teenage years. At the age of 18, he served in WWII as a U.S. Army infantryman in the Philippines. After his service, he attended Harvard University, where he met future New York School poet John Ashbery. After graduating from Harvard in 1948 and moving to New York City, Koch studied for and received his Ph.D. from Columbia University. In 1951, he met his first wife, Janice Elwood, at UC Berkeley; they married in 1954 and lived in France and Italy for over a year. Their daughter, Katherine, was born in Rome in 1955 (In 1982, Katherine married poet Mark Statman, one of Koch's former students). In 1959, he joined the faculty in the Department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia and he taught classes at Columbia for over forty years. His first wife died in 1981; Koch married his second wife, Karen Culler, in 1994. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1996. Koch died from a year-long battle with leukemia in 2002. Career While a student at Harvard, Koch won the prestigious Glascock Prize in 1948. In 1962, Koch was writer in residence at the New York City Writer's Conference at Wagner College. The 1960s saw his first published books of poetry, but his poetry did not garner wider popular acclaim until the 1970s with his book The Art of Love: Poems (1975). He continued writing poetry and releasing books of poetry up until his death. Koch won the Bollingen Prize for One Train (1994) and On The Great Atlantic Rainway: Selected Poems 1950-1988 (1994), followed closely by the Phi Beta Kappa Poetry Award winner New Addresses (2000). In 1970, Koch released a pioneering book in poetry education, Wishes, Lies and Dreams: Teaching Children To Write Poetry. Over the next 30 years, he followed this book with other books and anthologies on poetry education tailored to teaching poetry appreciation and composition to children, adults, and the elderly. Koch wrote hundreds of avant-garde plays over the course of his 50-year career, highlighted by drama collections like 1000 Avant-Garde Plays (1988), which only contains 116 plays, many of them only one scene or a few minutes in length. His prose work is highlighted by The Red Robins (1975), a sprawling novel about a group of fighter pilots flying for personal freedom under the leadership of Santa Claus. He also published a book of short stories, Hotel Lambosa (1988), loosely based on and inspired by his world travels. He also produced at least one libretto, and several of his poems have been set to music by composers. Koch taught poetry at Columbia University, where his classes were popular. His wild humor and intense teaching style, often punctuated by unusual physicality (standing on a table to shout lines by Walt Whitman) and outbursts of vocal performance often drawn from Italian opera, drew non-English majors and alumni. Some of the spirit of these lectures is contained in his final book on poetry education, Making Your Own Days (1998). His students included poets Ron Padgett, David Shapiro, Frank Lima, Alan Feldman, David Lehman, Jordan Davis, Jessy Randall, David Baratier, Loren Goodman and Carson Cistulli. His poems were translated into German by the poet Nicolas Born in 1973 for the renowned \\"red-frame-series\\" of the Rowohlt Verlag. Koch had a brush with the anarchist affinity group Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers in early January 1968. During a poetry reading at St. Mark's Church, a member of the group walked in and pointed a handgun at the podium, shouting \\"Koch!\\" before firing one blank round. The poet regained his composure and said to the \\"shooter,\\" \\"Grow up.\\" Poetry Koch asked in his poem Fresh Air (1956) why poets were writing about dull subjects with dull forms. Modern poetry was solemn, boring, and uneventful. Koch described poems \\"Written by the men with their eyes on the myth/ And the missus and the midterms...\\" He attacked the idea that poetry should be in any way stale. Koch wrote of how: The Waste Land gave the time's most accurate data, It seemed, and Eliot was the Great Dictator Of literature. One hardly dared to wink Or fool around in any way in poems, And critics poured out awful jereboams To irony, ambiguity, and tension ‚Äì And other things I do not wish to mention. (Excerpt from ‚Äò'Seasons on Earth',‚Äô 1987) Though not against T. S. Eliot, Koch opposed the idea that in order to write poetry one had to be depressed or think that the world is a terrible place.Interview with Kenneth Koch 5 August 1993 His ideas were developed with close friends Frank O'Hara and John Ashbery, along with painters Jane Freilicher and Larry Rivers, among others. He once remarked that \\"Maybe you can almost characterize the poetry of the New York School as having as one of its main subjects the fullness and richness of life and the richness of possibility and excitement and happiness.\\" In his poem The Art of Poetry (1975) Koch offered guidelines to writing good poetry. Among his 10 suggestions are \\"1) Is it astonishing?\\" and \\"10) Would I be happy to go to Heaven with this pinned on to my angelic jacket as an entrance show? Oh would I?\\" Koch once remarked that \\"Children have a natural talent for writing poetry and anyone who teaches them should know that.\\" In his poems: #He mixed word usage with various levels of imagery; #He set two contrasting tones next to each other, simplicity and silliness at the same time; #He spoke to everything, animate and inanimate objects; #He used parody of other poets to express his own views, both serious and comic. Koch was labeled by some as just a comedic poet. He acknowledged this in an interview and offered his comments: He gives a picture of this in \\"To Kidding Around,\\" where the joys of being a joker are proclaimed: To be rid of troubles Of one person by turning into Someone else, moving and jolting As if nothing mattered but today In fact nothing But this precise moment... (Excerpt from To Kidding Around, 2000) Theater Koch collaborated with the composer Ned Rorem on an opera, Bertha, which received its premier in 1973. His short play, George Washington Crossing the Delaware, was produced in 1962. Numerous others of his plays have been produced.http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsK/koch-kenneth.html Selected works *Poems (1953) *Ko: or, A Season on Earth (1959) *Permanently (1961) *Thank You and Other Poems (1962) *Bertha, & other plays (1966) *Poems from 1952 and 1953 (1968) *The Pleasures of Peace and Other Poems (1969) *Sleeping with Women (1969) *When the Sun Tries to Go On (1969) *The Art of Love (1975) *The Duplications (1977) *The Burning Mystery of Anna in 1951 (1979) *From the Air (1979) *Days and Nights (1982) *On the Edge (1986) *Seasons on Earth (1987) *On the Great Atlantic Rainway: Selected Poems 1950‚Äì1988 (1994) *One Train (1994) *Straits (1998) *New Addresses (2000) *A Possible World (2002) Notes References *Benfey, Christopher. \\"Wise Guy.\\" The New Republic 13 Mar. 1995: 39-42.

Norton stands on rising ground west of Billingham Beck, which flows south-east to join the River Tees. Blakeston is in the north-west of the parish and Hardwick in the west; between them lie Middlefield and Howden. Ouston Moor is in the south-west corner, Newham and Ragworth lie near the south, and Holme House Prison in the south-east. The original village dates back to at least the Anglo-Saxon period. Once a market town, for centuries Norton was the centre of an important parish that included Stockton, but its status was reversed in 1913 and Norton became a part of the borough of Stockton on Tees. In 1968 Norton became a part of Teesside County Borough. In 1974 Teesside County Borough was abolished. Norton became a part of the reconstituted and significantly bigger Borough of Stockton-on-Tees, in the new County of Cleveland. Stockton-on-Tees became a unitary authority in 1996. Norton Village The Green, Norton, County Durham during winter. Norton village consists of a wide, tree-lined High Street with a number of shops, hairdressers, boutiques and caf√©s, a library, photographic studio and a traditional fish & chips shop, as well as a mixture of 18th century and 19th century townhouses, cottages and modern apartments. To the south end of High Street, the Victoria Jubilee Memorial Cross stands where the market place was once situated. The red sandstone Anglian style cross commemorates Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. Further along, and on the opposite side of the High Street are the Fox almshouses, also founded in 1897 at the bequest of local brewer John Henry Fox. At the north end there is a large village green with a duckpond, surrounded by mostly Georgian houses and cottages. The ancient parish church of St. Mary the Virgin stands dominantly on the west side of the village Green. The buildings in the middle of the Green now house a newsagent shop, cafe and community hall where once a blacksmith's forge stood. Away from the village lie the housing estates of Albany, Glebe, Crooksbarn and Norton Grange (originally Blue Hall). The Green, Norton, County Durham during November 2019. In 1982, the chance discovery of human bones by school children playing on a rope swing near the Mill Lane area of the village, led to the unearthing of an Anglo-Saxon pagan cemetery. Excavations in 1984 revealed 120 burials (117 inhumations and 3 cremations) in graves that contained assorted personal items such as spears, belt buckles and brooches. The remains and objects collected suggest the site was dated to around AD 540‚Äì610. The Green, Norton, County Durham during December 2019. St Mary's Church St Mary the Virgin, the ancient parish church that stands on the village green, is the only cruciform Anglo-Saxon church in northern England. Its crossing tower with eight triangular head windows has a battlemented top of later date, and there is a 14th-century effigy of a knight in chainmail. Residing under the church floor there is claimed to be an escape tunnel used by the Saxons and priests when in danger, though it may be a drainage culvert. The tunnel leads under the church floor and Norton Green, eventually surfacing in the Albany housing estate. The church floor was recently renovated and Saxon remains and artefacts were discovered in the tunnel entrance. St Mary's was until the Reformation a Catholic Church. The grave of John Walker, the inventor of friction matches, is located in the churchyard.http://www.stmarysnorton.org.uk/ Norton's Catholic population now worship at St Joseph in Darlington Lane. The church opened in 1933 and is part of the St Hilda Partnership within the Hexham and Newcastle Diocese. The current priest is Fr Jeff Dodds. Red House School Located in the village is Red House School, an independent school established in 1929. Adjacent to St. Mary's Church is Red House Nursery & Infant School, which combines state of the art modern buildings with classrooms in the former Old Vicarage. On the opposite side of the village green resides Red House Preparatory and Main School. In May 2012, the school announced its intention to relocate to nearby Wynyard Park stating that it had outgrown its existing site in Norton. This, however, did not occur as the school decided to improve the existing site. Pubs, Caf√©s and Restaurants 12 Harland Place, deli & dining room in Norton Norton is home to a number of pubs: Norton Tavern, CiC@74 (known as Norton Cricket Club by locals),The Centenary, The Unicorn (known as The Top House by locals), The George and Dragon, The Highland Laddie, The Malleable Social Club, Connections, Red Lion, Norton Working Men's Club, The Head Of Steam, Hydes Bar, Alitheos and Canteen and Cocktails. The village also has a number of restaurants and caf√©s including Scrann, The Open Jar, 12 Harland Place, Cafe Lilly and Cafe Maison. Sport The Norton (Teesside) Sports Complex is situated on Station Road and dates back to 1847 when it was the home of Norton Cricket Club. At the Club's Centenary Dinner in 1947, the members decided to buy the ground (and a further twelve acres surrounding it) with a view to developing it into one of the finest sports complexes in the north of England. During the past few decades further land was acquired and now as well as being home to Norton Cricket Club, it provides facilities for a number of other sports, including: squash, tennis, hockey, bowls, five-a-side football, archery and boxfit. The complex is also home to the Billingham Synthonia Football Club and is now again home to Norton & Stockton Ancients Football Club, reinstated in 2019 having folded 3 years previously in 2016. Notable events 6 August 1856, John Warner and Sons cast the first bell for Big Ben, but it cracked beyond repair while being tested at Westminster. Another bell was later recast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London. 14 July 1977, Queen Elizabeth II passed through Norton by car, in front of spectators during her Silver Jubilee royal visit to the region. 11 November 2006, Dragon's Den businessman Duncan Bannatyne (who owned a house on the High Street at the time, later moving to nearby Wynyard Park) was married at St Mary's Church in Norton.

The southern end of the Cilician gates is about 44 km north of Tarsus and the northern end leads to Cappadocia. History Yumuktepe (modern Mersin), which guards the Adana side of the gateway, with 23 layers of occupation, is at 4,500 BCE, one of the oldest fortified settlements in the world. The ancient pathway was a track for mule caravans, not wheeled vehicles. The Hittites, Greeks, Alexander the Great, the Romans, Byzantines and Sasanians, Mongols, and the Crusaders have all traveled this route during their campaigns. The Bible testifies that Saint Paul of Tarsus and Silas went this way as they went through Syria and Cilicia. The Book of Galatians speaks of the cities of Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium - cities visited by Paul on his first journey (Acts 14; Gal. 1:2), with the purpose of strengthening their churches, at the beginning of the second preaching journey (Acts 15:40-41). The distance from the Anatolian plateau to the Cilician plain is about . In ancient times, this was a journey of nearly five days. Saint Paul spoke, according to the Bible, about being in \\"dangers from rivers\\" and \\"dangers from robbers\\" (2 Cor. 11:26). This may explain why one of the world's oldest fortresses was built at the southeastern end of the Cilician Gates around 4500 BCE. The Army of the Ten Thousand, Alexander the Great before the Battle of Issus, Paul of Tarsus on his way to the Galatians, and part of the army of the First Crusade all passed through the Cilician Gates. The Crusaders allied themselves with the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Above the Gates to the southwest is G√ºlek Kalesi (Armenian: Kuklak; Arab: KawlƒÅk), a large fortification of considerable antiquity that retains evidence of Byzantine and Arab periods of occupation, but is primarily an Armenian construction of the 12th and 13th centuries. Its circuit walls and towers at the south and west cover a distance of over 450 meters. Below the Cilician Gates is the medieval Armenian fortress of Anah≈üa with its large horseshoe-shaped towers and three impressive entrances.The 1979 photographic survey and a plan of Anah≈üa castle Also in the vicinity of the Gates is a fort built in the 1830s by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt during his Syrian campaign against the Ottomans.M.

A designator is persistently rigid if it also designates nothing in all other possible worlds. A designator is obstinately rigid if it designates the same thing in every possible world, period, whether or not that thing exists in that world. Rigid designators are contrasted with connotative terms, non-rigid or flaccid designators, which may designate different things in different possible worlds. History The Scholastic philosophers in the Middle Ages developed a theory of properties of terms in which different classifications of concepts feature prominently. Concepts, and the terms that signify them, can be divided into absolute or connotative, according to the mode in which they signify. If they signify something absolutely, that is, after the manner of substance, they are absolute, for example rock, lion, man, whiteness, wisdom, tallness. If they signify something connotatively, that is, with reference to a subject of inherence, i.e., after the manner of accidents, they are connotative, for example, white, wise, tall. Both connotative and absolute concepts can be used to signify accidents, but since connotative concepts signify with a reference to a subject of inherence, they can refer to object with different definitions and properties (i.e. with different essences). For example, large, as a connotative concept, can signify objects with many distinct essences: a man, a lion, a triangle can be large. On the other hand, absolute concepts signify objects that have the same definitions and properties. For example, the concept of gold, as an absolute concept, can signify only objects with the same definitions and properties (i.e. with the same essence). Proper names and definite descriptions The notion of absolute concepts was then revived by Saul Kripke, with the name ‚Äúrigid designation‚Äù, in the lectures that became Naming and Necessity, in the course of his argument against descriptivist theories of reference, building on the work of Ruth Barcan Marcus. At the time of Kripke's lectures, the dominant theory of reference in analytic philosophy (associated with the theories of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell) was that the meaning of sentences involving proper names could be given by substituting a contextually appropriate description for the name. Russell,Russell, Bertrand (1917), Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description for example, famously held that someone who had never met Otto von Bismarck might know of him as the first Chancellor of the German Empire, and if so, his statement that (say) \\"Bismarck was a ruthless politician\\" should be understood to mean \\"The first Chancellor of the German Empire was a ruthless politician\\" (which could in turn be analysed into a series of more basic statements according to the method Russell introduced in his theory of definite descriptions). Kripke argued‚Äîagainst both the Russellian analysis and several attempted refinements of it‚Äîthat such descriptions could not possibly mean the same thing as the name \\"Bismarck,\\" on the grounds that proper names such as \\"Bismarck\\" always designate rigidly, whereas descriptions such as \\"the first Chancellor of the German Empire\\" do not. Thus, for example, it might have been the case that Bismarck died in infancy. If so, he would not have ever satisfied the description \\"the first Chancellor of the German Empire,\\" and (indeed) someone else probably would have. It does not follow that the first Chancellor of the German Empire may not have been the first Chancellor of the German Empire-- that is (at least according to its surface-structure) a contradiction. Kripke argues that the way that proper names work is that when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of Bismarck, we are talking about what might or might not have been true of that particular person in various situations, whereas when we make statements about what might or might not have been true of, say, the first Chancellor of the German Empire we could be talking about what might or might not have been true of whoever would have happened to fill that office in those situations. The \\"could\\" here is important to note: rigid designation is a property of the way terms are used, not a property of the terms themselves, and some philosophers, following Keith Donnellan, have argued that a phrase such as \\"the first Chancellor of the German Empire\\" could be used rigidly, in sentences such as \\"the first Chancellor of the German Empire could have decided never to go into politics.\\" Kripke himself doubted that there was any need to recognize rigid uses of definite descriptions, and argued that Russell's notion of scope offered all that was needed to account for such sentences. But in either case, Kripke argued, nothing important in his account depends on the question. Whether definite descriptions can be used rigidly or not, they can at least sometimes be used non-rigidly, but a proper name can only be used rigidly; the asymmetry, Kripke argues, demonstrates that no definite description could give the meaning of a proper name--although it might be used to explain who a name refers to (that is, to \\"fix the referent\\" of the name). Essentialism In Naming and Necessity, Kripke argues that proper names and certain natural kind terms--including biological taxa and types of natural substances (most famously, \\"water\\" and \\"H2O\\") designate rigidly. He argues for a form of scientific essentialism not unlike Aristotelian essentialism. Essential properties are common to an object in all possible worlds, and so they pick out the same objects in all possible worlds - they rigidly designate. Causal-historical theory of reference Proper names rigidly designate for reasons that differ from natural kinds terms. The reason 'Johnny Depp' refers to one particular person in all possible worlds is because some person initially gave the name to him by saying something like \\"Let's call our baby 'Johnny Depp'\\". This is called the initial baptism. This usage of 'Johnny Depp' for referring to some particular baby got passed on from person-to- person in a giant causal and historical chain of events. That is why everybody calls Johnny Depp 'Johnny Depp'. Johnny's mother passed it onto her friends who passed it onto their friends who passed it onto their friends, and so on. Necessary identities One puzzling consequence of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators are necessary. If water is H2O, then water is necessarily H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, water is necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily H2O, but conditionally, if water is H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily H2O.

He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop for the Washington Senators. Nicknamed \\"Yo-Yo\\" by his teammates, he was listed at 5' 3\\", 140 lb. Davalillo batted and threw right-handed. Career Davalillo is listed in major league records as having been born in Cabimas, Venezuela. Official Venezuelan baseball resources indicate that he was born on July 5, 1928. A good defensive player, Davalillo was drafted by the New York Yankees in 1953 and later transferred to the Washington Senators. At the age of 25, he made his major league debut with the Senators on August 1, 1953, becoming only the fourth Venezuelan to play in Major League Baseball after Alex Carrasquel (1939), Chucho Ramos (1944) and Chico Carrasquel (1950). He had a promising future, but his aversion to airplane travel, combined with a severe injury, curtailed his career in the major leagues. Davalillo played eleven seasons in minor league baseball, nine of them at Triple-A level, and posted a .270 average in 1,207 games. He also played in Mexico (1962‚Äì64) and spent fourteen seasons with the Leones del Caracas of the Venezuelan Winter League (1952‚Äì53 and 1965‚Äì66). He is the second-smallest player in major league baseball history. The shortest player on record is 43-inch Eddie Gaedel, who got one plate appearance (a walk) as a 1951 publicity stunt. Five players listed at 5-3 have graced the major leagues since 1900, according to Baseball Reference, with Pompeyo Davalillo, Jess Cortazzo, Bob Emmerich, Stubby Magner and Mike McCormack combining for 90 hits in 463 at-bats\\".http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2011/08/18/astros-altuve- stands-shorter-than-all-active-mlb-players/ Career statistics In a 19-game major league career, Davalillo had 17 hits in 58 at bats for a .293 career batting average along with 2 runs batted in, 1 stolen base and scored 10 runs. He had a .305 on-base percentage along with a .935 fielding percentage. In 469 Venezuelan Winter League games, he was a .276 hitter with three home runs and 130 RBI, including 246 runs, 58 doubles, 19 triples and 67 stolen bases. Coaching career and honors After his playing career had ended, Davalillo became a coach and a manager in the Venezuelan league. Davalillo was inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in 2006. His younger brother Vic Davalillo, also played in Major League Baseball.

To this the Latin text of 1 John 4,13 is added: Per hoc cognoscimus quod in Deo manemus, et Deus manet in nobis, quod de Spiritu suo dedit nobis.

Adnotatio 14. \\"That some people think that Jacob had travelled 8 or 10 years between Mesopotamia and Bethel, is redolent of stupidity, Ezra forgive me...\\". de Spinoza. Theologisch- politiek traktaat, Amsterdam: Wereldbibliotheek, 1997. Translation in Dutch by F. Akkerman (1997), p. 446. Written by the Dutch philosopher Benedictus Spinoza, the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (TTP) or Theologico-Political Treatise was one of the most controversial texts of the early modern period. In it, Spinoza expounds his views on contemporary Jewish and Christian religion and critically analyses the Bible which underlies both. He argues what the best roles for state and religion should be and concludes that a degree of democracy and freedom of speech and religion works best, like in Amsterdam, while the state remains paramount within reason. The goal of the state is to guarantee the freedom of the citizens. Religious leaders should not meddle in politics. Spinoza prepares the ground for his work on metaphysics and psychology Ethics, published posthumously in 1677, for which he anticipated harsh criticism. Historical context Publication history The treatise was published anonymously in 1670 by Jan Rieuwertsz in Amsterdam. In order to protect the author and publisher from political retribution, the title page identified the city of publication as Hamburg and the publisher as Henricus K√ºnraht. It was written in New Latin rather than the vernacular Dutch in an attempt to avoid censorship by the secular Dutch authorities.  Treatment of religion  In the treatise, Spinoza put forth his most systematic critique of Judaism, and all organized religion in general. Spinoza argued that theology and philosophy must be kept separate, particularly in the reading of scripture. Whereas the goal of theology is obedience, philosophy aims at understanding rational truth. Scripture does not teach philosophy and thus cannot be made to conform with it, otherwise the meaning of scripture will be distorted. Conversely, if reason is made subservient to scripture, then, Spinoza argues, \\"the prejudices of a common people of long ago... will gain a hold on his understanding and darken it.\\" Spinoza argued that purportedly supernatural occurrences, namely prophecy and miracles, have in fact natural explanations. He argued that God acts solely by the laws of his own nature and rejected the view that God acts for a particular purpose or telos. For Spinoza, those who believe that God acts for some end are delusional and projecting their hopes and fears onto the workings of nature.  Scriptural interpretation  Spinoza was not only the real father of modern metaphysics and moral and political philosophy, but also of the so-called higher criticism of the Bible. He was particularly attuned to the idea of interpretation; he felt that all organized religion was simply the institutionalized defense of particular interpretations. He rejected in its entirety the view that Moses composed the first five books of the Bible, called the Pentateuch by Christians or Torah by Jews. He provided an analysis of the structure of the Bible which demonstrated that it was essentially a compiled text with many different authors and diverse origins; in his view, it was not \\"revealed\\" all at once. His Tractatus Theologico-Politicus undertook to show that Scriptures properly understood gave no authority for the militant intolerance of the clergy who sought to stifle all dissent by the use of force. To achieve his object, Spinoza had to show what is meant by a proper understanding of the Bible, which gave him occasion to apply criticism to the Bible. To appreciate his services in this connection it must be remembered that his age was remarkably lacking in historical sense, especially in matters relating to religion. Saintly contemporaries like John Bunyan and Manasseh ben Israel made the most fantastic use of Scripture texts; while militant clerics, relying on the ignorant bibliolatry of the masses, misapplied Bible texts to gain their ends. Spinoza, who permitted no supernatural rival to Nature and no rival authority to the civil government of the state, rejected also all claims that Biblical literature should be treated in a manner entirely different from that in which any other document is treated that claims to be historical. His contention that the Bible \\"is in parts imperfect, corrupt, erroneous, and inconsistent with itself, and that we possess but fragments of it\\"Theologico- Political Treatise, Ch. 12; cf. also Theologico-Political Treatise, Project Gutenberg eText. roused great storm at the time, and was mainly responsible for his evil repute for a century at least.For this section cf. espec. ‚Äî see also A. Wolf's, \\"Spinoza, the Man and His Thought\\", 1933; Antonio Damasio, Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, William Heinemann, 2003, esp. ch. 6, 224‚Äì261; Richard McKeon, The Philosophy of Spinoza: The Unity of His Thought, Ox Bow Pr., 1928; Ray Monk & Frederic Raphael, The Great Philosophers. Phoenix, 2000, s.v. \\"Spinoza\\", pp. 135‚Äì174. Nevertheless, many have gradually adopted his views, agreeing with him that the real \\"word of God\\", or true religion, is not something written in books but \\"inscribed on the heart and mind of man\\".Cf. The correspondence of Spinoza, G. Allen & Unwin ltd., 1928, p. 289. See also John Laird, Journal of Philosophical Studies, Vol. 3, No. 12 (Oct., 1928), pp. 544‚Äì545. Many scholars and ministers of religion now praise Spinoza's services in the correct interpretation of Scripture as a document of first rate importance in the progressive development of human thought and conduct.  Treatment of Judaism  The treatise also rejected the Jewish notion of \\"chosenness\\"; to Spinoza, all peoples are on par with each other, as God has not elevated one over the other. Spinoza also offered a sociological explanation as to how the Jewish people had managed to survive for so long, despite facing relentless persecution. In his view, the Jews had been preserved due to a combination of Gentile hatred and Jewish separatism. He also gave one final, crucial reason for the continued Jewish presence, which in his view, was by itself sufficient to maintain the survival of the nation forever: circumcision. It was the ultimate anthropological expression of bodily marking, a tangible symbol of separateness which was the ultimate identifier. Spinoza also posited a novel view of the Torah; he claimed that it was essentially a political constitution of the ancient state of Israel. In his view, because the state no longer existed, its constitution could no longer be valid. He argued that the Torah was thus suited to a particular time and place; because times and circumstances had changed, the Torah could no longer be regarded as a valid document.  Spinoza's political theory  Spinoza agreed with Thomas Hobbes that if each man had to fend for himself, with nothing but his own right arm to rely upon, then the life of man would be \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\".Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, Chapter XIII: \\"Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as Concerning Their Felicity and Misery The truly human\\" The truly human life is only possible in an organised community, that is, a state or commonwealth. The state ensures security of life, limb and property; it brings within reach of every individual many necessaries of life which he could not produce by himself; and it sets free sufficient time and energy for the higher development of human powers. Now the existence of a state depends upon a kind of implicit agreement on the part of its members or citizens to obey the sovereign authority which governs it. In a state no one can be allowed to do just as he pleases. Every citizen is obliged to obey its laws; and he is not free even to interpret the laws in a special manner. This looks at first like a loss of freedom on the part of the individuals, and the establishment of an absolute power over them. Yet that is not really so. In the first place, without the advantages of an organised state the average individual would be so subject to dangers and hardships of all kinds and to his own passions that he could not be called free in any real sense of the term, least of all in the sense that Spinoza used it. Man needs the state not only to save him from others but also from his own lower impulses and to enable him to live a life of reason, which alone is truly human. In the second place, state sovereignty is never really absolute. It is true that almost any kind of government is better than none, so that it is worth while bearing much that is irksome rather than disturb the peace. But a reasonably wise government will even in its own interest endeavour to secure the good will and cooperation of its citizens by refraining from unreasonable measures, and will permit or even encourage its citizens to advocate reforms, provided they employ peaceable means. In this way the state really rests, in the last resort, on the united will of the citizens, on what Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who read Spinoza, subsequently called the \\"general will\\". Spinoza sometimes writes as if the state upheld absolute sovereignty. But that is due mainly to his determined opposition to every kind of ecclesiastical control over it. Though he is prepared to support what may be called a state religion, as a kind of spiritual cement, yet his account of this religion is such as to make it acceptable to the adherents of any one of the historic creeds, to deists, pantheists and all others, provided they are not fanatical believers or unbelievers. It is really in the interest of freedom of thought and speech that Spinoza would entrust the civil government with something approaching absolute sovereignty in order to effectively resist the tyranny of the militant churches. =Human power consists in strength of mind and intellect= One of the most striking features in Spinoza's political theory is his basic principle that \\"right is might.\\" This principle he applied systematically to the whole problem of government, and seemed rather pleased with his achievement, inasmuch as it enabled him to treat political theory in a scientific spirit, as if he were dealing with applied mathematics. The identification or correlation of right with power has caused much misunderstanding. People supposed that Spinoza reduced justice to brute force. But Spinoza was very far from approving Realpolitik. In the philosophy of Spinoza the term \\"power\\" (as should be clear from his moral philosophy) means a great deal more than physical force. In a passage near the end of his Political Treatise he states explicitly that \\"human power chiefly consists in strength of mind and intellect\\" ‚Äî it consists in fact, of all the human capacities and aptitudes, especially the highest of them. Conceived correctly, Spinoza's whole philosophy leaves ample scope for ideal motives in the life of the individual and of the community.Cf. Theologico-Political Treatise, Ch. 20. =Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy= Spinoza discusses the principal kinds of states, or the main types of government, namely, Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy. Each has its own peculiarities and needs special safeguards, if it is to realise the primary function of a state. Monarchy may degenerate into Tyranny unless it is subjected to various constitutional checks which will prevent any attempt at autocracy. Similarly, Aristocracy may degenerate into Oligarchy and needs analogous checks. On the whole, Spinoza favours Democracy, by which he meant any kind of representative government. In the case of Democracy the community and the government are more nearly identical than in the case of Monarchy or Aristocracy; consequently a democracy is least likely to experience frequent collisions between the people and the government and so is best adapted to secure and maintain that peace, which it is the business of the state to secure.  Reception and influence  It is unlikely that Spinoza's Tractatus ever had political support of any kind, with attempts being made to suppress it even before Dutch magistrate Johan de Witt's murder in 1672. In 1673, it was publicly condemned by the Synod of Dordrecht (1673) and banned officially the following year. Harsh criticism of the TTP began to appear almost as soon as it was published. One of the first, and most notorious, critiques was by Leipzig professor Jakob Thomasius in 1670.Steven Nadler, A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age. Princeton UP, 2011, p231.Naturalism and its political dangers: Jakob Thomasius against Spinoza's Theological- Political Treatise. A study and the translation of Thomasius‚Äô text The British philosopher G. E. Moore suggested to Ludwig Wittgenstein that he title one of his works \\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\\" as a homage to Spinoza's treatise.Nils-Eric Sahlin, The Philosophy of F. P.

It is located in Buriram Province in the Isan region of Thailand, and was built at a time when Khmer social-political influences were significant in Srisaket. It was built of sandstone and laterite between the 10th and 13th centuries. It was a Hindu shrine dedicated to Shiva, and symbolises Mount Kailash, his heavenly dwelling. Thailand's Department of Fine Arts spent 17 years restoring the complex to its original state from 1971 to 1988. On 21 May 1988, the park was officially opened by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.\\"Phnom Rung Historical Park\\". Retrieved 9 Jul 2006. Printed by Joseph Plastic Crad (Korat) and Print Co. Ltd. In 2005, the temple was submitted to UNESCO for consideration as a future World Heritage Site. Architecture After the three-leveled lower stairway is the first cruciform platform, giving a first peek at the main temple. On the right, northward, is Phlab Phla or the White Elephant House. The pavilion is believed to be the place where kings and the royal family would change attire before rituals. Royalty would then enter the processional walkway, one of the most impressive elements of the park. It is 160 meters long and bordered by seventy sandstone posts with tops of lotus buds. The walkway itself is paved with laterite blocks. The walkway leads to the first of three naga bridges. The five-headed snakes face all four directions and are from the 12th century. This bridge represents the connection between heaven and earth. The naga bridge leads to the upper stairway, which is divided into five sets. Each set has terraces on the sides. The last terrace is wide, made with laterite blocks. It has a cruciform shape and four small pools. A couple more steps lead to the second naga bridge. It has the same shape as the first one, only smaller. In the middle the remains of an eight petalled lotus carving can be seen. This final terrace leads to the outer gallery. It probably used to be a wooden gallery with a tiled roof, but only a raised floor of laterite remains. After the outer gallery one reaches the inner gallery, which is divided in long and narrow rooms. It served as a wall around the principal tower. This last gallery leads to the third and last naga bridge, another small copy of the first one. The bridge leads directly into the main sanctuary. After the antechamber and the annex, one reaches the principal tower. Double porches lead out in all directions. The inner sanctum used to have the \\"linga\\", the divine symbol of Shiva. Currently, only the \\"somasutra\\" remains which was used to drain water during religious rites. The entrances have various lintels and icons depicting Hindu religious stories, e.g., the dancing Shiva and the five yogis. The south entrance is guarded by a sandstone statue. Apart from the main tower, other buildings in the compound are: * Two brick sanctuaries built around the 10th century, northeast of the tower. * The minor sanctuary southwest of the tower with a sandstone altar for a sacred image. It was built with sandstone in the 11th century. Prang Noi has only one entrance facing east. The sanctuary is square with indented corners, giving it a round feel. * Two Bannalai southeast and northeast of the principal tower. The buildings are rectangular and have only one entrance. They were built in the last period, around the 13th century, and used as a library for holy scriptures. Phanom Rung temple Layout of Phanom Rung temple Phanom Rung castle pathway Phra Narai Lintel The Phra Narai Lintel One of the most well-known elements of the temple is a decorative lintel placed above the eastern entrance to the central sanctuary. It depicts a reclining Vishnu or Vishnu Anantasayin, and is known in Thai as Thap Lang Narai Banthomsin (). The lintel is best known for its restitution from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1988. It had been stolen from the temple site in the 1960s and was acquired by the museum in 1967, where it was displayed for over twenty years, described as \\"the Birth of Brahma with Reclining Vishnu on a Makara\\". In early 1988, as restoration of the temple neared completion, calls were made by several parties in Thailand for its return. The issue became the subject of intense media attention, with some even accusing the US Government of facilitating the theft. The Thai government entered negotiations with the museum, which was unwilling to consider an unconditional return, since it had acquired the item in good faith. Finally, in October, the museum agreed to repatriate the lintel in exchange for a donation from the Chicago-based Elizabeth F. Cheney Foundation. The lintel's arrival in Thailand on 10 November was widely celebrated, and was covered live on the national TV pool. It was restored to its original position on 7 December, marking the completion of the temple's restoration.

It became the capital city of Osun State in 1991. Osogbo city seats the Headquarters of both Osogbo Local Government Area (situated at Oke Baale Area of the city) and Olorunda Local Government Area (situated at Igbonna Area of the city). It is some 88 kilometers by road northeast of Ibadan. It is also by road south of Ilorin and northwest of Akure. Osogbo shares boundaries with Ikirun, Ilesa, Ede, Egbedore, Ogbomosho and Iragbiji and is easily accessible from any part of the state because of its central nature. It is about 48 km from Ife, 32 km from Ilesa, 46 km from Iwo, 48 km from Ikire and 46 km from Ila-Orangun; The city had a population of about 499,999 people and an approximate land area of 2875 km2 the postal code of the area is 230. Infrastructure and demographics Osogbo lies on the railway line from Lagos to Kano. It is known for the Osogbo School of Art and the Oja Oba Market building, said to be the former Oba's palace, within yards of the Osogbo Grand Mosque. Osogbo is the trade center for a farming region. Yams, cassava, grain, and tobacco are grown. Cotton is grown and used to weave cloth. It is also home to several hotels and a football stadium with a capacity of 10,000 and a second division professional league team. Most of the population are members of the Yoruba ethnic group. In 1988, about 27% of the population were engaged in farming as their primary occupation, 8% were traders and about 30% clerks and teachers.  Culture  Osogbo city Osogbo, sometimes called \\"Ile Aro\\" (home of dyeing), is a major dyeing center. The traditional industry is one of the major industries of Osogbo and the different types of Adire in Osogbo includes Raffia Resist-Adire Oniko, Stitch Resist-Adire Alabere, Starch Resist-Adire Eleko, Wax Batik-Adire Alabele. A number of industries also began to rise after independence, notably small scale establishments involved in textile, foam making, and pencils. Osogbo was made a major industrial development center by the government of Nigeria during the 1970s. Osogbo is also the childhood home of the actor and dramatist Duro Ladipo and the Muslim scholar Sheikh Adelabu. Osogbo is the venue of the annual Osun-Osogbo festival along the River Osun. The festival is centered on the sacred grove of the river goddess ·ªåsun,Joseph M. Murphy; Mei Mei Sanford. Reviewed Work(s): Osun across the Waters: A Yoruba Goddess in Africa and the Americas.

Climate  History  According to tradition, In Ipole Omu, seven rulers reigned before Olarooye in the following succession: Adefokanbale, Aikanya, Ogbogba, Saso, Luberin, Laege (also known as Adetuturinrin; father to both Lajomo and Larooye), Lajomo and Olarooye. During the reign of Oba Olarooye at Ipole, life became very unbearable because of incessant dry seasons. The then Ipole people became much dejected, worried and uncomfortable over their losses involving their farms, domestic animals and human beings. The Oba Olarooye was worried and disheartened by the situation at Ipole Omu. He wanted emergency solutions to inevitable and uncountable losses. This was the time he ordered the chief hunter at Ipole-in the person of Timehin-and his co-hunters to go on expedition and look for greener pastures. Timehin and the other hunters courageously took up the challenge and moved out in search of a better place for settlement. The expedition discovered River Osun. Yoruba tradition claims many people fleeing the Fulani Invasion settled at Osogbo following the fall of old Oyo. As a result, Osogbo increased in population largely due to migration from other Yoruba towns.Tunde Agbola. Osogbo: Cities, Volume 9, Issue 4, November 1992. For want of a more open place than a grove and a more central location, Olarooye and his people abandoned their settlement, including the already flourishing market and moved to Ode-Osogbo. At Ode- Osogbo, Olarooye built his new palace at the present-day Idi-Osun while Timehin built the Ogun shrine now known as Idi-Ogun. Since then, Osogbo has maintained its function as an economic center.

It was first published in 1977 by astronomers R. Brent Tully and J. Richard Fisher. The luminosity is calculated by multiplying the galaxy's apparent brightness by 4\\\\pi d^2, where d is its distance from us, and the spectral-line width is measured using long-slit spectroscopy. Several different forms of the TFR exist, depending on which precise measures of mass, luminosity or rotation velocity one takes it to relate. Tully and Fisher used optical luminosity, but subsequent work showed the relation to be tighter when defined using microwave to infrared (K band) radiation (a good proxy for stellar mass), and even tighter when luminosity is replaced by the galaxy's total baryonic mass (the sum of its mass in stars and gas). This latter form of the relation is known as the Baryonic Tully‚ÄìFisher relation (BTFR), and states that baryonic mass is proportional to velocity to the power of roughly 3.5‚Äì4.S. Torres-Flores, B. Epinat, P. Amram, H. Plana, C. Mendes de Oliveira (2011), \\"GHASP: an HŒ± kinematic survey of spiral and irregular galaxies -- IX. The NIR, stellar and baryonic Tully‚ÄìFisher relations\\", The TFR can be used to estimate the distance to spiral galaxies by allowing the luminosity of a galaxy to be derived from its directly measurable line width. The distance can then be found by comparing the luminosity to the apparent brightness. Thus the TFR constitutes a rung of the cosmic distance ladder, where it is calibrated using more direct distance measurement techniques and used in turn to calibrate methods extending to larger distance. In the dark matter paradigm, a galaxy's rotation velocity (and hence line width) is primarily determined by the mass of the dark matter halo in which it lives, making the TFR a manifestation of the connection between visible and dark matter mass. In Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), the BTFR (with power-law index exactly 4) is a direct consequence of the gravitational force law effective at low acceleration. The analogues of the TFR for non-rotationally-supported galaxies, such as ellipticals, are known as the Faber‚ÄìJackson relation and the fundamental plane.

It is located in southeastern Nigeria. The city had a population of 722,664 according to the 2006 Nigerian census. The name Enugu is derived from the two Igbo words √ân√∫ ·ª§ÃÅgw·ª•ÃÅ meaning \\"hill top\\" denoting the city's hilly geography. The city was named after Enugwu Ngwuo, under which coal was found. Enugwu Ngwuo is one of the ten villages that made up the Ngwuo clan, often referred to as the children of Ngwuako, the ancestral founder of the clan. Ngwuako positioned Udeneogu, his warrior son of on top of the hill (Enu-Ugwu) to protect the clan from invaders. Enugwu Ama Udeneogu, (Enugwu, the land of Udeneogu) The people lived on the hilltop and farmed the sprawling surrounding valleys. Ngwuo has borders with Oshie clan in the south, Ojebeogene clan in the north and Nkanu clan in the east. The discovery of coal deposits on Enugwu Ngwuo farm lands down the valley, attracted people from all and sundry to the newly discovered wealth, in search for means of living, and as depicted in the map of the original plan for a government station, titled Enugwu Ngwo government station, this marked the core of the first urban settlement of what is today known as Enugu, started on Ngwuo land and it was called Enugwu Ngwuo until when it attained township status, the word Ngwo was removed for the convenience of pronunciation, thus a village of Ngwuo clan gave birth to a city which today has grown into a mega city, and still growing, engulfing the surrounding Nkanu towns of Nike and Akunino and stretching towards Neke and Emene. Since the 17th century the location of present-day Enugu has been inhabited by the Nike ( ) subgroup of the Igbo people; one of Enugu's neighbourhoods still retains the village's old name Ogui. In 1900 the Southern Nigeria Protectorate was established by the colonial administration of the British Empire. The discovery of coal by the colonialists led to the building of the Eastern Line railway to carry coal from the inland city to the port of Port Harcourt, a city created for this purpose located south of what was called Enugu Coal Camp. Enugu was then renamed simply Enugu and developed as one of the few cities in West Africa created from European contact. By 1958 Enugu had over 8,000 coal miners. there are no significant coal mining activities left in the city. Enugu became the capital of the Eastern Region after Nigeria's independence in 1960; a succession of territorial adjustments in 1967, 1976 and 1991 led to Enugu becoming the capital of what is now Enugu State. On 30 May 1967 Enugu was declared the capital of the short-lived Republic of Biafra; for this Enugu is known as the \\"capital of Igboland.\\" After Enugu was captured by the Nigerian armed forces, the Biafran capital was moved to Umuahia. Industries in the city include the urban market and bottling industries. Enugu is also one of the filming locations for directors of the Nigerian movie industry, dubbed \\"Nollywood\\". Enugu's main airport is the Akanu Ibiam International Airport. History =Early history= The first settlement in the Enugu area was the small Nike village of Ogui, which was present since the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade.Udo, p. 88. Nike in the Igbo language means \\"with strength or power.\\"Williams, p. 196. It was through slave raiding that the Nike people acquired most of their lands, which were mostly unsettled. The Nike used slaves for a defence strategy, placing slave camps at the edge of their territories so that it was harder for an enemy to access the free born.Udo, p. 92. The Nike people were allied to the Aro people who formed the Aro Confederacy (1690‚Äî1901) which was an Igbo organisation that controlled slave trading in the Enugu area. Along with the Aro people who came to trade from Arochukwu in the south were the Hausa people who came to trade from the north. The Hausa traders provided horses to the Nike which were used for rituals by the Igbo. Both the Aro and Hausa migrated back and forth to what is now the city of Enugu and were considered foreigners to the area. =Industrialisation= The Iva Valley coal mine A British campaign to invade Arochukwu and open up the hinterland for British military and political rule was carried out in 1901. A war between the British and Aro officially started on 1 December 1901 lasting till 24 March 1902 when the Aro were defeated. The Aro Confederacy ended and the rest of Aro dominated areas was added to The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, declared in 1900. Europeans first arrived in the Enugu area in 1903 when the British/Australian geologist Albert Ernest Kitson led an exploration of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate to search for especially valued mineral resources under the supervision of the Imperial Institute, London. By 1909 coal was found under the village of Enugwu Ngwo in the Udi and Okoga areas and by 1913 the coal was confirmed to be in quantities that would be viable commercially. By 1914 the colonial government had already merged the Northern and Southern Nigeria Protectorate to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. In 1915 the British began talks with the indigenous people of the land that would become Enugu about its acquisition in order to lay the Eastern Line railway and to build a colliery. The first houses built in the area were in a temporary settlement consisting of Igbo traditional mud housing inhabited by a W. J. Leck and some other Europeans on Hill-top, the only plain on the escarpment rolling before the jungled Milliken Hill. Antiques of the old residence of the colonialists called the \\" Europeans quarters\\" still abound on the Hill-top, an outskirt of Enugwu-Ngwo town. Another settlement known as Ugwu Alfred (Igbo: Alfred's Hill) or \\"Alfred's Camp\\", inhabited by an Alfred Inoma (a leader of indigenous labourers from Onitsha) and his labourers, was located on a hillside. After the land acquisition by the British, Frederick Lugard, the Governor-General of Nigeria at the time, named the colliery built at the bottom of the Udi Hills Enugu Coal Camp to distinguish it from Enugwu Ngwo which overlooks the city from atop a scarp on Enugu's west. The first coal mine in the Enugu area was the Udi mine opened in 1915 which was shut down two years later and replaced with the Iva Valley mine.Udo, pp. 196‚Äì197.Sklar, pp. 207‚Äì210. Enugu became a major coal mining area and the only significant one in West Africa. The Eastern Line railway connecting Enugu with Port Harcourt was completed in 1916 in order to export the coal through its seaport of which the city was created for this purpose.Williams, p. 200. Enugu became one of the few cities in West Africa created out of contact with Europeans. By 1916 parts of Enugu reserved for Europeans were set up by the colonial government. The area now known as the Government Reserved Area (GRA) became the European Quarters located north of the Ogbete River; alongside this was a section developed for African residents located south of the river. The built-up area of Enugu comprised these two areas, and by 1917 the city officially gained township status. On the African side of the city a rapid influx of migrant workers sparked the development of squatter camps on the Udi Hills near the coal mines and the Iva Valley. In 1938 Enugu became the administrative capital of the Eastern Region. The number of employed coal miners in Enugu grew from 6,000 (of mostly Udi men) in 1948 to 8,000 in 1958. Enugu's population rose sharply with its industrialisation; the population of the city reached 62,000 in 1952. Mining in Enugu was sometimes turbulent, as demonstrated by the events of 18 November 1949 when 21 striking miners were shot and killed and 51 wounded by police under British governance. The massacre that came to be known as \\"The Iva Valley Shooting\\" fuelled nationalist or \\"Zikist\\" sentiments among most Nigerians, and especially amongst Eastern Nigerians.Coleman, pp. 296‚Äî302. \\"Zikisim\\" was a post World War II movement that was created out of admiration for Nnamdi Azikiwe who was a prominent nationalist of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC). The shooting was right after a period of unrest when miners were angered by the belief that their full pay was being held back by the colliery management, a belief that was pushed by the nationalist press. Many of the Zikists tried to use the Iva Valley shooting to fuel their nationalistic agenda and push the British imperial administration, out of Nigeria. =Independence, war, and after= Enugu became a municipality in 1956 with Umaru Altine its first mayor. After four years passed, Nigeria gained its independence in 1960. On 27 May 1967 the Nigerian government divided the Western, Northern and Eastern Region into 12 states and Enugu was made the capital of the new East Central State. On 30 May 1967 Enugu was declared the capital of the short-lived Republic of Biafra, the latter created out of the eastern Nigerian states of East Central, Cross River and Rivers. Biafra was declared by Ojukwu because of Eastern Nigeria after their members were attacked injured and killed in a series of ethnic attacks launched by some other ethnic groups in other parts of the country following the first military coup executed by mostly Igbo generals, in which top northern Nigerian leaders among others were terminated. The main rivals of the mostly Igbo Eastern Nigerians were the Hausa/Fulani people of Northern Nigeria. A northern headed war on the secession (1967‚Äî1970) and continuous attacks on the Igbos in other part of Nigeria lead Igbos from northern and western Nigeria to return to their \\"native\\" areas in eastern Nigeria and Enugu became a destination. Radio Biafra, alternatively the Voice of Biafra (formerly the Eastern Nigerian Broadcasting Service), was based in Enugu; it was from here that the Biafran leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, broadcast speeches and propaganda to Biafrans and Nigeria. Because of the war, Enugu witnessed a decrease in the number of non-Igbo, specifically non-eastern Nigerian residents. On 4 October 1967 the Nigerian military bombarded Enugu with artillery just outside its boundaries before capturing it a week later, shortly after this Umuahia became the new capital of the republic. Years after the Republic of Biafra reverted to Nigeria, Enugu is still regarded as the \\"Capital of Igboland.\\" Enugu resumed in 1970 as the capital of the East Central State after the republic was dissolved. On 3 February 1976 the East Central State was made into two new states, Imo and Anambra; there were then 19 states in Nigeria; Enugu was the capital of Anambra. On 27 August 1991 the military dictatorship of Ibrahim Babangida divided the old Anambra State into two new states, Enugu State and Anambra State. Enugu remained as the capital of the newly created Enugu State, while Awka became the capital of the new Anambra State. Geography =Topography= Satellite image of Enugu and other communities neighbouring it. The Enugu escarpment can be seen on the left where it has a lighter colour; the Nyaba River can be seen on the bottom. Despite its name meaning hill top in the Igbo language, Enugu lies at the foot of an escarpment and not a hill. Enugu is located in the Cross River basinUdo, p. 89. and the Benue trough and has the best developed coal in this area. Precambrian basement rock in this region is overlaid with sediments bearing coal from the Cretaceous and Tertiary age. Coal seams in the Enugu coal district measure between in thickness and the reserves have been estimated to be more than 300 million tonnes. Enugu's hills at the extreme may reach an elevation of . Highlands surrounding Enugu for the most part are underlain by sandstone, while lowlands are underlain by shale. Much of the escarpment stretching from Enugu to Orlu has been ravaged by soil and gully erosion. Other geological features in Enugu include the Nike Lake near which the Nike Lake Hotel has been built. The Ekulu, Asata, Ogbete, Aria, Idaw and Nyaba rivers are the six largest rivers located in the city. The Ekulu River is the largest body of water in Enugu urban and its reservoir contributes to part of the city's domestic water supply. =Climate= Enugu is located in a tropical rain forest zone with a derived savannah. The city has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen: Aw). Enugu's climate is humid and this humidity is at its highest between March and November. For the whole of Enugu State the mean daily temperature is . As in the rest of West Africa, the rainy season and dry season are the only weather periods that recur in Enugu. The average annual rainfall in Enugu is around , which arrives intermittently and becomes very heavy during the rainy season. Other weather conditions affecting the city include Harmattan, a dusty trade wind lasting a few weeks of December and January.Udo, p. 67. Like the rest of Nigeria, Enugu is hot all year round. =Cityscape and architecture= The tallest building in Enugu's Central Business District (CBD) is the African Continental Bank (ACB) tower with six stories. The tower was built in the late 50s for the African Continental Bank Limited which was founded by Nnamdi Azikiwe who became the first president of Nigeria after the country's independence from the United Kingdom in October 1960.Sklar, p. 165. The opening of the building took place on 30 April 1959. Other tall buildings include the Hotel Presidential opened in August 1963. The seven story building contains 100 rooms and is located in the Independence Layout. Hotel Presidential cost $2.5 million to build and was commissioned by the government of what was then the Eastern Region to serve visiting businessmen, officials and tourists. In the middle of Enugu is the Michael Okpara Square, dedicated to the premier of the former Eastern Region Michael Okpara. Beside the square is located the Enugu State Government House, Enugu State House of Assembly and Enugu State Judiciary Complex. Enugu's coal mines are dotted around on the outskirts of the city, a majority of which are closed. The Colliery Camp mines are located in the Iva Valley which is near the neighbouring town of Ngwo and Hilltop of Enugu. The Iva Valley coal mine is accessed through the Iva Valley road linking Enugu with Ngwo. Other coal mines are located in the Ogbete and Coal Camp layouts; these mines are located on the periphery of the city near the Iva Valley as well. Architectural design in Enugu's early years was in the hands of the British colonial administration; Enugu's architecture was consequently very European. English cottage housing and Victorian houses were used for housing Europeans and Nigerian colonial civil servants in the early 20th century until Europeans started trying to adapt their architecture to the tropical climate. Some other examples of these European styles are visible in churches of the colonial era, such as the Holy Ghost Cathedral with its Greco- Roman stained glass windows depicting Europeans. Enugu's roads were reflective of its British rule; much of the city's narrow roads in the GRA have been preserved dating back to the incorporation of the city itself. Low rent one bedroom flats in Enugu and other Nigerian cities are known as \\"face-me-I-face- you\\" for the way a group of flats face each other and form a square where a compound entrance is led into. Government Enugu city covers three local government areas: Enugu East, Enugu North and Enugu South. A Local Government Council exists for each of these seats that manages sectors including primary education and health; an elected Executive Chairman and a group of elected Councillors form the Local Government Council that heads each Local Government Area. Enugu South is split between its rural and urban parts when electing an Executive Chairman. The Executive Chairmen include Paul Ogbe for Enugu South Urban, Theresa Egbo for Enugu South Rural, Emma Onoh for Enugu North, and Christopher Ugwu for Enugu East; these chairmen represent their LGA's in the Enugu State House of Assembly. The Ministry of Lands, Survey and Town Planning (at the state level) and the Local Planning Authority (at the local government level) are responsible for the administration of urban lands and town planning. Government House, Enugu is where the government of the state is based. On the federal level, the city of Enugu is split between two congressional areas; Enugu North/South represented by Chukwuegbo Ofor and Enugu East represented by Gilbert Nnaji; both representatives are in the People's Democratic Party (PDP) as is Ifeanyichukwu Ugwuanyi (GBURU-GBURU), the governor of Enugu State. Demographics According to the 2006 Nigerian census, the Enugu metropolitan area has an estimated population of 722,664. This estimate along with population estimates of other Nigerian cities have been disputed with accusations of population inflation and deflation in favour of the northern part of the country. The population of Enugu is predominantly Christian, as is the rest of southeastern Nigeria. Like the rest of Nigeria most people in Enugu speak Nigerian English alongside the dominant language in the region. In this case the dominant language is Igbo. Nigerian English, or pidgin (a mix of English and indigenous words) is often used because of ethnic diversity and sometimes because of the diversity of dialects in the Igbo language. In cultural and linguistic terms Enugu is within the Northern cluster of the Igbo region which includes other towns and cities like Awka and Nsukka. The indigenous people of Enugu include Enugwu-Ngwo people who live on the aged Hill-Top plain towards the Milliken Hills on the west, with their farm lands sprawling all over the valley, the Ogui Nike who live in the areas surrounding Hotel Presidential, Obiagu, Ama-Igbo, Ihewuzi and Onu-Asata. Other groups include the Awkunanaw people, who live mainly in the Achara Layout and Uwani areas. Other Nike people live around the Abakpa, Iji-Nike, and Emene areas of the city. Most of the non-indigenous people of Enugu are migrants from other parts of the Igbo cultural area. After the majority Igbo, the Yoruba people are another significant ethnic group found present in Enugu; other groups include the Hausa, Kanuri, Ijaw, and Fulani people. =Crime= Enugu's crime rate rose in 2009 as kidnapping and armed robbery rates increased in southeastern Nigeria specifically between September and December. The Enugu State government sought to check the high kidnapping rates by passing a bill in February 2009 that made kidnapping by the use of a weapon a capital offence; the bill was passed by the Enugu House of Assembly unanimously. 1,088 arrests were made in the city between September and December 2009; 270 of these were in September, 303 were in October, 295 in November and 220 were in December. 477 of these detainees were accused of committing capital offences which included kidnapping. The motives of kidnappers in Enugu are primarily financial and some ransoms went into the millions of Naira. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Enugu State, Dan Nwomeh, had his ransom set as high as ‚Ç¶500 million (3.3 million US Dollars ), dropping to ‚Ç¶200 million and then ‚Ç¶50 million before he was released without a ransom being paid because of the refusal of the government to negotiate with the kidnappers. Much of the crime in Enugu and the rest of Nigeria has been attributed to unemployment. Culture As a Northern Igbo city, Enugu shares cultural traits with its neighbouring towns. Two important Igbo traditional festivals take place in Enugu annually; the Mmanwu festival and the New yam festival. The Mmanwu festival takes place in November and features various types of masquerades that each have a name. This festival is held at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium as a parade of carnival-like masquerades that are accompanied by music and it is supported by the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture. The second important Igbo festival, the New yam festival known as 'iwa ji', is held between August and October marking the harvesting and feasting of the new yam. The yam is a root vegetable that is the staple crop and a cultural symbol for the Igbo people. Recently created festivals include the Enugu Festival of Arts which is managed by the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture. The festival highlights African culture and traditions and it is here that the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture included the Mmanwu parade as part of the events. The Enugu Festival of Arts was started in 1986; it has modernised the Mmanwu festival by transferring it from its traditional village surroundings to the urban setting of Enugu. Diana, Princess of Wales was a notable spectator of Enugu's cultural shows when she visited the city in 1990. visitors to the city can enjoy a wide variety of the cities native delicacies especially its Famous Okpa \\"Okpa Enugu\\", Abacha a local delicacy made from cassava \\"African salad\\" fiofio and host of other delicacies like Nkwobi, pepper soup. The tourism industry in Enugu, managed by the Enugu State Tourism Board (ESTB), is small; however, the state government recognises a variety of historic and recreational sites. These sites include places like the Udi Hills, from which the majority of Enugu city can be viewed.The Nike lake Resort in the outskirt of the city, the famous Iva Valley which served as residential quarters for European workers managing the Coal Mining activities. The Polo amusement park is a funfair that is among the first generation of public parks in the city; other parks in the city include the Murtala Muhammed Park.Hudgens, p. 1072. Enugu's former coal mines, Onyeama and Okpara, are open to public visits. Some other spots include: The Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Sculptural Garden and Art Gallery, the Eastern Region Parliamentary Building, the Old Government Lodge, and Enugu Golf course. Enugu Zoo is another attraction in the city. It is divided into the botanical garden and the zoological section. A National Museum is located near Enugu at its north, although it receives few visitors. It is managed by National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM). Other galleries include the Bona Gallery. Entertainment =Music= Flavour N'abania at the 2014 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards Enugu rose as an important centre for Highlife music in Nigeria in the 1950s. The Igbo dominated version of the genre grew out of earlier \\"Igbo blues\\" or \\"palm wine music\\" and further spread in popularity to the Southern Cameroons where Enugu had considerable influence in arts and culture in towns such as Limbe, Tiko and Douala. Some prominent musicians with origins in Enugu include Sonny Okosun, an afrobeat musician who was born and raised in Enugu and joined his first band The Postmen that was based in the city in 1965; Celestine Ukwu joined Michael Ejeagha's Enugu based Paradise Rhythm Orchestra in 1962 before creating his own band and had a recreational club in the city after the Nigeria Civil War; other musicians include 2Face Idibia; a Hip hop/R&B; musician who partly grew up and studied music in the city. Other notable musicians originating from Enugu include rapper Phyno, Slowdog, William Onyeabor, and highlife musician Flavour N'abania. =Media and literature= English-language newspapers published and sold in Enugu include the Daily Star, Evening Star, The Renaissance and New Renaissance. One of the earliest newspapers published in Enugu was the Eastern Sentinel published by Nnamdi Azikiwe's Zik Group in 1955, but failed in 1960. Among the city's television and radio stations are the Nigerian Television Authority's network affiliate (NTA Enugu) headquarters located at Independence Layout; and the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) network affiliate station (Radio Enugu) which broadcasts in English, Igbo, Efik, Ijaw and Tiv. Enugu State Broadcasting Service Television (ESBS-TV) is a state owned television broadcasting company which offers 18 hours of continuous broadcasting on weekends. Enugu, after Lagos is the preferred city for shooting films in Nigeria and a film production centre in the East. In 2007, Enugu hosted the first-ever film festival in the state, the Enugu International Film Festival. Held at Hotel Presidential, the festival's intent was to highlight Enugu as a \\"film making hub\\" in Africa including movie premiers and prizes for different film categories. Some of Nigeria's well-known writers were born and have lived in the city of Enugu. Chinua Achebe, writer of Things Fall Apart lived in Enugu in 1958, the year the book was published.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, pp. 67‚Äì68. He again moved to the city during the Nigerian Civil War after escaping Lagos with his family. It was at this time that he met and became friends with Nigerian poet Christopher Okigbo where they started the publishing house Citadel Press, among its titles How the Dog was Domesticated and How the Leopard Got His Claws.Ezenwa-Ohaeto, p. 125. Okigbo lived in Enugu during the early months of the Nigerian Civil War. His home in Hilltop contained many of his unpublished writings which were mostly destroyed by bombing early in the war. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, writer of Half of a Yellow Sun, a winner of the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2007, was born in Enugu in 1977 and grew up in Nsukka. =Sports= The Enugu Rangers, a first-division professional league association football team, is Enugu's home team that plays in the Nigerian Premier League and are based in the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium. Former Rangers players include Jay-Jay Okocha and Taribo West. Enugu's main sports centre is the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, named after Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first president of Nigeria. The stadium remained the centre of sports for the whole of the Eastern Region until the Nigerian Civil War broke out. At the war's end the stadium was refurbished. Enugu was a host for the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup games (24 October ‚Äì 15 November) alongside Calabar and five other Nigerian cities with matches taking place at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium. Its hosting of the FIFA U-17 World Cup benefited Enugu through the renovation of the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, having had such things as a new artificial surface laid.City's Top flight Football Team Enugu Rangers won the Nigerian Professional Football League in 2016. Economy Nicknamed the Coal City, Enugu's economy in the early 20th century depended on coal mining in the Udi plateau; this industry was the pushing force towards the city's growth. The Nigerian Coal Corporation has been based in Enugu since its creation in 1950 where it controlled coal mining.Udo, p. 86. With the creation of the Eastern Line, Enugu was connected with the sea via Port Harcourt to its south and later connected to the city of Kaduna to Enugu's north. The Nigerian Civil War brought widespread devastation that forced a decline in coal production from damage or destruction of equipment. coal mining is no longer the major source of income and mines lay unused. Other minerals mined in Enugu include iron ore, limestone, fine clay, marble, and silica sand.Nigeria, p. 39. In Enugu most goods are sold in open markets or by street hawkers; a significant number of street hawkers in Nigeria are children. , around 44 under-16-year-olds (equally boys and girls) hawk on every street on every hour in Enugu. There are three main urban markets in Enugu: Ogbete Market, Awkunanaw Market and New Market. New Market is a major market for the sale of garri. Ogbete market is patronised by merchants from all over the surrounding area, including merchants from cities like Onitsha, Aguleri, Abakaliki and Aba. In Ogebete market non-food goods are also sold. Brewing and soft-drink bottling are among other industries in the city; there is also a Mercedes assembly plantWilliams, p. 195. as well as the production and manufacturing of machinery, pottery, tiles, steel, cement, asbestos, petroleum, and pharmaceuticals. For a period of time Sosoliso Airlines had its head office on the grounds of Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu. The former Eastern Region was once famed for producing half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined largely because the plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled after the civil war and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food. Education Students at a seminar in Enugu Enugu has three main tertiary institutions: the Enugu State University of Science & Technology (ESUT); the University of Nigeria,Nsukka Campus (UNN)and Enugu Campus (UNEC); and the Institute of Management & Technology (IMT). Another notable tertiary institution in Enugu State is the Federal Cooperative College, Oji River (FCCO). Godfrey Okoye University, Caritas University, Renaissance University, Coal City university, Novena University, Esut Business School. The city is also home to Our Saviour Institute of Science and Technology, a polytechnic and Bigard Memorial Seminary. Some notable secondary schools in Enugu include the College of the Immaculate Conception (CIC) built in 1940, Holy Rosary College (HRC) built in 1943, Colliery Comprehensive Secondary school, Queen's Secondary School, Federal Government College, Royal Crown Academy, Nsukka and the University of Nigeria Secondary school. University Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu, under the university of Nigeria, is another university located in the city. Healthcare In Enugu, health care services can be obtained at several institutions including the ESUT (Enugu State University of Science and Technology) Teaching Hospital; University of Nigeria, Enugu, Teaching Hospital; Park Lane General Hospital in the GRA; PMC (Peenok Medical Center) located on Ziks Avenue in Uwani; Hansa Clinic on Awolowo Street in Uwani; Niger Foundation Hospital and Diagnostic Centre on Presidential Close in the Independence Layout; and the Ntasi Obi Ndi no n'Afufu Hospital organization located on Enuguabor Street in the Trans-Ekulu layout, among others. Some of the specialist hospitals in Enugu include the Psychiatric Hospital Enugu and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Enugu (NOHE). Many of the hospitals in Enugu are privately run. The UNTH and the National Orthopaedic Hospital are among some of the government controlled hospitals in the city. The medical equipment for the UNTH was upgraded in 2009 as well as parts of the hospital which were renovated in the same year. Most hospitals in the city suffer from a poor standard of medical facilities available to them; many of the city's citizens travel abroad for medical care. However, hospitals have been aided by foreign organisations and by Enugu's community at home and abroad who have donated medicine and other medical equipment. The most developed government hospital in Enugu is the Park Lane Hospital. The governor has said that the state has bought some ambulance service vehicles in March 2010. Enugu State has established free medical care for pregnant women and for all children under 5 years of age in the state. The child healthcare programme, founded under the District Health System (DHS), was added to the states 2008 budget. Enugu State has a HIV/AIDS prevalence of 6.5%, one of the highest in the country. Transport Enugu is located on the narrow-gauge Eastern Line railway linked to the city of Port Harcourt; the Enugu train station is by the side of the National Stadium; dating back to its coal-mining origins, it is located on Ogui Street. The main forms of transportation in the city are buses, taxi cabs and buses., Okada (motorcycles) once served as public transportation in the city until the state government banned them from this use in April 2009. Most transport enters and leaves the city through Enugu's Ogbete Motor Park, Garki Motor Park serves as a transport pick-up point as well. Unregistered taxis are known as Kabu Kabu and are differentiated with registered ones through the lack of yellow paint on the unregistered vehicles. In 2009, Enugu introduced a taxi job scheme under 'Coal City Cabs' to help in the eradication of poverty in the city. 200 registered Nissan Sunny taxis, provided by the state government; and 200 registered Suzuki taxis, provided by the Umuchinemere Pro- Credit Micro Finance Bank, were given out on loan to unemployed citizens in the city who will operate as taxi drivers and will own the vehicles after payments are completed. 20 buses with the capacity for 82 passengers seated and standing were introduced as Coal City Shuttle buses on 13 March 2009 to run as public transport for Enugu urban. The main airport in the state is the Akanu Ibiam International Airport which can be accessed by buses and taxis. Renovations began on 30 November 2009 to upgrade it to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft. These plans include extending the runway by to make it long; the runway will be widened from . It is estimated that the project will cost ‚Ç¶4.13bn (27.3 million US Dollars ). The A3, or the Enugu-Port Harcourt highway, was opened in the 1970s and links the two cities together by passing through Aba, a major urban settlement. The A3 goes further on past Enugu's north to link to the city of Jos via Makurdi.Nigeria, p. 187. Two more highways, the A232 from Benin City, Asaba and Onitsha to Enugu's eastHudgens, p. 1067. and the A343 from Abakaliki to Enugu's west, makes Enugu the site of a major junction.

The story concerns an idealistic young woman, Barbara Undershaft, who is engaged in helping the poor as a Major in the Salvation Army in London. For many years, Barbara and her siblings have been estranged from their father, Andrew Undershaft, who now reappears as a rich and successful munitions maker. Undershaft, the father, gives money to the Salvation Army, which offends Major Barbara, who does not want to be connected to his \\"tainted\\" wealth. However, the father argues that poverty is a worse problem than munitions, and claims that he is doing more to help society by giving his workers jobs and a steady income than Major Barbara is doing to help them by giving them bread and soup. The play script reprises several typical \\"Shavian\\" moves in lacking apostrophes on contractions and other punctuation, by having a didactic introductory essay explaining the play's themes, and by bending some rules of play scripting for literary purposes; for example, two characters are listed as \\"The Woman\\" and \\"The Man\\" before Shaw gives them names, for dramatic effect. As well, lines in dialect English are written phonetically (Bill Walker jeers, \\"Wot prawce selvytion nah?\\", \\"What price salvation now?\\"). Setting *London *Act I: Lady Britomart's house in Wilton Crescent *Act II: The Salvation Army shelter in West Ham *Act III: Lady Britomart's house, later at the Undershaft munitions works in Perivale St. Andrews Synopsis An officer of The Salvation Army, Major Barbara Undershaft, becomes disillusioned when her Christian denomination accepts money from an armaments manufacturer (her father) and a whisky distiller. She eventually decides that bringing a message of salvation to people who have plenty will be more fulfilling and genuine than converting the starving in return for bread. Although Barbara initially regards the Salvation Army's acceptance of Undershaft's money as hypocrisy, Shaw did not intend that it should be thought so by the audience. Shaw wrote a preface for the play's publication, in which he derided the idea that charities should only take money from \\"morally pure\\" sources, arguing that using money to benefit the poor will have more practical benefit than ethical niceties. He points out that donations can always be used for good whatever their provenance, and he quotes a Salvation Army officer, \\"they would take money from the devil himself and be only too glad to get it out of his hands and into God's.\\" Plot Lady Britomart Undershaft, the daughter of a British earl, and her son Stephen discuss a source of income for her grown daughters Sarah, who is engaged to Charles Lomax (a slightly comic figure who continually stupidly says \\"Oh, I say!\\"), and Barbara, who is engaged to Adolphus Cusins (a scholar of Greek literature). Lady Britomart leads Stephen to accept her decision that they must ask her estranged husband, Andrew Undershaft, for financial help. Mr. Undershaft is a successful and wealthy businessman who has made millions of pounds from his munitions factory, which manufactures the world-famous Undershaft guns, cannons, torpedoes, submarines and aerial battleships. When their children were still small, the Undershafts separated; now grown, the children have not seen their father since, and Lady Britomart has raised them by herself. During their reunion, Undershaft learns that Barbara is a major in The Salvation Army who works at their shelter in West Ham, east London. Barbara and Mr. Undershaft agree that he will visit Barbara's Army shelter, if she will then visit his munitions factory. A subplot involves the down-and-out and fractious visitors to the shelter, including a layabout painter and con artist (Snobby Price), a poor housewife feigning to be a fallen woman (Rummy Mitchens), an older laborer fired for his age (Peter Shirley), and a pugnacious bully (Bill Walker) who threatens the inhabitants and staff over his runaway partner, striking a frightened care worker (Jenny Hill). When he visits the shelter, Mr. Undershaft is impressed with Barbara's handling of these various troublesome people who seek social services from the Salvation Army: she treats them with patience, firmness, and sincerity. Undershaft and Cusins discuss the question of Barbara's commitment to The Salvation Army, and Undershaft decides he must overcome Barbara's moral horror of his occupation. He declares that he will therefore \\"buy\\" (off) the Salvation Army. He makes a sizeable donation, matching another donation from a whisky distiller. Barbara wants the Salvation Army to refuse the money because it comes from the armaments and alcohol industries, but her supervising officer eagerly accepts it. Barbara sadly leaves the shelter in disillusionment, while Cusins views Undershaft's actions both with disgust and sarcastic pleasure. According to tradition, the heir to the Undershaft fortune must be an orphan who can be groomed to run the factory. Lady Britomart tries to convince Undershaft to bequeath the business to his son Stephen, but neither male consents. Undershaft says that the best way to keep the factory in the family is to find a foundling and marry him to Barbara. Later, Barbara and the rest of her family accompany her father to his munitions factory. They are all impressed by its size and organisation. Cusins declares that he is a foundling, and is thus eligible to inherit the business. Undershaft eventually overcomes Cusins' moral scruples about the nature of the business, arguing that paying his employees provides a much higher service to them than Barbara's Army service, which only prolongs their poverty; as an example, the firm has hired Peter. Cusins' gradual acceptance of Undershaft's logic makes Barbara more content to marry him, not less, because bringing a message of salvation to the factory workers, rather than to London slum-dwellers, will bring her more fulfilment. Production history Louis Calvert as Andrew Undershaft and Harley Granville-Barker as Adolphus Cusins in Major Barbara (1905) The play was first produced at the Court Theatre in London in 1905 by J.E. Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker. Barker also played Cusins, alongside Louis Calvert, Clare Greet, Edmund Gwenn, Oswald Yorke and Annie Russell. The Broadway premiere in the USA was at the Playhouse Theatre on 9 December 1915. A film adaptation of 1941 was produced by Gabriel Pascal, and starred Wendy Hiller, Rex Harrison and Robert Morley. A Broadway production in 1956 with Charles Laughton and Burgess Meredith is noted in the discussion following Laughton's guest appearance on What's My Line on 25 November 1956. Meredith was on the panel. Caedmon Records released a 4-LP recording of the play in 1965 (TRS 319 S) directed by Howard Sackler with Warren Mitchell as Bill Walker, Maggie Smith as Barbara, Alec McCowen as Cusins, Celia Johnson as Lady Britomart, and Robert Morley as Undershaft. Background Lady Britomart Undershaft was modelled on Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle, the mother- in-law of Gilbert Murray, who with his wife Lady Mary served as inspiration for Adolphus Cusins and Barbara Undershaft. Andrew Undershaft was loosely inspired by a number of figures, including the arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, and German armaments family Krupp. Undershaft's unscrupulous sale of weapons to any and all bidders, as well as his government influence and more pertinently his company's method of succession (to a foundling rather than a son), tie him especially to Krupp steel. Friedrich Alfred Krupp died by suicide in 1902 following publication of claims he was a homosexual. His two daughters were his heirs. Undershaft shares a name with a Church of England church in the City of London named St Andrew Undershaft; given the district's longstanding status as the financial centre of London, the association underscores the play's thematic emphasis on the interpenetration of religion and economics, of faith and capital. Analysis Sidney P. Albert, a noted Shaw scholar, analysed various aspects of the play in several articles. These include first, Shaw's own account of the writing of the play; second, the chosen time of the play's setting, January 1906, and third, references to the Lord's Prayer Several scholars have compared this work to other works, including one of Shaw's own, and others from different periods. Fiona Macintosh has examined Shaw's use of classical literary sources, such as The Bacchae, in Major Barbara. In his discussion of the play, Robert J Jordan has analysed the relationship between Major Barbara and another Shaw play, Man and Superman. Joseph Frank has examined parallels between the play and the Divine Comedy of Dante. J.L. Wiesenthal has discussed parallels with the play and Shaw's personal interpretations of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Many studies have looked at main character Undershaft's beliefs and morals from several points of view, including their relation to Shaw's personal beliefs; their presentation throughout the play, and their changes over the course of the play; the counterpoints to them by Adolphus Cusins, and their relation to the social realities of the day. First, Charles Berst has studied the convictions of Andrew Undershaft in the play, and compared them with Shaw's own philosophical ideas. Robert Everding has discussed the gradual presentation of the ideas and character of Andrew Undershaft as the play progresses. The pseudonymous commentator 'Ozy' has compared Andrew Undershaft's apparent undermining of Shaw's own personal, general convictions about the 'Life Force', and Shaw's attempt to have Adolphus Cusins restore some philosophical balance. Norma Nutter has briefly discussed conflicts between the character's personal convictions compared to the social realities that they eventually face, via the concept of 'false consciousness'. Relatedly, several others have looked at the play in relation to the circumstances of the period in which it was written. Bernard Dukore has examined the historical context of the depiction of money in the play, relating the then-contemporary situation with inflation to more recent historical circumstances. Nicholas Williams has discussed possibilities for reinterpretation of the play in a more contemporary context, away from the immediate historical context of its original period.

Recipe A Hanky Panky cocktail with ingredients A recipe for the cocktail was included in Harry Craddock's The Savoy Cocktail Book. :In a cocktail shaker over ice pour: *1/2 (1 1/2oz.) Italian vermouth *1/2 (1 1/2oz) dry gin *2 dashes Fernet-Branca :Stir :Strain into a (4 oz.) cocktail glass. :Garnish by squeezing an orange peel over the top. History The Hanky-Panky was the brainchild of Ada Coleman (known as \\"Coley\\") who began as a bartender at the Savoy Hotel in 1903. Her benefactor was Rupert D'Oyly Carte, a member of the family that first produced Gilbert and Sullivan operas in London and that built the Savoy Hotel. When Rupert became chairman of the Savoy, Ada was given a position at the hotel's American Bar, where she eventually became the head bartender and made cocktails for the likes of Mark Twain, the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, and Sir Charles Hawtrey. Coleman created the Hanky-Panky for Hawtrey. He was a Victorian and Edwardian actor who mentored No√´l Coward. Coleman told the story behind the creation of the Hanky-Panky to England's The People newspaper in 1925: > The late Charles Hawtrey ... was one of the best judges of cocktails that I > knew. Some years ago, when he was overworking, he used to come into the bar > and say, \\"Coley, I am tired. Give me something with a bit of punch in it.\\" > It was for him that I spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new > cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He > sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said, \\"By Jove! That is the real > hanky-panky!\\" And Hanky-Panky it has been called ever since. The Hanky-Panky is a variation on the sweet martini, inasmuch as it calls for gin and sweet vermouth, but Coley's secret ingredient was Fernet-Branca, a bitter Italian digestivo. By adding a couple of dashes of this herbal elixir, she transformed it into a whole new drink.

The poem consists of the lament of the scop Deor, who lends his name to the poem, which was given no formal title; modern scholars do not actually believe Deor to be the author of this poem. In the poem, Deor's lord has replaced him. Deor mentions various figures from Germanic mythology and reconciles his own troubles with the troubles these figures faced, ending each section with the refrain \\"that passed away, so may this.\\" The poem Deor begins with the struggles and misfortunes of a character named Weland. The poem consists of 42 alliterative lines. Genre Attempts at placing this poem within a genre have proven to be quite difficult. Some commentators attempting to characterise the work have called it an ubi sunt (\\"where are they?\\") poem because of its meditations on transience. It can also be considered a traditional lament and poem of consolation. Christian consolation poems, however, usually attempt to subsume personal miseries in a historical or explicitly metaphysical context (e.g., Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy), and such perspectives are somewhat remote from the tradition of Anglo-Saxon poetry. Medievalist scholars who have viewed the poem within the Anglo-Saxon tradition have therefore seen it primarily as a begging poem‚Äîa poem written by a travelling and begging poet who is without a place at a noble court‚Äîalthough because few other begging poems survive, assigning it to such a genre is somewhat speculative. Others have related \\"Deor\\" to other melancholy poems in the Exeter Book, such as \\"The Seafarer\\" and \\"The Wanderer\\". Richard North has argued that the poem was written in about 856 as a satire on King √Üthelwulf of Wessex. John Miles Foley has hypothesized that the apparent murkiness of \\"Deor\\" is also in no small part attributable to the obscurity of the poet's references. As he puts it, \\"Cut off from its traditional background, 'Deor' makes little sense\\".Foley, John Miles. Homer's Traditional Art. University Park: Penn State University Press, 1999. Because the poem is not entirely translatable into modern English‚Äîthe third and fourth stanzas remain indeterminate to this day, and even the refrain prompts argument and poses linguistic difficulties‚Äîwithout grasping the allusions of the poem, it is quite difficult to understand the poet's implied attitude, and therefore to place it in any genre satisfactorily. Further, given the mass loss of Anglo-Saxon literature, it is possible that constraining the poem to an existing genre is artificial, for the poem may represent yet another, otherwise unattested genre, or it might well stand alone outside of generic rules. Language The language in the poetry is highly nuanced, and it is difficult for any translation into Modern English to capture the tensions present in the highly dense and parsimonious wording. The poem runs through a list of legendary figures, asks what happened to them, and then responds with a refrain of \\"√û√¶s ofereode, √æisses swa m√¶g\\" (\\"that passed away, so may this\\"). Grammatical difficulties are easily glossed over in most translations: for example, the Anglo-Saxon \\"√æ√¶s\\" and \\"√æisses\\" of the refrain are both genitive, not nominative. A more correct and literal translation would read \\"of that went away, and so may of this\\"‚Äîwhich is difficult to make sense of in Modern English. Reinserting an elided \\"it\\" might render \\"It (sorrow) went away from that (situation), (and) so it (sorrow) may from this (situation).\\" Story The poem \\"Deor\\" is a lament by its author about his exile from his life of luxury, respect, and popularity. He compares his current predicament to the predicaments of figures from Anglo-Saxon folklore. Among the miseries and dismal fates that Deor runs through are those of Theodoric the Great, Ermanaric of the Goths, the mythological smith Wayland, and Wayland's wife Beadohilde (the daughter of Wayland's captor; he seduced her and she finds herself with child). Geat and Maethild are more obscure figures, but it has been proposed that their story is the same as that told in the relatively recent medieval Scandinavian ballad known as the Power of the Harp; variants of this folk ballad from all the Scandinavian nations are known, and in some of these variants the names of the protagonists are Gauti and Magnhild. Each suffered an undeserved fate, and in each case \\"that passed away with respect to it, and so may this.\\" But this refrain can point at two very different statements: first, that remedy came about, one way or another, in each situation, or, alternatively, that the continuous flow of time (a favourite Anglo-Saxon topic) erases all pain (though not necessarily healing all wounds). Only in the last stanza do we learn what \\"this\\" references: the poet's own sorrow at having lost his position of privilege. At the poem's conclusion, Deor reveals that he was once a great poet among the Heodenings, until he was displaced and sent wandering by Heorrenda, a more skillful poet. According to Norse mythology, the Heodenings (Hja√∞ningar) were involved in the never-ending \\"battle of the Heodenings\\", the Hja√∞ningav√≠g.Malone, Kemp. \\"An Anglo-Latin Version of the Hjadningavig\\". Speculum, Vol. 39, No. 1 (Jan. 1964), pp. 35‚Äì44. Heorrenda (Hjarrandi) was one of the names of the god Odin. Translation Weland, the strong man, had experience of persecution; he suffered a lot. Sorrow and longing were his companions, along with exile in the cold winter; he experienced misfortunes after Nithad laid constraints upon him, supple bonds of sinew on a better man. That went away, this also may. In Beadohild's mind her brothers' death was not as grieving as her own situation, when she realized she was pregnant; she couldn't fathom the outcome. That went away, this also may. Many of us have heard that the Geat's love for Maethild passed all bounds, that his love robbed him of his sleep. That went away, this also may. For thirty years, Theodric ruled the stronghold of the Maerings; which has become common knowledge. That went away, this also may. We have learned of Eormanric's ferocious disposition; a cruel man, he held dominion in the kingdom of the Goths. Many men sat, full of sorrow, anticipating trouble and constantly praying for the fall of his country. That went away, this also may. If a man sits in despair, deprived of joy, with gloomy thoughts in his heart; it seems to him that there is no end to his suffering. Then he should remember that the wise Lord follows different courses throughout the earth; to many he grants glory, certainty, yet, misery to some. I will say this about myself, once I was a minstrel of the Heodeningas, my Lord's favorite. My name was Deor. For many years I had an excellent office and a gracious Lord, until now Heorrenda, a skillful man, has inherited the land once given to me by the protector of warriors. That went away, this also may. Literary influence Deor had a profound influence on J. R. R. Tolkien, the refrain in particular - which he himself translated as \\"Time has passed since then, this too can pass\\" - being (according to Tom Shippey) a central theme of The Lord of the Rings.T.

He was the host of American Top 40 from 1988 to 1995. He currently hosts the internationally syndicated radio show, Top of the World, and co-hosts Mental Radio, an entertaining approach to UFOs and paranormal topics. He was co-founder and creator of Sammy Hagar's rock station \\"Cabo Wabo Radio\\" which broadcast from the Cabo Wabo Cantina in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. In television, he was the announcer for The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on CBS and, as of July 2015, serves as the primary continuity announcer for the Antenna TV network. His voice can also be heard as the voiceover for \\"G.O.D.\\" in the Off-Broadway musical Altar Boyz. Stevens is also often heard on Hits & Favorites, calling in at least once a week to share wisdom with his brother Richard Stevens and their friend Lori St. James. Early life Stevens was born in Jamestown, North Dakota. He first came to fame in 1957 when a Life magazine article about him, entitled \\"America's Youngest D.J.\\", featured a photo of Stevens broadcasting live over radio station KEYJ (now called KQDJ) in his hometown of Jamestown. The accompanying article extolled the fact that he had built his own working transmitter in the attic of his home the year before, using a \\"souped-up\\" wireless broadcasting kit with a hundred-foot antenna. It omitted, however, the additional information that the equipment and advice needed to build the transmitter had both been furnished by the staff engineers at KEYJ, which happened to be owned by his father and uncle; his family continues to own many radio stations in North Dakota to this day, under the Ingstad Family Media group. He was later \\"discovered\\" in a \\"man on the street\\" interview by the station and was soon broadcasting a weekly rock show called Spin with Terry. During his high school years, he obtained a full-time shift at the station as a host of the Mister Midnight program, where he developed his now-famous \\"slow 'n low\\" style of speaking. College and early career Stevens attended and graduated from the University of North Dakota, where he was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. Majoring in Commercial Art and Radio/TV Journalism at the University of North Dakota and the University of Arizona, Stevens put himself through college working in radio at KILO in Grand Forks, North Dakota; KQWB in Fargo, North Dakota; and KIKX in Tucson, Arizona, where he quickly became the most popular DJ in town, under the on-air persona of \\"Jefferson K.\\" Following college, he joined the Bill Drake-formatted station WRKO in Boston during the winter of 1968-69. At WRKO, he worked the early evening (6-9 p.m.) shift during the station's peak in popularity. In the spring of 1970, he moved to Southern California to another Drake outlet, KHJ, as one of the last true \\"Boss Jocks\\", where his big baritone and energetic enthusiasm soon gained a following. Before long, he gained significant popularity on radio and became the announcer and sidekick on the nationally syndicated television series The Steve Allen Show. Stevens later went on to become a radio personality and program director at KRLA in Los Angeles. Attaining status as a programmer, he was hired to make a success of KMET-FM and then to create the programming for a new radio format on a new Los Angeles station, KROQ-FM (\\"K-Rock\\"), where he remained for five years. 1970s and the rise to fame During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stevens gained an additional cult following when he created and produced \\"Fred R. Rated for Federated,\\" a long-running series of offbeat television commercials for the Federated Group, a chain of home electronics retailers in the western and southwestern United States. These ads were so popular that they were the subject of a two-page spread in Time Magazine and led to a movie deal, television shows, and American Top 40. In 1984, Stevens entered an inpatient treatment facility in order to overcome a drug problem that had plagued him since the late 1960s.\\"Charice's Surprising Revelation, Carmen Electra, Macy Gray & Shadoe Stevens.\\" Oprah: Where Are They Now?

A Marconi AMES Type 84 radar was located on the airfield and an AMES Type 80 radar was located at Killard Point, Ballyhornan (remote from the station itself). An AMES Type 93 mobile radar was also located on the airfield from 1989 until the station closed. History =Airfield= A number of different units were based at the airfield: * 819 Naval Air Squadron * No. 7 Air Observers School RAF between (17 May 1943 and 15 February 1944 * No. 12 Air Gunners School RAF between 1 August 1943 and 31 May 1945 * No. 7 (Observers) Advanced Flying Unit RAF between 15 February 1944 and 31 May 1945 * No. 7 Air Navigation School RAF between 31 May 1945 and 4 June 1947 * No. 2 Air Navigation School RAF between 4 June and 1 October 1947 * No. 3 Air Navigation School RAF between 3 March 1952 and 14 April 1954 * No. 671 Gliding School RAF between 22 January 1959 and September 1962 * No. 664 Volunteer Gliding School RAF between February 1987 and 31 October 1990 =Radar station= RAF Bishops Court formed part of the UK Military Air Traffic Service, as one of four reporting stations it was to control its sector (North Atlantic) and was commanded by HQ Military Air Traffic Operations (MATO) at RAF Uxbridge and RAF Strike Command at High Wycombe. The site was known as Ulster Radar and had both a military and civil role. In its civil role the civilian personnel (using the military radar) controlled air traffic, primarily over the Atlantic to ensure correct height and separation. The Irish Republican Army fired five mortar bombs at the radar site on 11 September 1989. The responsibilities of the site were assumed by the air traffic control centre at Prestwick, Scotland, in October 1978. The radar equipment was soon removed from the site, however the RAF remained. In the early 1980s new bunkers were constructed and a mobile radar was installed. The decision to close the 577 acre (2.3 km¬≤) site was taken in the late 1980s and it was put up for sale in the period 1991‚Äì1995. Alexander Galt the famous Scottish artist was stationed here during the war. While there he painted murals on the wall of the officers mess. The paintings are still visible. Current use Since the sale the land surrounding the runway has been used for agriculture, while the land at one end of the site (including some of the airfield runways) has been used for motor sport being called Bishopscourt Racing Circuit. Today at least one runway remains intact and is used by gliders, the married quarters are now civilian housing. In 2003 it was reported that Bishopscourt was a contender for a Ryanair airfield in the south of Northern Ireland. While the site would require significant infrastructure works if this were to happen, the former RAF station would fit into the Ryanair business model (selecting airports some distance from a capital/major city with low landing fees etc. and providing transport to that city.)

It is the oldest girls‚Äô independent school in Greater London.JAGS website, History of School: \\"JAGS is the oldest girls‚Äô independent school in Greater London\\" It is a registered charity and was originally part of Edward Alleyn's College of God's Gift charitable foundation, which also included Alleyn's School and Dulwich College. It has a senior school for 11- to 18-year-old girls, a prep school for 7- to 11-year-old girls (James Allen's Preparatory School), and a pre- preparatory school for 4- to 7-year-old girls. It is the sister school of Dulwich College and Alleyn's. History =1741: Dulwich Reading School= The Bricklayer's Arms, the original site of the Dulwich Reading School In 1604 the hamlet of Dulwich, its name recorded well before the Norman Conquests, was bought by the Elizabethan actor and entrepreneur, Edward Alleyn, for ¬£4,900. Fourteen years later, Alleyn invested his fortune establishing the College of God's Gift, buying land for a school, a chapel and the alms houses in Dulwich. In June 1741 James Allen, Master of the College of God's Gift from 1723, founded the original Reading School for poor children, both boys and girls living in Dulwich. The Dulwich Reading School started in two rooms in the Bricklayer‚Äôs Arms, later called The French Horn in Dulwich Village. The boys were taught to read as preparation for entry to Dulwich College and the girls to read and sew. =Early 1800s: Dulwich Free School= By the 1800s it was known as the Dulwich Free School. Classes were growing in size and moved into an empty old inn building near the village crossroads and was renamed the Dulwich Free School. =1842: Dulwich Girls‚Äô School= The school continued to grow and when the College was reorganised in the 1840s, the boys were moved, leaving the Free School with improved teaching for the girls from 1842. It was renamed The Dulwich Girls‚Äô School with mostly local girls as pupils. It was housed in the building now inhabited by Dulwich Hamlet School. =1878: James Allen‚Äôs Girls‚Äô School= The school became known as James Allen‚Äôs Girls‚Äô School in 1878 and finally moved with 141 pupils to its present site in East Dulwich Grove in 1886 with Miss Bettany as its first Headmistress. Botany Gardens were created in the school grounds soon after Dr Lilian Clarke joined the staff in 1895. It was the first such experiment by a school in this country. In 1902 the first school laboratory equipped solely for botanical study was opened. She was a pioneer and influential in science teaching nationally. In 1890 the school roll had grown to 200 and the curriculum expanded. =20th century= The school in 1922 In the early 20th century, Ralph Vaughan Williams worked at the school as a singing master, and his friend Gustav Holst worked as music teacher at JAGS from 1904 for 16 years. Holst collaborated on Tennyson‚Äôs Songs from the Princess whilst at JAGS. He stopped teaching there in 1920 but maintained a close connection with the school. Choral music and singing developed into a core part of school life. By 1916 a school orchestra emerged for the first time and in 1920 JAGS girls participated in Holst‚Äôs 4th Thaxted Festival in Suffolk as a farewell to the composer. A series of stained glass windows was installed in 1969 in the Holst Hall. Sports Mistress Mildred Knott was appointed in 1921; she was an excellent hockey player who became captain of the England hockey team.

He was mortally wounded while leading his brigade during the fighting at Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, and died five days later. Early life and education Vincent was born in Waterford, Pennsylvania, son of iron foundryman B. B. Vincent and Sarah Ann (n√©e) Strong. He attended Trinity College and Harvard University, graduating in 1859. He practiced law in Erie, Pennsylvania. American Civil War At the start of the American Civil War, Vincent joined the Pennsylvania Militia as an adjutant and first lieutenant of the Erie Regiment. On September 14, 1861, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry and was promoted to colonel the following June. After the death of his regimental commander in the Seven Days Battles (at the Battle of Gaines's Mill), Vincent assumed command of the regiment. He developed malaria on the Virginia Peninsula and was on medical leave until the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862. On May 20, 1863, he assumed command of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, V Corps, Army of the Potomac, replacing his brigade commander, who resigned after the Battle of Chancellorsville. Likeness of Col. Vincent atop the 83rd Pennsylvania Infantry monument, Gettysburg National Military Park near the spot where Vincent was mortally wounded At the Battle of Gettysburg, 26-year-old Vincent and his brigade arrived on July 2, 1863. He had started the Gettysburg Campaign knowing that his young wife, Elizabeth H. Carter, whom he had married on the day he enlisted in the army, was pregnant with their first child. He had written her, \\"If I fall, remember you have given your husband to the most righteous cause that ever widowed a woman.\\" Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles of the III Corps had deviated from his orders, moving his corps to a position that left undefended a significant terrain feature: Little Round Top. The chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, recognized the tactical importance of the hill and urgently sought Union troops to occupy it before the Confederates could. A staff officer sent by Warren encountered Vincent's brigade nearby. Vincent, without consulting his superior officers, decided that his brigade was in the ideal position to defend Little Round Top, saying \\"I will take the responsibility to take my brigade there.\\" Pvt. Oliver Willcox Norton, Vincent's brigade standard bearer and bugler, later wrote that he and Vincent made a reconnaissance of the Confederate forces as the brigade was moving into position, \\"While our line was forming on the hill at Gettysburg I came out with him in full view of the rebel lines. They opened two batteries on us instantly, firing at the colors. Colonel Vincent looked to see what was drawing the fire and yelled at me, \\"Down with the flag, Norton! Damn it, go behind the rocks with it.\\".Norton, p. 167. Norton was a member of the 83rd Pennsylvania, which Vincent commanded before becoming its brigade commander. The pennant of the 3rd Brigade One of Vincent's regiments, the 20th Maine, led by Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, has received most of the fame for the defense of Little Round Top, but there is little doubt that the efforts and bravery of Vincent were instrumental in the eventual Union victory. Vincent impressed upon Chamberlain the importance of his position on the brigade's left flank and then he left to attend to the brigade's right flank. There, the 16th Michigan Infantry was starting to yield to enemy pressure. Mounting a large boulder, Vincent brandished a riding crop given to him by his wife and shouted to his men \\"Don't give an inch!\\" A bullet struck him through the thigh and the groin and he fell. Due to the determination of the 20th Maine, the 44th New York, the 140th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, the 83rd Pennsylvania and the 16th Michigan Infantry, the Union line held against the Confederate onslaught. Vincent was carried from the hill to a nearby farm, where he lay dying for the next five days, unable to be transported home due to the severity of his injury. The commander of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, recommended Vincent for promotion to brigadier general on the evening of July 2. The promotion was dated July 3, 1863, but it is doubtful that Vincent knew about the honor before he died Warner, p. 528. Eicher, p. 614, states that this promotion was not confirmed by the United States Senate, and therefore does not list him as a general. (although Pvt. Oliver Willcox Norton in Army Letters 1861-1865 writes \\"His commission as Brigadier General was read to him on his deathbed.\\")Norton, p. 162. Vincent's wife gave birth to a baby girl two months later, who died before reaching the age of one and is buried next to her father. His corps commander, Maj. Gen. George Sykes, described Vincent's actions in his official report from the battle: Legacy Statue at Blasco Library in Erie, Pennsylvania Vincent is buried in Erie Cemetery in Erie. He is memorialized by a statue on the 83rd Pennsylvania monument on Little Round Top, by a statue erected in 1997 at Blasco Memorial Library, Erie, and by Strong Vincent High School (now a middle school) in Erie. The portion of Little Round Top to the southeast of Sykes Avenue on the Gettysburg Battlefield is known as \\"Vincent's Spur\\". The 1-112 Infantry of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard stationed in Cambridge Springs uses the call sign \\"STRONG\\" in recognition of Vincent's courage, determination and sacrifice.

A face of a polyhedron is a planar polygon bounded by straight line segments, called edges. Curved surfaces are usually approximated by a polygon mesh. Computer programs for line drawings of opaque objects must be able to decide which edges or which parts of the edges are hidden by an object itself or by other objects. This problem is known as hidden-line removal. The first known solution to the hidden-line problem was devised by RobertsL. G. Roberts. Machine perception of three-dimensional solids. PhD thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1963. in 1963. However, it severely restricts the model: it requires that all objects be convex. Ruth A. Weiss of Bell Labs documented her 1964 solution to this problem in a 1965 paper.Ruth A.

Sutherland listed 10 unsolved problems in computer graphics.I. E. Sutherland. Ten unsolved problems in computer graphics. Datamation, 12(5):22‚Äì27, 1966. Problem number seven was \\"hidden-line removal\\". In terms of computational complexity, this problem was solved by Devai in 1986.F. Devai. Quadratic bounds for hidden line elimination. In Proc. 2nd Annual Symp. on Computational Geometry, SCG ‚Äô86, pp. 269‚Äì275, New York, NY, USA, 1986. Models, e.g., in computer-aided design, can have thousands or millions of edges. Therefore, a computational-complexity approach, expressing resource requirements, such as time and memory, as the function of problem sizes, is crucial. Time requirements are particularly important in interactive systems. Problem sizes for hidden-line removal are the total number n of the edges of the model and the total number v of the visible segments of the edges. Visibility can change at the intersection points of the images of the edges. Let k denote the total number of the intersection points of the images of the edges. Both k = Œò(n2) and v = Œò(n2) in the worst case, but usually v < k.  Algorithms  Hidden-line algorithms published before 1984A. Appel.

Assuming a model of a collection of polyhedra with the boundary of each topologically equivalent to a sphere and with faces topologically equivalent to disks, according to Euler's formula, there are Œò(n) faces. Testing Œò(n2) line segments against Œò(n) faces takes Œò(n3) time in the worst case. Appel's algorithm is also unstable, because an error in visibility will be propagated to subsequent segment endpoints.J. F. Blinn. Fractional invisibility. IEEE Comput. Graph.

These algorithms take Œò(n2 log2 n), respectively Œò(n2 log n) time in the worst case, but if k is less than quadratic, can be faster in practice. Any hidden-line algorithm has to determine the union of Œò(n) hidden intervals on n edges in the worst case. As Œ©(n log n) is a lower bound for determining the union of n intervals,M. L. Fredman and B. Weide. On the complexity of computing the measure of U[ai, bi]. Commun. ACM, 21:540‚Äì544, July 1978. it appears that the best one can hope to achieve is Œò(n2 log n) worst-case time, and hence Nurmi's algorithm is optimal. However, the log n factor was eliminated by Devai, who raised the open problem whether the same optimal O(n2) upper bound existed for hidden- surface removal. This problem was solved by McKenna in 1987.M. McKenna. Worst- case optimal hidden-surface removal. ACM Trans. Graph., 6:19‚Äì28, January 1987. The intersection-sensitive algorithms are mainly known in the computational- geometry literature. The quadratic upper bounds are also appreciated by the computer-graphics literature: Ghali notesSh. Ghali. A survey of practical object space visibility algorithms. SIGGRAPH Tutorial Notes, 1(2), 2001. that the algorithms by Devai and McKenna \\"represent milestones in visibility algorithms\\", breaking a theoretical barrier from O(n2 log n) to O(n2) for processing a scene of n edges. The other open problem, raised by Devai, of whether there exists an O(n log n + v)-time hidden-line algorithm, where v, as noted above, is the number of visible segments, is still unsolved at the time of writing.  Parallel algorithms  In 1988 Devai proposedF. Devai. An O(log N) parallel time exact hidden-line algorithm. Advances in Computer Graphics Hardware II, pp. 65‚Äì73, 1988. an O(log n)-time parallel algorithm using n2 processors for the hidden-line problem under the concurrent read, exclusive write (CREW) parallel random-access machine (PRAM) model of computation. As the product of the processor number and the running time is asymptotically greater than Œò(n2), the sequential complexity of the problem, the algorithm is not work-optimal, but it demonstrates that the hidden-line problem is in the complexity class NC, i.e., it can be solved in polylogarithmic time by using a polynomial number of processors. Hidden-surface algorithms can be used for hidden-line removal, but not the other way around. Reif and Sen J. H. Reif and S. Sen. An efficient output-sensitive hidden surface removal algorithm and its parallelization. In Proc. 4th Annual Symp. on Computational Geometry, SCG ‚Äô88, pp. 193‚Äì200, New York, NY, USA, 1988. proposed an O(log4 n)-time algorithm for the hidden-surface problem, using O((n + v)/log n) CREW PRAM processors for a restricted model of polyhedral terrains, where v is the output size. In 2011 Devai publishedF. Devai. An optimal hidden-surface algorithm and its parallelization.

Springer Berlin/Heidelberg, 2011. an O(log n)-time hidden-surface, and a simpler, also O(log n)-time, hidden-line algorithm. The hidden-surface algorithm, using n2/log n CREW PRAM processors, is work-optimal. The hidden-line algorithm uses n2 exclusive read, exclusive write (EREW) PRAM processors. The EREW model is the PRAM variant closest to real machines. The hidden-line algorithm does O(n2 log n) work, which is the upper bound for the best sequential algorithms used in practice. Cook, Dwork and Reischuk gave an Œ©(log n) lower bound for finding the maximum of n integers allowing infinitely many processors of any PRAM without simultaneous writes.S. Cook, C. Dwork, and R. Reischuk. Upper and lower time bounds for parallel random access machines without simultaneous writes. SIAM J. Comput., 15:87‚Äì97, February 1986. Finding the maximum of n integers is constant-time reducible to the hidden-line problem by using n processors. Therefore, the hidden-line algorithm is time optimal.

Retrieved 18 February 2007 As of the 2006 census, it had a population of 777,667, making it the 7th largest city by population in Nigeria. History Aerial view of Ilorin in 1929 Ilorin was founded by the Yoruba, one of the three largest ethnic groups in Nigeria, in 1450. It became a provincial military headquarters of the ancient Oyo Empire, and later became a Northern Nigeria protectorate when Shehu Alimi, an itinerant Islamic preacher and teacher, took control of the city through the spread of Islam. The capital was occupied by the Royal Niger Company in 1897 and its lands were incorporated into the British colony of Northern Nigeria in 1900, although the emirate continued to perform ceremonial functions. The city retains a strong Islamic influence, although Christianity is now widely practised in the cosmopolitan part of the city due to the significant immigration of people from other parts of Kwara State and the rest of Nigeria. Sports Ilorin has an 18,000-capacity stadium and two professional football teams; Kwara United F. C. playing in the top-tier league of Nigeria Professional Football League (N.P.F.L) which is run by the League Management Company; and ABS F.C. in the second division which is Bet9ja Nigeria National league. The city has the only standard baseball field in West Africa. It has also hosted several national handball competitions. Commerce Shoppers at the Palms Mall in Ilorin The political economy of Kwara State can be traced to 1967 when it was created. Since then the state has undergone various developmental efforts, mostly initiated by the federal government given the nature of the Nigerian state, a centralized federal system where development policies and programmes originate from the centre. The state has a large area of rich agricultural land. The limestone and dolomite of Oreke, kaolin and clay at Idofian near Ilorin and other parts of the state, pure gold in Kaiama and the Patigi area, and the highly exportable rich tantalite deposit of Iporin make Kwara State rich in primary resources. Initially, Kwara State had only a few major industrial companies, Global Soap (not more in operation), Detergent Industries Nigeria Limited and the International Tobacco Company. Successive administrations have attempted to attract industrialists to the state. With such efforts, Ilorin has become the hub for cashew processing in Nigeria and Olam International has set up Africa's biggest cashew processing plant. The plant processes 100 MT of cashews every day and provides employment to over 2000 workers. Recently established industries include Dangote Flour Mills, Tuyil Pharmaceutical company, KAMWIL, Golden Confectionate Food Industries, Chellaram Motor-Cycle Assembly plants, and Rajrab Pharmaceuticals. Climate Ilorin has a tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Aw). Transport Post Office Route Split Diamond Underpass in Ilorin Traffic warden in Ilorin city, Kwara State Ilorin Train Station, Kwara state Ilorin operates a relatively well- developed intra-city public transportation, and the major roads within the metropolis are very good. There are three modes of transiting from place to place in the city ‚Äì the most popular being the conventional taxis. Car-hire services are also available in major hotels. Furthermore, there are commercial motorbikes, commonly called \\"Okada\\", and the more recent arrival on Ilorin's roads of commercial tricycles, popularly called \\"Keke NAPEP\\" or \\"Keke\\", some of which are given on loan to beneficiaries of the National Poverty Eradication Programme. Ilorin taxis are painted yellow and green. Ilorin's central location makes it easily accessible to all parts of the country by air, road and rail. The state has a good network of roads, rail and air transportation facilities linking it with Nigeria's other industrial and commercial centres. Transportation is quite affordable in Ilorin with movement from one place to another for as low as fifty naira. There are scheduled daily commercial flights to and from Ilorin International Airport by Arik Air and Overland Airways. The now defunct Capital Airlines also operated from Ilorin. Current destinations include all of the major cities in Nigeria. The airport has also been re-designed and equipped as an international cargo airport. Ilorin offers reliable road transport services to Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Oyo, Ekiti, Kogi, Niger, Kaduna and Plateau States. Similar services are available to and from Onitsha, Port Harcourt, Abuja, Aba and others. A major expressway to Ibadan, numbered E1, is currently under construction by P.W. International. Culture =Religion= The city is a confluence of cultures, populated by the Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Fulani, Nupe, Bariba and Kanuri tribes from across Nigeria, as well as foreign nationals. There are large Christian and Islamic populations, and many ceremonial activities, mostly with religious aspects, take place in the city throughout the year. Ilorin has a friendly environment (generally called the \\"Home of Peace\\"), and hence host different religious practices and training institute, such as the degree-awarding United Missionary Theological College (affiliated with the University of Ibadan and University of Ilorin) produces many church ministers, teachers and theologians of all denominations. The College of Arabic and Islamic Legal Studies in the Adeta area trains Muslims in various Islamic, Arabic and social science disciplines. =Christianity in Ilorin= The city has a host of ancient and modern churches with moderate to large congregations, such as the holy order of Cherubim and Seraphim churches, Anglican, Methodist, Celestial Church of Christ, The Holy Trinity Gospel Church International, Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), United Missionary Church of Africa (UMCA), Catholic Church, Emmanuel Baptist Church, First Baptist Church, Zion Baptist church Common Wealth of Zion Assembly, Seventh- day Adventist and Protestant populations of the Christian faith. Most Christian churches in the state started schools and introduced innovative ideas that were readily adopted by the Muslim schools. There has been a Latter-day Saint congregation in Ilorin since 1992. In that year an LDS mission was organized in the city that year, but shortly later merged with the one in Enugu. Starting in 2016 additional LDS congregations were organized in Ilorin, which in 2018 was transferred to the new Nigerian Ibadan Mission, and had a district organized.LDs church growth newsletter =Ilorin Central Mosque= =History= The first Ilorin central mosque was founded in 1820 in the Agbarere Area, popularly known as \\"Ile-Elewa\\", under the leadership of Sheik Imam Muhammad Munab'bau. This was followed in 1835 when another central mosque was built at Idi-Ape during the reign of the first Emir of Ilorin, Abdus-salam. However, more than a century later, this central mosque could no longer cope with the growth in the Muslim population of the city. For this reason, in 1974, the ninth Emir of Ilorin, Alhaji (Dr) Zulkarnaini Gambari, invited Grand Mufti Alhaji Mohammed Kamal-u-deen and the then present Wazirin Ngeri of Ilorin, Dr. Abubakar Sola Saraki, to co-ordinate the fundraising and construction of a new central mosque. =The present Ilorin Central Mosque= On 30 April 1977, the foundation was laid for the new mosque by the Emir of Gwandu on behalf of the Sarki Musulmi, Sultan Abubabar III. The new Ilorin Central Mosque was completed and officially opened in 1981 by the former president Alhaji Shehu Shagari. The Mosque was renovated, rehabilitated and expanded in 2012 with a majestic view. The newly redecorated mosque was recommissioned on 14 December 2012. =The \\"New\\" Ilorin Central Mosque= Planning for the rehabilitation, refurbishment and redecoration of the Central Mosque started in 2007 when Alhaji (Dr) Ibrahim Zulu Gambari, CFR, the eleventh Emir of Ilorin, with assistance from Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, the Turaki of Ilorin, and the former Governor of Kwara State, set up a technical committee headed by Alhaji Shehu Abdul-gafar on the rehabilitation and enhancement of the central mosque. The committee has invited expertise from specialists in mosque construction from around the world, especially from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria. In addition to the general restoration and enhancement of the mosque, it will now have a total of 99 domes of different diameters, 75 feet above the floor. The large dome will be of gold finish while the four big domes around it will be coated in green with reflective illumination. The mosque form is enveloped within a pyramid shape with a square base and 45 inclinations for the faces. It has four accessible minarets, each standing at a height of 150 feet. Moreover, all the dilapidated domes and minarets with mosaic finishing will be restored and finished with cut-to-size marble. The exterior and interior will also be covered by special marble while the expanded courtyard will be constructed with heat-absorbing granite (marble) finish. The doors and windows will be replaced with specially designed ones befitting the new mosque concept. Arts and Tourism The city also has a range of tourist attractions such as the Sobi Hill which is said to have offered protection to natives during intertribal wars in ancient times. The Okuta Ilorin is located in Asaju's compound, Idi-Ape Quarters. It is the stone on which Ojo Isekuse, one of the founders of the city, used to sharpen his metal tools. It was actually called \\"Okuta ilo irin\\" (meaning stone for sharpening metals). It is from this tool, the town Ilorin derived its name. The stone was a deified object of worship and sacrifice offerings in the past. Pottery is a big business in Ilorin. The city has the biggest traditional pottery workshops in Nigeria. They are located in the Dada area of Okelele, Eletu in Oju-Ekun, Okekura, Oloje, Abe Emi and Ita Merin. The traditional textile industry also thrives in Ilorin. In various parts of the city, aso- oke, textiles hand-woven on simple looms, are made in large quantities. Aso- oke is purchased by traders and fashion designers from Kwara State, other parts of Nigeria and abroad. The cultural center houses the Kwara State Council for Arts and Culture, its performing troupe, and a gallery with artworks and antiquities. Souvenirs of cultural and historical values are also available. Metropolitan Park, a recreational park, is located on Unity Road. The Kwara State Stadium Complex has an Olympic-sized swimming pool with facilities for diving. A purpose-built baseball park is located in the Adewole area of the city. The National Commission for Museum and Monuments has one of its centers in Ilorin, with interesting cultural and ethnographic objects from Nigeria's many cultures. The Esie Museum is of major note. Education Ilorin is home to two universities; the University of Ilorin and Al-Hikmah University, Ilorin; it also has Kwara State University within its metropolitan area. It is also home to the following educational institutions: *Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin *Federal Government College, Ilorin *IQRA College, Ilorin *Kwara State College of Education, Ilorin *Muhyideen College of Education, Ilorin *Kwara State College of Arabic and Islamic Legal Studies, Ilorin *United Missionary Theological Seminary. *School of Nursing and Midwifery *National Centre for Agricultural Mechanization *Agriculture and Rural Management Training Institute *Michael Imoudu Institute for Labour Studies *Federal Training Center *Government Secondary School, Ilorin Founded in 1914 *Bishop Smith Memorial College *Ansarul Islam Secondary School, Ilorin *Mount Carmel College, Ilorin *Ilorin Grammar School, Ilorin *Unilorin Secondary School *Emmanuel Baptist College *Government Secondary School, Adeta, Ilorin *Government Day Secondary School, Karuma, Ilorin *Government Girls Day Secondary School *Army Day Secondary School, Sobi Barrack, Ilorin *Saint Anthony's Secondary School, Ilorin *Cherubim and Seraphim College, Ilorin *U.M.C.A Chapel Nursery and Primary School, Ilorin *U.M.C.A High school, Ilorin *Ideal Nursery and Primary School, Ilorin *Saint Joseph's Primary school, Ilorin *Socrates College, Ilorin See also * Ilorin Emirate References State capitals in Nigeria Cities in Yorubaland Cities in Nigeria Populated places in Kwara State 1450 establishments ","title":"Ilorin"},{"id":"596883","text":"Ghe with upturn (“ê “ë; italics: “ê “ë ) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It is part of the Ukrainian alphabet, the Pannonian Rusyn alphabet and both the Carpathian Rusyn alphabets, and also some variants of the Urum and Belarusian (i.e. Tara≈°kievica) alphabets. In these alphabets it is usually called \\"Ge\\", while the letter it follows ‚Äî ‚ü®–ì –≥‚ü© (which in its turn is also called \\"Ge\\" in Russian and many other languages) ‚Äî is called \\"He\\". In Unicode, this letter is called \\"Ghe with upturn\\". The letterform of this letter is based on the letterform of the letter ‚ü®–ì –≥‚ü©, but its handwritten and italic lowercase forms do not follow the italic modification of ‚ü®–≥‚ü© (i.e. –≥). It represents the voiced velar plosive , like the pronunciation of ‚ü®g‚ü© in \\"go\\". Ghe with upturn is romanized using the Latin letter G (but with an additional grave accent in ISO 9).  History  The common Slavic voiced velar plosive is represented in most Cyrillic orthographies by ‚ü®–ì‚ü©, called –≥–µ ghe in most languages. In Ukrainian, however, around the early 13th century, the sound lenited to the voiced velar fricative (except in the cluster *zg), and around the 16th century, debuccalized to the voiced glottal fricative (like the pronunciation of ‚ü®h‚ü© in behind). The phoneme continued to be represented by ‚ü®–ì‚ü©, called –≥–µ he in Ukrainian. Within a century after this sound change began, was re- introduced from Western European loanwords. Since then, it has been represented by several different notations in writing. In early Belarusian and Ukrainian orthographies, Latin ‚ü®g‚ü© or the Cyrillic digraph ‚ü®–∫–≥‚ü© (kh) were sometimes used for the sound of Latin ‚ü®g‚ü© in assimilated words. The first text to consequently employ the letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© was the 16th-century Peresopnytsia Gospel. The use of the letter was not confined to the Old- and Middle- Ukrainian-speaking territory, and there was a fully-fledged use in the 16th- century printer Pyotr Mstislavets's edition of The Four Gospels. Later, distinguishing of the sound and using the digraph gradually disappeared from Belarusian orthography. As far as linguistic studies are concerned, the letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© was first introduced into the Slavic alphabet in 1619 by Meletius Smotrytsky in his \\"Slavic Grammar\\" (–ì—Ä–∞–º–º–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–∏ —Å–ª–∞–≤—î–Ω—Å–∫–∏—ß –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–Ω–æ—î –°—µ–Ω—Ç–∞“ë–º–∞).–ú–µ–ª–µ—Ç—ñ–π –°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏—Ü—å–∫–∏–π. –ì—Ä–∞–º–∞—Ç–∏–∫–∞ —Å–ª–æ–≤'—è–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ (1619). –ü—ñ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∫–∞ —Ñ–∞–∫—Å–∏–º—ñ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –≤–∏–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—è –í. –í. –ù—ñ–º—á—É–∫–∞. –ö–∏—ó–≤. ¬´–ù–∞—É–∫–æ–≤–∞ –¥—É–º–∫–∞¬ª (–ü–∞–º'—è—Ç–∫–∏ —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –º–æ–≤–∏) 1979 Later, for an identical purpose, it was saved in the new orthography of Ukrainian. The letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© was officially eliminated from the Ukrainian alphabet in the Soviet orthographic reforms of 1933, its function being subsumed into that of the letter ‚ü®–≥‚ü©, pronounced in Ukrainian as . However, ‚ü®“ë‚ü© continued to be used by Ukrainians in Galicia (part of Poland until 1939) and in the Ukrainian diaspora worldwide. It was reintroduced to Soviet Ukraine in a 1990 orthographic reform under glasnost.Ukrainian Orthography (2012). ‚Äî ¬ß 15. The letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü©. In Belarusian, the plosive realization of the Proto-Slavic voiced velar plosive has been preserved root-internally in the consonant clusters ‚ü®–∑–≥‚ü©, ‚ü®–∂–≥‚ü©, ‚ü®–¥–∑–≥‚ü©, and ‚ü®–¥–∂–≥‚ü© (in words such as –º–∞–∑–≥—ñ , –≤—ç–¥–∑–≥–∞—Ü—å or –¥–∂–≥–∞—Ü—å but not on a morphological boundary, as in –∑–≥–∞–¥–∞—Ü—å , in which is a prefix). It is present in common loanwords such as –≥–∞–Ω–∞–∫ , –≥—É–∑—ñ–∫ , or –≥–∞–Ω–¥–∞–ª—å . In the 20th century, some Belarusian linguists, notably Jan Stankieviƒç, promoted both the reintroduction of the practice of pronouncing Latin ‚ü®g‚ü©, at least in newly assimilated words, and the adoption of the letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© to represent it. However, consensus on this has never been reached, and the letter has never been part of the standard Belarusian alphabet and saw only sporadic periods of use. For example, a code of alternative Belarusian orthography rules, based on the proposal of Vincuk Viaƒçorka and published in 2005, has the optional letter ‚ü®“ë‚ü© included in the alphabet, but it can be replaced by ‚ü®–≥‚ü©.Bu≈°lako≈≠ et al.

He was the original creator of Microsoft Word. After leaving Microsoft, Brodie became a motivational speaker and authored two bestselling books. Biography =Early life= Brodie was born in Newton, Massachusetts, the older son of Mary Ann Brodie and Richard Brodie, a child psychologist. He graduated from Newton South High School and entered Harvard College in the fall of 1977 concentrating in applied mathematics with an emphasis on computer science. Brodie left Harvard after his sophomore year and moved to Palo Alto, CA to work for Xerox Corporation's Advanced Systems Division (ASD), where he met Charles Simonyi and helped develop the Bravo X word processor for the Alto computer. Simonyi became a mentor to Brodie while at Xerox and took Brodie with him when he moved to Microsoft in 1981. =Microsoft= Simonyi hired Brodie in 1981 as Microsoft's 77th employee, and a founding member of the Microsoft Application Division. Brodie distinguished himself at Microsoft by creating the first version of Microsoft Word in less than seven months. In addition to primary authorship of Microsoft Word, Brodie wrote Microsoft's first C compiler, the original version of Notepad, and Word for the IBM PC Jr. Brodie's success as a programmer brought him to the attention of Bill Gates, who made Brodie his technical assistant in 1983. Brodie's primary accomplishment as Gates's assistant was the management of the Cashmere project, which would be released as Word for Windows. Brodie left Microsoft after the company went public in 1986, but returned in 1991 as Chief Software Designer and Lead Developer of the Omega project, which would be released as Microsoft Access in 1992. He left Microsoft again in 1994. =After leaving Microsoft= Between his stints at Microsoft, Brodie embarked upon a personal self-improvement quest. He took numerous courses and participated in retreats, looking for an answer to the question of \\"why money and success didn‚Äôt make me happy.\\" He wrote about his experience in his first book, Getting Past OK: The Self-Help Book for People Who Don‚Äôt Need Help, first published in 1993. The book became a regional bestseller and was republished by Warner Books. Brodie followed Getting Past OK with Virus of the Mind in 1995. Virus of the Mind explored the new field of memetics, but from a practical point of view. Hay House bought the rights to both books and currently publishes them. Both books are in print in many languages worldwide. Brodie's books and the subsequent book tours landed him interviews on both The Oprah Winfrey Show and Phil Donahue. =Poker player= Apart from his careers as a programmer and author, Brodie has found creative ways to integrate his love of sports and games into his professional life. In 2003 he joined the professional poker circuit. He has finished in the money in five World Series of Poker events and six World Poker Tours. Until Black Friday, he played as a Full Tilt Poker pro under the screen name Quiet Lion. He appeared on NBC's game show Identity and played himself in the movie The Grand. Brodie currently resides in Kirkland, Washington.

It commonly represents the voiceless alveolar affricate , like the pronunciation of zz in \\"pizza\\". In the standard Iron dialect of Ossetic, it represents the voiceless alveolar sibilant fricative /s/. In other dialects, including Digoron, it has the same value as in Russian. In English, Tse is commonly romanized as ts. However, in proper names (personal names, toponyms, etc.) and titles it may also be rendered as c (which signifies the sound in Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Hungarian etc.), z (which signifies the sound in Italian and German), cz or tz. Its equivalent in the modern Romanian Latin alphabet is »õ. History Tse is thought to have come from the Hebrew letter ·π¢ade ‚ü®‚ü©, via the Glagolitic letter Tsi . The name of Tse in the Early Cyrillic alphabet is (tsi). New Church Slavonic and Russian spelling of the name is —Ü—ã. In Ukrainian and Belorussian its spelling is tse (—Ü–µ and —Ü—ç respectively). In the Cyrillic numeral system, Tse has a value of 900. Usage =Russian= It is the 24th (if Yo is included) letter of the Russian alphabet. It is used both in native Slavic words (and corresponds to Proto-Indo-European *k in certain positions) and in borrowed words: * as a match for the Latin in words of Latin origin, such as —Ü–∏—Ä–∫ (circus), —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä (centre), * for the German and , in words borrowed from German, such as —Ü–∏–Ω–∫ (Zink), –ø–ª–∞—Ü (Platz), * may correspond to Latin (before vowels), such as —Å—Ü–∏–Ω—Ç–∏–ª–ª—è _—Ü–∏_ —è (scintilla _ti_ on).

It commonly represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative , like the pronunciation of sh in sheep or the somewhat similar voiceless retroflex fricative in Russian. More precisely, the sound in Russian denoted by —à is commonly transcribed as a palatoalveolar fricative but is actually a voiceless retroflex fricative. It is used in every variation of the Cyrillic alphabet for Slavic and non-Slavic languages. In English, Sha is romanized as sh or as ≈°, the latter being the equivalent letter in the Latin alphabets of Czech, Slovak, Slovene, Serbian, Macedonian, Croatian, Latvian and Lithuanian. History Sha has its earliest origins in Phoenician Shin and is linked closely to Shin's Greek equivalent: Sigma (Œ£, œÉ, œÇ). (The similar form of the modern Hebrew Shin (◊©), which is probably the origin of this letter, derives from the same Proto-Canaanite source). Sha already possessed its current form in Saints Cyril and Methodius's Glagolitic alphabet. Most Cyrillic letter- forms were derived from the Greek, but as there was no Greek sign for the Sha sound (modern Greek uses simply \\"Œ£/œÉ/œÇ\\" to spell the sh-sound in foreign words and names), Glagolitic Sha was adopted unchanged. There is a possibility that Sha was taken from the Coptic alphabet, which is the same as the Greek alphabet but with a few letters added at the end, including one called \\"shai\\" (œ¢œ£) which somewhat resembles both sha and shcha (–©, —â) in appearance. Use in mathematics –® has the distinction of being the most common Cyrillic letter internationally used in mathematics (–ª is used much less): In algebraic geometry, the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group of an Abelian variety A over a field K is denoted –®(A/K), a notation first suggested by J.

The digits are usually ranked with the 1 as \\"ace\\" as the highest value, followed by 0 as \\"10\\", down to 2 as the lowest. Each player holds one bill, unseen by the other players. The objective is to guess how often a particular digit appears among all the bills held by all the players. Each guess or bid must be higher in quantity, or equal in quantity but higher in value, than the previous bid. The round ends when all the other players challenge a bid. The game is similar in structure to Liar's dice. Gameplay Usually the game is played with random bills obtained from the cash register. Each player takes a dollar bill and looks at its serial number without letting any other players see it. The starting player makes an opening bid on how many of a particular digit appears across all serial numbers held by the group. For example, if the first player bids three 6s, he is predicting there are at least three 6s among all the players including himself. The next player can bid a higher number at that level (three 7s), any number at a higher level (four 5s), or challenge the bid. The game continues clockwise around the table until a particular bid is challenged by every other player. If the challenge is correct, and the total number of the digit on all the bills is lower than the bid, the bidder loses a dollar to each of the other players. If the challenge is incorrect, the bidder wins a dollar from each player.

His television roles include playing Rear Admiral Albert \\"Al\\" Calavicci in Quantum Leap (1989‚Äì1993) and Brother Cavil in the Sci Fi Channel revival of Battlestar Galactica (2004‚Äì2009). Following his roles on Quantum Leap and Battlestar Galactica, Stockwell appeared at numerous science fiction conventions. Biography =1936‚Äì1950: Early life and career beginnings= Robert Dean Stockwell was born March 5, 1936 in the North Hollywood section of Los Angeles, California, and grew up between there and New York City. Stockwell was born into a family of entertainers. He is the younger son of Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Stockwell and Harry Stockwell, an actor and lyric baritone singer in New York productions of Carousel and Oklahoma! as well as the voice of Prince Charming in Disney's film Snow White.https://seniorcitylocal.com/celebrating- seniors-dean-stockwell-is-81/ His elder brother was television and film actor Guy Stockwell. His stepmother, Elizabeth Veronica Stockwell, was an actress, comedian, singer, and toe dancer in burlesque and theater in Northern America and New York. Stockwell's father was appearing on Broadway in Oklahoma!, when he heard about a play, Innocent Voyage by Paul Osborne, that was looking for child actors. As a result, Stockwell's mother took their two sons down to audition. Both boys were successful. Stockwell's part was small and the play only had a short run, but it led to a contract with MGM. The studio cast Stockwell in a small role in The Valley of Decision (1945), a popular melodrama. Producer Joe Pasternak gave him a bigger part in Anchors Aweigh (1945) alongside Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, in which Stockwell played the nephew of Kathryn Grayson.Dorothy McGuire Set for 'White Collar Girl': Dorothy Stone, Member of Theatrical Family, Cast in 'With All My-Heart' Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 3 May 1944: A10. The film was popular and MGM put him in a key role in The Green Years (1946), as Robert Shannon, an Irish Catholic orphan who grows up in a Scottish Presbyterian household. It was a huge hit.\\"60 Top Grossers of 1946\\", Variety 8 January 1947 p8 He also made a brief appearance in the MGM school room during the chase sequence of Abbott and Costello in Hollywood (1945). 20th Century Fox borrowed him for Home Sweet Homicide (1946) with Peggy Ann Garner where he was billed fourth. He co- starred with Wallace Beery in The Mighty McGurk (1947) at MGM, a remake of The Champ (1931) which Beery had made previously with Jackie Cooper. He also had the lead in the short A Really Important Person (1947). Stockwell had supporting roles in The Arnelo Affair (1947), The Romance of Rosy Ridge (1947) (playing Janet Leigh's brother), and Song of the Thin Man (1947), billed fourth as the son of William Powell and Myrna Loy's characters. Stockwell later said, \\"I have very positive feelings regarding both of them, they were very sweet people, especially Myrna Loy. And that cute little dog, Asta. I liked that little dog.\\" Nevertheless, Stockwell found the experience of being a child actor difficult overall, stating, \\"I didn't enjoy acting particularly, when I was young. I thought it was a lot of work. There were a few films that I enjoyed, they were comedies, they were not important films, weren't very successful, so I was always pretty much known as a serious kid. I got those kind of roles and I didn't care for them very much.\\" Fox borrowed him again to play Gregory Peck's son in Gentleman's Agreement (1947), a film which Stockwell \\"didn't like doing at all, because it was so serious. In other words, when I would find out I was going to do another movie, my mother would always bring that news to me, and the first question that I would always ask was, 'Is there a crying scene in the movie?' And there almost always was.\\" He played an orphaned runaway longing to go to sea in Deep Waters (1948). He was then borrowed by RKO Pictures to play the title role in The Boy with Green Hair (1948) directed by Joseph Losey, a notorious flop for the Dore Schary regime. Stockwell said that \\"during the production, I did feel that I was part of something that meant something to me, it was important.\\" Back at Fox, he was cast as Lionel Barrymore's grandson and Richard Widmark's prot√©g√© in Down to the Sea in Ships (1949), before supporting Margaret O'Brien at MGM in The Secret Garden (1949), a box office disappointment.. Stockwell later described the picture as \\"More crying scenes! And temper tantrums! But I enjoyed very much working with Margaret, she was a very talented little actress.\\" In MGM's popular Stars in My Crown (1950), which he did not enjoy doing, he was billed third after Joel McCrea and Ellen Drew. Stockwell was top billed in The Happy Years, which lost a considerable amount of money for the studio, but then played the title role in Kim (1950) alongside Errol Flynn and Paul Lukas, a big commercial success.Deal for James Stewart as 'Harvey' Star on Foot; Shearer Return Pending Schallert, Edwin.

In 1951 he appeared in a lead role alongside Joel McCrea in a Western at Universal, Cattle Drive (1951). =1952‚Äì1968: Adult career and hiatus= Stockwell graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, and attended the University of California, Berkeley for a year before dropping out. \\"I was unhappy and could not get along with people,\\" he later said. During his time at the UC Berkeley, Stockwell immersed himself in music and wrote several small compositions. Stockwell took a number of years off and resumed his acting career as an adult in 1956. He guest-starred on shows such as Front Row Center, Matinee Theatre, Schlitz Playhouse, The United States Steel Hour, Climax!, Men of Annapolis, Cimarron City, General Electric Theater, and Wagon Train. He had a support role in a Western, Gun for a Coward (1957) and the lead role in a low-budget teen melodrama, The Careless Years (1957), the feature directorial debut of Arthur Hiller. It was made for Bryna Productions, the company of Kirk Douglas. Stockwell signed a five-year deal with the company but this was the only film he made for them. In 1957, he starred as Judd Steiner in the Broadway adaptation of Compulsion, based on the Leopold and Loeb story. He later reprised his role in the 1959 film version. He and his Compulsion co-stars Orson Welles and Bradford Dillman shared the 1959 Cannes Film Award for Best Actor.

A9 is based in Palo Alto, California, with teams in Bangalore, Beijing, Dublin, Ia»ôi, Munich and Tokyo. A9 has development efforts in areas of product, cloud, visual search, augmented reality, advertising technology and community question answering. History A9 was created by Amazon.com in 2003 as an independent company aimed at producing technology for search and advertising. They moved into the building previously used by the DEC Systems Research Center in Palo Alto, California. One purpose of A9.com was to leverage algorithms, and the name was chosen as a numeronym to represent that word (i.e. 'A' + 9 other letters). The office was in Silicon Valley, near Stanford University. Under the direction of its first president, Udi Manber, A9 focused on several areas, including the A9.com destination website, product search, and a search advertising platform. Some early A9 services such as \\"search inside the book\\" continued, while others have been discontinued. The A9 search engine powers product search for Amazon.com and several other eCommerce retailers. In February 2006, Manber was replaced by David L. Tennenhouse as president. In September 2006, William Stasior, one of A9's founders and a former AltaVista and Amazon.com executive, was named president. In June 2009, A9 acquired SnapTell, which developed smartphone- based visual search applications. Stasior left in October 2012 to join Apple Inc. to work on Siri. Brian Pinkerton, who had developed WebCrawler in the 1990s, became general manager of A9 in 2012. In 2019, The Wall Street Journal revealed that Amazon had changed its search algorithm to favor more profitable products, Amazon took down the A9.com site and pointed the domain name to Amazon's home page. Past projects =A9.com search portal= A9.com originally operated a search portal, along with an A9 toolbar, which was first demonstrated on April 14, 2004. The service featured some innovative design elements, allowing users to choose from over 400 sources to search and view results in separate columns grouped by source. In addition to web search results, users could get product search results from Amazon, encyclopedia results from Wikipedia, movie information from IMDb, and others, starting in September 2004. Web search results were provided by different search engines over time. The search portal functionality was discontinued in 2008. =Open Search= A9 developed a protocol called OpenSearch that enabled the \\"plug-in\\" search source functionality from the A9.com portal. The original specification, OpenSearch 1.0, was released in March 2005. A9 made the protocol freely available through a Creative Commons license. OpenSearch is now maintained by the OpenSearch.org community. =BlockView= A9 developed the first service that allowed users of maps and \\"yellow pages\\" (a telephone directory) to view buildings at street level. Called BlockView, the service was announced in January 2005. Within a year, the service included images for 24 US cities. Both BlockView and maps (as well as support for the A9 tool bar) were discontinued in September 2006. =Clickriver= In November 2006, A9 announced Clickriver, an advertising program that let third parties place advertisements on Amazon.com pages. Clickriver focused primarily on products and services that complemented Amazon's own offerings. For example, if a customer viewed a television on Amazon, a Clickriver ad might offer installation services in his or her local area. Clickriver was discontinued in 2010, replaced by other Amazon advertising programs. = Community question answering = A9 operated Askville, a community-based question-and-answer site first tested in December 2006. Service began in November 2007. Compared with other question-and-answer sites, Askville focused more on social interaction, allowing users to follow other users as well as track specific topics. On October 25, 2013, Askville was shut down. =Cloud search= CloudSearch is a managed Amazon Web Services service that makes client data searchable. For example, a business that wanted to allow customers to search their catalog could upload the catalog entries to CloudSearch and then route search requests from their application or web site to the service. CloudSearch instances could be brought online as data or traffic volume demanded. Sites using CloudSearch included SmugMug, and Sage Bionetworks. In March 2014, Amazon moved away from using A9 for CloudSearch to technology based on Apache Solr. Recent projects =Product search= A9 continued to develop and operate the service that provides search on all nine Amazon.com sites, as well as other retail sites owned by Amazon such as Endless.com, Javari.de, and Audible.com. In addition, A9 search is also used by other retailers, such as Marks & Spencer,\\"Marks & Spencer Launches Website in Collaboration with Amazon,\\" Computer Weekly, March 23, 2007. that license the Amazon retail platform for their online presence. A9 provided the \\"search inside the book\\" capability for Amazon.Gary Price, \\"Amazon Debuts New Book Search Tool,\\" Search Engine Watch, October 26, 2003 Announced in 2003, this service allows customers to search through the full text of hundreds of thousands of books. This feature is available both for searching individual books and for the entire book catalog. =Visual search= The visual search group at A9 created mobile applications that recognize objects and allow users to find these products on Amazon.com. Their first augmented reality app, Flow, provided both object and barcode recognition. It was released in 2011. A9 visual search technology powers features to let customers search for certain products (such as shoes) by shape, and find visually similar items on Amazon.com, Zappos.com, Endless.com, and other retail sites. =Advertising technology= A9's advertising technology group began delivering sponsored link advertisements on the Amazon.com retail Web site in 2003 and continued to manage this program for Amazon properties.

He was an alumnus of both Mount Allison University and the University of British Columbia with degrees in science. MacLean left farming to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, serving from 1939‚Äì1947 and achieving the rank of Wing Commander. MacLean's bomber was shot down, and he evaded capture in Nazi-occupied Europe with the help of the Belgian escape-line Com√®te with Andr√©e De Jongh. MacLean returned to Prince Edward Island after the war, and ran for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate, but was defeated in the 1945 and 1949 federal elections. He was first elected to Parliament in a 1951 by-election and held his seat continuously until he left federal politics in 1976. MacLean served in the cabinet of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker as Minister of Fisheries from 1957 until the government's defeat in the 1963 election. In 1976, MacLean was persuaded to leave federal politics and take the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island which had languished in opposition for a decade. On 8 November 1976, MacLean was elected to the provincial legislature in a by-election. MacLean led the party to victory in 1979, and formed a government that emphasized rural community life, banned new shopping malls and instituted a Royal Commission to examine land use and sprawl. His government cancelled the province's participation in the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in New Brunswick. On 17 August 1981, MacLean announced his intention to resign as premier upon the election of a new party leader. MacLean retired as premier on 17 November 1981, when James Lee was sworn-in as his successor and did not run in the 1982 provincial election. He returned to the family farm that he redeveloped for low-intensity blueberry farming. A respected steward of the land and of rural communities, MacLean was a committed Presbyterian of Scottish descent. In 1991, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He died in Charlottetown on February 15, 2000.

The Norwegian band In the Woods... was one of the first bands commonly viewed as pagan metal. Metal Hammer author Marc Halupczok wrote that Primordial's song \\"To Enter Pagan\\" from the band's demo \\"Dark Romanticism\\" contributed to defining the genre.  Characteristics  Pagan metal is \\"more of an idea than a genre\\" and consequently bands tend to be \\"wildly different\\" from one another. Bassist Jarkko Aaltonen of the band Korpiklaani notes that bands singing about \\"Vikings or other ancient tribes of people are all labelled as pagan\\", regardless of whether they use folk instruments.Jarkko Aaltonen of Korpiklaani, quoted in Wiederhorn 2009, p. 63 Heri Joensen expressed a similar description of pagan metal as bands that sing about \\"pre- Christian, European traditions, be they historical or mythological\\" and notes that it is \\"musically extremely diverse because it is more about the lyrics than the music\\".Heri Joensen of T√Ωr, quoted in Wiederhorn 2009, p. 64 Some bands are known to be \\"sprightly and spirited\\" while others are \\"bleak and doomy\\". Vocal styles range from \\"melodic chanting to unearthly growling\\" and while some acts sing in their native language, others sing in English. Pagan metal bands are often associated with Viking metal and folk metal. Bands such as Moonsorrow and Kampfar have been identified as fitting within all three of those genres.  History  Led Zeppelin and Manowar had already explored pagan themes in the 1970s and 1980s though pagan metal bands share few if any similarities, preferring instead to credit the influence of bands such as Bathory, Enslaved, Amorphis, and Skyclad. Bathory and Enslaved are also known as Viking metal bands while Amorphis and Skyclad are also known as folk metal bands. Jarkko Aaltonen notes that Black Sabbath \\"was quite pagan\\" as well but of \\"the current metal scene\\", he credits Skyclad as starting \\"the mix of traditional folk-rock music with mythology-concentrated lyrics\\". Chrigel Glanzmann of Eluveitie similarly credits Skyclad as the first pagan metal band, remarking that the band had mixed heavy metal music with Celtic folk music \\"in a way that was really inspiring\\".Chrigel Glanzmann of Eluveitie, quoted in Wiederhorn 2009, p. 63 The author Ian Christe has also identify Skyclad as the pioneers of pagan metal. In contrast, Heri Joensen credits Bathory as the first pagan metal act instead, noting that Bathory had gotten \\"tired of the childishness of satanic lyrics, so they added some cultural weight by going to Nordic mythology\\". Alan A. Nemtheanga of Primordial remarks that one \\"can see the formation of pagan metal\\" in Bathory's 1988 album Blood Fire Death. He also contends that Bathory \\"were copying Manowar, which most people don't like to admit\\".Alan A. Nemtheanga of the band Primordial, quoted in Wiederhorn 2009, p. 64 Mathias Nyg√•rd of Turisas identified Amorphis as the first pagan metal band for playing \\"a huge role in guiding us in the direction we are now\\".Mathias Nyg√•rd of Turisas, quoted in Wiederhorn 2009, p. 64. In April 2008, performers on the folk and pagan metal festival Paganfest were subject to accusations of being neo-Nazis and fascists from the Berliner Institut f√ºr Faschismusforschung. Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow and Heri Joensen of T√Ωr issued a joint video statement to refute these accusations, noting that \\"one of the biggest issues seems to be that we use ancient Scandinavian symbols in our imagery like the S in the Moonsorrow logo and the T in the T√Ωr logo [even though] that is how the S and the T runes have been written for thousands of years\\". Moonsorrow has also issued a written statement in response to the controversy while T√Ωr notes on their official website that they \\"got the idea for the rune logo\\" from the Black Sabbath album of the same name. Other pagan metal bands such as Skyforger have also disassociated themselves from Nazism, fascism or racism. Skyforger went as far as to add the words 'No Nazi Stuff Here!' on the back of their album covers. As of 2009, the genre has become something of a phenomenon. Mikael Karlbom of Finntroll feels that pagan metal has become something of a trend.Mikael Karlbom of Finntroll, quoted in Wiederhorn 2009, p. 62 Jarkko Aaltonen of Korpiklaani expresses a similar opinion and laments the number of people \\"jumping on a bandwagon\\". Johan Hegg of Amon Amarth has distanced his band from the trend, stating that \\"We don‚Äôt really see ourselves as one of those bands doing pagan folklore music.\\"Interview with Johan Hegg of Amon Amarth, Part Three at The Norse Mythology Blog.

He sought throughout his life to introduce new approaches to music.  Biography  Toch was born in Leopoldstadt, Vienna, into the family of a humble Jewish leather dealerIntroduction to the Dover edition, The Shaping Forces in Music, Ernst Toch, Dover Publications, 1977. when the city was at its 19th-century cultural zenith. He studied philosophy at the University of Vienna, medicine at Heidelberg and music at the Hoch Conservatory (1909‚Äì1913) in Frankfurt.Peter Cahn: Das Hoch'sche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main (1878‚Äì1978), Frankfurt am Main: Kramer, 1979 His main instrument was the piano, and he was a pianist of real stature, performing to acclaim throughout much of western Europe. Much of his writing was intended for the piano. Toch continued to grow as an artist and composer throughout his adult life, and in America came to influence whole new generations of composers. His first compositions date from c. 1900 and were pastiches in the style of Mozart (quartets, 1905 album verses for piano). His first quartet was performed in Leipzig in 1908, and his sixth (Opus 12, 1905) in the year 1909. In 1909, his Chamber Symphony in F major (written 1906) won the Frankfurt/Main Mozart prize. From this time onwards, Toch dedicated himself to being a full-time composer. He won the Mendelssohn prize for composition in 1910. In 1913, he was appointed lecturer of both piano and composition at the College of Music in Mannheim. After winning a further five major prizes for his works, he served four years in the army on the Italian Front during World War I. In 1916, he married Lilly Zwack, the daughter of a banker. After World War I, he returned to Mannheim to compose, developing a new style of polyphony. He received his Ph.D. degree from Heidelberg University in 1921. He then taught on the faculty of the Mannheim Conservatory where one of his pupils was Hugo Chaim Adler. Following Hitler's seizure of power in 1933, Toch went into exile, first to Paris and then London, where he wrote film scores. In 1935, he accepted an invitation from the New School for Social Research to go to New York City. He could, however, only secure his living in California by composing film music for Hollywood. Unlike his colleague Erich Wolfgang Korngold, however, Toch never got much attention in the industry and was rarely top-billed. His score for the chase scene in Shirley Temple's 1937 Heidi perhaps remains his best-known piece of film music. During his residence in California, he was a professor at the University of Southern California, where he taught both music and philosophy. He was also a guest lecturer at Harvard University. He wrote a book on music theory, The Shaping Forces in Music (1948). From 1950 on, he composed seven symphonies, the third of which (Opus 75, 1954) received the Pulitzer Prize three years later. In these later works, he returned to the late Romantic style of his early years. In 1958, he received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Grand Merit Cross). He died in Santa Monica, California, and was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. He is the grandfather of authors Lawrence Weschler and Toni Weschler.  Work  His works often exhibit a humorous aspect (Bunte Suite (1929)). In 1930 he invented \\"Gesprochene Musik,\\" the idiom of the \\"spoken chorus\\". His most performed work is the Geographical Fugue or Fuge aus der Geographie, which he himself regarded as an unimportant diversion. He wrote music for films, symphonies, chamber music, chamber operas. He also wrote books dealing with musical theory: Melodielehre (1923) and The Shaping Forces in Music (1948).

He is widely regarded as being Canada's pre-eminent musician, from the 1920s through the 1950s. His contributions to the development of music in Canada were sustained and varied, as conductor, performer, composer, administrator, lecturer, adjudicator, writer, humourist, and statesman. Biography =Early life and education (1893‚Äì1914)= Ernest Alexander Campbell MacMillan was born in Mimico (Etobicoke), Ontario. His first musical influences were his parents. From a very young age, he became fascinated while watching his mother play piano and decided to learn music. His father, who was a minister at St. Enoch‚Äôs Presbyterian Church, bought an organ for a new house the family moved to in 1898. The house had an adjoined drawing room and study room, with enough space for both an organ and piano. Thereafter, Macmillan was officially hooked. Macmillan started studying the organ at the age of 8 with Arthur Blakely. A child prodigy, he gave his first organ recital at the age of ten. His talents astonished the public and critics alike in 1904 when he performed in the \\"Festival of Lillies\\", which \\"firmly established him a prodigy\\". 4000 people were known to attend. Moreover, he was the appointed organist at St. Enoch‚Äôs, which gave him a sense of importance and great experience in accompanying singers. Between 1908 and 1910, MacMillan held his first professional appointment as an organist and choirmaster in Toronto at Knox (Presbyterian) Church. In 1910 he had his first official organ recital. After that, he performed elsewhere in Toronto until 1914. He earned the Associateship and Fellowship diplomas of the Royal College of Organists, and from 1911 to 1914 studied modern history at the University of Toronto, earning a BA. He was a member of the Canadian fraternity, Phi Kappa Pi. =Internment in Germany (1914‚Äì1919)= Gala performance of The Mikado at the Ruhleben internment camp MacMillan traveled to Paris in the spring of 1914 and began to study piano privately with Th√©r√®se Chaigneau. He was visiting Bayreuth, Germany, to attend performances of the Bayreuth Festival, when the First World War began in August, following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28. MacMillan was initially detained by the German Police, and then imprisoned as an enemy alien, as Canada had declared war on Imperial Germany on August 5. MacMillan was subsequently interned for the duration of the War at Ruhleben, a British civilian detention camp, located on the site of a former horse racing track, on the outskirts of Berlin. During this period, he became a prominent member of the Ruhleben Musical Society and directed performances of The Mikado (with orchestra) and a pantomime version of Cinderella. MacMillan transcribed the music for the former from memory with the help of four other musicians, including Benjamin Dale. Among those attending these performances was James W. Gerard, the United States Ambassador to Germany. MacMillan was also a member of the Ruhleben Drama Society and acted in productions of Othello, Twelfth Night, and The Importance of Being Earnest.Hart, Harold B. \\"Life in Ruhleben ‚Äì Stories of Returned Civil Prisoners\\", The Scotsman, 9 January 1918, pp. 5 and 11. MacMillan gave lectures on each of the nine symphonies of Beethoven; at the end of each lecture, MacMillan and Dale would perform a four hand piano arrangement of the symphony under discussion.Nevins, Maureen (1994). Sir Ernest MacMillan (1893‚Äì1973): Portrait of a Canadian Musician, Ruhleben. Library and Archives Canada (electronic collection). Retrieved 2011-09-12. MacMillan was later interviewed about his experiences as an internee at Ruhleben, as part of a series of CBC interviews with Canadian First World War veterans.\\"Sir Ernest MacMillan Recalls Being a POW\\", CBC Radio Career = As a conductor = Ernest MacMillan in 1941 in Toronto Upon return to Canada in 1919, MacMillan was appointed organist and choirmaster in Toronto at the Timothy Eaton Memorial Church. He was especially known there for his performances of Handel‚Äôs Messiah and Brahms' Requiem His career as a conductor truly began when he conducted a performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion in the Timothy Eaton Memorial Church in 1923. MacMillan conducted annual performances of this work for the next 30 years. Another annual tradition Macmillan initiated during his career includes the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir‚Äôs Christmas-time performance of Handel‚Äôs Messiah. Throughout his time with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, MacMillan accomplished many of the major achievements of his conducting career. His authority as a composer influenced some major changes within the orchestra. During the Depression, he changed the concert times from 5pm to a more \\"evening hour\\". As many theatre musicians were out of work during the Depression era, MacMillan hired them to play in these evening concerts on a regular basis. As a result, MacMillan was able to select much more ambitious repertoire for this stronger performing force, as well as lengthening its season, and increased their number of concerts. MacMillan tried to make concerts fun and entertaining. The Christmas Box Symphony Concerts were a great example of this. Not only did MacMillan conduct, but he dressed up as Santa Claus and had the audience participate by singing along. He also \\"appeared in overalls with a monkey wrench for a baton to conduct Alexander Mosolov's Iron Foundry\\". The entry of Canada into WWII proved to be \\"a difficult period\\", but it was during the post-war years that his conducting was regaled as being \\"the most successful in the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's history\\". MacMillan innovations in his repertoire changed yet again. He included Canadian music, as well as works by Western composers B√©la Bart√≥k, and Dmitri Shostakovich. During WWII he also gained fame as a guest conductor in the United States. He conducted many Hollywood Bowl concerts, and the National Broadcasting Company Symphony Orchestra in NYC. In Canada, he guest conducted the Orchestre symphonique de Montr√©al and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. By the end of the 1940s, he conducted the Vancouver Symphony on 45 different occasions, and 25 different occasions in Montreal. MacMillan also toured Australia for three months and conducted 30 concerts in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Later in his career (1948‚Äì1953), MacMillan introduced Canada to entirely new prospects of recording and broadcasting. A good number of performances he conducted were recorded for Beaver Records, and were also broadcast nationally by CBC Radio. However, his silence over the Symphony Six issue prompted criticism. = As a composer = While a prisoner in Ruhleben, MacMillan wrote what is seen to be his most significant composition, titled String Quartet in C Minor. Influenced by the \\"war-time style and themes\\", the first performance of this piece was heard on February 8, 1925, by the Hart House String Quartet, and was conducted by MacMillan himself. Although MacMillan's composing abilities were much praised during this performance, he stated composition was not his main preoccupation; he preferred conducting to composing. Nevertheless, not only did the musical language of the 19th century romantic period influence MacMillan , but he was also interested in Folklore music. In 1927, he traveled alongside Marius Barbeau to the Nass River region of British Columbia to \\"hear, record and notate music of the Tsimshian People\\". As a result, he composed Three Songs of the West Coast, arranged for voice and piano. MacMillan composed less during his commitment to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Still, he managed to compose Scottish and French songs for the ballad opera \\"Prince Charming\\". In addition, he composed Te Deum Landamus in E Minor (1936) and Song of Deliverance (1944), both choral works. His only work composed strictly for the organ was named Cort√®ge acad√©mique. In 1953, he was asked to both compose and perform it at the University College in Toronto. Apart from composing his own works, MacMillan made arrangements of works by composers such as Bach, Beethoven, Handel, and Tchaikovsky, all of whom he said had great influence on his style. Both Canadian and US orchestras have performed his orchestra arrangement of Bach's Prelude and Fugue in C Minor. = As a performer = MacMillan became well known in Toronto music circles after he first started giving performances in his earlier career. Upon returning to Canada after the war, MacMillan started off his later career as a performer by giving 5 organ recitals commissioned by the Canadian Academy of Music from November 1919 to March 1920. In addition, he gave recitals at the Timothy Eaton Memorial Church after each Sunday service. MacMillan also gave \\"all Bach recitals\\" which attracted members of the congregation and Toronto musicians. CBC Radio in the 1920s helped to heighten MacMillan‚Äôs talent as a performer. Thus, he became acknowledged as far west as Vancouver. He was frequently asked to perform there, as well in the United States. at the 1935 Convention of the Royal College of Organists in Toronto. In the early 1940s, MacMillan formed \\"The Canadian Trio\\". Alongside musicians Zara Nelsova (cellist) and Kathleen Parlow (violinist), MacMillan often performed in Toronto and occasionally elsewhere. Amazingly, they once performed Beethoven‚Äôs Triple Concerto in C Major with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra at Massey Hall. In addition, MacMillan started \\"The Canadian Duo\\" with Kathleen Parlow; their performances were broadcast on CBC Radio as well. MacMillan gave 100 concerts and recitals between the 1920s and 1950s. He eventually stopped performing due to his other responsibilities as a conductor, composer and an educator. = As an educator = Throughout his professional life, MacMillan put a strong emphasis on music education, and \\"contributed to the foundations of the development of music in Canada.\\" In the year 1919, MacMillan was selected for a staff position at the Canadian Academy of Music, even though he had little training in teaching. Regardless, he taught theory, harmony, counterpoint, piano and organ. Furthermore, MacMillan was sent to lead examination tours at McGill University in Southern Ontario, and in various parts of the west coast on the Academy‚Äôs behalf. Eventually, MacMillan was appointed the Dean of the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto. He made many valuable contributions and innovations during his tenure with their music department. MacMillan then established a conservatory choir in 1927, because he felt that the vocal students \\"needed experience in choral singing\\". MacMillan also started the first opera classes at the conservatory in 1920, with performances of Hansel and Gretel, The Sorcerer, Dido and Aeneas and Hugh the Drover. Amazingly enough, MacMillan also improved the library, made improvements to the colleges‚Äô sight reading/ear tests, and prepared teaching materials which include \\"The Modern Piano Student\\" in 1931 and \\"On the Preparation of Ear Tests\\" in 1938. MacMillan was also very interested in the education of young people. He worked in Children's concerts and Secondary School concerts, which were presented by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. To enrich children's musical experience, MacMillan introduced a series called \\"Music for Young Folk\\" in 1942. Focusing on all primary, junior and senior levels, the program ran for 45 minutes with soloists accompanied by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Alongside composing, conducting and performing, MacMillan additionally became recognized internationally as an adjudicator starting in 1924, when he participated as an adjudicator for the Ottawa Music Festival. Forward to 1937, MacMillan became the first Canadian to adjudicate at the National Eisteddfod of Wales. Furthermore, he adjudicated at various festivals in Jamaica and the United States. =Honours and awards= For his \\"services to music in Canada\\", MacMillan was knighted in 1935 by King George V on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of Canada, R. B. Bennett. He became an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in 1938, and was also a recipient of the University of Alberta National Award in Music (1952). MacMillan also received the Canada Council Medal twice (1964 and 1973) for \\"outstanding achievements in the arts, humanities or social sciences\\". The University of Toronto's Faculty of Music received a new facility in 1964, in which they named their new theatre \\"The MacMillan Theatre\\". It holds up to 815 people, and the orchestra pit is large enough to fit 60 musicians. MacMillan's sons, Keith and Ross MacMillan, established the Sir Ernest MacMillan Memorial Foundation. To this day, the annual awards grow up to 10,000 dollars for \\"advanced education at a graduate level\\". Ernest MacMillan died in Toronto in 1973.

The Sir Ernest MacMillan Memorial Foundation  The Sir Ernest MacMillan Memorial Foundation (Fondation comm√©morative Sir Ernest MacMillan) was founded in 1984 by Sir Ernest's sons, Keith and Ross MacMillan, with a donation from the MacMillan family. Additional funds have been obtained through the generosity of other donors. The principal goal of the Foundation is to assist young musicians in their advanced education at the graduate level and in so doing commemorate a great Canadian and his unique career. In 1993, the Foundation played a major role in celebrating the centenary of Sir Ernest's birth. The Foundation encouraged many commemorative activities throughout the country, and collaborated with the Music Division of the former National Library of Canada in presenting at Roy Thompson Hall part of the Library's comprehensive MacMillan exhibit. The Foundation accepts donations from individuals and organizations interested in furthering the musical arts in Canada through its awards program.  Examples of MacMillan‚Äôs recordings and music  MacMillan conducted the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in two films produced by the National Film Board of Canada in 1945. In the first film, Toronto Symphony No. 1 the TSO performed Jamaican Rhumba, √Ä St. Malo (one of MacMillan's own compositions), and the overture to the opera Colas Breugnon. The film is 12 minutes in length. In the second film, Toronto Symphony No. 2, the TSO performed the third movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony in B Minor. The film is 9 minutes in length. In 1942, MacMillan conducted the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) in a recording of the orchestral suite The Planets, by Gustav Holst, recorded on 78 RPM phonograph records, for RCA Victor. During the Second World War, MacMillan conducted the TSO in a recording of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 2, by Sir Edward Elgar, recorded on 78 RPM phonograph records, for RCA Victor. This was reportedly the first recording of this work made outside of the United Kingdom. MacMillan conducted the TSO in a number of recordings with Canadian pianist Glenn Gould as soloist, playing works by various composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven. House constructed for Sir Ernest MacMillan in 1931 Sir Ernest MacMillan Home What is now referred to as the Sir Ernest MacMillan Home was constructed in 1931 for Ernest MacMillan and his wife in the Rosedale area of Toronto. The house is designated a heritage property.

After graduation from high school, Kiriyenko enrolled in the shipbuilding faculty at the Nizhny Novgorod (Gorky) Water Transport Engineers Institute, where his divorced father taught. Prime Minister Kiriyenko was appointed Prime Minister after the dismissal of Viktor Chernomyrdin's Second Cabinet. The State Duma, dominated by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, twice refused to confirm his appointment but president Boris Yeltsin nominated him a third time and Kiriyenko was confirmed. Along with Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais, Kirienko became known as one of \\"young reformists\\". They tried to improve the Russia's economy using International Monetary Fund credits, and it elevated the national debt to the level of $22.6 billion. Kirienko's cabinet defaulted the GKO-OFZ government bond coupons which led to devaluation of the Russian ruble and 1998 Russian financial crisis. Responsible for the crisis, the prime minister resigned on 23 August. =Libel lawsuit= In 2004 Novaya Gazeta printed seven articles by columnist Georgy Rozhnov, which accused Kiriyenko of embezzling US$4.8 billion of International Monetary Fund funds in 1998 when he was Prime Minister of Russia. The newspaper based the accusations on a letter allegedly written to Colin Powell and signed by US Congressmen Philip Crane, Mike Pence, Charlie Norwood, Dan Burton and Henry Bonilla and posted on the website of the American Defense Council. The newspaper went on to claim that Kiriyenko had used some of the embezzled funds to purchase real estate in the United States. The Moscow newspaper, The eXile, announced it had sent the letter as a prank, but later claimed that this had been a joke. In response, Kiriyenko sued Novaya Gazeta and Rozhnov for libel, and in passing judgement in favour of Kiriyenko the court ordered Novaya Gazeta to retract all publications relating to the accusations, and noted \\"Novaya gazeta‚Äôs content on the missing IMF funds include a great deal of unproven information\\" and also went on to say that the newspaper \\"is obliged to publish only officially proven information linking Mr Kiriyenko with embezzlement.\\" Union of Right Forces Sergey Kiriyenko (left) and Russian President left Together with Boris Nemtsov and Irina Hakamada, Kirienko formed the Union of Right Forces.

He said on 18 September 2006 while in Vienna, that the reactor in the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran should be operational by September 2007 and the plant itself will be active in November 2007. He advocated President Vladimir Putin's idea of creating an international system of uranium enrichment centers. A uranium enrichment center could be operational in Russia in 2007. Responding to a reporter's question, Kiriyenko said that the Bushehr power plant would not affect nuclear non-proliferation and that there was nothing preventing Iran-Russia energy cooperation. The Government of Russia planned to deliver nuclear fuel to the plant in March 2007. After a delay of some three years, Kiriyenko said 21 August 2010's arrival of nuclear fuel at Iran's Bushehr I marks \\"an event of crucial importance\\" that proves that \\"Russia always fulfills its international obligations.\\" Spent nuclear fuel from the plant will be sent back to Russia.

International human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have drawn attention to the actions of the human rights movement and designated members of it as prisoners of conscience, such as √ìscar El√≠as Biscet. In addition, the International Committee for Democracy in Cuba led by former heads of state V√°clav Havel of the Czech Republic, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar of Spain and Patricio Aylwin of Chile was created to support the civic movement. Cuban law limits freedom of expression, association, assembly, movement, and the press. Concerns have also been expressed about the operation of due process. According to Human Rights Watch, even though Cuba, officially atheist until 1992, now \\"permits greater opportunities for religious expression than it did in past years, and has allowed several religious-run humanitarian groups to operate, the government still maintains tight control on religious institutions, affiliated groups, and individual believers\\". Censorship in Cuba has also been at the center of complaints. According to the report of Human Rights Watch from 2017 the government continues to rely on arbitrary detention to harass and intimidate critics, independent activists, political opponents, and others. This report added that the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, an independent human rights group that lacks official authorization and is therefore considered illegal by the government, received more than 7,900 reports of arbitrary detentions from January through August 2016. This represents the highest monthly average of detentions in the past six years. Amnesty International's 2017‚Äì2018 Annual Report also noted more arbitrary detentions, discriminatory layoffs by state agencies and harassments in self-employment with the aim of making them silent in criticism. Regarding any progress in education, Amnesty International reported that advances in education were undermined by ongoing online and offline censorship. Cuba remained mostly closed to independent human rights monitors. Relating to arbitrary arrests and detentions the report added that human rights and political activists continued to be harassed, intimidated and arbitrarily detained in high numbers. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, a Cuban NGO not officially recognized by the state, recorded 5,155 arbitrary detentions in 2017, compared to 9,940 in 2016.  History  During Spanish colonization, the oppression of the indigenous populations was chronicled at length by clergyman Bartolom√© de las Casas. The subsequent transportation of African slaves to the island, which lasted over 300 years, led to British military intervention and a determination \\"to put a stop to these abuses\\".\\"Report from the British commissionary judge, Havana, to the Foreign secretary (Lord Stanley).\\" September 30, 1866. Thomas, Hugh. Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom. p.1050. Since Cuba achieved independence in 1902, successive Cuban governments have been criticised and condemned by various groups, both within Cuba and internationally, for human rights violations on the island. During the latter part of the Spanish colonial era in Cuba, human rights on the island became a particular international concern. After a visit to the region in 1898, U.S. Senator Redfield Proctor estimated that up to 200,000 Cubans had died from starvation and disease within \\"Spanish forts\\", essentially concentration camps.Harvard Rhetorical Society The concern was a contributory factor in garnering support for the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the U.S. After independence, and following a sustained period of instability, the 1924‚Äì33 government of Gerardo Machado proved to be authoritarian. Machado extended his rule until Fulgencio Batista led an uprising called the Revolt of the Sergeants, as part of a coup which deposed Machado in 1933. Batista then became the strongman behind a succession of puppet presidents until he was himself elected president in 1940. According to Hugh Thomas, the post-Machado period was marked by violent reprisals, mass lynchings and a deterioration towards corruption and gansterismo throughout the island.Hugh Thomas. Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom. p.388 From 1940, Cuba had a multiparty electoral system until Fulgencio Batista (President from 1940‚Äì1944) staged a coup with military backing on March 10, 1952. In 1958, Time magazine wrote: \\"Cuba's fanatic, poorly armed rebels last week tried to smash President Fulgencio Batista with the ultimate weapon of civilian revolutions: the general strike. ... Fulgencio Batista got ready for the strike by offering immunity to anyone who killed a striker and by threatening to jail any employer who closed shop.\\" During the strike, militants and youths stole guns, and threw bombs (one of which may have set up a gas-mains fire), after which some people were killed in clashes. The strike was short-lived: \\"With the upper hand, Batista drove boldly around the city while his cops proceeded to make their supremacy complete. When a patrol car radioed that it had clashed with rebels and had 'a dead man and a prisoner', the dispatcher ordered: 'Shoot him.' At midafternoon, cops burst into a boardinghouse, grabbed three young men who were leaders of Cuba's lay Catholic Action movement, which sympathizes with Castro. Two hours later their stripped, tortured and bullet-torn bodies were turned over to relatives. Total dead: 43.\\" In 1959, Fidel Castro and his forces succeeded in displacing Batista from power. At that time there were fundamental changes in the judicial and political process. During this transitional period there were some concerns voiced about due process.The Day After ‚Äî Cuba: His Brother's Keeper Foreign Policy archive.The End of the Rule of Law March 1959 Fidel Castro, by Robert E. Quirk 1993 The \\"Cuban National Reconciliation movement\\", a U.S.-based organisation that claims to act as a forum for discussing Cuban society, has detailed what it believes are complex variables when analysing human rights immediately after the revolution. In the 1960s, violent confrontations known as the Escambray Rebellion between the Cuban government and armed opposition were ongoing, but had declined by the early 1970s. The group asserts that by the time international human rights movements flourished in the 1970s, the most severe period of repression was over, making non-partisan retrospective assessments of the period difficult. The reconciliation movement also cite the difficulties in assessing accounts of abuses that are commonly split upon partisan lines. According to the group, Cuban exiles who were often the first to denounce the Cuban government, largely shared an anti-Communist ideology and overlooked violations committed by other regimes, whilst many left leaning observers did not give the claims of Cuban victims due consideration.Cuban National Reconciliation movement Task force report 2003 After coming to power in 1959, Fidel Castro's government built a highly effective machinery of repression, according to Human Rights Watch.

Within the first two months of the 1959, Castro's government executed more than 300 Batista officials, with Latin American historian Thomas E. Skidmore says that there had been 550 executions in the first six months of 1959. In an April 1961 UPI story, the agency stated that about \\"700 have died before Castro's firing squads\\" between 1959 and 1961. The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators ascertained that there had been 2,113 political executions between the years 1958‚Äì67, while British historian Hugh Thomas, stated in his study Cuba or the pursuit of freedom that \\"perhaps\\" 5,000 executions had taken place by 1970. According to Amnesty International, the total number of death sentences issued from 1959‚Äì87 was 237, of which all but 21 were actually carried out.When the State Kills: The Death Penalty v. Human Rights, Amnesty International Publications, 1989 The anti-Castro Archivo Cuba estimates that 4,000 people were executed in Cuba between 1959 and 2016. The Black Book of Communism estimated that between 15,000 and 17,000 people were executed by the state. The vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 revolution were policemen, politicians and informers for the Batista regime who were accused of crimes such as torture and murder, and their public trials and executions enjoyed widespread popular support among the Cuban population. Most scholars agree that those executed were probably guilty as charged, but their trials did not follow due process. The Cuban Government justified such measures on the grounds that the application of the death penalty in Cuba against war criminals and others followed the same procedure as the one previously followed by the Allies during the Nuremberg trials. Some Cuban scholars maintain that had the government not applied severe legislation against the torturers, terrorists, and other criminals employed by the Batista regime, the people themselves would have taken justice into their own hands.Raul Gomez Treto, \\"Thirty Years of Cuban Revolutionary Penal Law\\", Latin American Perspectives, Vol. 18, No. 2, Spring, 1991, pp. 114‚Äì125 = Refugees = According to the US government, some 1,200,000 Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States between 1959 and 1993, often by sea in small boats and fragile rafts. = Forced labor camps and abuse of prisoners = In 1987 a \\"Tribunal on Cuba\\" was held in Paris to present testimonies by former prisoners of Cuba's penal system to the international media. The gathering was sponsored by Resistance International and The Coalition of Committees for the Rights of Man in Cuba. The testimonies presented at the tribunal, before an international panel, alleged a pattern of torture in Cuba's prisons and \\"hard labor camps\\". These included beatings, biological experiments in diet restrictions, violent interrogations and extremely unsanitary conditions. The jury concurred with allegations of arbitrary arrests; sentencing by court martial with neither public audience nor defense; periods in hard labour camps without sufficient food, clothes and medical care; and the arrests of children over nine years old.Tribunal on Cuba Paris April 1986 The number of reported executions in Cuba declined during the 1970s and by the 1980s they were restricted to rare high-profile cases, notably the execution of General Arnaldo Ochoa in 1989. Ochoa, once proclaimed \\"Hero of the Revolution\\" by Fidel Castro, along with three other high-ranking officers, was brought to trial for drug trafficking. This offense carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, but Ochoa and the others were convicted of treason and promptly executed. Opponents of the Castro government outside of Cuba expressed skepticism about the legitimacy of Ochoa's arrest and execution. = Political abuse of psychiatry = Although Cuba has been politically connected to the Soviet Union since the United States broke off relations with Cuba shortly after the prime minister Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, few considerable allegations regarding the political abuse of psychiatry in this country emerged before the late 1980s. Americas Watch and Amnesty International published reports alluding to cases of possible unwarranted hospitalization and ill-treatment of political prisoners. These reports concerned the Gustavo Machin hospital in Santiago de Cuba in the southeast of the country and the major mental hospital in Havana. In 1977, a report on the alleged abuse of psychiatry in Cuba presenting cases of ill- treatment in mental hospitals going back to the 1970s came out in the United States. It presents grave allegations that prisoners end up in the forensic ward of mental hospitals in Santiago de Cuba and Havana where they undergo ill-treatment including electroconvulsive therapy without muscle relaxants or anaesthesia. The reported application of ECT in the forensic wards seems, at least in many of the cited cases, not to be an adequate clinical treatment for the diagnosed state of the prisoner‚Äîin some cases the prisoners seem not to have been diagnosed at all. Conditions in the forensic wards have been described in repulsive terms and apparently are in striking contrast to the other parts of the mental hospitals that are said to be well-kept and modern. In August 1981, the Marxist historian Ariel Hidalgo was apprehended and accused of \\"incitement against the social order, international solidarity and the Socialist State\\" and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. In September 1981, he was transported from State Security Headquarters to the Carb√≥-Servi√° (forensic) ward of Havana Psychiatric Hospital where he stayed for several weeks. Contemporary Cuba =Political repression= A 2009 report by Human Rights Watch concluded that \\"Ra√∫l Castro has kept Cuba‚Äôs repressive machinery firmly in place...since being handed power by his brother Fidel Castro.\\" The report found that \\"[s]cores of political prisoners arrested under Fidel continue to languish in prison, and Ra√∫l has used draconian laws and sham trials to incarcerate scores more who have dared to exercise their fundamental rights.\\" US government-funded Freedom House classifies Cuba as being \\"Not Free\\", and notes that \\"Cuba is the only country in the Americas that consistently makes Freedom House‚Äôs list of the Worst of the Worst: the World‚Äôs Most Repressive Societies for widespread abuses of political rights and civil liberties.\\" In the 2017 report of Human Rights Watch is written that independent journalists who publish information considered critical of the government are subject to smear campaigns and arbitrary arrests, as are artists and academics who demand greater freedoms. Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez assailed the Cuban thaw as a capitulation to the Castro's regime A 1999 Human Rights Watch report notes that the Interior Ministry's principal responsibility is to monitor the Cuban population for signs of dissent. In 1991 two new mechanisms for internal surveillance and control emerged. Communist Party leaders organized the Singular Systems of Vigilance and Protection (Sistema Unico de Vigilancia y Protecci√≥n, SUVP). Rapid Action Brigades (Brigadas de Acci√≥n Rapida, also referred to as Rapid Response Brigades, or Brigadas de Respuesta R√°pida) observe and control dissidents. The government also \\"maintains academic and labor files (expedientes escolares y laborales) for each citizen, in which officials record actions or statements that may bear on the person's loyalty to the revolution. Before advancing to a new school or position, the individual's record must first be deemed acceptable\\". The opposition movement in Cuba is a widespread collection of individuals and nongovernmental organizations, most of whom are working for the respect of individual rights on the island. Some of the best known Cuban members of the opposition include the Ladies in White (recipients of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought), Human Rights Center and Cuban community leader Jesus Permuy, Marta Beatriz Roque, and Nobel Peace Prize nominee and Sakharov Prize winner Oswaldo Pay√°, as well as √ìscar El√≠as Biscet, and Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez \\"Ant√∫nez.\\" On October 18, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department announced that the United States will impose new sanctions against Cuba following its poor human rights records and support of the Venezuelan government. Jos√© Daniel Ferrer's continued detention in particular was brought into notice in a different statement issued by the U.S. State Department. Ferrer who heads the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), has been kept in detention by the Cuban government without his whereabouts released. =Censorship= Cuba officially adopted the civil and political rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. One of the key principles in the declaration was the insistence on Freedom of expression and opinion. The Cuban constitution says that free speech is allowed \\"in keeping with the objectives of socialist society\\" and that artistic creation is allowed \\"as long as its content is not contrary to the Revolution\\". Cuba's ranking was on the bottom of the Press Freedom Index 2008 compiled by the Reporters Without Borders (RWB). Cuba was named one of the ten most censored countries in the world by the Committee to Protect Journalists. Books, newspapers, radio channels, television channels, movies and music are supposedly censored, although a lot of foreign media, particularly movies and music, have notably been heard and seen without any police interference. The media are operated under the supervision of the Communist Party's Department of Revolutionary Orientation, which \\"develops and coordinates propaganda strategies\\". Human rights groups and international organizations believe that these articles subordinate the exercise of freedom of expression to the state. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights assess that: \\"It is evident that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression under this article of the Constitution is governed by two fundamental determinants: on the one hand, the preservation and strengthening of the communist State; on the other, the need to muzzle any criticism of the group in power.\\"Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Report on Cuba Human rights group Amnesty International assert that the universal state ownership of the media means that freedom of expression is restricted. Thus the exercise of the right to freedom of expression is restricted by the lack of means of mass communication falling outside state control.CUBA: fundamental freedoms still under attack Amnesty Human Rights Watch states: \\"Refusing to recognize human rights monitoring as a legitimate activity, the government denies legal status to local human rights groups. Individuals who belong to these groups face systematic harassment, with the government putting up obstacles to impede them from documenting human rights conditions. In addition, international human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are barred from sending fact- finding missions to Cuba. It remains one of the few countries in the world to deny the International Committee of the Red Cross access to its prisons.\\"\\"Cuba\\". Human Rights Watch. Retrieved September 6, 2012. Yet, activists' networks like Eye on Cuba and Cubalog.eu have continued working with the intention to raise awareness about the true situation concerning human and civil rights on the \\"island of freedom\\" and appeal to Europe Union and its members to apply responsible approach to Cuba in their foreign policy. Financial support and legal representation is provided by foreign NGOs as part of the EU Cuba Network. A formal structure and system of reporting news not approved by the government was first attempted in 1993. The effort for an independent, uncensored news agency was spearheaded by Cuban human rights activist and then-President of Christian Democratic Movement Jesus Permuy. It formally began in May of that year as Members of Civic Democratic Action, an umbrella group of nearly twenty Castro opposition organizations, formed an alliance with the Independent Cuban Journalists Association. The effort ultimately failed. A Reporters Without Borders report as of October 2006 finds that Internet use is very restricted and under tight surveillance. Access is only possible with government permission and equipment is rationed. E-mail is monitored. See also Censorship in Cuba. Foreign journalists are systematically expelled from Cuba, e.g. notable journalists of New Left Gazeta Wyborcza, Anna Bikont and Seweryn Blumsztahn, were expelled in 2005. = Restrictions of assembly = Human Rights Watch states that \\"freedom of assembly is severely restricted in Cuba, and political dissidents are generally prohibited from meeting in large groups. Amnesty states that \\"All human rights, civil and professional associations and unions that exist today in Cuba outside the officialdom of the state apparatus and mass organizations controlled by the government are barred from having legal status. This often puts at risk the individuals who belong to these associations of facing harassment, intimidation or criminal charges for activities which constitute the legitimate exercise of the fundamental freedoms of expression, association and assembly.\\" The Cuban authorities only recognize a single national trade union centre, the Central de Trabajadores de Cuba (CTC), heavily controlled by the State and the Communist Party which appoints its leaders. Membership is compulsory for all workers. Before a worker can be hired, they must sign a contract in which they promise to support the Communist Party and everything it represents. The government explicitly prohibits independent trade unions, there is systematic harassment and detention of labor activists, and the leaders of attempted independent unions have been imprisoned. The right to strike is not recognized in law.\\"Is Cuba a 'Workers Paradise'?.\\" Cuba Verdad. Retrieved September 2012.\\"Independent Trade Unions In Cuba.\\" Cuba Verdad. Retrieved September 2012.\\"Violations of social and labor rights.\\" Cuba Verdad. Retrieved September 2012. Bans are enforced by \\"Rapid Brigades\\", consisting of members of the army and police in plain clothes, who beat and disperse any demonstrators. =Society= In 2001 an attempt was made by Oswaldo Pay√° Sardi√±as and others from the Christian Liberation Movement, operating as the Varela Project, to have a national plebiscite using provisions in the Constitution of Cuba which provided for citizen initiative. If accepted by the government and approved by public vote, the amendments would have established such things as freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of press, as well as starting private businesses. The petition was refused by the National Assembly and in response a referendum was held in support of socialism being a permanent fixture of the constitution, for which the government claimed 99% voter approval. Another important project is the establishment of the Assembly to Promote Civil Society. The Assembly to Promote Civil Society in Cuba is a coalition of 365 independent civil society groups with the stated aims of forming a democratic culture, developing a social movement, strengthening the Assembly's organization, communicating among groups to promote the civil society, using all available means to combat poverty and seeking the betterment of the community's life conditions, developing a true knowledge of Cuba's history, in all its dimensions: economic, social and political, undertaking activities and projects aimed at the protection and conservation of natural resources and the ecosystem, and promoting a true culture on labor rights.Sitio Oficial de la Asamblea para Promover la Sociedad Civil en Cuba The Assembly had its first meeting in May 2005. =Capital punishment= Cuba placed a moratorium on the use of capital punishment in 1999. However, an exception was made when, in 2003, three Cubans were executed for a ferry hijacking in which Cuban passengers and two young French female tourists were held at gunpoint. The hijackers were attempting to reach Florida, USA in order to seek asylum. No one was harmed in the incident but the gang held knives to the throats and threatened to kill them if the vessel was not given enough fuel to carry them to the United States. =Acts of repudiation= Human rights groups including Amnesty International have long been critical of what the Cuban authorities have termed \\"Acts of repudiation\\" (actos de repudio). These acts occur when large groups of citizens verbally abuse, intimidate and sometimes physically assault and throw stones and other objects at the homes of Cubans who are considered counter-revolutionaries. Human rights groups suspect that these acts are often carried out in collusion with the security forces and sometimes involve the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution or the Rapid Response Brigades. The level of violence of these acts have increased significantly since 2003.Amnesty International report 2006 =Notable prisoners of conscience= * In 1960, Armando Valladares was working at the Cuban Postal Savings Bank when agents of the Ministry of Communications handed him a card bearing a communist slogan and told him to put it on his worktable. The 23-year-old Valladares refused. Astonished, the agents asked him if he had anything against Castro. Valladares answered that if Castro was a communist, he did. Valladares was convicted on a charge of placing bombs in public places and was sentenced to thirty years in prison. His supporters contend that he was never part of the Batista police as alleged by Castro supporters (because Valladares was only 19 at the time of the revolution), and that his imprisonment was the result of his vocal opposition to the Castro government. Conservative author David Horowitz has called him a \\"Human Rights Hero.\\" Valladares claims to have been tortured and humiliated while he was on a hunger strike in order to protest against prison abuses; he claims the guards denied him water until he became delirious, and they proceeded to urinate in his mouth and on his face. Valladares was released from prison after serving twenty-two years of his sentence upon the intercession of France's Socialist President Fran√ßois Mitterrand. * In 1973, gay writer Reinaldo Arenas was sent to prison after being charged and convicted of 'ideological deviation' and for publishing abroad without official consent. He escaped from prison and tried to leave Cuba by launching himself from the shore on a tire inner tube. The attempt failed and he was re- arrested near Lenin Park and imprisoned at the notorious El Morro Castle alongside murderers and rapists. After escaping from Cuba, Arenas described the horrors he endured under the Cuban government in his autobiography Antes que anochezca (1992), English translation Before Night Falls (1993). * On August 28, 1998, a Havana court sentenced Reynaldo Alfaro Garc√≠a, a member of the Democratic Solidarity Party, to three years in prison for \\"spreading enemy propaganda\\" and \\"rumour-mongering\\". * Desi Mendoza, a Cuban doctor, was imprisoned for making statements criticizing Cuba's response to an epidemic of dengue fever in Santiago de Cuba which he alleged had caused several deaths. Dr. Mendoza had previously been fired from his job in a Cuban hospital three years earlier for establishing an independent medical association. He was later released due to ill-health, subject to his leaving the country. * √ìscar El√≠as Biscet, a medical doctor, has been sentenced to jail for 25 years for his non-violent, but vocal opposition to Castro. * In early 2003, dozens of persons, including independent journalists, librarians and other opponents of the Castro government were jailed after summary show trials, with some sentences in excess of 20 years, on the charge of receiving money from the United States in order to carry out anti-government activities. * An Amnesty International report, CUBA: fundamental freedoms still under attack from Amnesty International calls for the \\"Cuban authorities to release all prisoners of conscience immediately and unconditionally\\" and to \\"revoke all legislation that restricts freedom of expression, assembly and association, and to put a halt to all actions to harass and intimidate dissidents, journalists, and human rights defenders\\". * Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez was reported to have been released from prison in April 2007 after serving his full sentence of 17 years and 34 days for having, at the age of 25, shouted slogans against Fidel Castro. Garc√≠a Ant√∫nez was convicted of sabotage after authorities accused him of setting fire to sugar cane fields, sabotage, spreading \\"enemy propaganda\\", and being in illegal possession of a weapon. * Dr. Ariel Ruiz Urquiola, whom Amnesty International had declared \\"a prisoner of conscience\\" and demanded that he be released \\"immediately and without conditions\\". * On September 2, 2020, Article 19, Institute for War and Peace Reporting and Amnesty International urged the Cuban government to immediately release prisoner of conscience and independent journalist, Roberto Qui√±ones Haces. Following the trial in August 2019 and he was sentenced to one-year imprisonment for resistance and disobedience concerning his work as an independent journalist. = Travel and immigration = As of January 14, 2013, all Cuban government-imposed travel restrictions and controls have been abolished. Since that date, any Cuban citizen, with a valid passport, can leave the country at will, without let or hindrance from the Cuban authorities. Visa requirements for Cuban citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Cuba. In 2014, Cuban citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 61 countries and territories, ranking the Cuban passport 69th in the world. Persons holding dual Spanish and Cuban citizenships are now allowed to travel freely, using their Spanish passport in lieu of a visa for countries normally requiring a visa for the Cuban passport. Moreover, ever since that date, the Cuban government extended the allowable time abroad from 11 to 24 months, allowing Cubans who return within the 24-month time frame to retain their status and benefits of \\"Cuban Resident of the Interior\\". Should the citizen remain out of Cuba for more than 24 months, then his status would change to \\"Cuban Resident of the Exterior\\" and he would lose his privileges within. By this change, there is no longer such a thing as \\"illegal\\" or \\"unauthorized\\" travel, and therefore persons who leave Cuba via unconventional means (boats etc.) are no longer violating Cuban law, and therefore not subject to detention or imprisonment. Prior to January 13, 2013, Cuban citizens could not travel abroad, leave or return to Cuba without first obtaining official permission along with applying for a government issued passport and travel visa, which was often denied. Unauthorized travel abroad had sometimes resulted in criminal prosecution. It was common, in those days, that certain citizens who were authorized travel (primarily medical personnel and other professionals deemed essential to the country) were not permitted to take their children with them overseas. In the event that Cuban doctors defect to the United States when they are sent to a \\"mission\\" out of Cuba to any foreign country, any children left behind would not be allowed to join their defector parent for a minimum of ten years, even if they had received a foreign visa, and regardless of their age. Castro opposition leader Oswaldo Pay√° has been allowed to travel abroad to receive his Sakharov Prize, but Ladies in White was not. Even discussing unauthorized travel carried a six-month prison sentence. From 1959 through 1993, some 1.2 million Cubans (about 10% of the current population) left the island for the United States, often by sea in small boats and fragile rafts. In the early years, a number of those who could claim dual Spanish-Cuban citizenship left for Spain. Over time a number of Cuban Jews were allowed to emigrate to Israel after quiet negotiations; the majority of the 10,000 or so Jews who were in Cuba in 1959 have left. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Cubans now reside in a diverse number of countries, some ending up in countries of the European Union. A large number of Cubans live in Mexico and Canada. At times the exodus was tolerated by the Cuban government as a \\"release valve\\"; at other times the government has impeded it. Some Cubans left for economic reasons and some for political ones. Others emigrated by way of the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, which is blocked on the Cuban (land) side by barbed-wired fences and land mines. In 1995 the US government entered into an agreement with the Cuban government to resolve the emigration crisis that created the Mariel Boatlift of 1980, when Castro opened the docks to anyone who wanted to leave. The result of the negotiations was an agreement under which the United States was required to issue 20,000 visas annually to Cuban emigrants. This quota is rarely filled; the Bush administration refused to comply with the act, issuing only 505 visas to Cubans in the first six months of 2003. It also blocked some Cubans who have visas. On July 13, 1994, 72 Cubans attempted to leave the Island on a World War II era tugboat named the 13 de Marzo. In an attempt by the Cuban Navy to stop the tugboat, patrol boats were sent out to intercept the tug. Crewmen and survivors reported that the interception vessels rammed the tugboat and sprayed its passengers with high-pressure fire hoses, sweeping many overboard. The US Coast Guard reported that the interceptions in high seas have been characterized as violent confrontations with authorities and by the deaths of immigrants. According to the same authorities, the Cubans are taken to the US on speed boats by a network of criminals specialized in human trafficking, former drug traffickers, based in southern Florida which now find contraband of humans more lucrative than drugs. These criminals charge 8 to 12 thousand dollars per person, overcrowding the small vessels. The majority of those that attempt to emigrate are individuals that have relatives in the United States, others who do not qualify to be considered as legal immigrants in the US, or those who do not want to wait their turn in the annual quota, assigned under the migratory treaties for legal immigrants Since November 1966, the Cuban Adjustment Act provides automatic permanent residency for almost all Cubans arriving legally or illegally after one year and one day in the US. No immigrant from any other nation has this privilege. Controversy over this policy centers around the loss of Cuba's scientists, professionals, technicians and other skilled individuals, but it has also prompted concerns of a migratory crisis. At the end of the 2005 fiscal year which ended September 30, the US Coast Guard Service reported having intercepted 2,712 Cubans at sea, more than double the 1,225 reported in 2004 The figure for 2005 is the third highest of Cubans intercepted in the Florida straights during the last 12 years. The highest had been reported in 1993 with 3,656 and 1994 when over 30,000 Cubans emigrated illegally due to the so-called migratory crisis between the two countries. The 1994 and 1995 migratory accords signed between Havana and Washington, and which emerged due to the crisis in August 1994, are still in effect. These accords force the US to return all those intercepted at sea by US authorities to Cuba, except the cases in which political persecution can be proven to justify exile in the United States. The accords were designed to discourage those who would consider emigrating illegally by sea but the Bush administration has not complied with Washington's part of the agreements. Although the Coast Guard says that only 2.5 percent of the Cubans intercepted are granted political asylum, the public understanding, the public perception in Cuba and among the Cuban community in Miami, is not the same. And since that is not the perception, more and more people continue to illegally leave the island by sea causing fatal consequences. According to studies carried out by Cuban experts on the island, it is estimated that at least 15 percent of those that attempt to cross the sea die before reaching the US. However, figures of those fleeing other Latin American or Caribbean countries of origin compare similarly with those of Cuba. During the 2005 fiscal year, 3,612 Dominicans were picked up at high seas attempting to illegally reach the US (900 more than Cubans intercepted) and in 2004, 3,229 Haitians were also picked up (2,000 more than the 1,225 Cubans that fiscal year). The Brazilian daily O Globo published an article on illegal immigrants in the US, quoting official sources, pointing out that during the first semester of 2005, 27,396 Brazilians were stopped from illegally crossing US borders, an average of 4,556 per month and 152 a day. In 2004, a total of 1,160,000 foreigners, were stopped when attempting to illegally enter the US, 93 percent of them (close to 1,080,000) were Mexicans. =Education= Education in Cuba is normally free at all levels and controlled by the Ministry for Education. In 1961 the government nationalized all private educational institutions and introduced a state-directed education system. The system has been criticized for political indoctrination and for monitoring the political opinions of the students. Strong ideological content is present. The constitution states that educational and cultural policy is based on Marxism. =Healthcare= The Cuban government operates on national health system and assumes full fiscal and administrative responsibility for the health care of its citizens. The government prohibits any private alternatives to the national health system. In 1976, Cuba's healthcare program was enshrined in Article 50 of the revised constitution which states, \\"Everyone has the right to health protection and care\\". Healthcare in Cuba is also free. However, there is no right to privacy, or a patient's informed consent, or the right to protest or sue a doctor or clinic for malpractice. Moreover, the patient does not have right to refuse treatment (for example, a Rastafarian cannot refuse an amputation on grounds that his religion forbids it.) Many Cubans complain about politics in medical treatment and health care decision-making. After spending nine months in Cuban clinics, anthropologist Katherine Hirschfeld wrote \\"My increased awareness of Cuba‚Äôs criminalization of dissent raised a very provocative question: to what extent is the favorable international image of the Cuban health care system maintained by the state‚Äôs practice of suppressing dissent and covertly intimidating or imprisoning would-be critics?\\" Family doctors are expected to keep records of their patients' \\"political integration.\\" Epidemiological surveillance has become juxtaposed with political surveillance. = Religious freedom = In the years following the Cuban Revolution, the activities of the Roman Catholic Church were severely limited and in 1961 all property held by religious organizations was confiscated without compensation. Hundreds of members of the clergy, including a bishop, were permanently expelled from the nation. The Cuban leadership was officially atheist until 1992 when the Communist Party agreed to allow religious followers to join the party. In 1998, Pope John Paul II visited the island and was allowed to conduct large outdoor masses and visas were issued for nineteen foreign priests taking up residence in the country. In addition, other religious groups in Cuba such as the Jewish community are now permitted to hold public services and to import religious materials and kosher food for Passover, as well as to receive rabbis and other religious visitors from abroad. In October 2008, Cuba marked the opening of a Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Havana in a ceremony attended by Ra√∫l Castro, Vice President Esteban Lazo, Parliament leader Ricardo Alarc√≥n, and other figures.\\"Raul Castro Attends Dedication of Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Havana\\". 20 Oct. 2008. Retrieved 14 Apr. 2009. Cuban News Agency. The Cuban press noted that the cathedral was the first of its kind in Latin America. =Rights of women= Women have high representation in the country, with women holding 48.9% of the parliamentary seats in the Cuban National Assembly.The Human Development Index United Nations Development report. =Torture= The Cuban Foundation for Human Rights, directed by Juan Carlos Gonz√°lez Leiva, reports torture of female prisoners in Cuba. About the torture in Cuba, in 2005 a group of culture personalities, including several Nobel Prize laureates, have signed an appeal on The Guardian in defense of Cuba, claiming that \\"the government of the US has no moral authority to elect itself as the judge over human rights in Cuba, where there has not been a single case of disappearance, torture or extra-judicial execution since 1959, and where despite the economic blockade, there are levels of health, education and culture that are internationally recognised.\\" The appeal is signed, for example, by Rigoberta Mench√∫ Tum, Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel, Jos√© Saramago, Claudio Abbado, Manu Chao, Walter Salles, Nadine Gordimer, Harold Pinter, Tariq Ali, Harry Belafonte, Danny Glover, Ernesto Cardenal, Alice Walker, Ramsey Clark and Danielle Mitterrand.Human rights and Cuba, The Guardian, March 26th, 2005 However, the Center for a Free Cuba claimed the opposite. Race relations Esteban Morales Dominguez has pointed to institutionalized racism in his book The Challenges of the Racial Problem in Cuba (). Racial Politics in Post-Revolutionary Cuba discusses the racial politics prevalent in communist Cuba. Enrique Patterson, writing in the Miami Herald, describes race as a \\"social bomb\\" and he says, \\"If the Cuban government were to permit black Cubans to organize and raise their problems before [authorities] ... totalitarianism would fall\\". Carlos Moore, who has authored extensively on the issue, says that \\"There is an unstated threat, blacks in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail. Therefore the struggle in Cuba is different. There cannot be a civil rights movement. You will have instantly 10,000 black people dead\\". He says that a new generation of black Cubans are looking at politics in another way. Jorge Luis Garc√≠a P√©rez, a well-known Afro-Cuban human rights and democracy activist who was imprisoned for 17 years, in an interview with the Florida-based Directorio Democr√°tico Cubano states \\"The authorities in my country have never tolerated that a black person oppose the revolution. During the trial, the color of my skin aggravated the situation. Later when I was mistreated in prison by guards, they always referred to me as being black\\". Black Spring In March 2003, the government of Cuba arrested dozens of people (including self-identified journalists and human rights activists), and charged them with sedition due to their alleged cooperation with James Cason, head of the United States Interests Section in Havana. The accused were tried and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 28 years. In all, 75 people were given lengthy sentences averaging 17 years each. Among those sentenced were Ra√∫l Rivero, Marta Beatriz Roque, and Oscar El√≠as Biscet. Amnesty International described the trials as \\"hasty and manifestly unfair.\\" Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe P√©rez Roque denied these accusations and responded: \\"Cuba has the right to defend itself and apply punishment just like other nations do, like the United States punishes those who cooperate with a foreign power to inflict damage on their people and territory.\\" During the trial, evidence was presented that the defendants had received funds from the U.S. Interests Section. Cuban officials claim that the goal of this funding was to undermine the Cuban state, disrupt internal order, and damage the Cuban economy. For his part, Cason denies offering funds to anyone in Cuba. On November 29, 2004, the Cuban government released three of those arrested in the March 2003: Oscar Espinosa Chepe, Marcelo L√≥pez, and Margarito Broche. The action followed a meeting between the Spanish ambassador and Cuba's foreign minister. In subsequent days four more dissidents were released: Ra√∫l Rivero, Osvaldo Alfonso Vald√©s, Edel Jos√© Garc√≠a and Jorge Olivera. Seven other prisoners had previously been released for health reasons. Campaigns against homosexual behavior Thousands of homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, conscientious objectors, and dissidents were forced to conduct their compulsory military service in the 1960s at UMAP camps, where they were subject to political \\"reeducation\\". Military commanders brutalized the inmates. Carlos Alberto Montaner says \\"Camps of forced labour were instituted with all speed to \\"correct\\" such deviations ... Verbal and physical mistreatment, shaved heads, work from dawn to dusk, hammocks, dirt floors, scarce food ... The camps became increasingly crowded as the methods of arrest became more expedient\\". In the late 1960s, because of \\"revolutionary social hygiene\\", the Castro government claimed to cleanse the arts of \\"fraudulent sodomitic\\" writers and \\"sick effeminate\\" dancers. Additionally, men with long hair were locked up and their hair was cut. Castro is reported to once have asserted that, \\"in the country[side], there are no homosexuals\\", before claiming in 1992 that homosexuality is a \\"natural human tendency that must simply be respected\\".Gay Rights and Wrongs in Cuba, , Peter Tatchell (2002), published in the \\"Gay and Lesbian Humanist\\", Spring 2002. An earlier version was published in a slightly edited form as The Defiant One, in The Guardian, Friday Review, 8 June 2001. Another source reports Castro as having denounced \\"maricones\\" (\\"faggots\\") as \\"agents of imperialism\\". Castro has also reportedly asserted that \\"homosexuals should not be allowed in positions where they are able to exert influence upon young people\\". =Recent changes= Cuba has taken some reforms in 21st century. In 2003, Carlos Sanchez from the International Lesbian and Gay Association issued a report on the status of gay people in Cuba that claimed that the Cuban government no longer offers any legal punishment for its gay citizens, that there is a greater level of tolerance among Cubans for gay, bisexual, and transgender people, and that the Cuban government was open to endorsing a gay and lesbian rights plank at the United Nations. Since 2005 sex reassignment surgeries for transgender individuals are free under law, and are paid for by the government. Also Havana now has a \\"lively and vibrant\\" gay and lesbian scene. In a 2010 interview with Mexican newspaper La Jornada, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, Fidel Castro, called the persecution of homosexuals whilst he was in power \\"a great injustice, great injustice!\\" Taking responsibility for the persecution, he said, \\"If anyone is responsible, it's me ... We had so many and such terrible problems, problems of life or death. In those moments I was not able to deal with that matter [of homosexuals]. I found myself immersed, principally, in the Crisis of October, in the war, in policy questions.\\" Castro personally believed that the negative treatment of gays in Cuba arose out of the country's pre-revolutionary attitudes toward homosexuality. Mariela Castro, daughter of Communist Party First Secretary Ra√∫l Castro, has been pushing for lesbian rights with the pro-lesbian government sponsored Cuban National Center for Sexual Education which she leads. Mariela has stated her father fully supports her initiatives, saying that her father has overcome his initial homophobia to support his daughter. United Nations Human Rights Commission Cuban human rights have been repeatedly discussed and debated in the United Nations Human Rights Commission since the Cuban Revolution. It would become a recurring flashpoint in the backdrop of international dynamic during the Cold War and into the years following. The organized and sustained international effort launched by prominent Cuban dissident groups (e.g. Miami's Center for Human Rights,Sam Verdeja, Guillermo Martinez, Cubans, an Epic Journey: The Struggle of Exiles for Truth and Freedom (2012). p. 241, . UNIDAD Cubana, Christian Democratic Party of Cuba, and others) and affiliated NGOs (such as Human Rights Watch) made their way to the UNHRC and would become a growing presence in Geneva. These groups sometimes represented a spectrum of different Cuban interests, such as religious liberty (e.g. Christian-Democrat movements, parties, and organizations) and education (e.g. the International Association of Educators for World Peace), that coalesced around the issue of human rights. An influential force credited with crafting and spearheading the international Cuban human rights effort, particularly in the United Nations, was activist and Cuban community leader Jesus Permuy. The Miami Herald's profile of the Cuban Christian Democrat Movement stated that Permuy spearheaded the international diplomatic strategy to call out the Castro regime's human rights abuses and work with other Christian-Democratic governments to withhold international support until governmental changes were made to address human rights abuses. Though the coalition's NGO-driven human rights effort for Cuba initially struggled to gain traction in the UNHRC, their influence gradually grew, especially as key groups secured Consultative Status which significantly expanded their resources and exposure there. A significant turning point in these efforts came in 1984 when Permuy's Miami-based Center for Human Rights successfully lobbied to have Cuba's diplomatic representative, Luis Sola Vila, removed from a key subcommittee of the United Nations Human Rights Commission and replaced with a representative from Ireland, a Christian-Democratic ally in oppostion of the Castro government. Another key moment came in 1987 when US President Ronald Reagan appointed Armando Valladares, former Cuban political prisoner of 22 years, as the US Ambassardor to the Commission. By 1992, there had been a substantial change in Geneva as the UNHRC representatives had shifted from initial rejection, then indifference and towards embrace of the anti-Castro Cuban human rights movement's diplomatic efforts. Since 1990, the United States itself has presented various resolutions to the annual UN Human Rights Commission criticizing Cuba's human rights record. The proposals and subsequent diplomatic disagreements have been described as a \\"nearly annual ritual\\".U.N. panel condemns Cuba for rights abuses Miami Herald April 19, 2001 Long-term consensus between Latin American nations has not emerged.Cuba, the U.N.

Subsequent efforts by the U.S. have succeeded by narrow voting margins. In the Americas, some governments back the criticism, others oppose it, seeing it as a cynical manipulation of a serious human rights issue in order to promote the isolation of the island and to justify the decades-old embargo.

His most recent album, Lonely Ones, was released on January 21, 2014. Colton's songs have been featured on numerous TV shows including American Idol, Pretty Little Liars, Kyle XY, Oprah's Big Give, Newport Harbor, Castle, Wildfire, October Road Fall promo, HBO Winter promo, Sundance promo, and many others. In the fall of 2011, he developed the \\"Go Natural\\" tour partnering with CNGnow.com and became their first featured artist. He traveled the country in an energy-efficient Natural Gas powered vehicle while logging the money saved & calculating his eco footprint via social media. He has recently been collaborating with Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne. Early life Colton graduated from Heritage Hall School, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. While there, he was the quarterback of the football team. Together with his childhood friend and teammate Wes Welker, former wide receiver and current Offensive Assistant for the Houston Texans, Colton led his team to a class 2A state championship in 1998 against the Tishomingo Indians. In the process, Colton and Welker set multiple state passing and receiving records, respectively. Career =Graham Colton Band= After leaving his hometown of Oklahoma City to attend Southern Methodist University, Colton began writing and performing songs in Dallas pubs and coffee houses. During this time, Colton perceived an appreciable demand for his music. Colton began recording songs for a growing local fan base; his self-titled demo, Graham Colton, became a local favorite and a top seller on the popular music website Awarestore.com. Soon after, Colton formed the Graham Colton Band alongside Brian 'Turtle' Turton, Jordan Elder, Drew Nichols, & Ryan Tallent. The band's first trip outside of Texas included a tour stop at DC Sessions in Washington, DC. There, the band struck up a friendship with New Orleans band Better Than Ezra and frontman Kevin Griffin. They would perform with Better than Ezra off and on for the next 2 years and begin collaborating with Griffin on several songs. Adam Duritz invited Colton to perform as a supporting act for the Counting Crows in their 2002 fall tour. Colton was invited for another tour in 2004. The Graham Colton Band signed a record deal with Universal Records. The group started recording sessions with producer Brendan O'Brien at the Southern Tracks studio in Atlanta, GA. The resulting album Drive was released in May 2004. To support the album, performance dates were arranged with various high-profile acts, including John Mayer, O.A.R., Maroon 5 and the Dave Matthews Band. Guitarist Aben Eubanks served as an unofficial member of the band. After extensive touring through 2006, the band officially parted ways. =Here Right Now= After spending the majority of 2005 on the road with Kelly Clarkson, who he also dated, Colton began writing songs for what would become his solo follow up, Here Right Now, which was released in late October 2007. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard New Artist/Heatseeker chart, and No. 4 Pop Album/#11 Top Album charts on iTunes. Upon release of the album, Graham returned to the road for a series of solo performances with Vanessa Carlton. On March 10, 2008, Graham mentioned that a full tour would be announced in early 2008 for this album. He also performed to promote the album on the Today Show, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and the Late Show with David Letterman. The lead track, \\"Best Days\\", was chosen as single of the week at iTunes and subsequently, Graham was named by its editors as a 'Top New Pop Artist' of '07. In addition, the track landed coverage in Billboard magazine with a 'Singles Review' and was the subject of their 'Breaking and Entering' feature. The music video for the song was directed by highly acclaimed director Nigel Dick, and made its TRL debut on MTV shortly after it was filmed. MTV proceeded to use four songs from the album as part of their 'Featured Artist Program' for the hit show, Newport Harbor. That year, Colton performed at a number of concerts and radio events alongside Vanessa Carlton, Colbie Caillat, John Mellencamp, as well as a U.S headlining tour. Colton officially parted ways with Universal/Republic records in 2008 and quickly began writing songs for what would later become the Twenty Something EP. As a newly independent artist, Colton enlisted touring bandmates Chad Copelin & Jarod Evans to produce the EP at Blackwatch Studios in Norman, Oklahoma. Colton played several solo acoustic shows in support of the EP including a month of tour dates with longtime pals Needtobreathe. =Pacific Coast Eyes= Colton began recording songs with producer Tommy Walter in 2010 that would later become Pacific Coast Eyes. Officially released in April 2011, the album would be Colton's first official full length independent release. The album was highly praised and reached the top of the iTunes singer songwriter chart. Colton enlisted David Green and Jon Cooper to direct/produce the music video for \\"Pacific Coast Eyes\\". It was filmed in three days in Los Angeles. Colton would again embark on a US headlining tour as well as open for artists including Sheryl Crow, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Colin Hay, Mat Kearney, and Ben Rector. After writing a handful of new songs he chose to re-release the album in October 2011 as Pacific Coast Eyes Volume 2 adding three new songs and three bonus tracks. =Sooner The Sunset= Colton collaborated with Lindsey Ray in the summer of 2011 under the name Sooner the Sunset and recorded a handful of songs for a self-titled EP released October 2, 2012. The band's first single \\"All Because of You\\" was released on iTunes in March 2012. =Lonely Ones= Colton's latest album Lonely Ones, produced by Chad Copelin and Jarod Evans at Blackwatch Studios, was released on January 21, 2014. Lonely Ones was inspired by Colton's collaborations with Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips and features Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips on guitar. \\"Born To Raise Hell\\", the first music video from Lonely Ones, premiered on PopMatters on November 7, 2013. The song was inspired by a story told by Colton's co- producer Chad Copelin about his father picking up a hitchhiker in the 70s who turned out to be serial killer Richard Speck. Colton released a series of live in-studio performances from the album called \\"The Lonely Sessions.\\" In conjunction with the Lonely Ones Tour with Seattle indie band Cumulus, Colton released the Lonely Ones Tour EP on Noisetrade featuring two collaborations with The Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne: \\"Don't Take My Sunshine Away,\\" made popular by the band Sparklehorse, and an alternate version of \\"Another Night.\\" Television performances Graham made his national television debut on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Friday, February 2, 2008, with a full band performance of \\"Best Days\\" which included a three-piece string section. Shortly thereafter, he travelled to New York to perform on CBS' Late Show with David Letterman on March 13 and NBC's Today Show on the 14th, again with full band and strings. The next week, he performed on CBS' The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on March 19, with a stripped down acoustic performance with strings. The week after, he travelled back to New York for a solo acoustic performance on Live with Regis and Kelly on the 27th, making that the third consecutive week with a national television performance. On April 9, Graham returned to Los Angeles to perform on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.

It is an effective thickening agent and stabilizer to prevent ingredients from separating. It can be produced from simple sugars using a fermentation process, and derives its name from the species of bacteria used, Xanthomonas campestris. History Xanthan gum was discovered by Allene Rosalind Jeanes and her research team at the United States Department of Agriculture, and brought into commercial production by CP Kelco under the trade name Kelzan in the early 1960s.Whistler, Roy, L, and BeMiller, James N., eds Industrial Gums: Polysaccharides and their Derivatives Academic Press (1973) . It was approved for use in foods in 1968 and is accepted as a safe food additive in the USA, Canada, European countries, and many other countries, with E number E415, and CAS number 11138-66-2. Xanthan gum derives its name from the species of bacteria used during the fermentation process, Xanthomonas campestris.Barr√©re, G.C., C.E. Barber, and M.J. Daniels (1986) Intl. J. Biological Macromolecules, 8(6):372-374 This is the same bacterium responsible for causing black rot to form on broccoli, cauliflower, and other leafy vegetables. Uses Xanthan gum, 1%, can produce a significant increase in the viscosity of a liquid. In foods, xanthan gum is common in salad dressings and sauces. It helps to prevent oil separation by stabilizing the emulsion, although it is not an emulsifier. Xanthan gum also helps suspend solid particles, such as spices. Xanthan gum helps create the desired texture in many ice creams. Toothpaste often contains xanthan gum as a binder to keep the product uniform. Xanthan gum also helps thicken commercial egg substitutes made from egg whites, to replace the fat and emulsifiers found in yolks. It is also a preferred method of thickening liquids for those with swallowing disorders, since it does not change the color or flavor of foods or beverages at typical use levels.cuisine, m. (2014). Xanthan Gum. Retrieved from modernist cuisine: In gluten-free baking, xanthan gum is used to give the dough or batter the stickiness that would otherwise be achieved with gluten. In most foods it is used at concentrations of 0.5% or less. Xanthan gum is used in wide range food products, such as sauces, dressings, meat and poultry products, bakery products, confectionery products, beverages, dairy products, others. In the oil industry, xanthan gum is used in large quantities to thicken drilling mud. These fluids carry the solids cut by the drilling bit to the surface. Xanthan gum provides great \\"low end\\" rheology. When circulation stops, the solids remain suspended in the drilling fluid. The widespread use of horizontal drilling and the demand for good control of drilled solids has led to its expanded use. It has been added to concrete poured underwater, to increase its viscosity and prevent washout. In cosmetics, xanthan gum is used to prepare water gels. It is also used in oil-in-water emulsions to enhance droplet coalescence. Xanthan gum is under preliminary research for its potential uses in tissue engineering to construct hydrogels and scaffolds supporting three-dimensional tissue formation. =Shear thinning= The viscosity of xanthan gum solutions decreases with higher shear rates. This is called shear thinning or pseudoplasticity. This means that a product subjected to shear, whether from mixing, shaking or chewing will thin. When the shear forces are removed, the food will thicken again. In salad dressing, the addition of xanthan gum makes it thick enough at rest in the bottle to keep the mixture fairly homogeneous, but the shear forces generated by shaking and pouring thins it, so it can be easily poured. When it exits the bottle, the shear forces are removed and it thickens again, so it clings to the salad. = Amounts used = The greater the ratio of xanthan gum added to a liquid, the thicker the liquid will become. An emulsion can be formed with as little as 0.1% (by weight). Increasing the amount of gum gives a thicker, more stable emulsion up to 1% xanthan gum. A teaspoon of xanthan gum weighs about 2.5 grams and brings one cup (250 ml) of water to a 1% concentration.Tests and measurements of xanthan gum To make a foam, 0.2‚Äì0.8% xanthan gum is typically used. Larger amounts result in larger bubbles and denser foam. Egg white powder (0.2‚Äì2.0%) with 0.1‚Äì0.4% xanthan gum yields bubbles similar to soap bubbles. Health Evaluation of workers exposed to xanthan gum dust found evidence of a link to respiratory symptoms. On May 20, 2011, the FDA issued a press release about SimplyThick, a food-thickening additive containing xanthan gum as the active ingredient, warning parents, caregivers and health care providers not to feed SimplyThick, a thickening product, to premature infants. The concern is that the product may cause premature infants to suffer necrotizing enterocolitis. =Safety= According to a 2017 safety review by a scientific panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), xanthan gum (European food additive number E 415) is extensively digested during intestinal fermentation, and causes no adverse effects, even at high intake amounts. The EFSA panel found no concern about genotoxicity from long-term consumption. EFSA concluded that there is no safety concern for the general population when xanthan gum is consumed as a food additive. Preparation Xanthan gum is produced by the fermentation of glucose and sucrose. The polysaccharide is prepared by the bacteria being inoculated into a sterile aqueous solution of carbohydrate(s), a source of nitrogen, dipotassium phosphate, and some trace elements. The medium is well-aerated and stirred, and the xanthan polymer is produced extracellularly into the medium. After one to four days, the polymer is precipitated from the medium by the addition of isopropyl alcohol, and the precipitate is dried and milled to give a powder that is readily soluble in water or brine. It is composed of pentasaccharide repeat units, comprising glucose, mannose, and glucuronic acid in the molar ratio 2:2:1. A strain of X. campestris has been developed that will grow on lactose - which allows it to be used to process whey, a waste product of cheese production. This can produce 30 g/L of xanthan gum for every 40 g/L of whey powder. Whey-derived xanthan gum is commonly used in many commercial products, such as shampoos and salad dressings.Tortora, G.J., Funke, B.R., & Case, C.L. (2010). Microbiology: An Introduction, 10th edition. San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings. Pg. 801. =Detail of the biosynthesis= Synthesis originates from glucose as substrate for synthesis of the sugar nucleotides precursors UDP-glucose, UDP-glucuronate, and GDP-mannose that are required for building the pentasaccharide repeat unit. This links the synthesis of xanthan to carbohydrate metabolism. The repeat units are built up at undecaprenylphosphate lipid carriers that are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane. Specific glycosyltransferases sequentially transfer the sugar moieties of the nucleotide sugar xanthan precursors to the lipid carriers. Acetyl and pyruvyl residues are added as non-carbohydrate decorations. Mature repeat units are polymerized and exported in a way resembling the Wzy- dependent polysaccharide synthesis mechanism of Enterobacteriaceae. Products of the gum gene cluster drive synthesis, polymerization, and export of the repeat unit.

Martenitsi are worn from Baba Marta Day (March 1) until the wearer first sees a stork, swallow, or blossoming tree (or until late March). The name of the holiday means \\"Grandma March\\" in Bulgarian and Macedonian and the holiday and the wearing of Martenitsi are a Bulgarian tradition related to welcoming the spring, which according to Bulgarian folklore begins in March.Grandmother March, 1st March, Martenitsa Bulgarian rituals and traditions Regional Museum Burgas Inscribed in 2017 on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  Symbolism  A typical Martenitsa consists of two small wool dolls, Pizho and Penda (). Pizho, the male doll, is usually predominantly white; Penda, the female doll, is distinguished by her skirt and is usually predominantly red. The red and white woven threads symbolize the wish for good health. They are the heralds of the coming of spring and of new life. While white as a color symbolizes purity, red is a symbol of life and passion, and so some ethnologists have proposed that, in its very origins, the custom might have reminded people of the constant cycle of life and death, the balance of good and evil, and the sorrow and happiness in human life. The Martenitsa is also a stylized symbol of Mother Nature, the white symbolizing the purity of the melting white snow and the red setting of the sun, which becomes more and more intense as spring progresses. These two natural resources are the source of life. They are also associated with the male and female beginnings, and in their balance, with the need for balance in life.  Tradition  Martenitsi tied to a blossoming tree, a symbol of approaching spring Another tied Martenitsa Blossoming Magnolia full of tied Martenitsi Tradition dictates that Martenitsi are always given as gifts, not bought for oneself. They are given to loved ones, friends, and those people to whom one feels close. Beginning on the first of March, one or more are worn pinned to clothing, or around the wrist or neck, until the wearer sees a stork or swallow returning from migration, or a blossoming tree, and then removes the Martenitsa. In Bulgarian folklore the name Baba Marta (, \\"Grandma March\\") evokes a grumpy old lady whose mood swings very rapidly. The common belief is that by wearing the red and white colors of the Martenitsa, people ask Baba Marta for mercy. They hope that it will make winter pass faster and bring spring. The first returning stork or swallow is taken as a harbinger of spring and as evidence that Baba Marta is in a good mood and is about to retire. The ritual of finally taking off the Martenitsa is different in different parts of Bulgaria. Some people tie the Martenitsa on a branch of a fruit tree, thus giving the tree health and luck, which the person wearing the Martenitsa has enjoyed themselves while wearing it. Others put it under a stone with the idea that the kind of creature (usually an insect) closest to the token the next day will determine the person's health for the rest of the year. If the creature is a larva or a worm, the coming year will be healthy and full of success. The same luck is associated with an ant, the difference being that the person will have to work hard to reach success. If the creature nearest the token is a spider, then the person is in trouble and may not enjoy luck, health, or personal success. Wearing one or more Martenitsi is a very popular Bulgarian tradition. The time during which they are worn is meant to be a joyful holiday commemorating health and long life. Modern Martenitsi take a wider variety of forms and often incorporate colored beads and other elaboration.  Origin  This tradition is an important part of the Culture of Bulgaria and there is a similar tradition in North Macedonia, as well as in Greece, Albania (known as verorja), Romania and Moldova. The tradition is related to the ancient pagan history of the Balkan Peninsula and to all agricultural cults of nature. Some specific features of the ritual, especially tying the twisted white and red woolen threads, are a result of centuries-old tradition and suggest Thracian (paleo-Balkan) or possibly Hellenic or Roman origins.–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—ä—Ä –ø–æ —Ç—Ä–∞–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è \\"–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ. –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—ä—Ä –§–æ–ª\\"; –ï–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∞ –¢—Ä–∞–∫–∏—è –∏ —Ç—Ä–∞–∫–∏—Ç–µ - –ú–∞—Ä—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—Ü–∞—Ç–∞, –í–∞–Ω—è –õ–æ–∑–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞.

It is south of Bude and northeast of Tintagel.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 190 Bude & Clovelly The harbour is a natural inlet protected by two stone harbour walls built in 1584 by Sir Richard Grenville and is the only significant harbour for along the coast. The village extends up the valleys of the River Valency and River Jordan. Heavy rainfall on 16 August 2004 caused extensive damage to the village. Boscastle lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The South West Coast Path passes through the village. History The name of the village comes from Botreaux Castle (pronounced \\"Botro\\"),As is pronounced the name of the former Devon manor of Molland-Bottreaux, a remnant of which name survives as the hamlet of Bottreaux Mill, Molland; also the title Baron Botreaux. Pointon, Graham E. (1990). BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (2nd ed.) Oxford: Oxford University Press; p. 31 a 12th-century motte-and-bailey fortress, of which few remains survive. The castle was anciently in the possession of the de Botreaux family, which became under William de Botreaux (1337‚Äì91) the Barons Botreaux. The antiquary, John Leland in the mid 16th century described the village ‚Ä≥... it is a very filthy town and il kept.‚Ä≥ Boscastle harbour is a natural inlet protected by two stone harbour walls built in 1584 by Sir Richard Grenville (of HMS Revenge). It is the only significant harbour for along the coast. Boscastle was once a small port (similar to many others on the north coast of Cornwall), importing limestone and coal, and exporting slate and other local produce. In the early 20th century Boscastle hosted a street dance similar to the Helston Furry Dance, but it is unclear how old the tradition is or when this ceased. =Churches= The Rector of Boscastle is responsible for seven churches in the district: Forrabury (St Symphorian), Minster (St Merthiana), St Juliot, Lesnewth (St Michael and All Angels), Trevalga (St Petroc), Otterham (St Denis) and Davidstow (St David). St Juliot is of particular interest to devotees of the works of Thomas Hardy since he acted as the architect for the church's restoration in March 1870 and this is where he met his first wife, Emma Gifford, who was the Rector's sister-in-law. Their love affair was the inspiration for his novel A Pair of Blue Eyes and, later in life, some of his poetry. ;A Seaside Parish In 2004 British television channel BBC 2 began broadcasting A Seaside Parish, a weekly series focusing on the life of the newly appointed Rector of Boscastle, Christine Musser. = Tourism= The village, with its picturesque harbour, is a popular tourist destination. Among the attractions are the Museum of Witchcraft, Uncle Paul's Emporium, the Boscastle pottery shop, and access to the South West Coast Path. Much of the land in and around Boscastle is owned by the National Trust, including both sides of the harbour, Forrabury Stitches, high above the Boscastle and divided into ancient \\"stitchmeal\\" cultivation plots, and large areas of the Valency Valley, known for its connections to Thomas Hardy. The former harbour stables (part of the National Trust estate) are now a youth hostel run by YHA, popular with walkers. The National Trust runs a shop at the harbour, and a visitor centre in the Old Smithy. Charles, Prince of Wales, visited Boscastle on 15 July 2019 to commemorate the anniversary of the Cornwall AONB and to visit a local Cornish hedge restoration project.Rosie Cripps Warm welcome for Prince Charles as he visits Boscastle ; Camelford & Delabole Post; 16 July 2019 The Boscastle Breakdown (stepdance) The Boscastle & Tintagel Players concertinas, cello & stepping is included in the Topic Records compilation The Voice of the People.

London: Carlton Books ; p. 279 =Boscastle floods= ;Flood of 2004 A flash flood on 16 August 2004 caused extensive damage to the village. Residents were trapped in houses as the roads turned into rivers: people were trapped on roofs, in cars, in buildings and on the river's banks. and the village's visitor centre was washed away. Two Royal Air Force Westland Sea King rescue helicopters from Chivenor, three Royal Navy Sea Kings from Culdrose, one RAF Sea King from St Mawgan and one Coastguard S61 helicopter from Portland searched for and assisted casualties in and around the village. The operation was coordinated by the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC) based at RAF Kinloss in Scotland in the largest peacetime rescue operation ever launched in the UK. A total of 91 people were rescued and there were no fatalities, only one broken thumb. Around 50 cars were swept into the harbour and the bridge was washed away, roads were submerged under of water, making communication effectively impossible until flood-waters subsided. The sewerage system burst, and for this range of health and safety reasons Boscastle was declared temporarily inaccessible. The causes were: over of rainfall (typically a month's rainfall) fell in two hours; the ground was already saturated due to the previous two weeks of above average rainfall; the drainage basin has many steep slopes, and has areas of impermeable slate causing rapid surface run-off; Boscastle is at the confluence (where tributaries meet) of two rivers - Valency and Jordan;The names Jordan and Paradise may have been borrowed from the Bible by a reinterpretation of the French \\"jardin\\", i.s.the garden of Bottreaux Castle; Armstrong, W. J. C. (1931) A Rambler's Guide to Boscastle; 2nd ed. Boscastle: the author; p. 10 a large quantity of water all arrived within a short space of time causing the rivers to overflow; the flooding coincided with a high tide, making the effect worse. The effects were homes, businesses and cars belonging to more than 1,000 people were swept away; income from tourism was lost, which affected livelihoods and the local economy; there were vast numbers of subsequent insurance claims; no lives were lost, partly due to the rapid response of the emergency services. ;Flood of 2007 Boscastle was flooded again on 21 June 2007 although the scale of destruction was not nearly as serious as in 2004. Sport Boscastle Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1907. The club continued until the mid-1920s. References Further reading *Williams, Michael (1975) Tintagel to Boscastle.

A synchrocyclotron is a special type of cyclotron, patented by Edwin McMillan, in which the frequency of the driving RF electric field is varied to compensate for relativistic effects as the particles' velocity begins to approach the speed of light. This is in contrast to the classical cyclotron, where this frequency is constant. There are two major differences between the synchrocyclotron and the classical cyclotron. In the synchrocyclotron, only one dee (hollow \\"D\\"-shaped sheet metal electrode) retains its classical shape, while the other pole is open (see patent sketch). Furthermore, the frequency of oscillating electric field in a synchrocyclotron is decreasing continuously instead of kept constant so as to maintain cyclotron resonance for relativistic velocities. One terminal of the oscillating electric potential varying periodically is applied to the dee and the other terminal is on ground potential. The protons or deuterons to be accelerated are made to move in circles of increasing radius. The acceleration of particles takes place as they enter or leave the dee. At the outer edge, the ion beam can be removed with the aid of electrostatic deflector. The first synchrocyclotron produced 195 MeV deuterons and 390 MeV Œ±-particles. Differences from the classical cyclotron In a classical cyclotron, the angular frequency of the electric field is given by :\\\\omega = \\\\frac{q B}{m}, Where \\\\omega is the angular frequency of the electric field, q is the charge on the particle, B is the magnetic field, and m is the mass of the particle. This makes the assumption that the particle is classical, and does not experience relativistic phenomena such as length contraction. These effects start to become significant when v, the velocity of the particle greater than \\\\approx \\\\frac{c}{3}. To correct for this, the relativistic mass is used instead of the rest mass; thus, a factor of \\\\gamma multiplies the mass, such that :\\\\omega = \\\\frac{q B}{m \\\\gamma}, where :\\\\gamma = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}. This is then the angular frequency of the field applied to the particles as they are accelerated around the synchrocyclotron. Advantages A part of the former Orsay synchrocyclotron The chief advantage of the synchrocyclotron is that there is no need to restrict the number of revolutions executed by the ion before its exit. As such, the potential difference supplied between the dees can be much smaller. The smaller potential difference needed across the gap has the following uses: #There is no need for a narrow gap between the dees as in the case of conventional cyclotron, because strong electric fields for producing large acceleration are not required. Thus only one dee can be used instead of two, the other end of the oscillating voltage supply being connected to earth. #The magnetic pole pieces can be brought closer, thus making it possible to increase greatly the magnetic flux density. #The frequency valve oscillator is able to function with much greater efficiency. Disadvantages The main drawback of this device is that, as a result of the variation in the frequency of the oscillating voltage supply, only a very small fraction of the ions leaving the source are captured in phase-stable orbits of maximum radius and energy with the result that the output beam current has a low duty cycle, and the average beam current is only a small fraction of the instantaneous beam current. Thus the machine produces high energy ions, though with comparatively low intensity. The next development step of the cyclotron concept, the isochronous cyclotron, maintains a constant RF driving frequency and compensates for relativistic effects by increasing the magnetic field with radius. Isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than synchrocyclotrons. As a result, isochronous cyclotrons became more popular in the research field. History The Synchrocyclotron (SC) at CERN In 1945, Robert Lyster Thornton at Ernest Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory led the construction of the 730 MeV cyclotron. In 1946, he oversaw the conversion of the cyclotron to the new design made by McMillan which would become the first synchrocyclotron with could produce 195 MeV deuterons and 390 MeV Œ±-particles. After the first synchrocyclotron was operational, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) funded two synchrocyclotron construction initiatives. The first funding was in 1946 for Carnegie Institute of Technology to build a 435-MeV synchrocyclotron led by Edward Creutz and to start its nuclear physics research program. The second initiative was in 1947 for University of Chicago to build a 450-MeV synchrocyclotron under the direction of Enrico Fermi. In 1948, University of Rochester completed the construction of its 240-MeV synchrocyclotron, followed by a completion of 380-MeV synchrocyclotron at Columbia University in 1950. In 1950 the 435-MeV synchrocyclotron at Carnegie Institute of Technology was operational, followed by 450-MeV synchrocyclotron of University of Chicago in 1951. At a UNESCO meeting in Paris in December 1951, there was a discussion on finding a solution to have a medium-energy accelerator for the soon-to-be-formed European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The synchrocyclotron was proposed as a solution to bridge the gap before the 28-GeV Proton Synchrotron was completed. In 1952, Cornelis Bakker led the group to design and construct the synchrocyclotron named Synchro-Cyclotron (SC) at CERN. The design of the Synchro-Cyclotron with in circumference started in 1953. The construction started in 1954 and it achieved 600 MeV proton acceleration in August 1957, with the experimental program started in April 1958. Current developments Synchrocyclotrons are attractive for use in proton therapy because of the ability to make compact systems using high magnetic fields. Medical physics companies Ion Beam Applications and Mevion Medical Systems have developed superconducting synchrocyclotrons that can fit comfortably into hospitals.http://mevion.com/trinioblum-core References Accelerator physics Particle accelerators ","title":"Synchrocyclotron"},{"id":"596997","text":"Yegor Timurovich Gaidar (; ; 19 March 1956 ‚Äì 16 December 2009) was a Soviet and Russian economist, politician, and author, and was the Acting Prime Minister of Russia from 15 June 1992 to 14 December 1992. He was the architect of the controversial shock therapy reforms administered in Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which brought him both praise and harsh criticism. He participated in the preparation of the Bialowieza agreements. Many Russians held him responsible for the economic hardships that plagued the country in the 1990s that resulted in mass poverty and hyperinflation among other things, although liberals praised him as a man who did what had to be done to save the country from complete collapse.Yegor Gaidar The Daily Telegraph. Retrieved 17 December 2009 Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute, who advised the Russian government in the early 1990s, called Gaidar \\"the intellectual leader of many of Russia's political and economic reforms\\" and \\"one of the few pivotal actors\\" of the period. Gaidar died of pulmonary edema, provoked by myocardial ischemia on 16 December 2009. Personal life Gaidar was born in 1956 in Moscow, RSFSR, Soviet Union, the son of Ariadna Bazhova and Pravda military correspondent Timur Gaidar, who fought in the Bay of Pigs Invasion and was a friend of Ra√∫l Castro. His paternal grandfather was Soviet writer Arkady Gaidar and his maternal grandfather was writer Pavel Bazhov. Gaidar married the daughter of writer Arkady Strugatsky during his time at the university. His daughter, Maria Gaidar, was one of the leaders of the Russian democratic opposition. From July 2009 till June 2011 she was Deputy Chair of the Government of Kirov oblast.Divisions Revealed as Kremlin Critic Moves to Work for Ukraine Government, The Moscow Times (20 July 2015) In 2015 and 2016 she was vice- governor of Odessa Oblast in Ukraine. Career Gaidar graduated with honors from the Moscow State University, Faculty of Economics, in 1978 and worked as a researcher in several academic institutes. A long-time member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and an editor of the CPSU ideological journal Communist during the perestroika, he joined Boris Yeltsin's camp during Perestroika. In 1991 he quit the Communist Party and was promoted to Yeltsin's government. While in government, Gaidar advocated free market economic reforms according to the principle of shock therapy. His best-known decision was to abolish price regulation by the state, which immediately resulted in a major increase in prices and amounted to officially authorizing a market economy in Russia. He also cut military procurement and industrial subsidies, and reduced the budget deficit. Gaidar was the First Vice-Premier of the Russian Government and Minister of Economics from 1991 until 1992, and Minister of Finance from February 1992 until April 1992. He was appointed Acting Prime Minister under President Boris Yeltsin in 1992 from 15 June until 14 December, when the anti-Yeltsin Russian Congress of People's Deputies refused to confirm Gaidar in this position and Viktor Chernomyrdin was eventually chosen as a compromise figure. Gaidar continued to advise the new government. On 18 September 1993, he was again appointed the First Vice- Premier under Chernomyrdin as a deliberate snub to the opposition. He played an active role in the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993. On 3 October, he famously spoke live on Russian television, then broadcasting from an emergency station near Moscow, as there was fighting going on in the Ostankino complex, calling on Muscovites to gather to defend Yeltsin's government so that Russia would not be \\"turned into an enormous concentration camp for decades\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqPLUz1Mlfg In the 1993 Duma elections, in the aftermath of the crisis, Gaidar led the pro-government bloc Russia's Choice and was seen by some as a possible future Prime Minister. However, due to the bloc's failure to win the plurality of votes in the election, Gaidar's role in the government diminished and he finally resigned on 20 January 1994. Gaidar in the early 1990s During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia Yegor Gaidar, Boris Nemtsov and Boris Fyodorov were in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on a mediation mission. =Reforms controversy= Gaidar was often criticized for imposing ruthless reforms in 1992 with little care for their social impact; however, it has to be understood that the country back then was at the brink of a famine. Russia had no currency for buying import goods, at the same time, no-one gave credits as the country was essentially bankrupt.–ì–∞–π–¥–∞—Ä –∏ –µ–≥–æ —Ä–µ—Ñ–æ—Ä–º—ã by –ì—Ä–∏–≥–æ—Ä–∏–π –ì–µ—Ä–∞—Å–∏–º–æ–≤ The collapse of the Soviet social system led to serious deterioration in living standards. Millions of Russians were thrown into poverty due to their savings being devalued by massive hyperinflation. Moreover, the privatization and break-up of state assets left over from the Soviet Union, which he played a big part in, led to much of the country's wealth being handed to a small group of powerful business executives, later known as the Russian oligarchs, for much less than what they were worth. The voucher privatization program enabled these few oligarchs to become billionaires specifically by arbitraging the vast difference between old domestic prices for Russian commodities and the prices prevailing on the world market. Because they stashed billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the Russian economy, these oligarchs were dubbed \\"kleptocrats.\\"Johanna Granville, \\"Dermokratizatsiya and Prikhvatizatsiya: The Russian Kleptocracy and Rise of Organized Crime,\\"Demokratizatsiya (summer 2003), pp. 448-457. As society grew to despise these figures and resent the economic and social turmoil caused by the reforms, Gaidar was often held by Russians as one of the men most responsible. On the other hand, the ubiquitous goods deficit of the Soviet years disappeared and it became possible to buy all goods in the shops. Per capita calorie consumption under Gaidar diminished by 3.5% from 2526.88 kCal to 2438.17 kCal.–ì–æ—Å–∫–æ–º—Å—Ç–∞—Ç According to Franklin Foer writing in The Atlantic, however, \\"when Yegor Gaidar ... asked the United States for help hunting down the billions that the KGB had carted away, the White House refused.\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/how-kleptocracy- came-to-america/580471 One of Gaidar's most outspoken critics was the Yabloko economist and MP Grigory Yavlinsky, who had proposed since 1990 a 500 Days programme for the transition of the whole USSR to market economic, which was first backed and then dismissed by the government of Nikolai Ryzhkov. Yavlinsky emphasized the differences between his and Gaidar's reforms program, such as the sequencing of privatization vs. liberalization of prices and the applicability of his program to the entire Soviet Union. Gaidar's supporters contend that although many mistakes were made, he had few choices in the matter and ultimately saved the country both from bankruptcy and from starvation. According to the BBC's Andrei Ostalski, \\"There were only two solutions‚Äîeither introduce martial law and severe rationing, or radically liberalize the economy. The first option meant going all the way back to the Stalinist system of mass repression. The second meant a colossal change, a journey‚Äîor, rather, a race‚Äîthrough uncharted waters with an unpredictable outcome.\\"Yegor Gaidar: The price to pay BBC News. Retrieved 17 December 2009 = Poisoning case = In November 2006 Gaidar went to Dublin, Ireland to present his book 'Death of the Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia' at an academic conference. Shorty after breakfast, a fruit salad and a cup of tea, Gaidar felt sick and returned from the conference hall to his room at the hotel. Then he was called on the phone to come down and deliver his speech, what Gaidar has later recalled as a call that saved his life, as he must had certainly died if were left in his room unattended. After Gaidar had tried to deliver his speeh he collapsed in the university hallway and was urgently taken a to local hospital. His colleague, Ekaterina Genieva, recalled that \\"He was lying on the floor unconscious. There was blood coming from his nose; he was vomiting blood. This went on for more than half an hour\\". Next day he moved from the hospital to the Russian embassy's premises and arranged a transfer to Moscow where the doctors familiar with his health status suggested that it looks like he was 'poisoned'. In a later interview that was published in the FT Gaidar claimed that this has been an attempted political murder, where \\"most likely that means that some obvious or hidden adversaries of the Russian authorities stand behind the scenes of this event, those who are interested in further radical deterioration of relations between Russia and the west\\". Another Russian reformist official and former colleague of Gaidar, Anatoly Chubais rejected a possibility of Kremlin's involvement in this case, commening that \\"Yegor Gaidar was on the verge of death on 24 November. The deadly triangle - Politkovskaya, Litvinenko and Gaidar - would have been very desirable for some people who are seeking an unconstitutional and forceful change of power in Russia.\\" Irish police opened an official investigation of the case. One of the versions voiced by the Russian opposition leaders and Kremlin supporters suggested that Boris Berezovsky, then a Russian oligarch in exile, may have been behind it. Andrey Illarionov, former Putin's adviser now living in the US, commented that the whole case was staged, and the reason for taking Gaidar to hospital must have been hyperthensia, stress or alcohol. Death Gaidar died at the age of 53 in Odintsovo raion, Moscow Oblast, Russia. Gaidar's aide Valery Natarov stated that Gaidar died unexpectedly, early on 16 December 2009, at his Moscow Oblast home while he was working on a book for children. Gaidar died of pulmonary edema, provoked by myocardial ischemia. He is survived by his wife, three sons and daughter. Former associates acknowledged Gaidar as an object of loathing among ordinary Russians who lost everything during the economic liberalization. However, many Russian citizens praised Gaidar as a man who averted greater catastrophes. \\"He stood before the choice of civil war or painful reforms\\", Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister under Yeltsin, told the Ekho Moskvy radio station. \\"He gave his life to avert civil war.\\" Anatoly Chubais, the minister responsible for privatization in the early 1990s, who considers himself a friend of Gaidar, praised Gaidar as Russia's \\"savior\\". \\"It was Russia's huge good fortune that in one of the worst moments in its history it had Yegor Gaidar. In the early 1990s he saved the country from famine, civil war and disintegration\\", Chubais wrote in his blog. \\"Few people in the history of Russia and in world history can be compared with him for force of intellect, clarity of understanding of the past, present and future, and a willingness to take the most difficult but necessary decisions\\", wrote Chubais. Former Deputy Minister of Fuel and Energy of Russia Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev expressed their condolences.http://echo.msk.ru/news/641740-echo.html \\"He laid the foundation of our economy\\". Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has expressed condolences to relatives and friends of Yegor Gaidar. Medvedev called Gaidar a \\"daring, honest and decisive\\" economist who \\"evoked respect among his supporters and opponents.\\" Gaidar was a brave, honest, and determined man, who \\"assumed responsibility for unpopular but essential measures in a period of radical change,\\" the president said.

He didn't dodge responsibility and 'took the punch' in the most challenging situations with honor and courage,\\" the statement said. The White House offered condolences over Gaidar's death. Although controversial, Gaidar's legacy formed the foundation of a dynamic market-based economy and is destined to live on, U.S. National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said. Hammer described him as a top-notch intellectual, a true Russian patriot and a leading brain behind Russia‚Äôs political and economic reforms in the past two decades. =Gaidar Forum= In honor of Yegor Gaidar, each year in mid-January the Russian Presidency holds a conference that attracts the Russian political and business elite, with top European politicians also attending. The 2014 Forum was hosted by Dmitry Medvedev, with presentations by former Czech President V√°clav Klaus, former Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, and former Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Simeon Djankov. The Gaidar Forum is organized the week before the World Economic Forum in Davos and thus also serves to formulate the Russian positions on a variety of topics.

It opened on 12 March 1903 as the New Theatre and was built by Sir Charles Wyndham behind Wyndham's Theatre which was completed in 1899. The building was designed by the architect W. G. R. Sprague with an exterior in the classical style and an interior in the Rococo style. In 1973 it was renamed the Albery Theatre in tribute to Sir Bronson Albery who had presided as its manager for many years. Since September 2005, the theatre has been owned by Delfont-Mackintosh Ltd. It underwent major refurbishment in 2006, and was renamed the No√´l Coward Theatre when it re-opened on 1 June 2006. The theatre seats 872 patrons on four levels. The building is now a Grade II Listed structure. History =Early years, 1903‚Äì1919= The New was the second of the three theatres in St Martin's Lane. The Trafalgar Square (now the Duke of York's) opened in 1892 and the London Coliseum in 1904. The actor-manager Charles Wyndham, who had been based at the Criterion Theatre for more than twenty years, moved in 1899 to the larger Wyndham's Theatre which he commissioned in Charing Cross Road. To built Wyndham's he had been obliged to buy a larger parcel of land than he required, and in 1901 he was in negotiations to sell the area he did not need. When negotiations fell through he decided to build another theatre on the vacant site. This plot fronting on St Martin's Lane is bounded on one side by St Martin's Court, which also runs behind the theatre. While the theatre was in planning and then under construction it was referred to simply as \\"the new theatre\\", and the name stuck. The street adjacent to it is called New Row.Mander and Mitchenson (1975), pp. 11‚Äì12 New Theatre, postcard, circa 1905 The theatre, like Wyndham's, was designed by the architect W. G. R. Sprague, and was the thirtieth theatre he designed. A contemporary report described the front elevation as \\"of the free classic order ‚Ä¶ at once dignified and effective\\". As at Wyndhams, the auditorium is constructed on the cantilever principle, rendering columns unnecessary and ensuring unimpeded views. The internal decoration was based on French designs from the 18th century. Over the Proscenium there is a gilt trophy emblematic of peace and music.Mander and Mitchenson (1975), p. 12 The New Theatre opened on 12 March 1903 with a brief season consisting of a revival of Rosemary ‚Äì a play by Louis N. Parker and Murray Carson, starring Wyndham and his partner (later wife) Mary Moore ‚Äì and a special matin√©e of Wyndham's best-known production, David Garrick. The following month Johnston Forbes-Robertson transferred his production of The Light that Failed from the Lyric, after which there were seasons featuring Mrs Patrick Campbell and then Cyril Maude. Fred Terry and Julia Neilson played an annual season of about six months at the New from 1905 to 1913, including many revivals of their great success, The Scarlet Pimpernel. Between these seasons, productions at the New Theatre included Amasis, a comic opera by Frederick Fenn and Philip Michael Faraday (1906), with Ruth Vincent,\\"New Theatre\\", The Times, 10 August 1906, p. 3 and Count Hannibal (1910). In 1911 Terry presented As You Like It and Romeo and Juliet to introduce his daughter Phyllis to the stage. Between then and the First World War the theatre featured comedies and musical comedies.Mander and Mitchenson (1975), p. 13 Dion Boucicault became manager in December 1915 and opened with a revival of Peter Pan, revived each Christmas season until 1919. He produced a series of successes including new plays by Somerset Maugham, J. M. Barrie, Arthur Wing Pinero and A. A. Milne. Leon M. Lion presented a season in 1918‚Äì19 in which Katharine Cornell made her only appearance on the London stage, playing Jo in a dramatisation of Little Women.\\"Little Women\\", The Manchester Guardian, 11 October 1919, p. 12Mander and Mitchenson (1975), p. 14 =1920s= No√´l Coward and Esm√© Wynne in Coward's I'll Leave It to You, 1920 I'll Leave It to You, in 1920, was No√´l Coward's first staged play, and ran at the New for 37 performances.Mander and Mitchenson (2000), p. 36 Matheson Lang was associated with the New for several years, presenting and playing in Shakespeare and modern dramas. The London premiere of Bernard Shaw's St. Joan starring Sybil Thorndike followed in 1924.Mander and Mitchenson (1975), pp. 14‚Äì15 In July 1925 Robert Atkins took over management of the New, presenting Israel Zangwill's We Moderns. The following year and for most of 1927 the New was home to a dramatisation of Margaret Kennedy's The Constant Nymph, which ran for 587 performances, starring first Coward and then the young John Gielgud as Lewis Dodd. Towards the end of the decade, two comedies by P. G. Wodehouse and Ian Hay ‚Äì A Damsel in Distress (1928), and Baa Baa Black Sheep (1929) ran for 234 and 115 performances respectively. =1930s= In February 1933 Gielgud began a period of management at the theatre. He produced and starred in Gordon Daviot's , Richard of Bordeaux, which ran for 472 performances. He followed this in June 1934 with the same author's Queen of Scots starring Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, which ran for 106 performances. In November 1934 he presented Hamlet, which ran for 155 performances. After works by Hugh Walpole and Andre Obey, Gielgud presented a revival of Romeo and Juliet which had the longest run on record for that play: 186 performances. Peggy Ashcroft played Juliet and Edith Evans was the Nurse; Laurence Olivier played Romeo, and Gielgud Mercutio for the first part of the run and then exchanged roles. Gielgud concluded with Chekhov's The Seagull, directed by Theodore Komisarjevsky, a production that, according to The Times showed the play as \\"among the supreme masterpieces of the theatre\\".\\"New Theatre\\", The Times, 21 May 1936, p. 14 After Gielgud's tenure there was more Shakespeare at the New: As You Like with Edith Evans and Michael Redgrave; The Taming of the Shrew with Evans and Leslie Banks; and Macbeth with Olivier and Judith Anderson (all 1937). =1940s= During the Second World War the Old Vic was badly damaged by German bombs, and Sadler's Wells Theatre was requisitioned as a refuge for those made homeless by air- raids. The drama company of the former and the opera and ballet companies of the latter toured nationally throughout the war, and Bronson Albery, managing director of the New Theatre made it available to all three companies as a London base, although in practice the Old Vic company occupied the theatre more than the Sadler's Wells companies. The theatre historians Mander and Mitchenson single out productions of The Beggar's Opera, King John. The Cherry Orchard and Hamlet (with Robert Helpmann in the title role). In 1944, with the end of the war in sight, a reconstituted Old Vic company took possession of the New, starring Ralph Richardson, Olivier and Thorndike. The repertory that year comprised Ibsen's Peer Gynt, Shaw's Arms and the Man, Shakespeare's Richard III and Chekhov's Uncle Vanya. Between Old Vic seasons Robert Morley and Wendy Hiller starred in a Regency drama, The First Gentleman, which ran for 654 performances.Gaye, p. 1531 The 1945 Old Vic company season added Henry IV, Parts I and II and a celebrated double bill of Oedipus and The Critic. In September 1946 King Lear and Cyrano de Bergerac were given. Under a different management, Aldous Huxley's The Gioconda Smile was a success in 1948‚Äì49, running for 655 performances.Gaye, p. 1532Mander and Mitchenson (1975) pp. 15‚Äì16 =1950s and 1960s= In 1950 The Cocktail Party by T.

They included Jorrocks, a musical (1967, 181 performances); Gwen Watford and Gemma Jones in Howards End (1967, 137); Roy Dotrice playing multiple roles in the comedy World War 2 (1967, 166); the Prospect Company's production of Farquhar's The Constant Couple; Spring and Port Wine; Paul Scofield in John Osborne's The Hotel in Amsterdam; the controversial Soldiers in December 1968, and in April 1969 Anne of Green Gables, a new musical with Polly James in the lead. =1970s onward= A 1970 Royal Shakespeare Company production of Dion Boucicault's London Assurance, directed by Ronald Eyre, with Donald Sinden as Sir Harcourt Courtly, (for which he received the 1975 Drama Desk Special Award)Who's Who in the Theatre, 17th edition (1981), Roger Rees as Charles, Judi Dench as Grace and Dinsdale Landen as Dazzle, transferred to the New Theatre in 1972 for a year, prior to its 1974 run in New York. A revival of Oliver! ran from 1977 to 1980 In 1981, Children of a Lesser God won Olivier Awards for Best New Play and for actors Trevor Eve and Elizabeth Quinn. Among some of the 1980s productions is the 1994 revival of Turgenev's A Month in the Country starring Helen Mirren and John Hurt. In the 2000s the theatre has played host to several Shakespeare productions including a production of Twelfth Night set in India with an entirely Asian cast. The production played to packed houses and only closed as the Royal Shakespeare Company themselves had exclusive rights to perform their annual London season of Tragedies there. Between December 2004 and April 2005, they presented Hamlet, Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth, King Lear and a brand new production of Euripides' Hecuba starring Vanessa Redgrave. On 8 June 2005, Dion Boucicault's Victorian melodrama The Shaughraun opened; however, its success at the Dublin Gate Theatre was not repeated in London and it closed on 30 July. A dark period of around three months followed before the theatre was transferred to the ownership of Delfont Mackintosh Limited and reopened in October 2005 with The Right Size's new production Ducktastic!. Once again this failed to live up to expectations and closed just three weeks after opening on 19 November 2005. A short Christmas season of Patrick Stewart's one-man version of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol played from 6 to 31 December 2005, before the theatre hosted the Edinburgh International Festival hit drama Blackbird starring Roger Allam. The award-winning play Enron (directed by Rupert Goold, starring Samuel West and Tim Pigott-Smith) transferred here after a sellout run at the Royal Court. The European premiere of the Broadway hit, Avenue Q, started previewing on 2 June 2006 and had its opening night on 28 June 2006, finally closing on 28 March 2009 prior to transferring to the Gielgud Theatre. Following a production of Deathtrap, directed by Matthew Warchus and starring Simon Russell Beale and Jonathan Groff, the theatre became the home of jukebox musical Million Dollar Quartet in February 2011. =Recent, present and future productions= * Endgame (10 March 2004 ‚Äì 1 May 2004) by Samuel Beckett, starring Lee Evans and Michael Gambon * Suddenly Last Summer (14 May 2004 ‚Äì 31 July 2004) by Tennessee Williams, starring Diana Rigg * Twelfth Night (26 August 2004 ‚Äì 30 October 2004) by William Shakespeare, starring Raza Jaffrey and Kulvinder Ghir * The RSC's Hamlet (23 November 2004 ‚Äì 11 December 2004) by William Shakespeare, starring Toby Stephens * Peter Pan ‚Äì 100 Years of Peter Pan (19 December 2004) by JM Barrie * The RSC's Romeo and Juliet (21 December 2004 ‚Äì 8 January 2005) by William Shakespeare * The RSC's King Lear (18 January 2005 ‚Äì 5 February 2005) by William Shakespeare, starring Corin Redgrave * The RSC's Macbeth (16 February 2005 ‚Äì 5 March 2005) by William Shakespeare * The RSC's Hecuba (7 April 2005 ‚Äì 7 May 2005) by Tony Harrison, adapted from Euripides, starring Vanessa Redgrave * The Shaughraun (8 June 2005 ‚Äì 30 July 2005) by Dion Boucicault * Ducktastic!

He served as premier of the colony from 1865 to 1867, and from 1870 to 1872. He was premier of PEI in 1873 when the island joined Canadian confederation. He was born in Bedeque, Prince Edward Island, the son of Joseph Pope and Lucy Colledge. Pope was a successful businessman who was at one point the island's third largest shipowner. He entered PEI politics in 1857 when the island was still a colony of the United Kingdom. He was a member of the Conservative Party, and defended the rights of landowners against growing demands by tenant farmers for land reform. Pope was named to the Executive Council in 1859, joining the Conservative government of Edward Palmer. In 1865, he became Premier after a dispute over Canadian confederation resulted in Palmer and John Hamilton Gray resigning from the Executive Council. While not hostile to confederation, Pope did not agree with the terms set by the Quebec Conference. A particular problem was the unresolved land question, which pitted the demands of tenant farmers for land reform against demands by landlords for compensation. The question had led to violence, and, in 1865, Pope used soldiers to put down disturbances led by the Tenant League. The next year, his government negotiated the purchase of the large Cunard estate, which composed 15% of the island's land mass, in order to redistribute the land to over 1,000 tenants. The colony lacked the funds to purchase all the island's proprietary estates. Pope was in Britain during the London Conference (on the question of Confederation) of 1867, and persuaded delegates to agree to $800,000 being allocated by the federal treasury to buy proprietary lands on PEI so that they could be distributed to tenants. This was seen as bribery on the island, however, and divided the Tories, leading to their defeat in the 1867 election at the hands of the Liberals, who were more hostile to confederation. The Tories were also hurt by their reputation as being pro-landlord: the Tenant League campaigned to defeat the Pope government. Pope returned to the premiership in 1870 leading a coalition government of Conservatives and Liberals. The question of school funding and the role of separate schools divided the province and both political parties, and caused the fall of Robert Poore Haythorne's Liberal government. Pope was able to form a coalition between his Tories and dissident Liberals by promising not to act on the question of schools, or confederation, before an election. The new government instead moved to commence the construction of a railway on the island in 1871. The railway proved to be a severe economic burden that almost bankrupted the island. The government lost a by-election on the railway issue, and Pope, as a result, lost his governing majority in the House of Assembly, and was forced to resign in 1872. The financial crisis caused by the railway, and the ability of the Canadian government to bail the island out, was a major factor in the colony finally agreeing to seek to join Canadian confederation. The Liberal government of Robert Poore Haythorne sent a delegation to Ottawa, Ontario in February 1873 seeking terms to admission to Canada. Ottawa agreed to take over the railway, provide funds to settle the land question, assume the colony's debts and give the new province an annual subsidy. The Liberals called an election on the proposal. Pope's Tories argued that the terms were not good enough, and that, if elected, his government would obtain more favourable conditions. Pope's party won 20 out of 30 seats in the April election, and he proceeded to Ottawa where he persuaded the Canadian government to increase the promised annual subsidy to PEI by a further $25,000. PEI entered confederation on July 1, 1873. Pope's third stint as Premier ended in September 1873 when he won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. He did not run in the 1874 federal election, however, and returned to the province's House of Assembly in 1875, although he did not return to government. In 1876, he lost his seat in the provincial election which was fought on the issue of school funding and particularly separate schools. Pope's position was considered too moderate for voters who supported a secular system. The next year, he returned to the House of Commons and served as Minister of Marine and Fisheries from 1878 to 1882 in the Conservative government of Sir John A. Macdonald.

M. Barrie's Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up debuted on 27 December 1904. Many famous British actors have appeared here, including Basil Rathbone, who played Alfred de Musset in Madame Sand in June 1920, returning in November 1932 as the Unknown Gentleman in Tonight or Never. The theatre was Grade II listed by English Heritage in September 1960.English Heritage listing details accessed 28 April 2007 In the late 1970s the freehold of the theatre was purchased by Capital Radio and it closed in 1979 for refurbishment. It reopened in February 1980 and the first production under the patronage of Capital was Rose, starring Glenda Jackson. In 1991 comedian Pat Condell performed sketches at the theatre which were later released on DVD. The Ambassador Theatre Group bought the theatre in 1992; this coincided with the successful Royal Court production of Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden. A host of successes followed including the 21st anniversary performance of Richard O'Brien's The Rocky Horror Show and the Royal Court Classics Season in 1995.

It is used for making corn tortillas, gorditas, tamales, pupusas, and many other Latin American dishes. Its dried and powdered form is called masa harina, masa de harina, and sometimes Maseca, the name of one commercial brand. The flour is reconstituted with water to make a dough before it is used in cooking. In Spanish, masa harina translates to \\"dough flour\\", which can refer to many other types of dough. Preparation Field corn grain is dried and then treated by cooking the mature, hard grain in a diluted solution of slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or wood ash, and then letting it soak for many hours. The soaked maize is then rinsed thoroughly to remove the unpalatable flavor of the alkali themselves. This process is nixtamalization, and it produces hominy, which is ground into a relatively dry dough to create fresh masa. The fresh masa can be sold or used directly, or can be dehydrated and blended into a powder to create masa harina, or masa flour. Lime and ash are highly alkaline: the alkalinity helps the dissolution of hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the corn. Some of the corn oil is broken down into emulsifying agents (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the corn proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains. The chemical changes in masa allow dough formation, and also allow the nutrient niacin to be absorbed by the digestive tract. By contrast, untreated cornmeal is unable to form a dough on the addition of water, and a diet heavily reliant on its consumption is a risk factor for pellagra. Other uses The ground product can be called masa nixtamalera. In Central American and Mexican cuisine, masa nixtamalera is cooked with water and milk to make a thick, gruel-like beverage called atole. When made with chocolate and sugar, it becomes atole de chocolate. Adding anise and piloncillo to this mixture creates champurrado, a popular breakfast drink.

It is one of the smallest of the West End theatres, seating a maximum of 444, with 195 people in the dress circle and 251 in the stalls. History The theatre was, along with the adjacent St Martin's conceived by their architect, W. G. R. Sprague, as companions, born at the same time in 1913, but the First World War interrupted the construction of the latter for three years. The Ambassadors was built with the intention of being an intimate, smaller theatre and is situated opposite the renowned restaurant The Ivy, favourite haunt of the theatrical elite. The theatre was Grade II listed by English Heritage in March 1973. The stage door c.2000 =New Ambassadors era= In 1996, the venue was bought by its namesake the Ambassador Theatre Group, now the largest operator of theatres in the West End. It was first split into two small spaces, by creating a false floor at circle level, and used by the Royal Court. Then in 1999 the venue was returned to its original design,Theatre website History page.

However, within a few years the theatre had largely reverted to playing material seen as more commercially viable for its location in the West End. On 4 April 2007 it was announced that ATG had sold the venue to Stephen Waley-Cohen, who renamed the venue The Ambassadors as it once was, and began an extensive programme of refurbishments. In 2014, Waley- Cohen announced plans to sell the Ambassadors to Delfont Mackintosh Theatres, who said it intended to rename the theatre after Stephen Sondheim once the sale was completed.

Productions  Vivien Leigh made her West End debut in the Ambassadors, starring in The Mask of Virtue (1935); this was the play in which Laurence Olivier first saw her perform. The theatre's most famous production is Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, which showed from 1952 to 1974 before moving next door to the St Martin's Theatre, where it is still running. After its purchase by the Ambassador Theatre Group under producer Sonia Friedman, productions included Some Explicit Polaroids by Mark Ravenhill, Spoonface Steinberg by Lee Hall, Krapp's Last Tape by Samuel Beckett and starring John Hurt, and was the West End's first home of Marie Jones' Stones in His Pockets and The Vagina Monologues by Eve Ensler. Recent productions have included the multi-award-winning production of John Doyle's Sweeney Todd which subsequently transferred to Broadway, Ying Tong ‚Äì A Walk with the Goons, Someone Who'll Watch Over Me, Journey's End and the world premi√®re of Kate Betts' On the Third Day which won the Channel 4 television series The Play's the Thing. In 2006, the theatre played host to the landmark revival of Peter Hall's production of Waiting for Godot which ran for a strictly limited autumn season. Recent productions include the Menier Chocolate Factory production of Little Shop of Horrors, the Bush Theatre's production of Whipping it Up, starring Richard Wilson and Robert Bathurst, and Love Song, starring Cillian Murphy and Neve Campbell (November 2006 to February 2007).

Sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick gathered with officials of the British government to draft the British North America Act, 1867. The Canadian delegates met at the Westminster Palace Hotel, just across the street from the Parliament buildings. The London Conference was a continuation of the Quebec Conference held earlier about the seventy-two Resolutions. A major issue of contention was the education system, with Roman Catholic bishops lobbying for guarantees protecting the separate school system. This was opposed by delegates from the Maritimes, and the compromise reached was Section 93 of the Act, which guaranteed separate school systems in Quebec and Ontario but not in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. The result of this meeting was the British North America Act. This was the last of the conferences discussing Confederation. John A. Macdonald was the chairman of the conference. Queen Victoria assented to the bill and the Dominion of Canada was created when it came into force on July 1, 1867.

The house currently has 986 seats on three levels. The theatre was designed by W. G. R. Sprague and opened on 27 December 1906 as the Hicks Theatre, named after Seymour Hicks, for whom it was built. The first play at the theatre was a hit musical called The Beauty of Bath co-written by Hicks. Another big success was A Waltz Dream in 1908. In 1909, the American impresario Charles Frohman became manager of the theatre and renamed the house the Globe Theatre ‚Äì a name that it retained for 85 years. Call It a Day opened in 1935 and ran for 509 performances, a long run for the slow inter-war years. There's a Girl in My Soup, opening in 1966, ran for almost three years, a record for the theatre that was not surpassed until Daisy Pulls It Off opened in April 1983 to run for 1,180 performances. Refurbished in 1987, the theatre has since presented several Alan Ayckbourn premieres, including Man of the Moment (1990), as well as a notable revival of An Ideal Husband in 1992. During reconstruction of Shakespeare's Globe theatre on the South Bank, in 1994 the theatre was renamed the Gielgud Theatre in honour of John Gielgud. Another refurbishment was completed in 2008. The Globe's theatre cat, Beerbohm, became famous enough to receive a front-page obituary in the theatrical publication The Stage in 1995. History =Early years= The theatre opened on 27 December 1906 as the Hicks Theatre in honour of actor, manager and playwright Seymour Hicks, for whom it was built. Designed by W.G.R. Sprague in Louis XVI style, the theatre originally had 970 seats, but over the years boxes and other seats have been removed. The theatre is a pair with the Queen's Theatre, which opened in 1907 on the adjacent street corner. The first play at the theatre was a musical called The Beauty of Bath by Hicks and Cosmo Hamilton. My Darling, another Hicks musical, followed in 1907, followed by the original London production of Brewster's Millions, and the next year, the long-running London premiere production of the Straus operetta, A Waltz Dream . An astonishing event occurred midway through the run of the theatre's next major work, a musical titled The Dashing Little Duke (1909), which was produced by Hicks. Hicks' wife, Ellaline Terriss, played the title role (a woman playing a man). When she missed several performances due to illness, Hicks stepped into the role ‚Äì possibly the only case in the history of musical theatre where a husband succeeded to his wife's role.Seymour Hicks at the British Musical Theatre website, 31 August 2004.

It is home to the DuSable Museum of African American History. The park was the proposed site of the Olympic Stadium and the Olympic Aquatics Center in Chicago's bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics. It and surrounding neighborhoods have gone through notable and often turbulent racial transitions. History In the mid-to-late 19th century, a large number of Irish and German railroad workers and meatpackers made Washington Park home. There was a sprinkling of African American residents in the working-class district south of Garfield Boulevard/55th Street. Affluent American-born European Americans settled the wide north-south avenues that provided a direct route into the Loop to the north. Cable cars, the Chicago 'L' and wide boulevards contributed to late 19th century prosperity. The wide avenues, especially Grand Boulevard (now named Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Drive), provided popular locations for mansions and grand apartments built by many wealthy Chicagoans. The park in this community area was named for President George Washington in 1880. In the 1920s, the University of Chicago created the community area system of city subdivision with the current names that continue to be used today. The community areas although not formally adopted by the United States Census Bureau are largely consistent with census tract boundaries. The Washington Park community area and its census tracts have been unchanged. = Changing demographics = A turn-of-the-20th-century apartment construction boom allowed the expansion of Chicago's African American ghetto southward, and the original inhabitants mostly left the area. The transition was rapid and marked with conflicts such as the Race Riot of 1919. Some white Protestants left to form an exclusive residential community in the South Shore community area. In 1906 they formed the South Shore Country Club, which excluded Blacks and Jews from membership. The area rapidly changed from European American to African-American in the 1920s. By 1930, the population was only 7.8% white. By 1960, the population was 0.5% white.Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 The Encyclopedia of Chicago, p. 1044. The University of Chicago Press, From 1950 to 2000 the total population of the neighborhood declined from 57,000 to 14,146. This population decline is partly due to initiatives of the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, who acted under the 1955 Amendment to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act, which empowered redevelopment authorities that have acquired land by condemnation or otherwise to redevelop such lands for non- residential uses. A good example of the Land Clearing commission activities is the Lake Meadows Park to the north of Washington Park. The failure of the evolution of industry and commerce in the community, the above-mentioned white flight and land redevelopment for non-residential use combined lead to population decline.  Religion  Religion and worship are cornerstones of the South Side communities. The nearby hub of Bronzeville at 47th and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive (known as King Drive and formerly Grand Boulevard) was a cultural center of the rising ghetto that fostered a cultural identity. In keeping with the racial transformation, the cultural and religious institutions, including those of Irish Catholics, Greek Orthodoxy and the Jewish faith, converted to African American institutions.  Structures  The neighborhood once contained many public housing complexes including about a third of the nation's largest, the Robert Taylor Homes. The Taylor homes have been demolished because of the socioeconomic problems that they perpetuated. The area has minimal industry or commerce at the current time. The other property on the NRHP in the area is the Schulze Baking Company Plant. The DuSable Museum of African American History, founded in 1961, moved to Washington Park in 1973. It is a Washington Park landmark and one of the largest African American museums in the country. = Namesakes = Several nearby regions and institutions use Washington Park in their name. Immediately to the south, Washington Park Subdivision exists where Washington Park Race Track once stood. One city block to the north, Washington Park Court District is a neighborhood that has become a Chicago Landmark. In literature and culture The Washington Park neighborhood has been the setting for works of popular literature. James T. Farrell's Studs Lonigan trilogy is set in Washington Park. In Richard Wright's novel Native Son, Bigger Thomas drives the drunken Jan Erlone and Mary Dalton around Washington Park, as the two embrace. In addition to hosting the DuSable Museum, the park hosts Fountain of Time, the world's earliest concrete finished art work. Additionally, the aforementioned adjacent Washington Park Subdivision has been the subject of notable literature. The conditions of this neighborhood are described in a section of Black Metropolis by St. Clair Drake and Horace Roscoe Cayton. The play Raisin in the Sun was inspired by Lorraine Hansberry's time in the neighborhood after her father won the repeal of restrictive covenants. The Hansberry house, the red brick three-flat at 6140 S.

An escapement, part of every mechanical clock, is the mechanism that gives the clock's pendulum periodic pushes to keep it swinging, and each swing releases the clock's gears to move forward by a fixed amount, thus moving the hands forward at a steady rate. The grasshopper escapement was used in a few regulator clocks built during Harrison's time, and a few others over the years, but has never seen wide use. The term \\"grasshopper\\" in this connection, apparently from the kicking action of the pallets, first appears in the Horological Journal in the late 19th century. History John Harrison used the grasshopper escapement in his regulator clocks, and also for the first three of his marine timekeepers, H1 - H3. Determining longitudinal position was a major problem in marine navigation; Newton argued that astronomical positioning could be used, but an easier theoretical possibility was to use accurate knowledge of the time at a specific base location. The difference in time between local time, which was easy to measure, and the time at base gives the difference in longitude between the base and the ship, since 24 hours of time is equivalent to 360 degrees of longitude. A large prize was offered for a solution to the problem and Harrison devoted his life to devising and building highly accurate timekeepers. Precision and friction were the main problems. Two advantages of the grasshopper escapement are the repeatability of its operation and that it does not need lubrication. The repeatability of its operation is inherent in its design. One pallet is released only by the engagement of the other; the impulse given to the pendulum is thus completely regular in its timing. Lubricants available to Harrison were poor, messy and short-lived. This meant that conventional clocks had to be stopped frequently for cleaning and oiling. Using his clean and absolutely stable grasshopper escapement Harrison began a series of long-term investigations into the performance of clocks, leading to his invention of the gridiron pendulum which counteracted the effects of expansion and contraction with changing temperature. The performance of his improved clocks in turn gave him an accurate, convenient standard against which to test his marine timekeepers. Operation Animation of a grasshopper escapement in motion. This shows a modified version which has counterweighted pallet arms and spring stops. Harrison developed the grasshopper escapement from a conventional anchor escapement which he built for a turret clock to go in the stable block at Brocklesby Park in Lincolnshire. This proved to be unreliable, needing repeated attention by which Harrison was inconvenienced, so around 1722 he modified the escapement by putting a hinge in the middle of each arm of the anchor. The hinged pallets both pointed the same way, opposing the rotation of the escape wheel. As the escape wheel pushes the pallet, the hinge moves away from the escape wheel. The pallet pivots about its contact point with the wheel as it pushes the anchor. At the same time, the other pallet is approaching the wheel. When it contacts the wheel, it pushes it backwards slightly and contact between the wheel and the first pallet is broken. Both the pallets are slightly tail-heavy so that they naturally tend to move away from the wheel. The first pallet therefore moves out of the path of the escape wheel and the job of impulsing the pendulum passes to the second pallet. The first pallet comes to rest against a stop which holds it in the correct position so that when the pendulum is reaching the end of its travel, pushed by the second pallet, the first pallet swings down into the path of the wheel again. It makes contact with the wheel and, driven by the momentum of the pendulum, pushes the wheel backwards slightly. This releases the second pallet, which retires gracefully to its stop, having transferred the task of impulsing the pendulum to the first pallet again. The small movement of the pallet on its hinge involves far less friction than the sliding contact in a conventional escapement; it needs no lubrication and there is so little wear that Harrison was able to make his pallets from wood. One of the original pallets at Brocklesby Park was still working when the clock was renovated in 2005 while the other was only replaced following an accident in 1880. Harrison later modified the layout of the escapement by having one pallet pull rather than push, putting a little hook at the end of the pivoted arm to contact the teeth of the escape wheel. He also put both hinge axes together on a common pin. When the pallet is pushing the escape wheel backwards it is also being driven hard against its stop. To prevent wear, or damage, the stops are designed to give way. Each stop is hinged about the same axis as its pallet. The pallets are tail-heavy but the stops are nose-heavy, tending to fall towards the wheel. The stops are sufficiently nose-heavy that the combination of pallet plus stop also tends to fall towards the wheel but this is prevented by a fixed pin on the anchor. This means that the pin holds the stop which holds the pallet in just the right place to engage cleanly with the escape wheel. When the pallet meets the wheel, it pushes the wheel backwards and as it does it lifts the stop off its pin. When the wheel then pushes the pallet, the stop comes back down onto its pin and parts company with its pallet. Each stop is also lifted off its pin once in each cycle by the momentum of the arriving pallet. Limitations The tendency of the pallets to move out of the path of the wheel has some serious consequences. The first is that any time that the drive to the escape wheel is interrupted the pallets lose contact and when the drive is restored, the escape wheel may not be restrained and may accelerate rapidly and uncontrollably. To prevent this happening while the clock was being wound, Harrison invented one of his longest-lasting mechanisms, a maintaining power which is still widely used in clocks and watches. In its usual construction this consists of a ratchet wheel sandwiched between, and co-axial with, the first (and slowest-turning) driving gear of the movement and the barrel that the weight (or spring) is attached to. When the clock is wound, the barrel goes backwards and a ratchet on the maintaining wheel slips over teeth cut on the barrel. The first gear is still driven forward however because there is a spring between the maintaining wheel and the first gear which pushes against it. As it does so it tries to push the maintaining wheel backwards. This is prevented from happening by a pawl fixed to the frame of the clock which engages with ratchet teeth cut round the edge of the maintaining wheel. Once the clock is fully wound, pressure on the key is released and the barrel drives the maintaining wheel and the first gear in the normal way. It also rewinds the maintaining spring ready for the next time the clock is wound. During normal operation the pawl that stops the maintaining wheel from going backwards simply slips over the teeth of the maintaining wheel. The second consequence of the pallets' tendency to move out of the path of the wheel is that when the clock runs down and stops both pallets return to their stops. Unless the ends of one of the pallets is long enough to sit into the gap between the teeth of the escape wheel then the wheel will run free as soon as the clock is wound. The same problem can arise if the hinges for the stops get dirty and stick in a raised position. Unlike most other escapements of its time, the grasshopper pushes the pendulum back and forth throughout its cycle; it is never allowed to swing freely. Around the same time as Harrison invented the grasshopper, George Graham introduced the deadbeat escapement,Andrewes, W.J.H., Clocks and Watches: The leap to precision in invented by Richard Towneley in 1675, which allowed the pendulum to be damped by friction during most of its cycle, impulsed rapidly and subject to an unpredictable interruption of impulse as the escape wheel advanced. Nonetheless, this escapement became the standard in precision regulator clocks until late in the nineteenth century. Because of its various idiosyncrasies, the grasshopper escapement was never used widely. Harrison used it in his prototype marine chronometers, H1 - H3, and Justin and Benjamin Vulliamy made a small number of regulators using Harrison's design,Betts, Jonathan; Regulator Clock in but generally it remains today what it was in Harrison's time: a brilliant, unique curiosity.  John Taylor's Corpus Clock  A unique public clock built as a tribute to John Harrison's grasshopper escapement, the Corpus Clock, was unveiled at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University, in Cambridge, England on 19 September 2008. Industrialist John Taylor spent ¬£1 million building the mechanical clock. Feeling that Harrison's escapement was not well enough known, the clock's grasshopper escapement is exposed on the top of the clock, built in the form of a demonic grasshopper called the \\"Chronophage\\" or \\"time eater\\", which rhythmically opens and closes its jaws, representing time being devoured. The clock, 1.5 metres in diameter, has many other notable features. It has no hands, but rather uses three concentric pairs of stacked annular disks‚Äîone pair each for hours, minutes and seconds‚Äîslotted and lensed to allow the selective escape of light from an enclosed, continuously lit set of light emitting diodes. The arrangement of slots in each disk, along with the rotation of the foremost disk of each pair, creates a Vernier effect, producing the illusion of lights rotating at various speeds about three concentric circumferences on the clock's face. The pendulum speeds up, slows down, and sometimes stops, but returns to the correct time every five minutes. Taylor designed the clock to remind himself of his own mortality.Barr, Robert Cambridge's fantastical new clock even tells time, NBC News, retrieved September 19, 2008  Parmigiani Senfine  A grasshopper-type escapement is used in an entirely new mechanism intended for wristwatches. This new type of mechanical regulator uses flexible structures both in the escapement and the oscillator. A silicon wheel oscillates about 86,400 times an hour, approximately three times faster than in conventional wristwatches. The initial development was done at the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) with Pierre Genequand, a Swiss physicist, as lead inventor.Daniel Hug: Das Ende des Ticktacks.

Burgess Clock B  A grasshopper escapement is an essential part of a sculptural clock by Martin Burgess, known as Burgess Clock B. One of a pair based on the technology of the late regulator clock by John Harrison, it was completed by Charles Frodsham & Company at the request of its owner, Donald Saff. After successful testing there it was transferred to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich for a detailed assessment of its long-term performance. This was overseen by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers and the National Physical Laboratory, whose representatives attached tamper-proof seals to the case of the clock. Although the clock is electrically-wound, thus preventing any disturbance whatever of the clock during the assessment, it is otherwise entirely mechanical. At the end of a period of one hundred days, the maximum error had not exceeded five- eighths of a second - no allowance for a steady drift of time (rate) having had to be applied. As a result, on the 18th of April 2015, the Guinness World Records organisation presented a World Record certificate http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/4/video-how-%e2%80%9cperfect- clock%e2%80%9d-redefines-timekeeping-history-300-years-on-377653 to Martin Burgess for having made the most accurate purely mechanical clock working in free air. The clock remains at the ROG; in 2017 it was moved to the gallery containing the Harrison marine timekeepers where its performance continues to be monitored.

There she takes over as guide from the Latin poet Virgil because, as a pagan, Virgil cannot enter Paradise and because, being the incarnation of beatific love, as her name implies, it is Beatrice who leads into the beatific vision. Just as Virgil represents human reason, so does Beatrice represent divine revelation, theology, faith, contemplation and grace. Scholars have long debated whether the historical Beatrice is intended to be identified with either or both of the Beatrices in Dante's writings. She was apparently the daughter of the banker Folco Portinari, and was married to another banker, Simone dei Bardi. Dante claims to have met a \\"Beatrice\\" only twice, on occasions separated by nine years, but was so affected by the meetings that he carried his love for her throughout his life. Biography =Life= The tradition that identifies Bice di Folco Portinari as the Beatrice loved by Dante is now widely, though not unanimously, accepted by scholars. Boccaccio, in his commentary on the Divine Comedy, was the first one to explicitly refer to the young woman; all later references are dependent on his unsubstantiated identification. Clear documents on her life have always been scarce, helping to make even her existence doubtful. The only hard evidence is the will of Folco Portinari from 1287 which says \\"...item d. Bici filie sue et uxoris d. Simonis del Bardis reliquite ..., lib.50 ad floren\\"‚Äîessentially a bequest to his daughter who was married to Simone dei Bardi. Folco Portinari was a rich banker, born in Portico di Romagna. He moved to Florence and lived in a house near Dante where he had six daughters. Folco also gave generously to found the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Beatrice and Dante According to Dante, he first met Beatrice when his father took him to the Portinari house for a May Day party. They were both nine years old at the time, though Beatrice was a few months younger than Dante. Dante was instantly taken with her and remained so throughout his life even though she married another man, the banker Simone dei Bardi, in 1287. Dante married Gemma Donati in 1285 and had children. Yet in spite of this, he maintained a deep love and respect for Beatrice, even after her death in 1290. After Beatrice's death, Dante withdrew into intense study and began composing poems dedicated to her memory. The collection of these poems, along with others he had previously written in his journal in awe of Beatrice, became La Vita Nuova. Dante and Beatrice, by Henry Holiday. Dante looks longingly at Beatrice (in center) passing by with friend Lady Vanna (red) along the Arno River According to the autobiographic La Vita Nuova, Beatrice and Dante met only twice during their lives. Even less credible is the numerology behind these encounters, marking out Dante's life in periods of nine years. This amount of time falls in line with Dante's repeated use of the number three or multiples of, derived from the Holy Trinity. It is more likely that the encounters with Beatrice that Dante writes of are the two that fulfill his poetic vision, and Beatrice, like Petrarch's Laura, seem to blur the line between an actual love interest and a means employed by the poet in his creations. Following their first meeting, Dante was so enthralled by Beatrice that he later wrote in La Vita Nuova: Ecce Deus fortior me, qui veniens dominabitur michi (\\"Behold, a deity stronger than I; who coming, shall rule over me\\"). Indeed, Dante frequented parts of Florence, his home city, where he thought he might catch even a glimpse of her. As he did so, he made great efforts to ensure his thoughts of Beatrice remained private, even writing poetry for another lady, so as to use her as a \\"screen for the truth\\". Dante's courtly love for Beatrice continued for nine years, before the pair finally met again. This meeting occurred in a street of Florence, which she walked along dressed in white and accompanied by two older women. She turned and greeted him, her salutation filling him with such joy that he retreated to his room to think about her. In doing so, he fell asleep, and had a dream which would become the subject of the first sonnet in La Vita Nuova. Beatrice used to pray at Santa Margherita de' Cerchi where she is interred In this dream, a mighty figure appeared before him, and spoke to him. Although he could not make out all the figure said, he managed to hear \\"Ego dominus tuus\\", which means \\"I am your Lord\\". In the figure's arms was Beatrice, sleeping and covered by a crimson cloth. The figure woke Beatrice, and made her eat Dante's burning heart. An English translation of this event, as described in La Vita Nuova, appears below: This was the last encounter between the pair, since Beatrice died eight years later at the age of twenty-five in 1290. Tomb of Beatrice in Santa Margherita de' Cerchi. The manner in which Dante chose to express his love for Beatrice often agreed with the Middle Ages concept of courtly love. Courtly love was very formal; a sometimes secret, often unrequited and highly respectful form of admiration for another person. Yet it is still not entirely clear what caused Dante to fall in love with Beatrice. Since he knew very little of the real Beatrice, and that he had no great insight to her character, it is perhaps unusual that he did. But he did, and there are clues in his works as to why: Dante saw Beatrice as a saviour, one who removed all evil intentions from him. It is perhaps this idea of her being a force for good that he fell in love with, a force which he believed made him a better person. This is certainly viable, since he does not seem concerned with her appearance‚Äîat least not in his writings. He only once describes her complexion, and her \\"emerald\\" eyes. =Influence on Dante's work= Inferno, in an illustration by Gustave Dor√©. Beatrice's influence was far from simple inspiration. According to Dante, he first met Beatrice when his father took him to the Portinari house for a May Day party. They were both nine years old at the time, though Beatrice was a few months younger than Dante. She appeared as a character in his two greatest works‚ÄîLa Vita Nuova and Divine Comedy. She first appeared in the autobiographical text La Vita Nuova, which Dante wrote in about 1293. The book was filled with poems and also prose that is autoethnographical in form as it connects the poems to Beatrice to his social and romantic reality. The writing is almost entirely complimentary to her; she was described as \\"gentilissima\\" and \\"benedetta\\" (meaning \\"most kind\\" and \\"blessed\\" respectively). Having already referred to Beatrice as his salvation, this idea is further touched upon in Divine Comedy, where she appears as a guide through Heaven who caused his trip through the afterlife so he might see what awaits him. Here she is described as being \\"maternal, radiant and comforting\\". Although they converse in personal terms, very rarely did their relationship extend beyond a casual street ceremony. However, upon invitation of a friend, Dante was in attendance at a customary event where maids of honor support a new bride during her first meal with the groom, and Beatrice, along with other maids of honor, were in attendance. Dante prior to seeing Beatrice asked his friend, \\"Why have we come here to these women?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúTo make sure they‚Äôre properly attended to‚Äù (La Vita Nuova in digitaldante, 2012). Dante recounts this experience in La Vita Nuova by noting: \\"No sooner did I make this suggestion than I thought I sensed the appearance of a marvelous trembling that started on the left side of my chest and spread rapidly throughout my entire body. Then I had to prop myself, surreptitiously, against one of the pictures that ran around the walls of this house; and fearing that someone might have noticed my shaking, I raised my eyes, and looking around at the women, among them I saw that most gracious of creatures, Beatrice.\\" Dante believed that some of the other women and Beatrice were \\"making fun\\" of his physical state and so he wrote a sonnet, present in La Vita Nuova, that begins, ‚ÄúWith other women‚Äù (La Vita Nuova in digitaldante, 2012). Any romantic exchange between Dante and Beatrice in The Divine Comedy is no more than the imagination of Dante. In popular culture Beatrice Portinari has been immortalized not only in Dante's poems but in paintings by Pre-Raphaelite masters and poets in the nineteenth century. Subjects taken from Dante Alighieri's La Vita Nuova (which Rossetti had translated into English) and mostly the idealisation of Beatrice Portinari had inspired a great deal of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's art in the 1850s, in particular after the death of his wife Elizabeth Siddal. He idealised her image as Dante's Beatrice in a number of paintings, such as Beata Beatrix. Beatrice has also been immortalised in space, as asteroid 83 Beatrix is named in her honour. The Dante Alighieri Academy Beatrice Campus, a Catholic high school in Toronto, Ontario, Canada is named after Portinari. In A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket, Snicket's love interest is named Beatrice, after Portinari. The relationship between the characters is very similar to that of Beatrice and Dante. In the animated miniseries Over the Garden Wall the woods called the Unknown is implied multiple times throughout the series to be some form of afterlife. Here, the main characters Wirt and Greg are guided through the Unknown by a bluebird named Beatrice.

Queen Katherine's Dream by William Blake, c. 1825. NGA 11638, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. The play's second scene introduces King Henry VIII, and shows his reliance on Wolsey as his favourite. Queen Katherine enters to protest about Wolsey's abuse of the tax system for his own purposes; Wolsey defends himself, but when the King revokes the Cardinal's measures, Wolsey spreads a rumour that he himself is responsible for the King's action. Katherine also challenges the arrest of Buckingham, but Wolsey defends the arrest by producing the Duke's Surveyor, the primary accuser. After hearing the Surveyor, the King orders Buckingham's trial to occur. At a banquet thrown by Wolsey, the King and his attendants enter in disguise as masquers. The King dances with Anne Bullen. Two anonymous Gentlemen open Act II, one giving the other an account of Buckingham's treason trial. Buckingham himself enters in custody after his conviction, and makes his farewells to his followers and to the public. After his exit, the two Gentlemen talk about court gossip, especially Wolsey's hostility toward Katherine. The next scene shows Wolsey beginning to move against the Queen, while the nobles Norfolk and Suffolk look on critically. Wolsey introduces Cardinal Campeius and Gardiner to the King; Campeius has come to serve as a judge in the trial Wolsey is arranging for Katherine. Anne Bullen is shown conversing with the Old Lady who is her attendant. Anne expresses her sympathy at the Queen's troubles; but then the Lord Chamberlain enters to inform her that the King has made her Marchioness of Pembroke. Once the Lord Chamberlain leaves, the Old Lady jokes about Anne's sudden advancement in the King's favour.

Katherine reproaches Wolsey for his machinations against her, and refuses to stay for the proceedings. But the King defends Wolsey, and states that it was his own doubts about the legitimacy of their marriage that led to the trial. Campeius protests that the hearing cannot continue in the Queen's absence, and the King grudgingly adjourns the proceeding. Wolsey and Campeius confront Katherine among her ladies-in-waiting; Katherine makes an emotional protest about her treatment. Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey, and the Lord Chamberlain are shown plotting against Wolsey. A packet of Wolsey's letters to the Pope have been re-directed to the King; the letters show that Wolsey is playing a double game, opposing Henry's planned divorce from Katherine to the Pope while supporting it to the King. The King shows Wolsey his displeasure, and Wolsey for the first time realises that he has lost Henry's favour. The noblemen mock Wolsey, and the Cardinal sends his follower Cromwell away so that Cromwell will not be brought down in Wolsey's fall from grace. The two Gentlemen return to observe and comment upon the lavish procession for Anne Bullen's coronation as Queen, which passes over the stage in their presence. Afterward they are joined by a third Gentleman, who updates them on more court gossip ‚Äì the rise of Thomas Cromwell in royal favour, and plots against Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Katherine is shown, ill; she has a vision of dancing spirits. Caputius visits her; Katherine expresses her continuing loyalty to the King despite their divorce, and wishes the new Queen well. The King summons a nervous Cranmer to his presence, and expresses his support; later, when Cranmer is shown disrespect by the King's Council, Henry reproves them and displays his favour of the churchman. Anne Bullen gives birth to a daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth. In the play's closing scenes, the Porter and his Man complain about trying to control the massive and enthusiastic crowds that attend the infant Elizabeth's christening; another lush procession is followed by a prediction of the glories of the new born princess's future reign and that of her successor. The Epilogue, acknowledging that the play is unlikely to please everyone, asks nonetheless for the audience's approval. Sources As usual in his history plays, Shakespeare relied primarily on Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles to achieve his dramatic ends and to accommodate official sensitivities over the materials involved.G. Blakemore Evans, general editor, The Riverside Shakespeare, Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p. 977. Shakespeare not only telescoped events that occurred over a span of two decades, but jumbled their actual order. The play implies, without stating it directly, that the treason charges against the Duke of Buckingham were false and trumped up; and it maintains a comparable ambiguity about other sensitive issues. The disgrace and beheading of Anne Boleyn (here spelled Bullen) is carefully avoided, and no indication of the succeeding four wives of Henry VIII can be found in the play. However, Catherine of Aragon's plea to Henry before the Legatine Court seems to have been taken straight from historical record. Date Dame Ellen Terry as Queen Katherine of AragonMost modern scholars date Henry VIII to 1613, the year in which the Globe Theatre burned down during one of the play's earliest known performances. One contemporary report states that the play was new at the time of the fire, having \\"been acted not passing 2 or 3 times before\\".Gordon McMullan, ed. Henry VIII (London: Thomson, 2000), pp. 57‚Äì60. Despite this evidence, there has been much debate about the date of the work. Nicholas Rowe in 1709 wrote that the play must date from after the death of Elizabeth in 1603 because its \\"E[u]logy upon Q. Elizabeth, and her Successor K. James, in the latter end of his Henry VIII, is a Proof of that Play's being written after the Accession of the latter of those two Princes to the Crown of England\\".Nicholas Rowe, \\"Some Account of the Life &c.; of Mr. William Shakespear\\", 1709. Rowe was writing before the discovery of the document on the 1613 fire, which was first published by the 18th century scholar Thomas Tyrwhitt and seemed to confirm his view. However, several 18th- and 19th-century scholars, including Samuel Johnson, Lewis Theobald, George Steevens, Edmond Malone, and James Halliwell-Phillipps, dated the play's composition to before 1603. Malone suggested that the brief passage in praise of James was probably added for a performance during his reign but that the extended glorification of Elizabeth implies that it was intended for her ears. James \\"hated her memory\\", so such praise was not likely to have been written under him. Malone mistook the 12 Feb 1604 Stationer's Register entry of \\"the Enterlude of K. Henry VIII\\" (Samuel Rowley's When You See Me You Know Me, 1605) as Shakespeare's play, and he argued that the reference to the newness of the play in 1613 derived from the fact that it had been expanded with a new prologue and epilogue, perhaps written by Ben Jonson.Edmond Malone, The Plays of William Shakspeare, vol 2, 1790, pp. 150ff. In fact, Shakespeare's play was first registered on 8 November 1623, along with 15 other previously unpublished works, in preparation for the publication of the 1623 First Folio. Halliwell-Phillipps also took the view that the play performed in 1613 was an altogether different work.James Halliwell-Phillipps, The Works of William Shakespeare, Collier, p. 167. These views are no longer held by most modern scholars. Plays offering positive portrayals of major Tudor figures like Henry VIII (When You See Me You Know Me) and Queen Elizabeth (If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody by Thomas Heywood, 1605) were in fact performed, published, and re-published throughout the Stuart era.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 342, 472. Since the play is now generally believed to be one of Shakespeare's collaborations with John Fletcher, the 1613 date is consistent with other such collaborations. Authorship John Fletcher, probably the author of more than half of the play The play was published as the work of Shakespeare, and was accepted as such by scholars until 1850, when the possibility of collaboration with John Fletcher was first raised by James Spedding, an expert on Francis Bacon.Spedding, James. \\"Who Wrote Henry VIII?\\" Gentleman's Magazine, 178 / new series 34, August 1850, pp. 115‚Äì23. Fletcher was the writer who replaced Shakespeare as the principal playwright of the King's Men. He is known to have collaborated with Shakespeare on other plays, but there is no contemporary evidence of it for this play; the evidence lies in the style of the verse, which in some scenes appears closer to Fletcher's typical style than Shakespeare's. It is also not known whether Fletcher's involvement can be characterised as collaboration or revision, though the apparent division of scenes between the writers strongly suggests the former. Spedding and other early commentators relied on a range of distinctive features in Fletcher's style and language preferences, which they saw in the Shakespearean play. For the next century the question of dual authorship was controversial, with more evidence accumulating in favour of the collaborative hypothesis. In 1966, Erdman and Fogel could write that \\"today a majority of scholars accept the theory of Fletcher's partial authorship, though a sturdy minority deny it.\\"Erdman, David V., and Ephraim G. Fogel, eds. Evidence for Authorship: Essays on Problems of Attribution. Ithaca, N.Y., Cornell University Press, 1966; p. 457. For a summary of scholarship to that date, see: pp. 457‚Äì78. An influential stylistic or stylometric study was undertaken by Cyrus Hoy, who in 1962 divided the play between Shakespeare and Fletcher based on their distinctive word choices, for example Fletcher's uses of ye for you and 'em for them.Hoy, Cyrus. \\"The Shares of Fletcher and his Collaborators in the Beaumont and Fletcher Canon.\\" Studies in Bibliography 15 (1962); pp. 71‚Äì90. In the mid-nineteenth century, James Spedding had proposed a similar division based on the use of eleven-syllable lines; he arrived at the same conclusions Hoy would reach a century later.John M. Berdan and Tucker Brooke (1925). The Life of King Henry the Eighth Yale UP, pp. 155‚Äì57. The Spedding- Hoy division is generally accepted, although subsequent studies have questioned some of its details.Hope, Jonathan. The Authorship of Shakespeare's Plays. (CUP, 1994) pp. 67‚Äì83. The most common delineation of the two poets' shares in the play is this: :Shakespeare: Act I, scenes i and ii; II,iii and iv; III,ii, lines 1‚Äì203 (to exit of King); V,i. :Fletcher: Prologue; I,iii; II,i and ii; III,i, and ii, 203‚Äì458 (after exit of King); IV,i and ii; V ii‚Äìv; Epilogue.Erdman and Fogel, p. 457. Performance John Lowin, possibly the first actor to play Henry Henry VIII is believed to have been first performed as part of the ceremonies celebrating the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in 1612‚Äì1613, although the first recorded performance was on 29 June 1613. The performance is especially noteworthy because of the fire that destroyed the Globe Theatre during the performance, as described in several contemporary documents. These confirm that the fire took place on that date. One often reported tradition associated with the play involves John Downes, promptor of the Duke of York's Company from 1662 to 1706. In his Roscius Anglicanus (1708),Downes' Roscius Anglicanus is an important source of information on the Restoration stage and the traditions it preserved from the early Stuart era. Halliday, p. 140. Downes claims that the role of Henry VIII in this play was originally performed by John Lowin, who \\"had his instructions from Mr. Shakespeare himself.\\"Halliday, pp. 218‚Äì19. Fifteen years to the day after the fire, on 29 June 1628, The King's Men performed the play again at the Globe. The performance was witnessed by George Villiers, the contemporary Duke of Buckingham (no relation to or descendant of the Duke of Buckingham portrayed in the play), who left half-way through, once the play's Duke of Buckingham was executed. (A month later, Villiers was assassinated.)Halliday, F. E. A Shakespeare Companion 1564‚Äì1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 74‚Äì75. During the Restoration era, Sir William Davenant staged a production, starring Thomas Betterton, that was seen by Pepys. Thomas Betterton played Henry in 1664, and Colley Cibber revived it frequently in the 1720s. Subsequent stagings of the play by David Garrick, Charles Kean, Henry Irving (who chose to play Wolsey, the villain and perhaps the showier role of the play, in 1888, with Ellen Terry as the noble Katherine of Aragon).Halliday, p. 219. The longest Broadway run the play has had is Herbert Beerbohm Tree's 1916 production in which Lyn Harding played Henry and Tree played Wolsey, running 63 performances. Tree's production was notable for its elaborate exploitation of the play's pageantry, typical of the expensive and spectacular staging of the era. The production subsequently toured, with Sydney Greenstreet taking over the title role. = Modern revivals = The play's popularity has waned in the mid twentieth century, although Charles Laughton played Henry at Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1933 and Margaret Webster directed it as the inaugural production of her American Repertory Company on Broadway in 1946 with Walter Hampden as Wolsey and Eva Le Gallienne as Katherine. John Gielgud played Wolsey, Harry Andrews the king and Edith Evans Katharine at Stratford in 1959. Another notable production was the first at the reconstructed Shakespeare's Globe from 15 May to 21 August 2010, as part of the theatre's first season of Shakespeare's history plays, with cannon fire at the same point as the 1613 production and a cast including Dominic Rowan as Henry, Miranda Raison as Anne, Ian McNeice as Wolsey and Kate Duch√™ne as Katherine (with Raison also playing Anne in the same season's Anne Boleyn). It was staged at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre (Washington, D.C.) from 12 October until 28 November 2010; this production added a puppeter-narrator, played by Louis Butelli, named for Henry VIII's jester, Will Sommers, as well as the character of Mary I, played by Megan Steigerwald. A remount of that production also played at Alabama Shakespeare Festival in 2012. In July 2013, the Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey mounted a production as part of their annual Shakespeare in the Parks series. While director Jon Ciccarelli set the production in the Tudor period, he adapted the script to provide a more modern spin to the wives by fleshing out the role of Anne Bullen and stressing the plight of Queen Katherine of Aragon. Katherine (Noelle Fair) spoke the play's prologue and Anne (Emily Ludolph) spoke the epilogue, having the wives bookend the play. In the original play text, Anne is presented as a passive, almost divine figure that great events happen around and she and Katherine never meet. Here, she was given more lines, some usually spoke by a gentleman commenting on the Buckingham execution to give the character more of a presence in the show. The production also introduced several dumb shows, set to period music, showing the development of Henry and Anne's relationship and his distancing from Katherine. Anne was made one of Katherine's waiting women that led to a minor but tense stand off scene as a song usually given to a minor character was sung by Anne in front of the enraged Queen Katherine.

Wedgwood had previously based his business in the nearby town of Burslem at the Ivy House Works and the Brick House Works (demolished ‚Äì the Wedgwood Institute is built on its site). In 1767 Wedgwood paid about three thousand pounds for his new site, which was then known as the Ridgehouse Estate.

This may be translated from the Latin as \\"The Arts of Etruria are reborn\\".Wedgwood Museum website Wedgwood was inspired by ancient pottery then generally described as Etruscan. In particular he was interested in artworks which Sir William Hamilton began to collect in the 1760s while serving as British Ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples. Hamilton's collections were published as Etruscan, although the term was a misnomer, as many of the \\"Etruscan\\" items turned out to be pottery of ancient Greece.Winckelmann's Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums (\\"The History of Art in Antiquity\\") of 1764 first refuted the Etruscan origin of what we now know to be Greek pottery. Hamilton independently came to the conclusion that he was collecting pottery of Greek origin. (See The Hunt Krater, British Museum) More authentically Etruscan in inspiration was Wedgwood's black basalt stone ware, which was already in development as the Etruria works were being built and came on the market in 1768. As with the black, burnished and unglazed bucchero pottery characteristic of genuinely Etruscan ceramics,Bucchero Wedgwood's \\"Black Basaltes\\" were fired in a reducing atmosphere, achieved by closing vents, where the oxygen-starved flames drew off the oxygen from iron oxides, rendering the ceramic body black, a color that was enriched and deepened with the addition of manganese to the clay.Wedgwood Museum: black basalts.

Background Josephy Hensley was born and educated in England. His family settled on PEI in 1841 where Hensley became a lawyer. He was appointed to the legislative council by George Coles and served as Attorney-General under Coles' various Liberal governments of the 1850s. In 1861, Hensley was elected to the House of Assembly in 1861 and became Coles' lieutenant in the legislature. When Coles retired as Liberal leader and Premier in 1869, Hensley succeeded him.

History Milestones in the History of Wetaskiwin The future location of Wetaskiwin was once the site of a battle between the Cree and the Blackfoot. In 1890, when the Calgary and Edmonton Railway was built, it became a whistle-stop, and was known as Siding 16. In 1892, it was named Wetaskiwin to commemorate the battle.Alberta-Montana Heritage Partnership. Alberta-Montana Discovery Guide: Museums, Parks, & Historic Sites.

The northwest end of Wetaskiwin is characterized by hills with sandy soil (formerly sand dunes), while the southeast end of the city is very flat with more silty soil. The city lies at an elevation of . Coal Lake, a reservoir developed on the Battle River is located immediately east of the city, and other nearby waterways include Pipestone Creek, Bigstone Creek, Bittern Lake and Bearhills Lake. Wetaskiwin is located at the junction of Highway 2A, Highway 13 and the Canadian Pacific railroad. It was a stagecoach stop between Calgary and Edmonton. =Climate= Wetaskiwin has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb) with warm summers that retain cool nights, and cold winters. It falls into zone 3b under Plant hardiness zones.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the City of Wetaskiwin recorded a population of 12,655 living in 5,121 of its 5,563 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 12,525. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. The population of Wetaskiwin according to its 2014 municipal census is 12,621, a change of from its 2009 municipal census population of 12,285.

Almost 90% of residents identified English as their first language. About 2.5% identified German, 1.5% French, 1.0% Cree, 0.9% Tagalog, 0.5% identified Chinese, and 0.4% each identified Swedish and Ukrainian as their first language learned. About 75 percent of residents identified as Christian at the time of the 2001 census, while 24 percent indicated they had no religious affiliation.

Features and attractions  = Water tower = Built in 1909, Wetaskiwin's water tower is one of the oldest municipal water towers in Canada. The 42-metre-high structure has towered above Wetaskiwin since 1909 and holds 454,609 litres of water. In 2004, Wetaskiwin City Council considered the possibility of demolishing the water tower, but concerned citizens convinced them the old tower was worth saving. Work to refurbish the tower began in 2005, and by 2006 the water tower was completely restored. = Peace cairn = The Wetaskiwin Peace Cairn commemorates 60 years of peace between the Blackfoot and Cree First Nations. This historic peace pact took place in a group of hills just north of present-day Wetaskiwin. At the time of construction, school children each carried a rock and walked in a procession from their school to the hill where the cairn was to be erected. The cairn was dedicated during the celebrations for Canada's Diamond Jubilee on 2 July 1927. =Manluk Centre= The Manluk Centre: Wetaskiwin Aquatics and Fitness is a 44,756 square foot facility that opened on 13 September 2014. The facility has the Flaman Fitness Facility on its second floor. Built over a two-year period, the facility was funded by contributions from local businesses and individuals. Amenities include a 25-metre pool, a leisure pool, a lazy river, wave machine, slides, whirlpool, and a steam room. =City Hall= The current City Hall was originally built as a courthouse, and was completed in 1908 at a cost $75,000. It was one of seven such buildings commissioned by the new Province of Alberta between 1906 and 1912, under the direction of Provincial Architect A. M. Jeffers. The building was constructed in modern renaissance style, with the outside being composed entirely of red brick. The front steps, the back steps, the columns, and the keystones are constructed of stone, and the foundation is made of concrete and rubble sheathed with sandstone from the Calgary area. In the early years, the basement of the courthouse contained the jail cells, the caretaker's residence, and the Northwest Mounted Police residence. The cells are in their original state, and still contain the original carvings prisoners etched into the brick walls. The caretaker looked after the building and the grounds while his wife looked after the family, as well as feeding the prisoners and the members of the Northwest Mounted Police housed there. In 1920, two German field cannons that were seized from Germany at the end of World War were placed on the front lawn of the Old Courthouse. These cannons, presented to the citizens of Wetaskiwin by the Dominion Government of Canada, served to honour the many men and women of this community who volunteered for active service. In 1983, a new courthouse was built, and the old courthouse sat empty for more than two decades. In the late 1990s, a local developer approached the City with plans to renovate it as City Hall's new home; after several meetings between the parties involved, the old courthouse was purchased by the City and renovation began in 2005. Glass was used to frame the new areas of the building; the brick exterior of the Old Courthouse was left undisturbed. Aside from changes required by Alberta's building codes, the requirements set out by Alberta Historical Resources were followed during the restoration of the original courtroom, which now serves as Council Chambers. The wood panelling was retained, and the cast iron radiators were connected to the new geothermal heating and cooling system. New paint and carpet completed the renovations, and in 2007 the building became Wetaskiwin's new City Hall. =By-the-Lake Park= Wetaskiwin's By-the-Lake Park, located near the Automile close to Wetaskiwin's downtown core, is a day-use facility featuring a 2.5-kilometre paved trail surrounding a 17-acre man-made lake and a large picnic area and a nature trail with signs identifying various plants and wildlife. The lake is stocked with fish for summer and winter fishing (Alberta Sport Fishing Regulations must be followed) and is used by school and community groups for canoeing and watersports. During the winter months the lake and surrounding area is used for cross-country skiing, ice skating, tobogganing, and pick-up games of pond-hockey.  Government  Historically the population of Wetaskiwin has voted Conservative in both provincial and federal politics. The city is currently represented in the House of Commons by MP Mike Lake of the Conservative Party.  Infrastructure  A regional airport is located within the city.  Media  Wetaskiwin is served by two local newspapers, the Pipestone Flyer and The Wetaskiwin Times.

Holl was appointed to the legislative council in 1840 by governor Charles Augustus FitzRoy. Responsible government came to the island in 1851. In 1853 the Liberal government of the colony's first premier, George Coles, was defeated in the general election and was forced to resign in early 1854 when it could not command the support of the House of Assembly which now had a Conservative majority. Holl was appointed Premier despite the fact that he sat in the appointed legislative council rather than the elected House of Assembly. Due to changes in the franchise which broadened the right to vote from property owners to universal male suffrage a new election was held in June 1854 and the Liberals again won power and were able to form a government when the legislature resumed in 1855 ending Holl's few months as Premier. Holl continued to sit in the legislative council until leaving the island in 1856.

The family left Spain in 1492, settling in France, the Netherlands and Italy, after the Alhambra Decree expelled Jews and Muslims from Spain, not long after the beginning of the Spanish Inquisition. Some moved to England following Oliver Cromwell's readmission of Jews to England. In the mid 17th century, Antonio de Marchena, from a branch of the Mocatta family that had stayed in Spain and ostensibly become Catholic, left for the Netherlands, and was welcomed back into the Amsterdam Spanish & Portuguese community, adopting the name Moses Mocatta.

Grant Building at Brigham Young University. It serves the purpose of administering tests to students. Tests are often administered in the Testing Center instead of during class time. By doing this, instructors allow students to take as much time as they need for the test, do not waste class time on testing, and allow students to take tests at their convenience. Building history The Heber J. Grant Building was originally built as the BYU library. It was dedicated in 1925 by Heber J. Grant, the first building completed while Franklin S. Harris was president of BYU. The library was housed on the second floor, while the first floor contained classrooms. After the building of the Harold B. Lee Library the building was used as a museum by the College of Biology and Agriculture until this was moved to the Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum.Ernest L. Wilkinson and Leonard J. Arrington, ed., Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years, Vol. 3, p. 60 In 1982 the building began its use as the university's testing center. Current functions The southern face of the building The main portion of the Testing Center is a large main testing room, which originally served as BYU's library, and now is filled with approximately 650 desks. Students enter through the center's administration area. The center also has a few smaller rooms with even more desks (one of which, the music room, has soft classical music playing through wall-mounted speakers), study hall rooms downstairs for test preparation, and faculty offices. Interior of the BYU Testing Center When students exit the testing center, they can see their scores immediately on the BYU Testing Center website (for multiple-choice tests). Earlier, those taking multiple-choice tests waited for a moment or two in the administration area to receive a printout of their results, which usually resulted in the exit area being crowded. In order to avoid long lines during finals, the testing center opens remote locations around campus. Generally the Wilkinson Student Center (WSC) serves all religion finals while the Joseph Smith Building (JSB) Auditorium is used for larger classes such as American Heritage. Lines are usually shortest before 11:00 AM, in the early afternoon, and after 7:00 PM.

Thomas Whieldon (September 1719 in Penkhull, Stoke-on-Trent ‚Äì March 1795) was a significant English potter who played a leading role in the development of Staffordshire pottery. The attribution of actual pieces to his factory has long been uncertain, and terms such as \\"Whieldon-type\\" are now often used for a variety of different types of wares. Other terms reflecting the lack of certainty are \\"Whieldon ware\\" as a type, and \\"Astbury-Whieldon\\", used for early Staffordshire figures, where the two were pioneers. He worked in earthenware and stoneware, using a variety of types of body and ceramic glazes. He is especially associated with agate ware and tortoiseshell ware; in both cases Whieldon refined the techniques used, and made the types more popular.  Family  Very early Staffordshire figure of Oriental lady and dog in salt-glazed earthenware, c. 1745, Whieldon factory. Also made in tortoiseshell ware, image. Whieldon is first recorded as a potter in 1744 when he married Anne Shaw at Barlaston Church. Little is known about his early career and it is not known where he served his apprenticeship.Halfpenny, 238 Anne died in 1757 and in 1758 Whieldon married Alice Parrot, the daughter of a notable family from Newcastle-under-Lyme. Josiah Wedgwood recorded how Alice later died very suddenly at church one Sunday night in 1772.Halfpenny, 246 Whieldon married a third time in 1776, wedding Sarah Turner, who was from London society, although there was a family connection, as yet unknown, with one John Turner of Lane End, Staffordshire, a potter. James Christie, founder of the auctioneering house of Pall Mall, St James's, was a signatory to the marriage settlement.Halfpenny, 247 There were six children from the marriage to Sarah Turner including one daughter and five sons.Halfpenny, 247‚Äì249 Whieldon's Account Book provides much information for his business during the period 1749 to 1762 and from 1754 to 1759 when he was in partnership with Josiah Wedgwood, but beyond that there is little documentary evidence of his family or his life save for the normal run of parish records and occasional mentions in the private correspondence of Josiah Wedgwood and others.Barker, 81‚Äì82 Thomas Whieldon became very wealthy as a result of his business acumen but preferred to live next door to his Fenton Vivian factory, at Whieldon Grove, a fine house from which he was able to see his works. He continued to live there after his retirement in 1780, when he demolished his factory and planted an ornamental garden on the site, as none of his children wished to take on the business. In 1786 he was appointed High Sheriff of Staffordshire, underlining his social position, and in 1789 he was granted a coat of arms. He died in 1795, surviving his former partner Josiah Wedgwood by just a few weeks, and was buried in Stoke churchyard.  Whieldon the potter  At some time between 1742 and 1747 Whieldon became a tenant at Fenton VivianHalfpenny, 239 and in 1748 he bought the freehold. He was to remain at this site throughout his career. By 1750 he had bought an additional pottery factory at Fenton Low but this was let to tenants and there is no evidence he ever used the factory at Fenton Low himself.Halfpenny, 251 Archaeological finds of pottery shards at Fenton Low cannot be taken as evidence of Whieldon's early production therefore. Whieldon's high reputation enabled him to attract into his employment some of the most important figures in the early history of Staffordshire pottery. These included Aaron Wood, the most prominent ceramic block-cutter or modeller of the day; Josiah Spode, who went on to found his own renowned ceramics factory and William Greatbatch, another prominent figure. From 1754 to 1759 Whieldon enjoyed a partnership with the young Josiah Wedgwood.Reilly, Robin (1992). Josiah Wedgwood, 1730‚Äì1795. London: Macmillan. Pp. 18‚Äì24 A block mould by Aaron Wood, 1757‚Äì65 (the mould is shown rear left, with a similar finished sauceboat in the foreground). Aaron Wood, who formerly worked for Thomas Whieldon, was one of the leading block-makers of the time. On display at the V&A; Museum, London, Room 138.Thomas Whieldon was recognised by his contemporaries as one of the most successful potters in Britain and one author has suggested that, aside from Wedgwood's family members who were already established in business, \\"there was probably no one who could have taught him so much about the innovative techniques that were already changing an ancient craft into a substantial industry.\\"Reilly, 8 Other writers have pointed to a possible lack of innovation, on the contrary: according to Brian Dolan, Whieldon's production appears to have altered little between 1759, when Wedgwood left him, and 1780 when he retired.Dolan, 64 Robin Hildyard has said, less generously, that Whieldon lacked creative ambition and \\"was content to mass-produce unadventurous wares for general consumption\\", providing Wedgwood only with \\"an object-lesson in how to acquire wealth with a minimum of risk.\\"Hildyard, 86 It is indisputable that Whieldon was a highly successful businessman but was necessarily a more conservative potter than Wedgwood, whose exceptional achievements cannot be matched.  Wedgwood and Whieldon: the partnership 1754‚Äì1759  Wedgwood and Whieldon cauliflower teapot Thomas Whieldon took Josiah Wedgwood into partnership at his factory at Fenton Vivian in 1754. By then Whieldon was 35 years old and had already achieved financial success and a considerable reputation whilst Wedgwood was just 24 years old ‚àí Whieldon had clearly recognised his great potential.Reilly, 18 Whieldon's pottery production is described by Josiah Wedgwood in his contemporary Experiment Book where there is a wealth of manuscript material on the partnership.Held at the Wedgwood Museum, Barlaston, Staffordshire. WMS 29-19121. Unpublished. Here Wedgwood explains that by 1759 there was an urgent need to improve the quality of lead-glazed creamware which was the principle ware being produced by Whieldon at the time. Prices for this type of ware were rapidly declining and the quality of production was suffering as a result.Reilly, 18 It is likely that Wedgwood's work with Whieldon was largely experimental and concerned with improving the factory's wares and looking to the future. This set Wedgwood on a course of experimentation that was to guarantee his future fame. > \\"These considerations induced me to try for some more solid improvement, as > well in the Body, as the Glazes, the Colours, & the Forms, of the articles > of our manufacture.\\"Reilly, 19 Wedgwood was brought into partnership to address these problems and was mainly engaged in improving the lead glazes for creamware. Creamware at that time had already achieved an acceptable white body but no one had succeeded in producing a transparent lead glaze.Reilly, 20 By 1759, when Wedgwood decided to leave and set up his own independent business, he had already made his first successful experimental glazes. Even after Wedgwood had established his own business, he continued to buy-in wares from Whieldon ‚Äì usually biscuit- fired wares for later colouring and glazing ‚Äì to meet demand, when needed. He also frequently bought wares from William Greatbatch, whom he knew from his time with Whieldon.Reilly, 29‚Äì30  The Wares  Archaeological excavations at the Fenton Vivian site conducted by Arnold Mountford on behalf of Stoke City Museum between 1968 and 1970Mountford, 164‚Äì82 found evidence of salt-glazed stoneware, tortoiseshell ware, agateware, red stoneware, glazed red earthenware, blackware and a small amount of plain creamware, all dating from the time of Whieldon's partnership with Wedgwood. There were also a few fragments of painted creamware, depicting Chinese-inspired figures and flowers, of a type rarely associated with Whieldon.Halfpenny, 245‚Äì246 Whieldon kept an Account and Memorandum BookKept in the City Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent. Unpublished. and his records for 1749‚Äì53 show a wide range of pottery goods produced, including coffeepots, teapots, punch pots, bowls, ewers, sugar dishes, plates, tureens and ‚Äòtoys‚Äô or trinkets.Reilly, 19 There is evidence of a range of figures being produced but not in great quantities.Halfpenny, 243 Forms were sometimes based on contemporary silver and pewter shapes and were both press-moulded and slip-cast.Reilly, 19‚Äì20 None of Whieldon's pottery was marked, making attribution difficult. The shards excavated at the Fenton Vivian site are a vital source of information allowing some attribution by typology. It was common practice for factories in the 18th century to share or copy designs, or to buy and sell ceramic block-moulds, so care has to be taken in ascribing particular pots to particular factories in the absence of any other supporting evidence. Finishes such as spouts, handles and knops can provide vital clues. For this reason it is difficult to point to any particular style of ware that was exclusively Whieldon's ‚Äì this is striking when speaking of such an important figure.  Tortoiseshell ware  Tortoiseshell Ware plate attrributed to the Whieldon factory, c. 1765 alt=Thomas Whieldon: style of, c. 1760 Tortoiseshell ware is effectively an earthenware, often creamware, that is decorated with a limited, rather dark, palette to imitate tortoiseshell, as fashionable material in the period. It was made before Whieldon, by William Greatbatch and many others in Staffordshire and also Liverpool and Leeds. The original technique was to sprinkle the un-fired (\\"green\\") wares with \\"powdered lead oxide and calcined flint with a trace of manganese oxide\\". This produced the colour effect within the glaze.Hughes, 85 Whieldon's innovation, about 1750, was his \\"first important contribution to the pottery trade\\".Hughes, 85 The pigments were applied under the glaze by painting or sponging with metallic oxides, and then a transparent glaze was applied. During the glost firing, the colours flow to produce the tortoiseshell effect.Barker, 17; Hughes, 85 Teapot, c. 1755 Tortoiseshell wares were first mentioned by Thomas Whieldon in his Account and Memorandum Book of 1749. In his Experiment Book, Josiah Wedgwood states that in 1759 tortoiseshell ware was the second most important ware at the Whieldon factory, but the market was declining: > ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] But as no improvement had been made in this branch for several years, > the country was grown weary of it; and though the price had been lowered > from time to time, in order to increase the sale, the expedient did not > answer, and something new was wanted, to give a little spirit to the > business.\\"Reilly, 19 Historically, tortoiseshell wares have come to be associated almost exclusively with Thomas Whieldon, however, ceramics expert Pat Halfpenny warns that: > ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòWhieldon‚Äô label has inhibited scholarly research and limited our > understanding of the pottery production dates in North > Staffordshire.‚ÄùHalfpenny, 251 In his 1991 study of William Greatbatch, David Barker also concluded: > \\"Many of the wares manufactured by Whieldon are of types now known to have > been made by Greatbatch and have been found on the Greatbatch site. Whieldon > ware, or Whieldon-type ware are terms which are widely accepted in > describing a variety of ceramics, particularly tortoiseshell wares, but > which lead to problems in any objective research into the pottery of the > period.\\"Barker, 82 In the absence of any supporting information, caution is therefore needed in ascribing any particular tortoiseshell wares to Thomas Whieldon.See for example the four tortoiseshell-ware plates illustrated in British Ceramics 1675‚Äì1825 (2015). The Mint Museum in association with D Giles Limited, London, p.61.Halfpenny, 248, fig. 16  Workforce  In the 18th century it was usual for whole families, including children, to be working in pottery manufacture. Workers were engaged, for example, as specialist potters, painters or ‚Äòoven‚Äô (or kiln) men. Whieldon had an exceptionally large workforce for the period and expected ‚Äòscrupulous obedience, respectful behaviour and strict punctuality‚Äô. Workers were organised into teams and well paid, with skilled workers‚Äô pay being linked to productivity.Dolan, 56 Whieldon was remarkable for being the first employer in the potteries to offer rented accommodation for his workers, which he did as early as 1750, providing eight dwelling houses for rental.Reilly, 20‚Äì21 Later, Josiah Wedgwood was to take up the idea of a community for his workforce at the Etruria works when he founded Etruria Village in 1769, consisting of 42 dwellings and an inn.Dolan, 218 A Turnpike Petition dated 1763 revealed that at that time there were 150 separate pottery businesses operating in the Staffordshire Potteries employing as many as 7,000 people.Reilly, 46 Potters working with lead glazes were exposed to lead poisoning and the dangers of serious health problems.Dolan, 278‚Äì279  Transportation  As the markets for Staffordshire pottery grew during the 18th century, the need for improved transportation links became more pressing. In the early part of the 18th century, goods were generally sold locally and transported by 'crate-men' who carried goods in large panniers on their backs. Mules were sometimes used instead. Local roads were so poor that mules and men were likely to stumble with their heavy loads into potholes ‚Äì literally, large holes left in the highway after quantities of clay had been removed by local people to make simple pots for their household use. Some of these potholes were two feet deep or more and were hazardous to life.Reilly, Robin (1992). Josiah Wedgwood, 1730‚Äì1795. London: Macmillan. Pp. 21‚Äì22 Originally, all the main routes by which goods might leave the Potteries involved a combination of road and river transport out to the ports and the coastal trade routes. Road journeys by these routes varied between 20 and 40 miles in length and progress was slow. Because roads were in a poor state before the introduction of turnpikes, many of the finished goods were broken in transit, substantially reducing the profitability of pottery production. By the 1750s there was a strong London market for goods and some trade with Europe. Whieldon, Spode and Wedgwood were amongst those who subscribed to the first turnpike roads in the neighbourhood. Josiah Wedgwood went on to revolutionise transportation within the Potteries by commissioning the first canals from 1766.  Forgery  Figure, c. 1750, of lady with pannier dress. Because of the popularity of Whieldon-style tortoiseshell wares and of historic Staffordshire pottery in general, and the high prices they fetch on the market, there has long been a problem of forgery. In more modern times, forgery of Whieldon wares dates back at least until the 1920s when his work commanded high prices.Wallace Elliot, \\"Reproductions and Fakes of English Eighteenth-Century Ceramics,\\" in Transactions of the English Ceramics Circle, Vol. 2 No. 7 (1939) In 1991 a lawsuit brought a forgery to light when the authenticity of a Whieldon-type candelabrum was called into question. This piece had been vetted by experts before being bought from an English dealer on behalf of a renowned American collector. However, the use of thermoluminescence dating showed that it was modern.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-07-28/features/1991209179_1_fakes- scotland-yard-sampson This is just one of many such cases. Thermoluminescence is prohibitively expensive and therefore cannot be used to test all pottery. Buyers must continue to rely on their own knowledge and judgment.  Enduring reputation  Thomas Whieldon's works have been treasured by potters and collectors alike and have realised high prices for at least the past century. In 2011, Edmund de Waal selected a Thomas Whieldon teapot of 1760 for his celebration of the potter's art.Waal, 290  Whieldon in national collections  British Museum, London Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Victoria & Albert Museum, London The Potteries Museum & Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, UK: Well represented but online catalogue appears to be under development.

He was a celebrated teacher at Reims, and a close advisor of his former pupil, Pope Urban II. His feast day is October 6. Life Bruno was born in Cologne about the year 1030. According to tradition, he belonged to the family of Hartenfaust, or Hardeb√ºst, one of the principal families of the city. Little is known of his early years, except that he studied theology in the present- day French city of Reims before returning to his native land. His Feast day was announced to be October 6th. His education completed, Bruno returned to Cologne, where he was most likely ordained a priest around 1055, and provided with a canonry at St. Cunibert's. In 1056 Bishop Gervais recalled him to Reims, where the following year he found himself head of the Episcopal school, which at the time included the direction of the schools and the oversight of all the educational establishments of the diocese. For eighteen years, from 1057 to 1075, he maintained the prestige which the school of Reims attained under its former masters, Remi of Auxerre, and others. Bruno led the school for nearly two decades, acquiring an excellent reputation as a philosopher and theologian.\\"St. Bruno, founder\\", Catholic News Agency Among his students were Eudes of Ch√¢tillon, afterwards Pope Urban II, Rangier, Cardinal and Bishop of Reggio, Robert, Bishop of Langres, and a large number of prelates and abbots.  Chancellor of the Diocese of Reims  In 1075, Bruno was appointed chancellor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims, which involved him in the daily administration of the diocese. Meanwhile, the pious Bishop Gervais de Ch√¢teau-du-Loir, a friend to Bruno, had been succeeded by Manasses de Gournai, a violent aristocrat with no real vocation for the Church. In 1077, at the urging of Bruno and the clergy at Reims, de Gournai was suspended at a council at Autun. He responded, in typical eleventh century fashion, by having his retainers pull down the houses of his accusers.Foley OFM, Leonard. \\"St. Bruno\\", Saint of the Day, (refised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media He confiscated their goods, sold their benefices, and even appealed to the pope. Bruno discreetly avoided the cathedral city until in 1080 a definite sentence, confirmed by popular riot, compelled Manasses to withdraw and take refuge with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, the fierce opponent of Pope Gregory VII.  Refusal to become a Bishop  archbishopric of Reggio di Calabria, by Vincenzo Carducci, Chartreuse of el Paular. On the verge of being made bishop himself, Bruno instead followed a vow he had made to renounce secular concerns and withdrew, along with two of his friends, Raoul and Fulcius, also canons of Reims.\\"The saint who founded the Carthusian order\\", Catholic Herald, 3 October 2014 Bruno's first thought on leaving Reims seems to have been to place himself and his companions under the direction of an eminent solitary, Robert of Molesme, who had recently (1075) settled at S√®che-Fontaine, near Molesme in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Langres, together with a band of other hermits, who were later on (in 1098) to form the Cistercians. But he soon found that this was not his vocation. After a short stay he went with six of his companions to Hugh of Ch√¢teauneuf, Bishop of Grenoble. The bishop, according to the pious legend, had recently had a vision of these men, under a chaplet of seven stars, and he installed them himself in 1084 in a mountainous and uninhabited spot in the lower Alps of the Dauphin√©, in a place named Chartreuse, not far from Grenoble. With St. Bruno were: Landuin, Stephen of Bourg, Stephen of Die (canons of St. Rufus), Hugh the Chaplain and two laymen, Andrew and Guerin, who afterwards became the first lay brothers. They built an oratory with small individual cells at a distance from each other where they lived isolated and in poverty, entirely occupied in prayer and study, for these men had a reputation for learning, and were frequently honored by the visits of St. Hugh who became like one of themselves. At the time, Bruno's pupil, Eudes of Ch√¢tillon, had become pope as Urban II (1088). Resolved to continue the work of reform commenced by Gregory VII, and being obliged to struggle against Antipope Clement III and Emperor Henry IV, he was in dire need of competent and devoted allies and called his former master to Rome in 1090. It is difficult to assign the place which Bruno occupied in Rome, or his influence in contemporary events, because it remained entirely hidden and confidential. Lodged in the Lateran with the pope himself, privy to his most private councils, he worked as an advisor but wisely kept in the background, apart from the fiercely partisan rivalries in Rome and within the curia. Shortly after his arrival in Rome, the papal party was forced to evacuate to the south by the arrival of Henry IV with his own antipope in tow.Duffy, Patrick. \\"St. Bruno of Cologne (1035-1101)\\", Catholic Ireland Bruno of Cologne Bruno resisted efforts to name him Archbishop of Reggio Calabria, deferring instead in favor of one of his former pupils nearby in a Benedictine abbey near Salerno. Instead Bruno begged to return again to his solitary life. His intention was to rejoin his brethren in Dauphin√©, as a letter addressed to them makes clear. But the will of Urban II kept him in Italy, near the papal court, to which he could be called at need. Bruno did not attend the Council of Clermont, where Urban preached the First Crusade, but seems to have been present at the Council of Benevento (March, 1091). His part in history is effaced. The place for his new retreat, chosen in 1091 by Bruno and some followers who had joined him, was in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Squillace, in a small forested high valley, where the band constructed a little wooden chapel and cabins. His patron there was Roger I of Sicily, Count of Sicily and Calabria and uncle of the Duke of Apulia, who granted them the lands they occupied, and a close friendship developed. Bruno went to the Guiscard court at Mileto to visit the count in his sickness (1098 and 1101), and to baptize his son, Roger (1097), the future King of Sicily. But more often Roger went into retreat with his friends, where he erected a simple house for himself. Through his generosity, the monastery of St. Stephen was built in 1095, near the original hermitage dedicated to the Virgin. At the turn of the new century, the friends of St. Bruno died one after the other: Urban II in 1099; Landuin, the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, his first companion, in 1100; Count Roger in 1101. Bruno followed on 6 October 1101 in Serra San Bruno.  Bruno's legacy  Notre Dame de Casalibus, Dauphin√© After his death, the Carthusians of Calabria, following a frequent custom of the Middle Ages, dispatched a roll-bearer, a servant of the community laden with a long roll of parchment, hung round his neck, who travelled through Italy, France, Germany, and England, stopping to announce the death of Bruno, and in return, the churches, communities, or chapters inscribed upon his roll, in prose or verse, the expression of their regrets, with promises of prayers. Many of these rolls have been preserved, but few are so extensive or so full of praise as that about St. Bruno. A hundred and seventy-eight witnesses, of whom many had known the deceased, celebrated the extent of his knowledge and the fruitfulness of his instruction. Strangers to him were above all struck by his great knowledge and talents. But his disciples praised his three chief virtues ‚Äî his great spirit of prayer, extreme mortification, and devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Both the churches built by him in the desert were dedicated to the Blessed Virgin: Our Lady of Casalibus in Dauphin√© and Our Lady Della Torre in Calabria; faithful to his inspirations, the Carthusian Statutes proclaim the Mother of God the first and chief patron of all the houses of the order, whoever may be their particular patron. He is also the eponym for San Bruno Creek in California.  Inscription in the Roman Calendar  R.A.B.A.S.F., Madrid). Bruno was buried in the little cemetery of the hermitage of Santa Maria. In 1513, his bones were discovered with the epitaph \\"Haec sunt ossa magistri Brunonis\\" (these are the bones of the master Bruno) over them. Since the Carthusian Order maintains a strict observance of humility, Saint Bruno was never formally canonized. He was not included in the Tridentine Calendar, but in the year 1623 Pope Gregory XV included him in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 6 October.\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 105 Saint Bruno has long been regarded the patron saint of Calabria and one of the patron saints of Germany. A writer as well as founder of his order, Saint Bruno composed commentaries on the Psalms and on the Epistles of Paul the Apostle. Two letters of his also remain, his profession of faith, and a short elegy on contempt for the world which shows that he cultivated poetry. St Bruno's Commentaries reveal that he knew a little Hebrew and Greek; he was familiar with the Church Fathers, especially Augustine of Hippo and Ambrose. \\"His style,\\" said Dom Rivet, \\"is concise, clear, nervous and simple, and his Latin as good as could be expected of that century: it would be difficult to find a composition of this kind at once more solid and more luminous, more concise and more clear.\\" In Catholic art, Saint Bruno can be recognized by a skull that he holds and contemplates, with a book and a cross. He may be crowned with a halo of seven stars; or with a roll bearing the device O Bonitas.

He was born in England to a prominent family, his father having been mayor of Bristol on several occasions. Haythorne arrived in Prince Edward Island at the age of 25 and, with his brother, acquired ownership of 10,000 ac (4,000 ha) of land. When the land question became a major issue in the 1860s Haythorne who had been a progressive farmer and a reformer decided to sell his land to his tenants for $2.00/ac ($4.94/ha). His former tenants asked him to run for a seat on the legislative council (which was by then an elected body) in 1867 and he did so winning the seat as a Liberal. Haythorne joined the Liberal government of George Coles and became Premier in 1869 after Coles retired and his successor, Joseph Hensley accepted a judicial appointment. Politically, Haythorne became skeptical of Canadian confederation and his government rejected pressure by the British to join Canada because he didn't see confederation as offering a solution to the land question. He favoured reciprocity with the United States as an alternative. Haythorne's majority in the legislature was cut to only four seats as a result of the 1870 election. The issue of school funding divided his government, Haythorne supported funding of separate schools leading to the resignation of several of his ministers and the fall of his government in the fall of 1870. James Colledge Pope formed a coalition government with dissidents from Haythorne's Liberal party but Pope's government fell in 1872 when its railway policy almost bankrupted the colony. Haythorne's Liberals returned to power but had to commit to a promise to extend the railway to both ends of the island, a project with the colony could not afford. The financial situation forced Haythorne's government to send a delegation to Ottawa in February 1873 and seek terms for admission to Canadian confederation which would see the completion of the railway and the Canadian government assume the island's debts. Haythorne reached favourable terms including the taking over of the railway by the federal government, the assumption of the colonial debt, an $800,000 payment for the acquisition of proprietary lands in order to settle the land question by allowing land reform, and a promise of continuous steam communication with the mainland. Haythorne had the legislature dissolved and ran an election on the terms of union with Canada. His Conservative rival, John Colledge Pope, outmanoeuvered Haythorne during the campaign, however, by promising that he could get even better terms. Pope's Tories were elected in April, persuaded Ottawa to increase the promised annual federal subsidy to the island by $25,000 and led the island into confederation on July 1, 1873. Haythorne was named to the Senate of Canada in October 1873 where he supported free trade with the United States and was an active supporter of the federal Liberal party. He remained a Senator until his death in 1891.

Late in life, he became a best-selling writer. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2002, seven years after his death. Golf career Penick was born in Austin, Texas. He began his golf career as a caddie at the Austin Country Club at age eight. He became the club's assistant pro five years later, and after his graduation from high school, was promoted to head professional in 1923, where he remained until 1973. After 1973, Penick continued teaching at the club. Penick was the golf coach at the University of Texas from 1931 to 1963, coaching the Longhorns to 21 Southwest Conference championships in 33 years, including 20 out of 23 seasons from 1932 to 1954 (1932‚Äì38; 1940‚Äì47; 1949‚Äì52; 1954). He coached the following members of the World Golf Hall of Fame: Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw, Mickey Wright, Betsy Rawls, and Kathy Whitworth. Other outstanding players coached by Penick include: Sandra Palmer, Judy Kimball, Wes Ellis, Terry Dill, Don Massengale, Rik Massengale, Davis Love Jr., and Ed White. In 1989, Penick was honored by the PGA of America as Teacher of the Year. Author In 1992, he co-authored (with Bud Shrake) Harvey Penick's Little Red Book; filled with insightful, easily understood anecdotes, it became the highest selling golf book ever published. While Penick was a strong all-around teacher of the game, he was perhaps the most gifted instructor of the mental game who ever lived. He advocated that \\"once you address the ball, hitting it to the desired target must be the only thing in your life. Allow no negative thoughts, and focus on your goal.\\" Penick and Shrake collaborated on four more golf books on similar themes; all sold well. The final three Penick-Shrake books were published after Penick's 1995 death, based on Penick's extensive notes from his lifetime of golf instruction. Death During his final illness, he gave lessons from his deathbed to longtime student Ben Crenshaw. The day after serving as a pallbearer at Penick's funeral, Crenshaw began play in the 1995 Masters Tournament. With the memory and spirit of his longtime friend and mentor to guide him, he became the second oldest Masters champion, winning his second Masters at the age of 43. In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \\"I had a 15th club in my bag,\\" a reference to Penick. (The \\"15th club\\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.) Penick died in Austin in 1995. Seven years after his death, in 2002, he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

PLM integrates people, data, processes and business systems and provides a product information backbone for companies and their extended enterprise. History The inspiration for the burgeoning business process now known as PLM came from American Motors Corporation (AMC). The automaker was looking for a way to speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger competitors in 1985, according to Fran√ßois Castaing, Vice President for Product Engineering and Development. Lacking the \\"massive budgets of General Motors, Ford, and foreign competitors ‚Ä¶ AMC placed R&D; emphasis on bolstering the product life cycle of its prime products (particularly Jeeps).\\" After introducing its compact Jeep Cherokee (XJ), the vehicle that launched the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV) market, AMC began development of a new model, that later came out as the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The first part in its quest for faster product development was computer-aided design (CAD) software system that made engineers more productive. The second part in this effort was the new communication system that allowed conflicts to be resolved faster, as well as reducing costly engineering changes because all drawings and documents were in a central database. The product data management was so effective that after AMC was purchased by Chrysler, the system was expanded throughout the enterprise connecting everyone involved in designing and building products. While an early adopter of PLM technology, Chrysler was able to become the auto industry's lowest-cost producer, recording development costs that were half of the industry average by the mid-1990s. During 1982-83, Rockwell International developed initial concepts of Product Data Management (PDM) and PLM for the B-1B bomber program. The system called Engineering Data System (EDS) was augmented to interface with Computervision and CADAM systems to track part configurations and lifecycle of components and assemblies. Computervison later released implementing only the PDM aspects as the lifecycle model was specific to Rockwell and aerospace needs. Forms PLM systems help organizations in coping with the increasing complexity and engineering challenges of developing new products for the global competitive markets. Product lifecycle management (PLM) should be distinguished from 'product life-cycle management (marketing)' (PLCM). PLM describes the engineering aspect of a product, from managing descriptions and properties of a product through its development and useful life; whereas, PLCM refers to the commercial management of life of a product in the business market with respect to costs and sales measures. Product lifecycle management can be considered one of the four cornerstones of a manufacturing corporation's information technology structure. All companies need to manage communications and information with their customers (CRM-customer relationship management), their suppliers and fulfillment (SCM-supply chain management), their resources within the enterprise (ERP-enterprise resource planning) and their product planning and development (PLM). One form of PLM is called people-centric PLM. While traditional PLM tools have been deployed only on release or during the release phase, people-centric PLM targets the design phase. As of 2009, ICT development (EU-funded PROMISE project 2004‚Äì2008) has allowed PLM to extend beyond traditional PLM and integrate sensor data and real time 'lifecycle event data' into PLM, as well as allowing this information to be made available to different players in the total lifecycle of an individual product (closing the information loop). This has resulted in the extension of PLM into closed-loop lifecycle management (CL2M). Benefits Documented benefits of product lifecycle management include: * Reduced time to market * Increase full price sales * Improved product quality and reliability * Reduced prototyping costs * More accurate and timely request for quote generation * Ability to quickly identify potential sales opportunities and revenue contributions * Savings through the re-use of original data * A framework for product optimization * Reduced waste * Savings through the complete integration of engineering workflows * Documentation that can assist in proving compliance for RoHS or Title 21 CFR Part 11 * Ability to provide contract manufacturers with access to a centralized product record * Seasonal fluctuation management * Improved forecasting to reduce material costs * Maximize supply chain collaboration Areas of PLM Within PLM there are five primary areas; # Systems engineering (SE) is focused on meeting all requirements, primarily meeting customer needs, and coordinating the systems design process by involving all relevant disciplines. An important aspect for life cycle management is a subset within Systems Engineering called Reliability Engineering. # Product and portfolio m¬≤ (PPM) is focused on managing resource allocation, tracking progress, plan for new product development projects that are in process (or in a holding status). Portfolio management is a tool that assists management in tracking progress on new products and making trade-off decisions when allocating scarce resources. # Product design (CAx) is the process of creating a new product to be sold by a business to its customers. # Manufacturing process management (MPM) is a collection of technologies and methods used to define how products are to be manufactured. # Product data management (PDM) is focused on capturing and maintaining information on products and/or services through their development and useful life. Change management is an important part of PDM/PLM. Note: While application software is not required for PLM processes, the business complexity and rate of change requires organizations execute as rapidly as possible. Introduction to development process The core of PLM (product lifecycle management) is the creation and central management of all product data and the technology used to access this information and knowledge. PLM as a discipline emerged from tools such as CAD, CAM and PDM, but can be viewed as the integration of these tools with methods, people and the processes through all stages of a product's life. It is not just about software technology but is also a business strategy. Product lifecycle management For simplicity the stages described are shown in a traditional sequential engineering workflow. The exact order of event and tasks will vary according to the product and industry in question but the main processes are: *Conceive **Specification **Concept design *Design **Detailed design **Validation and analysis (simulation) **Tool design *Realise **Plan manufacturing **Manufacture **Build/Assemble **Test (quality control) *Service **Sell and deliver **Use **Maintain and support **Dispose The major key point events are: *Order *Idea *Kickoff *Design freeze *Launch The reality is however more complex, people and departments cannot perform their tasks in isolation and one activity cannot simply finish and the next activity start. Design is an iterative process, often designs need to be modified due to manufacturing constraints or conflicting requirements. Whether a customer order fits into the time line depends on the industry type and whether the products are for example, built to order, engineered to order, or assembled to order. Phases of product lifecycle and corresponding technologies Many software solutions have been developed to organize and integrate the different phases of a product's lifecycle. PLM should not be seen as a single software product but a collection of software tools and working methods integrated together to address either single stages of the lifecycle or connect different tasks or manage the whole process. Some software providers cover the whole PLM range while others single niche application. Some applications can span many fields of PLM with different modules within the same data model. An overview of the fields within PLM is covered here. The simple classifications do not always fit exactly; many areas overlap and many software products cover more than one area or do not fit easily into one category. It should also not be forgotten that one of the main goals of PLM is to collect knowledge that can be reused for other projects and to coordinate simultaneous concurrent development of many products. It is about business processes, people and methods as much as software application solutions. Although PLM is mainly associated with engineering tasks it also involves marketing activities such as product portfolio management (PPM), particularly with regards to new product development (NPD). There are several life-cycle models in industry to consider, but most are rather similar. What follows below is one possible life-cycle model; while it emphasizes hardware-oriented products, similar phases would describe any form of product or service, including non-technical or software-based products: =Phase 1: Conceive= Imagine, specify, plan, innovate The first stage is the definition of the product requirements based on customer, company, market and regulatory bodies‚Äô viewpoints. From this specification, the product's major technical parameters can be defined. In parallel, the initial concept design work is performed defining the aesthetics of the product together with its main functional aspects. Many different media are used for these processes, from pencil and paper to clay models to 3D CAID computer-aided industrial design software. In some concepts, the investment of resources into research or analysis-of- options may be included in the conception phase ‚Äì e.g. bringing the technology to a level of maturity sufficient to move to the next phase. However, life- cycle engineering is iterative. It is always possible that something doesn't work well in any phase enough to back up into a prior phase ‚Äì perhaps all the way back to conception or research. There are many examples to draw from. =Phase 2: Design= Describe, define, develop, test, analyze and validate This is where the detailed design and development of the product's form starts, progressing to prototype testing, through pilot release to full product launch. It can also involve redesign and ramp for improvement to existing products as well as planned obsolescence. The main tool used for design and development is CAD. This can be simple 2D drawing / drafting or 3D parametric feature based solid/surface modeling. Such software includes technology such as Hybrid Modeling, Reverse Engineering, KBE (knowledge-based engineering), NDT (Nondestructive testing), and Assembly construction. This step covers many engineering disciplines including: mechanical, electrical, electronic, software (embedded), and domain-specific, such as architectural, aerospace, automotive, ... Along with the actual creation of geometry there is the analysis of the components and product assemblies. Simulation, validation and optimization tasks are carried out using CAE (computer-aided engineering) software either integrated in the CAD package or stand-alone. These are used to perform tasks such as: Stress analysis, FEA (finite element analysis); kinematics; computational fluid dynamics (CFD); and mechanical event simulation (MES). CAQ (computer-aided quality) is used for tasks such as Dimensional tolerance (engineering) analysis. Another task performed at this stage is the sourcing of bought out components, possibly with the aid of procurement systems. =Phase 3: Realize= Manufacture, make, build, procure, produce, sell and deliver Once the design of the product's components is complete, the method of manufacturing is defined. This includes CAD tasks such as tool design; including creation of CNC machining instructions for the product's parts as well as creation of specific tools to manufacture those parts, using integrated or separate CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) software. This will also involve analysis tools for process simulation of operations such as casting, molding, and die-press forming. Once the manufacturing method has been identified CPM comes into play. This involves CAPE (computer-aided production engineering) or CAP/CAPP (computer- aided production planning) tools for carrying out factory, plant and facility layout and production simulation e.g. press-line simulation, industrial ergonomics, as well as tool selection management. Once components are manufactured, their geometrical form and size can be checked against the original CAD data with the use of computer-aided inspection equipment and software. Parallel to the engineering tasks, sales product configuration and marketing documentation work take place. This could include transferring engineering data (geometry and part list data) to a web based sales configurator and other desktop publishing systems. =Phase 4: Service= Use, operate, maintain, support, sustain, phase-out, retire, recycle and disposal The final phase of the lifecycle involves managing \\"in-service\\" information. This can include providing customers and service engineers with the support and information required for repair and maintenance, as well as waste management or recycling. This can involve the use of tools such as Maintenance, Repair and Operations Management (MRO) software. There is an end- of-life to every product. Whether it be disposal or destruction of material objects or information, this needs to be carefully considered since it may be legislated and hence not free from ramifications. Operational upgrades During the operational phase, a product owner may discover components and consumables which have reached individual end of life and for which there are Diminishing Manufacturing Sources or Material Shortages (DMSMS), or that the existing product can be enhanced for a wider or emerging user market easier or at less cost than a full redesign. This modernization approach often extends the product life cycle and delays end of life disposal. =All phases: product lifecycle= Communicate, manage and collaborate None of the above phases should be considered as isolated. In reality, a project does not run sequentially or separated from other product development projects, with information flowing between different people and systems. A major part of PLM is the co-ordination and management of product definition data. This includes managing engineering changes and release status of components; configuration product variations; document management; planning project resources as well as timescale and risk assessment. For these tasks data of graphical, textual and meta nature ‚Äî such as product Bills Of Materials (BOMs) ‚Äî needs to be managed. At the engineering departments level this is the domain of Product Data Management (PDM) software, or at the corporate level Enterprise Data Management (EDM) software; such rigid level distinctions may not be consistently used, however it is typical to see two or more data management systems within an organization. These systems may also be linked to other corporate systems such as SCM, CRM, and ERP. Associated with these system are project management systems for project/program planning. This central role is covered by numerous collaborative product development tools which run throughout the whole lifecycle and across organizations. This requires many technology tools in the areas of conferencing, data sharing and data translation. This specialised field is referred to as product visualization which includes technologies such as DMU (digital mock-up), immersive virtual digital prototyping (virtual reality), and photo-realistic imaging. User skills The broad array of solutions that make up the tools used within a PLM solution-set (e.g., CAD, CAM, CAx...) were initially used by dedicated practitioners who invested time and effort to gain the required skills. Designers and engineers produced excellent results with CAD systems, manufacturing engineers became highly skilled CAM users, while analysts, administrators, and managers fully mastered their support technologies. However, achieving the full advantages of PLM requires the participation of many people of various skills from throughout an extended enterprise, each requiring the ability to access and operate on the inputs and output of other participants. Despite the increased ease of use of PLM tools, cross-training all personnel on the entire PLM tool-set has not proven to be practical. Now, however, advances are being made to address ease of use for all participants within the PLM arena. One such advance is the availability of \\"role\\" specific user interfaces. Through tailorable user interfaces (UIs), the commands that are presented to users are appropriate to their function and expertise. These techniques include: * Concurrent engineering workflow * Industrial design * Bottom‚Äìup design * Top‚Äìdown design * Both-ends-against-the-middle design * Front-loading design workflow * Design in context * Modular design * NPD new product development * DFSS design for Six Sigma * DFMA design for manufacture / assembly * Digital simulation engineering * Requirement-driven design * Specification-managed validation * Configuration management =Concurrent engineering workflow= Concurrent engineering (British English: simultaneous engineering) is a workflow that, instead of working sequentially through stages, carries out a number of tasks in parallel. For example: starting tool design as soon as the detailed design has started, and before the detailed designs of the product are finished; or starting on detail design solid models before the concept design surfaces models are complete. Although this does not necessarily reduce the amount of manpower required for a project, as more changes are required due to the incomplete and changing information, it does drastically reduce lead times and thus time to market.CE is so defined by the PACE consortium (Walker, 1997) Feature-based CAD systems have for many years allowed the simultaneous work on 3D solid model and the 2D drawing by means of two separate files, with the drawing looking at the data in the model; when the model changes the drawing will associatively update. Some CAD packages also allow associative copying of geometry between files. This allows, for example, the copying of a part design into the files used by the tooling designer. The manufacturing engineer can then start work on tools before the final design freeze; when a design changes size or shape the tool geometry will then update. Concurrent engineering also has the added benefit of providing better and more immediate communication between departments, reducing the chance of costly, late design changes. It adopts a problem prevention method as compared to the problem solving and re-designing method of traditional sequential engineering. =Bottom‚Äìup design= Bottom‚Äìup design (CAD-centric) occurs where the definition of 3D models of a product starts with the construction of individual components. These are then virtually brought together in sub-assemblies of more than one level until the full product is digitally defined. This is sometimes known as the \\"review structure\\" which shows what the product will look like. The BOM contains all of the physical (solid) components of a product from a CAD system; it may also (but not always) contain other 'bulk items' required for the final product but which (in spite of having definite physical mass and volume) are not usually associated with CAD geometry such as paint, glue, oil, adhesive tape and other materials. Bottom‚Äìup design tends to focus on the capabilities of available real-world physical technology, implementing those solutions which this technology is most suited to. When these bottom‚Äìup solutions have real-world value, bottom‚Äìup design can be much more efficient than top‚Äìdown design. The risk of bottom‚Äìup design is that it very efficiently provides solutions to low-value problems. The focus of bottom‚Äìup design is \\"what can we most efficiently do with this technology?\\" rather than the focus of top‚Äìdown which is \\"What is the most valuable thing to do?\\" =Top‚Äìdown design= Top‚Äìdown design is focused on high-level functional requirements, with relatively less focus on existing implementation technology. A top level spec is repeatedly decomposed into lower level structures and specifications, until the physical implementation layer is reached. The risk of a top‚Äìdown design is that it may not take advantage of more efficient applications of current physical technology, due to excessive layers of lower-level abstraction due to following an abstraction path which does not efficiently fit available components e.g. separately specifying sensing, processing, and wireless communications elements even though a suitable component that combines these may be available. The positive value of top‚Äìdown design is that it preserves a focus on the optimum solution requirements. A part-centric top‚Äìdown design may eliminate some of the risks of top‚Äìdown design. This starts with a layout model, often a simple 2D sketch defining basic sizes and some major defining parameters, which may include some Industrial design elements. Geometry from this is associatively copied down to the next level, which represents different subsystems of the product. The geometry in the sub-systems is then used to define more detail in levels below. Depending on the complexity of the product, a number of levels of this assembly are created until the basic definition of components can be identified, such as position and principal dimensions. This information is then associatively copied to component files. In these files the components are detailed; this is where the classic bottom‚Äìup assembly starts. The top‚Äìdown assembly is sometime known as a \\"control structure\\". If a single file is used to define the layout and parameters for the review structure it is often known as a skeleton file. Defense engineering traditionally develops the product structure from the top down. The system engineering process prescribes a functional decomposition of requirements and then physical allocation of product structure to the functions. This top down approach would normally have lower levels of the product structure developed from CAD data as a bottom‚Äìup structure or design. =Both-ends-against-the-middle design= Both-ends-against-the-middle (BEATM) design is a design process that endeavors to combine the best features of top‚Äìdown design, and bottom‚Äìup design into one process. A BEATM design process flow may begin with an emergent technology which suggests solutions which may have value, or it may begin with a top‚Äìdown view of an important problem which needs a solution. In either case the key attribute of BEATM design methodology is to immediately focus at both ends of the design process flow: a top‚Äìdown view of the solution requirements, and a bottom‚Äìup view of the available technology which may offer promise of an efficient solution. The BEATM design process proceeds from both ends in search of an optimum merging somewhere between the top‚Äìdown requirements, and bottom‚Äìup efficient implementation. In this fashion, BEATM has been shown to genuinely offer the best of both methodologies. Indeed, some of the best success stories from either top‚Äìdown or bottom‚Äìup have been successful because of an intuitive, yet unconscious use of the BEATM methodology. When employed consciously, BEATM offers even more powerful advantages. =Front loading design and workflow= Front loading is taking top‚Äìdown design to the next stage. The complete control structure and review structure, as well as downstream data such as drawings, tooling development and CAM models, are constructed before the product has been defined or a project kick-off has been authorized. These assemblies of files constitute a template from which a family of products can be constructed. When the decision has been made to go with a new product, the parameters of the product are entered into the template model and all the associated data is updated. Obviously predefined associative models will not be able to predict all possibilities and will require additional work. The main principle is that a lot of the experimental/investigative work has already been completed. A lot of knowledge is built into these templates to be reused on new products. This does require additional resources \\"up front\\" but can drastically reduce the time between project kick-off and launch. Such methods do however require organizational changes, as considerable engineering efforts are moved into \\"offline\\" development departments. It can be seen as an analogy to creating a concept car to test new technology for future products, but in this case the work is directly used for the next product generation. =Design in context= Individual components cannot be constructed in isolation. CAD and CAID models of components are created within the context of some or all of the other components within the product being developed. This is achieved using assembly modelling techniques. Geometry of other components can be seen and referenced within the CAD tool being used. The other referenced components may or may not have been created using the same CAD tool, with their geometry being translated from other collaborative product development (CPD) formats. Some assembly checking such as DMU is also carried out using product visualization software. Product and process lifecycle management (PPLM) Product and process lifecycle management (PPLM) is an alternate genre of PLM in which the process by which the product is made is just as important as the product itself. Typically, this is the life sciences and advanced specialty chemicals markets. The process behind the manufacture of a given compound is a key element of the regulatory filing for a new drug application. As such, PPLM seeks to manage information around the development of the process in a similar fashion that baseline PLM talks about managing information around development of the product. One variant of PPLM implementations are Process Development Execution Systems (PDES). They typically implement the whole development cycle of high-tech manufacturing technology developments, from initial conception, through development and into manufacture. PDES integrate people with different backgrounds from potentially different legal entities, data, information and knowledge and business processes. Market size Total spending on PLM software and services was estimated in 2006 to be above $30 billion a year. After the Great Recession, PLM investments from 2010 onwards showed a higher growth rate than most general IT spending. Pyramid of production systems Pyramid of Production Systems According to Malakooti (2013), there are five long-term objectives that should be considered in production systems: * Cost: Which can be measured in terms of monetary units and usually consists of fixed and variable cost. * Productivity: Which can be measured in terms of the number of products produced during a period of time. * Quality: Which can be measured in terms of customer satisfaction levels for example. * Flexibility: Which can be considered the ability of the system to produce a variety of products for example. * Sustainability: Which can be measured in terms ecological soundness i.e. biological and environmental impacts of a production system. The relation between these five objects can be presented as pyramid with its tip associated with the lowest Cost, highest Productivity, highest Quality, most Flexibility, and greatest Sustainability. The points inside of this pyramid are associated with different combinations of five criteria. The tip of the pyramid represents an ideal (but likely highly unfeasible) system whereas the base of the pyramid represents the worst system possible.

He had four spaceflights, the first three of which were Space Shuttle missions lasting 10 to 11 days each. His fourth and final spaceflight was a long-duration stay aboard the International Space Station as a crew member of Expedition 4, which lasted from December 2001 to June 2002. This 196-day mission set a new record for the longest duration spaceflight for an American astronaut, a record simultaneously set with his crew mate Carl Walz. Their record has since been broken, and as of 2016 it is held by Scott Kelly, who flew a 340-day mission during Expeditions 43, 44 and 45. Education Bursch graduated from Vestal Senior High School, Vestal, New York, in 1975; received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the United States Naval Academy in 1979, and a Master of Science degree in Engineering Science from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1991. Navy career Bursch graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1979, and was designated a Naval Flight Officer in April 1980 at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. After initial training as an A-6E Intruder bombardier/navigator (B/N), he reported to VA-34 in January 1981, and deployed to the Mediterranean aboard the aircraft carrier , and to the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans aboard . He attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in January 1984. Upon graduation in December he worked as a project test flight officer flying the A-6 Intruder until August 1984, when he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as a flight instructor. In April 1987, Bursch was assigned to the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1, as Strike Operations Officer, making deployments to the Indian Ocean aboard the cruiser and the carrier . Redesignated an Aeronautical Engineering Duty officer (AEDO), he attended the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, from July 1989 until his selection to the astronaut program. He has flown over 3,430 flight hours in more than 35 different aircraft. Astronaut career Selected by NASA in January 1990, Bursch became an astronaut in July 1991. His technical assignments to date include: Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch, working on controls and displays for the Space Shuttle and Space Station; Chief of Astronaut Appearances; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control. A veteran of four space flights, Bursch has logged over 227 days in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-51 (1993), STS-68 (1994) and STS-77 (1996), and served as flight engineer on International Space Station Expedition 4 (2001‚Äì2002). Dan Bursch and fellow astronaut Carl Walz completed one of the longest U.S. space flights of 196 days in space. In January 2003, Bursch reported to the Naval Postgraduate School for a two-year assignment as an instructor in the Space Systems Academic Group. He left NASA in May 2005 and later retired from active duty in July 2005 after 26 years of service in the U.S. Navy. Bursch joined The Aerospace Corporation in July 2005 and is currently serving as the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Chair at the Naval Postgraduate School. =STS-51= STS-51 launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 12, 1993. During the ten-day mission the crew of five aboard the deployed the U.S. Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), and the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) with NASA and German scientific experiments aboard. Following a spacewalk by two crew members to evaluate Hubble Space Telescope repair tools, the crew initiated rendezvous burns and Bursch recovered the SPAS using the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The mission concluded on September 22, 1993, with the first night landing at the Kennedy Space Center. Mission duration was 236 hours and 11 minutes. =STS-68= STS-68, Space Radar Lab-2 (SRL-2), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 30, 1994. As part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, SRL-2 was the second flight of three advanced radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide pollution sensor, MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together in Endeavours cargo bay to study Earth's surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth's surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth, the eleven-day mission ended with Space Shuttle Endeavour landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 11, 1994. Mission duration was 269 hours and 46 minutes. =STS-77= STS-77 launched from the Kennedy Space Center on May 19, 1996. It included the fourth Spacehab module flight as a scientific laboratory, designated SPACEHAB-4. It consisted of 12 separate materials processing, fluid physics and biotechnology experiments, with an emphasis on commercial space product development. STS-77 completed a record four rendezvous in support of two satellites sponsored by the Goddard Space Flight Center, and the SPARTAN 207/Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) and the Passive Aerodynamically stabilized Magnetically damped Satellite/Satellite Test Unit (PAMS/STU). Following 160 orbits of the Earth, the ten-day mission ended with Space Shuttle Endeavour landing at the Kennedy Space Center on May 29, 1996. Mission duration was 240 hours and 39 minutes. =Expedition 4= The Expedition 4 crew launched on December 5, 2001 aboard STS-108 and docked with the International Space Station on December 7, 2001. During a 6¬Ω month stay aboard the Space Station, the Expedition 4 crew of three (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. The crew spent 196 days in space establishing a U.S. space flight endurance record for Dan Bursch and crew mate Carl Walz. Wearing the Russian Orlan spacesuit, Bursch logged 11 hours and 48 minutes of EVA time in two separate spacewalks.

The term \\"anusim\\" is most properly translated as the \\"coerced [ones]\\" or the \\"forced [ones]\\". Etymology The term anusim derives from the Talmudic phrase averah b‚Äôones (),Talmud, Abod√° Zar√° 54a meaning \\"a forced transgression.\\" The Hebrew ones (pronounced \\"oh'nes\\") derives from the triconsonantal root ◊ê-◊†-◊° (Aleph-Nun-Samekh), and originally referred to any case where a person has been forced into any act against his or her will. In Modern Hebrew, the word ones is mainly used to mean rape, thus \\"anusim\\" (or female \\"anusot\\") nowadays means rape victims, the older meaning used only in the historical context. The term an√∫s is used in contradistinction to meshumad (), (literally \\"self-destroyed\\") which means a person who has voluntarily abandoned the practice of Jewish law in whole or part. The forced converts were also known as cristianos nuevos (Spanish) or crist√£os-novos (Portuguese); converso or marrano, which had and still has today a pejorative connotation in Spanish. Related terms Besides the term anusim, halakha has various classifications for those Jews who have abandoned, or are no longer committed to, the rabbinic Jewish tradition, whether or not they have converted to another religion. The two most common descriptions are: * \\"Min (), or an apostate of Judaism, for a Jew who basically denies the existence of God; and * \\"Meshumad (), literally \\"self-destroyed\\" or a heretic to Judaism, for a Jew who deliberately rebels against the observance of Jewish law. The main difference between a min, a meshumad, and the anusim is that the act of abandonment of Judaism is voluntary for a min and a meshumad, while for the anusim it is not. In more recent times, the term Anusim has also been used to describe Reverse Marranos, that is, Haredi Jews who are religious on the outside, but are not necessarily practicing in private. History of use The term anusim became more frequently used after the forced conversion to Christianity of Ashkenazi Jews in Germany at the end of the 11th century. In his religious legal opinions, Rashi, a French rabbi who lived during this period, commented about the issue of anusim. Several centuries later, following the mass forced conversion of Sephardi Jews (those Jews with extended histories in Spain and Portugal, known jointly as Iberia, or \\"Sepharad\\" in Hebrew) of the 15th and 16th centuries, the term \\"anusim\\" became widely used by Spanish rabbis and their successors for the following 600 years,Medieval Jewish History Resource Directory henceforth becoming associated with Sephardic history. The term may be properly applied to any Jew of any ethnic division. Since that time, it has also been applied to other forced or coerced converted Jews, such as the Mashadi Jews of Persia (modern Iran), who converted to Islam in the public eye, but secretly practised Judaism at home. They lived dual-religious lives, being fully practising Muslims in public life, and fully practising Jews at home.See Mashhadi Jewish Community History on MashadiRabbi.com In non-rabbinic literature, the more widely known Sephardic anusim are also referred to as: *\\"Conversos\\", meaning \\"converts [to Christianity]\\" in Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan and Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish). *\\"New Christians\\", or cristianos nuevos in Spanish, and crist√£os novos in Portuguese (Catalan: cristians nous), which also encompasses converts from Islam. *\\"Crypto-Jews\\", and *\\"Marranos\\", a term which refers to those conversos which practiced Judaism in secret and, as a result, were targeted by the Spanish inquisition. In rabbinic literature The subject of anusim has a special place in rabbinic literature. In normal circumstances, a person who abandons Jewish observance, or part of it, is classified as a meshumad. Such a person is still counted as a Jew for purposes of lineage, but is under a disability to claim any privilege pertaining to Jewish status: for example, he should not be counted in a minyan, that is, a quorum for religious services. Anusim, by contrast, not only remain Jews by lineage but continue to count as fully qualified Jews for all purposes. Since the act of the original abandonment of the religion was done against the Jew's will, the Jew under force may remain a kosher Jew, as long as the an√∫s keeps practising Jewish law to the best of his/her abilities under the coerced condition. In this sense, \\"kosher\\" is the rabbinic legal term applied to a Jew who adheres to rabbinic tradition and is accordingly not subject to any disqualification. Rabbinic legal opinions Se‚Äòady√° ben Maim√≥n ibn Danan in the 15th century stated: Ben- Zion Meir Hai Uziel, the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of the State of Israel, stated in the mid-20th century: It follows that Uziel considered anus√≠m as Jews, because only Jews can give or receive a get, a Jewish divorce. Maimonides stated in the Mishneh Torah Sefer Shofet√≠m, Hilekh√≥t Mumar√≠m 3:3:  Current status  There is much controversy regarding the status of conversions today. While the chief rabbis are wary of converting large groups, there are some rabbis such as Haim Amsalem and Chuck Davidson who have done mass conversions of Bnei Anusim. In the United States Reform rabbi Jacques Cukierkorn is one of the leaders of the outreach to the descendants of those Crypto-Jews who wish to renew their ties with the Jewish people.

It was intended to operate from I-400 class submarines whose original mission was to conduct aerial attacks against the United States. Design and development From the late 1920s, the Imperial Japanese Navy had developed a doctrine of operating floatplanes from submarines to search for targets.Layman and McLaughlin 1991, p. 176. In December 1941, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, proposed constructing a large fleet of submarine aircraft carriers (also designated STo or sen-toku ‚Äî special submarine) whose purpose was to mount aerial attacks against American coastal cities. The submarines would surface to launch their aircraft by catapult, submerge to avoid detection, then surface again to retrieve the aircrews who would ditch their planes nearby. By June 1942, the plan was to build a fleet of eighteen such subs. This was later cut to nine, then five and finally just three as Japan's wartime fortunes declined.Layman and McLaughlin 1991, p. 177.Air International October 1989, pp. 182‚Äì3. To equip the submarine aircraft carriers, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service requested that Aichi design a folding attack aircraft with a range of and a speed of . Aichi was already manufacturing under license, the D4Y1 Suisei (Judy), a relatively small single-engined carrier dive bomber with exceptionally clean lines and high performance. Detailed engineering studies commenced in an effort to modify the Suisei for use aboard the I-400 submarines but the difficulties in doing so were eventually judged insurmountable and a completely new design was initiated.Sakaida, p. 19. Simplified line drawing of an M6A1 folded for transport. Aichi's final design, designated AM-24 by Aichi and given the military designation M6A1, was a two-seat, low-winged monoplane powered by a Aichi AE1P Atsuta 30 engine (a licence-built copy of the Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid-cooled V12 engine). The original specification dispensed with a traditional undercarriage but it was later decided to fit the aircraft with detachable twin floats to increase its versatility. If conditions permitted, these would allow the aircraft to alight next to the submarine, be recovered by crane and then re-used. The floats could be jettisoned in flight to increase performance or left off altogether for one-way missions.Air International October 1989, pp. 183‚Äì4. The Seiran's wings rotated 90 degrees and folded hydraulically against the aircraft's fuselage (with the tail also folding down) to allow for storage within the submarine's diameter cylindrical hangar. Armament was a single torpedo or an equivalent weight in bombs. One Type 2 machine gun was mounted on a flexible mounting for use by the observer.Air International October 1989, pp. 185‚Äì186.Francillon 1970, p. 292.Layman and McLaughlin 1991, p. 179. As finalised, each I-400 class submarine had an enlarged watertight hangar capable of accommodating up to three M6A1s. The Seirans were to be launched from a compressed-air catapult mounted on the forward deck. A well-trained crew of four men could roll a Seiran out of its hangar on a collapsible catapult carriage, attach the plane's pontoons and have it readied for flight in approximately 7 minutes.Sakaida, p. 20 In order to shorten the launching process and eliminate the need for time-consuming engine warm-ups, the Seirans were to be catapulted from a cold start. This necessitated heating the engine oil for each plane to approximately in a separate chamber and pumping it, as well as hot water, through the engine just prior to launch while the planes were still in the hangar. In this way, the aircraft's engine would be at or near normal operating temperature immediately upon getting airborne. The idea was borrowed from the Germans who planned on using a similar launch method for the aircraft of their unfinished carrier Graf Zeppelin.\\"Secrets of the Dead\\" ‚Äì PBS tv special. Retrieved 7 May 2010.Burke, p. 86 The first of eight prototype Seirans was completed in October 1943, commencing flight testing in November that year. A problem with overbalance of the auxiliary wings was eventually solved by raising the height of the tail fin. Further testing was sufficiently successful for production to start in early 1944. In order to aid pilot conversion to the Seiran, two examples of a land based trainer version fitted with a retractable undercarriage were built. These were given the designation M6A1-K Nanzan (\\"Southern Mountain\\"). Besides the difference in landing gear, the vertical stabilizer's top portion, which was foldable on the Seiran, was removed.Air International October 1989, p. 186. Operational history The first production examples of the Seiran were completed in October 1944. Deliveries were slowed by an earthquake near Nagoya on 7 December 1944, and by an American air-raid on 12 March 1945. Construction of the STo submarines was stopped in March 1945, after two submarine aircraft carriers had been completed and a third finished as a fuel tanker. These were supplemented by two smaller Type AM submarines, originally designed as command submarines carrying reconnaissance floatplanes, but capable of carrying two Seirans.Layman and McLaughlin 1991, pp. 176‚Äì177. Owing to the reduced carrier submarine force, production of the Seiran was halted, with a total of 28 completed (including the prototypes and the M6A1-Ks).Air International October 1989, p. 187. The new submarines and aircraft were assigned to the 1st Submarine Flotilla, comprising the two STo submarines, the I-400 and the flagship I-401, each carrying three Seirans together with two type AMs, the I-13 and I-14. The 1st Submarine Flotilla commenced training with the Seirans in January 1945, the crews gradually learning how to handle the submarines and aircraft. Launching all three Seirans took longer than expected: 30 minutes if floats were fitted, although this could be reduced to 14.5 minutes if the floats were not used. The first mission of the Seiran squadron, which was named the was to be a surprise air strike on the Gatun locks of the Panama Canal, to cut the main supply line for US forces in the Pacific. When the force was finally ready to set off on their mission against Panama, Japan's increasingly desperate situation led to a change in plan, with the target for the attack, called Operation Hikari (Splendour), being switched to the American base at Ulithi Atoll where forces, including aircraft carriers, were massing in preparation for attacks on the Japanese Home Islands. The flotilla departed Japan on 23 July 1945 and proceeded towards Ulithi. On 16 August, the flagship I-401 received a radio message from headquarters, informing them of Japan's surrender and ordering them to return to Japan.Air International October 1989, pp. 187‚Äì188, 201.Tamiya, Aichi M6A1 Seiran, 1/48 Scale Aircraft Series No.54Layman and McLaughlin 1991, pp. 179‚Äì180. All six Seirans on board the two submarines, having been disguised for the operation as American planes in violation of the laws of war, were catapulted into the sea with their wings and stabilizers folded (for the I-401) or pushed overboard (for the I-400) to prevent capture.Air International October 1989, p. 201.

Johnson Space Center, and at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Moscow, Russia. He later earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Michigan State University in 2002. He enjoys flying, athletics, woodworking, reading, shooting, motorcycle riding, and amateur radio. He was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Star Scout. At MIT, Cameron was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Military and flight experience Cameron was commissioned in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970 at Officer Candidate School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. After graduating from The Basic School and Vietnamese language school, he was assigned to the Republic of Vietnam for a one-year tour of duty as an infantry platoon commander with the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines and later with the Marine Security Guards at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. Upon his return to the United States, he served as executive officer with India Company, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, in 1972 for flight training, receiving his Naval Aviator wings in 1973. He was then assigned to VMA-223 at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, flying A-4M Skyhawks. In 1976, Cameron was reassigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he participated in the Marine College Degree and Advanced Degree Programs. Upon graduation, he was assigned to flying duty for one year with Marine Aircraft Group 12 at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. He was subsequently assigned to the Pacific Missile Test Center in 1980, and in 1982 to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. Following graduation in 1983, he was assigned as project officer and test pilot in the F/A-18 Hornet, A-4, and OV-10 Bronco airplanes with the Systems Engineering Test Directorate at the Naval Air Test Center. He has logged over 4,000 hours flying time in 48 different types of aircraft. NASA career Selected by NASA in May 1984, Cameron became an astronaut in June 1985. His technical assignments have included work on Tethered Satellite Payload, flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), launch support activities at Kennedy Space Center, and spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control for STS-28, 29, 30, 33 and 34. Cameron's management assignments in NASA include Section Chief for astronaut software testing in SAIL, astronaut launch support activities, and Operations Assistant to the Hubble Repair Mission Director. In 1994, Cameron served as the first NASA Director of Operations in Star City, Russia, where he worked with the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center staff to set up a support system for astronaut operations and training in Star City, and received Russian training in Soyuz and Mir spacecraft systems, and flight training in Russian L-39 aircraft. He was absent from NASA between 1996 and 2003. However, following the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and her crew, Cameron returned to the space program in October 2003, taking a founding position as a Principal Engineer in the NASA Engineering & Safety Center, based at the NASA Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia. In June 2005, Cameron was selected as Deputy Director for Safety of the NESC, and in June 2007 he was relocated to the NESC office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. A veteran of three space flights, Cameron has logged over 561 hours in space. He served as Pilot on STS-37 (April 5‚Äì11, 1991), and was the spacecraft commander on STS-56 (April 9‚Äì17, 1993) and STS-74 (November 12‚Äì20, 1995). =Spaceflight experience= Cameron flew his first mission as Pilot on STS-37. This mission was launched on April 5, 1991, and featured the deployment of the Gamma Ray Observatory for the purpose of exploring gamma ray sources throughout the universe. Space Shuttle Atlantis landed on April 11, 1991. On his second mission, he was spacecraft commander on STS-56, carrying ATLAS-2. During this nine-day mission, the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery conducted atmospheric and solar studies in order to better understand the effect of solar activity on the Earth's climate and environment, and deployed and retrieved the autonomous observatory Spartan. STS-56 launched on April 8, 1993, and landed at Kennedy Space Center on April 17, 1993. On his third mission, Cameron commanded Atlantis on STS-74, NASA's second Space Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian space station Mir, and the first mission to use the Shuttle to assemble a module and attach it to a space station. STS-74 launched on November 12, 1995, and landed at Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1995. Post-NASA career Cameron in 2008 Following his first NASA retirement on August 5, 1996, he joined Hughes Training, Inc., a subsidiary of General Motors Corporation, as Executive Director of Houston Operations. In September 1997, Cameron transferred to Saab Automobile, AB, in Sweden, as Vehicle Line Executive for the Saab 9-3 automobile. He was called \\"Kalle Comet\\" by his co workers at Saab. Upon his return to the United States, Cameron worked at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, near Detroit, in positions in World Wide Purchasing, Supplier Technology Acquisition, Research and Development, and Fuel Cell Vehicle Development. Cameron retired from NASA for good in December 2008 to join Northrop Grumman Corporation as the Director of Houston Operations for Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems.

A crossover is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters, settings, or universes into the context of a single story. They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant copyright holders, unauthorized efforts by fans or common corporate ownership.  Official and unofficial crossovers  = Official = Crossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the intellectual property rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one. Crossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the public domain with those concurrently under copyright protection. A crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from The Golden Girls and Empty Nest) or meeting via dimensional rift or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for science fiction properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series' respective continuities. Still, others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with The Simpsons and Futurama, where each show is fiction in the other. = Unofficial = In contrast with legal crossovers, unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by its producers. Generally, unofficial crossovers take the form of fan-written fiction and fan art, but it is increasingly prevalent in amateur films and audio. Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright, royalties payments, quality of writing and ownership of the characters, unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns, so long as property holders do not exercise their right to enjoin the distribution of such material. A good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film Batman: Dead End which brings together the properties of Batman, Alien and Predator in one setting. Unofficial crossovers can also occur in a \\"what-if\\" scenario. Roger makes frequent cameo appearances in Family Guy, while Brian makes cameos on American Dad!. Roger, Rallo Tubbs, and Klaus Heissler were seen in the final Family Guy Star Wars spoof, \\"It's A Trap!\\", as an Imperial Officer, Nien Nunb, and Admiral Ackbar, respectively. Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on Bones when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor, with David Boreanaz (who plays Booth) repaying the favor in \\"Road to the North Pole\\". An appearance by Elmo, from Sesame Street, was made, in a hallucination of Connie Ray's, on TV sitcom The Torkelsons. Fan fiction fusions between different science fiction movies and series are often created, such as Star Wars vs. Star Trek or Babylon 5 vs. Stargate. M.U.G.E.N. is a fighting game engine that features many fan-created and fictional characters and stages from various television series, movies, as well as other video games.  Comics  Golden Age, where characters frequently teamed up on the cover (though far more rarely on the inside). Speed Comics number 32, Artwork by Alex Schomburg. Captain Marvel and Bulletman join forces to battle Captain Nazi. Master Comics number 21, Artwork by Mac Rayboy. Crossovers of multiple characters, owned by one company or published by one publisher, have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of comic book publishers, as different characters in various Marvel, DC, or Valiant comic books frequently interact with one another since they live in a \\"shared universe\\". For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, Spider-Man has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, Daredevil, just as in the DC Comics Universe, the Flash and Green Lantern often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these \\"guest star\\" roles are common enough that they are generally not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a team-up. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title. This has led to \\"crossover events\\" in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe. The earliest such crossover event was Gardner Fox's Zatanna's Search which took place in Hawkman #4 (October/November 1964), Detective Comics #336 (February 1965), The Atom #19 (June/July 1965), Green Lantern #42 (January 1966), Detective Comics #355 (September 1966), and Justice League of America #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with Zatanna attempting to reconnect with her father, Zatara, and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, Robin, the Atom, Green Lantern, and the Elongated Man along the way. The first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, Jim Shooter. As a way to further toy sales he devised the Secret Wars crossover which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a 12-issue miniseries to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with, they all returned to their regular titles. Secret Wars was hailed as both a critical and commercial success, largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of Spider-Man's black suit which would later become the villain Venom). Jim Shooter later perfected his crossover technique at Valiant Comics with the Unity event. Unity brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat Mothergod, but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like Secret Wars, the Unity crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe; most notably the introduction of Turok, the birth of Magnus, Robot Fighter and the death of a major Valiant hero. Dark Horse Comics's Aliens Versus Predator comic book franchise was a success that continued into many video games, two movies and even an Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator comic. The comic crossovers from Raj Comics are very famous in India, in which the super heroes meet to fight a common enemy. Many of these crossovers have occurred between Nagraj and Super Commando Dhruva. In Kohram, all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish Haru, an extremely powerful enemy. Webcomics creators sometimes produce crossovers; one of the first was a two-week sequence between Christopher Baldwin's Bruno and Peter Zale's Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet in 1998. In 2013, Archie Comics released a 12-part crossover of Capcom character Mega Man and Sega character Sonic the Hedgehog called \\"Worlds Collide\\". Taking place in issues of the Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Universe, and Mega Man comic series from Archie, the crossover involved Dr. Eggman and Dr. Wily forming an alliance to take over both their universes and destroy their respective nemeses. Sonic and Mega Man were briefly tricked into fighting each other, but later joined forces and teamed up with other heroes to battle the doctors' forces, which included virtually every Robot Master introduced in the Mega Man games. The popularity of this crossover and the books involved led to a second crossover in 2015 entitled \\"Worlds Unite\\", which not only reunited Sonic and Mega Man, but also featured comics-exclusive characters from both of their books, the Mega Man X and Sonic Boom spinoff franchises and various other SEGA and Capcom franchises. This crossover was enabled by the conclusion of the first crossover, which saw a reboot to the Sonic books as their universe was drastically rewritten. Aftereffects of this included the Genesis Portals, gateways connecting worlds that would be exploited by Mega Man X villain Sigma and his minions, forcing a reunion between Sonic and Mega Man and an alliance between heroes of the various franchises involved. \\"Worlds Unite\\" spans not only the three series featured in the first crossover, but also includes the Sonic Boom comic series, which entered publication between the two crossovers. There are also intercompany crossovers, where characters owned by two different companies meet, such as those from DC and Marvel.  Animation  Cartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them ‚Äì like comics or live- action TV shows ‚Äì will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is Cartoon Network's The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door. It features five crossovers ‚Äì Ed, Edd n Eddy, Codename: Kids Next Door, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, a reference to The Powerpuff Girls and a quote from Scooby-Doo, which are all licensed Cartoon Network series. The cast of Ben 10: Ultimate Alien and Generator Rex team up in Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United. Similarly, characters from Uncle Grandpa and Steven Universe appeared in a crossover episode \\"Say Uncle\\". The same occurred with The Powerpuff Girls and Teen Titans Go! in an episode called \\"TTG v PPG\\". OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes did a crossover episode called \\"Crossover Nexus\\" to celebrate 25 years of Cartoon Network where the lead character joined forces with Ben 10, Garnet from Steven Universe and Raven from Teen Titans Go!. Most of the last episodes of the Lilo & Stitch: The Series (a spinoff of the film Lilo & Stitch) had crossovers with various other Disney cartoons, including The Proud Family, Kim Possible, Recess, and American Dragon Jake Long. The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour trilogy is another example, in which Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes. The Disney TV series Hercules, based on the 1997 film of the same name, had an episode titled \\"Hercules and the Arabian Night\\" that had a crossover between the characters of the TV series and film and with the characters of the Disney film Aladdin in which Hades and Jafar each try to get rid of each other's enemies (Hades would try to defeat Aladdin while Jafar would try to defeat Hercules). Another crossover is Rugrats Go Wild in which the Rugrats are stranded on an island where The Wild Thornberrys were at the time. In Dexter's Laboratory \\"Dial M for Monkey\\" \\"Huntor\\" who tries to hunt Monkey is himself hunted; \\"Huntor\\" later makes a cameo crossover in Samurai Jack's \\"Jack vs Mad Jack.\\" During the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the Hanna-Barbera properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on The New Scooby-Doo Movies which featured appearances by characters from Harlem Globetrotters, Josie and the Pussycats, Jeannie, Speed Buggy, Batman and Robin, and The Addams Family. Later, the Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10 set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones. This was taken to an extreme in the 1977‚Äì79 series Laff-A-Lympics, which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series. Crossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney's movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and Warner Bros. Daffy Duck and Donald Duck made a simultaneous appearance in one scene in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet. Later in the movie, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny were shown parachuting together (to keep things from getting too iffy legally, Mickey and Bugs' lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie). The film also includes cameos of characters from MGM. The end of the movie features all the cartoons from all of the animation companies joining together in song, to be concluded by Porky Pig stuttering his famous \\"That's All, Folks!\\" line as Tinker Bell ends the scene with a magical fade-out. On February 27, 1998, Fox Kids show, Power Rangers in Space and Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation, had their crossover with the episode \\"Shell Shocked\\". On October 4, 1997, The 2 Kids WB shows, Superman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, had their first crossover with the TV movie World's Finest, which was also released on DVD. Another cartoon crossover would occur in 1990, Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue. This cartoon featured popular characters from children's Saturday morning cartoons, banding together to promote an anti-drug message. ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC aired this half-hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks, including Huey, Dewey, and Louie (from Disney's DuckTales), Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Slimer (from The Real Ghostbusters and Extreme Ghostbusters), Michelangelo (from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Alvin and the Chipmunks, The Smurfs, ALF (from his short- lived cartoon spinoff), Garfield, and the trio of Baby Kermit, Baby Piggy, and Baby Gonzo (from Jim Henson's Muppet Babies). Animation companies granted unlimited, royalty-free use of their cartoon characters for this project, a feat that has been unequalled before or since then. This cartoon was also introduced by then-President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide. Manga artist Leiji Matsumoto has been known to cross over the characters of his various stories and characters such as Captain Harlock, Galaxy Express 999, and Queen Millennia, all of which were originally written as separate, self- contained stories. In the Maetel Legend, Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been Yukino Yaoi, the protagonist from Queen Millennia. Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with Space Battleship Yamato, an anime on which he served as director, although the rights to Yamato are actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki. The adult parody-oriented series Drawn Together features many crossovers; while some are regular cameos, such as Peter and Lois Griffin from Family Guy, others involve a personality twist, such as the homicidal version of Bambi from the eponymous film or the gay version of Elmer Fudd from the Looney Tunes franchise. The Disney/Marvel crossover Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel features the Marvel heroes Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, and Thor, the Marvel villains Whiplash, MODOK, Red Skull, and Venom, and characters from Phineas and Ferb, where the storyline involves Phineas and Ferb trying to restore power to the Marvel heroes, whose powers were taken away by Doofenshmirtz. During its 26th season, The Simpsons has crossovers with Family Guy and Futurama. In the hour-long Family Guy season 13 premiere \\"The Simpsons Guy\\", the Griffins meet the Simpson family, who meet the Planet Express crew in the Simpsons episode \\"Simpsorama\\". In the Disney series House of Mouse, Mickey Mouse and friends host a nightclub featuring cameos by other Disney characters. Webtoons (animated shows from the internet) can also have crossovers with different webtoons, franchises, YouTubers and more. Some examples are when Kate from TomSka's Crash Zoom series makes an appearance in Eddsworld as a trick or treater who possesses Matt and Edd in the episode, \\"Trick or Threat\\". In addition to this a couple of characters from Eddsworld make appearances in some Crash Zoom episodes such as \\"Orcs and Dorks\\". Another example is Death Battle which is a show where two hosts (Wiz and Boomstick) put two characters from different franchises together to battle each other. These characters range from television, movie, video game, or comic franchises. Shows like One Minute Melee, Cartoon Fight Club, and Death Battle Exhibitions (the spinoff series) have a similar format to Death Battle. The Netflix original series Harvey Girls Forever is a crossover of the comics Little Audrey, Little Dot and Little Lotta, although later episodes in the third and fourth season are crossovers of Richie Rich and Casper the Friendly Ghost.  Anime and Manga  Anime has also participated in many crossover events featuring characters or shows from the same company or network. One of the biggest projects down would be Dream 9 Toriko x One Piece x Dragon Ball Z Super Special Collaboration as it includes three Shonen Jump franchises, being Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, and Toriko, crossed over into an hour long special- like most crossovers, this special is filler, a fan-service episode that follows the common plot line in most crossovers. In the first half of the special, characters from the three franchises meet-up and fight. In the second half, they team up to battle a stronger foe. What makes this crossover unique is when the characters from all three shows split into groups, where the members all share the same clich√©d character archetypes, such the main characters Goku, Luffy, and Toriko falling into the dumb, good natured, strong character archetype. Carnival Phantasm is also an OVA comedy series based on a Type-Moon gag manga called Take-Moon. Created to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary, the anime consists of several funny and unusual scenarios involving various characters from the Type-Moon franchises. Some examples include characters from Fate/stay night and Tsukihime. The Dragon Ball franchise is one of the most popular manga and anime in the world, and has its fair share of crossovers as well. The creator of the franchise, Akira Toriyama, has used another character from a different manga series he created, Jaco from Jaco the Galactic Policeman as a reoccurring character in Dragon Ball Super. He comes to Earth to warn the characters about the return of Frieza and is later seen in the disputes involving Beerus and Champa. Cyborg 009 VS Devilman is a three part anime OVA that crosses over the Cyborg 009 and Devilman series. It originally aired on 17 October 2015 and then was released on 11 November 2015 Netflix currently owns the rights to this title. Other anime- or manga-based crossovers include: Digimon and Digimon Fusion, Fairy Tail x Rave Master, Isekai Quartet, It's a Rumic World: 50th Anniversary Weekly Shonen Sunday, Kamen Rider Fourze x Crayon Shin-chan, Lupin III vs. Detective Conan: the Movie, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Undersea Super Train: Marine Express, and Yu-Gi-Oh!: Bonds Beyond Time.  Film  Battle sequence in King Kong vs. Godzilla showing the title characters fighting each other. The first film crossover in a series of Universal Studios monster films was Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, in 1943. In 2003, Freddy vs. Jason was released by New Line Cinema. In 2004, 20th Century Fox released Alien vs. Predator along with the sequel Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007. One year later, both Dollman vs. Demonic Toys and Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys were released by 20th Century Fox and Terry Kelley Studios. In 2015, Sony released Lake Placid vs. Anaconda. After the comics publishing house Marvel Comics ventured into movie production, they set off to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie The Avengers (2012). The same process was repeated for Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Inspired by Marvel's success, Warner Bros., who hold movie rights for DC Comics' heroes, announced the production of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic DC Extended Universe, while Paramount Pictures and Allspark Pictures announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the Transformers film series. There have been numerous crossovers in Japanese cinema. The boom of kaiju films saw a lot of crossovers produced at Toho Studios, with some of the monsters forming teams in numerous movies, much like the Marvel movie franchise. Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in Mothra vs. Godzilla and a few months later of all three in Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. In 1962 Toho released King Kong vs. Godzilla. The long running Zatoichi series sees Shintaro Katsu's blind master swordsman face off with Toshiro Mifune in his iconic role in Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo (1970) and also features a unique cross-Asian project Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman (1971). This coproduction sees Jimmy Wang reprise his famous part of the One-Armed Swordsman while featuring two different endings for both the Japanese and Hong Kong audiences.  Games  Crossovers in video games occur when otherwise separated fictional characters, stories, settings, universes, or media in a video game meet and interact with each other. These can range from a character simply appearing as a playable character or boss in the game, as a special guest character, or a major crossover where two or more franchises encounter. Konami made the first crossover video game featuring Simon Belmont from Castlevania, Universal Picture's King Kong and Mikey from the Warner Bros. movie The Goonies in Konami Wai Wai World for the Famicom in 1988. The King of Fighters, Marvel vs. Capcom, and many other franchises from third-party developers such as Capcom and SNK bring these licenses together. The 2.5D fighting game series Super Smash Bros. brings various Nintendo characters together and allow players to fight against each other as these characters in arenas. The third game in the series, Super Smash Bros. Brawl introduced two third-party characters with the inclusion of Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog, of Konami's Metal Gear series and Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series respectively. The fourth installments, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, feature characters from the third-party franchises of Capcom's Mega Man (Mega Man) and Street Fighter (Ryu), Sega's Bayonetta (Bayonetta), Bandai Namco's Pac-Man (Pac-Man), and Square Enix's Final Fantasy (Cloud Strife), in addition to other Nintendo characters from the company's different universes. The fifth installment, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate also introduced Simon and Richter Belmont from Konami's Castlevania series, Ken Masters from Capcom's Street Fighter series, Joker from Persona 5, the Hero from the Dragon Quest series, Banjo-Kazooie from the Banjo-Kazooie series, Terry Bogard from the Fatal Fury series, and Steve/Alex from the Minecraft franchise in addition to bringing back all of the playable characters from the previous entries in the series. The Namco- developed Soul series features characters from a variety of other franchises including Link from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series, Heihachi Mishima from Tekken, Todd McFarlane's Spawn, Darth Vader, Yoda, and Starkiller from Star Wars, Lloyd Irving from Tales of Symphonia, Ubisoft Montreal's Ezio Auditore from the Assassin's Creed series, Geralt of Rivia from Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher, and YoRHa No. 2 Type B from PlatinumGames' Nier: Automata. Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, released in Japan two months before Super Smash Bros. Brawl, was the first time that Mario and Sonic (as well as their associated characters) appeared in a game together. The Kingdom Hearts series of role-playing games developed by Square Enix features a number of characters from Disney films, Final Fantasy, and The World Ends With You. Starting with Mortal Kombat, video game developer NetherRealm Studios has guest characters ranging from Mortal Kombat veterans Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Raiden to Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare on Elm Street, Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Xenomorph from Alien, The Predator from Predator, the T-800 from Terminator, Kratos from God of War, The Joker from Batman, all four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Todd McFarlane's Spawn and Mike Mignola's Hellboy. Super Robot Wars are turn-based strategy games featuring a variety of Japanese mecha series from many generations, such as Mazinger Z, Gundam, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and GaoGaiGar. Warriors Orochi is the game that features the casts of both the Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series. The third installment of this series included a number of playable characters from other Koei Tecmo properties, such as Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive, Zill O'll, and Sophitia Alexandra from Bandai Namco's Soul series. Warriors All-Stars similarly crossed-over a number of characters from Koei Tecmo series. More recently, there has been a collaboration between Capcom and Namco which results in Street Fighter X Tekken and the upcoming Tekken X Street Fighter. Heroes of the Storm is an example of the major crossover video game which is developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. This hero brawler brings various Blizzard's characters together as playable heroes, as well as different battlegrounds based on Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch universes. Perhaps one of the most notable video game crossovers is Lego Dimensions which makes use of over 30 different franchises, including DC Comics, Doctor Who, The Lego Movie, The Lord of the Rings, Sonic the Hedgehog, and more. A large number of video game characters make cameo appearances in the Disney computer- animated film Wreck-It Ralph and its sequel.  Literature  In literature, some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one. Kim Newman frequently uses this device, as does Stephen King. The works of James Branch Cabell, J.D. Salinger, William Faulkner, Margaret Laurence, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Mordecai Richler, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov also cross over with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works. Author Rick Riordan publishes multiple book series featuring gods of ancient civilizations in the modern day, which have had two crossovers and three references to other series. The first popular crossover in literature was the 1885 Mark Twain novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which had an important guest appearance by Tom Sawyer. Similarly, Lady Glencora Palliser from the Pallisers series of Anthony Trollope appears towards the end of Miss Mackenzie, a novel published between the first and second Palliser novels in 1865, a character first introduced in the novel, Can You Forgive Her? (1864). Science Fiction writer Poul Anderson allowed fellow writer A. Bertram Chandler to \\"borrow\\" Anderson's space-faring character Dominic Flandry and let Flandry meet with Chandler's John Grimes in a common adventure (the two fail to like each other). Alex Scarrow featured the characters Cato and Macro from his brother Simon's Eagles of the Empire series in one book of the TimeRiders series: Gates of Rome (2012), serving as supporting characters when the three protagonists travel back in time to Ancient Rome. Brazilian writer Monteiro Lobato also created solid and imaginative crossovers, using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the Cuca and Saci, from Greek mythology, from the Arabian Nights, from fairy tales such as Grimm's \\"Snow White\\", Western literature such as Peter Pan, cartoons such as Popeye and Felix the Cat, and Western films.  Public domain  It is also common for authors to 'crossover' characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of Philip Jos√© Farmer's Wold Newton family sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan). Roger Zelazny's novel A Night in the Lonesome October combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such (\\"The Count\\", \\"The Good Doctor\\", \\"Jack\\", etc.). Occasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or 'mythic' enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One, wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. Fu Manchu appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator Sax Rohmer, he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as 'the Devil Doctor'. Something similar occurs in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, wherein a character named \\"Jimmy\\" is clearly intended to be Ian Fleming's character James Bond, though here he is satirized as being an inept and unfavorable antagonist, likely to parody Sean Connery's appearance in the 2003 film adaptation. Another example in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is when a character is named to be the Anti- Christ, yet, despite never being named, is shown to be an evil Harry Potter. The TV show Once Upon a Time is set in a world in which all fairy tales coexist, including Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, and even Alice in Wonderland. (As a production of The Walt Disney Company, copyrighted elements from that company's productions have appeared in Once Upon a Time.) The Shrek film series is built on the same concept, and even includes references to then-copyrighted elements like Peter Pan (often in the form of satire).  Television series  =Between established shows= Crossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. The Law and Order series, for example, afford a commonality of setting and profession which lends itself to crossovers, both within the franchise and in a wider universe. Law & Order: SVU has crossed over several times with Chicago P.D. and Chicago Fire, as well as sharing a common character with Homicide: Life on the Street. NCIS has crossed over with NCIS: Los Angeles, NCIS: New Orleans and JAG, while NCIS: Los Angeles has crossed over with both Scorpion and Hawaii Five-0. Following the cancellation of the ABC soap opera One Life to Live and its high rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network's remaining soap opera General Hospital, remaining in the same timeline as their former show. The CSI franchise is another common example of the crossover phenomena, with the original series crossing over with CSI: Miami, CSI: Cyber, CSI: NY and Without a Trace. CSI: NY crossed over with fellow CBS series Cold Case, and Ted Danson appeared as a regular on both CSI and Cyber. Similarly, Family Guy has crossed over with The Simpsons, while The Simpsons has crossed over with Futurama. The X-Files has in turn crossed over with Millennium, Homicide: Life on the Street, The Lone Gunmen and Cops. A proposed crossover with The West Wing was planned, but was never produced. The Beverly Hillbillies, Green Acres, and Petticoat Junction shared a common universe, so crossovers were not uncommon. Doctor Who and Torchwood both take place in the same universe, and have had multiple crossovers, including Torchwood characters appearing in \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\". Torchwoods first series finale ends with the materialisation sound of the TARDIS, which is seen in Doctor Whos series 3 episode \\"Utopia\\". =Between related shows= Though most common on shows of the same production company (see, for example, \\"Hurricane Saturday\\"), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or television network. A notable example of this kind of link is that between Murder, She Wrote and Magnum, P.I. These shows were made by different companies, but owned by Universal Studios and broadcast on CBS. Another case is that of Mad About You and Friends, which share the character of Ursula Buffay. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress (Lisa Kudrow), a setting (New York City) and a schedule (Friends initially followed Mad About You on NBC's Thursday night schedule). Mad About You and Friends share another type of \\"network crossover\\". On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night's programming around a crossover \\"event\\". In one case, a New York City blackout caused by Paul Reiser's character on Mad About You was experienced by the characters on Friends and Madman of the People.epguides.com listing for Pandora's Box, the episode which kicked off \\"Blackout Thursday\\" on NBC. Such \\"event nights\\" can also be linked by a single character's quest across multiple shows on the same evening. ABC attempted this kind of \\"event night\\" crossover with its Friday night programming during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of Sabrina the Teenage Witch should chase her cat, Salem, through Boy Meets World, You Wish and Teen Angel because it had run away with a \\"time ball\\" that was displacing each show through time. ABC also attempted a \\"crossover\\" when four of its sitcoms (Grace Under Fire, Ellen, The Drew Carey Show and Coach) all went to Las Vegas during the 1996‚Äì1997 season. Dan Schneider used his show Zoey 101 to promote his new show iCarly by making characters from Zoey 101 go to ICarly.com or use the song the iCarly theme song as a ringtone. A Henry Danger comic book and Gibby's wax head is seen in the Game Shakers episode \\"Lost Jacket, Falling Pigeons\\", the subway station's lost and found. The CW's superhero franchise Arrowverse has held annual crossover events since 2014. Narrative rationales On other occasions, crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality, but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover. The appearance of detective John Munch (from NBC's Homicide: Life on the Street) on Fox's The X-Files happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore, a logical place for characters on The X-Files to have encountered Munch. Munch would also appear on the TV series Law & Order on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on Homicide: Life on the Street. Later, when Homicide went off the air in 1999, Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York, and becoming a permanent character (as New York City Detective Munch) on NBC's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit until October 2013. A two-part crossover episode between CSI: Crime Scene Investigation with Without a Trace aired on November 8, 2007. The first hour was on CSI and the second hour was on Without a Trace. While both series are on the same network in the United States, spreading two parts of a story across two different shows can cause problems in international markets where they have been separately sold to different broadcasters. For example, in the United Kingdom, Without a Trace was shown on Channel 4 and CSI on Channel 5, meaning the two companies had to come to a special agreement to show both episodes. Another CSI crossover occurred in 2009 when Raymond Langston from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation appeared both in CSI: Miami and CSI: NY, traveling to Miami and New York to track a human trafficking and organ harvesting ring. ER had a crossover with Third Watch which corresponded with a peak in viewership for the latter show, with 17.2 million viewers. In 2013, the Canadian crime drama series Republic of Doyle and Murdoch Mysteries produced a crossover, which was complicated by the shows' incompatible historical settings; Murdoch Mysteries is a historical series set in the 1890s, while Republic of Doyle is set in the present day. The problem was solved by having the actors cross over as relatives of their primary characters; Allan Hawco appeared on the November 25, 2013 episode of Murdoch Mysteries as Jacob Doyle, a 19th-century ancestor of his regular character Jake Doyle, while Yannick Bisson appeared on a January 2014 episode of Republic of Doyle as Bill Murdoch, a 21st-century descendant of his regular character William Murdoch. In children's television Disney Channel's Suite Life franchise has featured three crossovers: In 2006, That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana featured characters from Hannah Montana and That's So Raven taking a vacation at the Tipton Hotel (the main setting of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody); Hannah Montana/Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus) also eats cake off Zack; this recurs when she eats cake off of Cody during the 2009 crossover Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana, in which characters from Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana come on aboard the S.S. Tipton (though the characters from Wizards of Waverly Place and Hannah Montana do not interact). The New Year's special Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year, which aired in 2013, features characters from Austin & Ally and Jessie. In 2015 a crossover between two Disney XD shows Lab Rats: Bionic Island and Mighty Med crossed over in the special \\"Lab Rats vs. Mighty Med\\". Another type of crossover involves characters from an off-the-air series resurfacing in a newer series. This occurred in a 2010 episode of the Nickelodeon sitcom iCarly; the episode \\"iStart a Fan War\\" featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series: Drake & Josh characters Eric Blonowitz, Craig Ramirez, Gavin Mitchell, and Zoey 101 character Stacey Dillsen. A crossover between Victorious and Drake & Josh also occurred, with Helen DuBois, portrayed by Yvette Nicole Brown making an appearance. An episode titled \\"iParty with Victorious\\" was a crossover between iCarly and Victorious. This means all 4 shows exist in the same universe. However, in Who Did It to Trina, Tori referred to Drake and Josh as a TV show, making it seem as if the previous appearance was an actor of a character from a show within a show. Also in multiple episodes from iCarly and Sam & Cat (a crossover/spin-off of iCarly and Victorious) one can see Drake and Josh and Zoey 101 in TV guides, when the characters are watching TV. Carly and Spencer were heard watching it in the iCarly episode iGet Pranky and Carly is seen looking at it briefly in iToe Fat Cakes and you can see the character Megan from Drake and Josh (also portrayed by Miranda Cosgrove) and Sam is seen changing the channel to it in #FavoriteShow an episode from Sam & Cat, making the universe between each of the shows confusing. However, these were probably all non-canonical references. In 2014, The Thundermans and The Haunted Hathaways did a crossover, called \\"The Haunted Thundermans\\". In 2016, Henry Danger and The Thundermans did a crossover, called \\"Danger & Thunder\\". In 2017, Henry Danger and Game Shakers did a crossover, called \\"Danger Games\\", which was then followed by a crossover episode, called \\"Babe Loves Danger\\", that aired in 2018. In 2017, Game Shakers did a crossover with iCarly, called \\"Game Shippers\\". The main characters of Aaahh!!! Real Monsters make a crossover appearance in the Rugrats episode, \\"Ghost Story\\". This is because both shows were created/produced by Klasky Csupo and distributed also by Nickelodeon. In Chile, children's programs and characters from El Mundo del Profesor Rossa (Spanish for The World of Professor Rossa) and Cachureos (Chilean Spanish for odds and ends) conducted a crossover between them for a few minutes in their emissions of Saturday 18 (Mundo del Profesor Rossa) and Sunday 19 (Cachureos) of April 1998 due to the debut of the latter program on Canal 13, after several years of broadcast on TVN and even have competed with each other for the child audience. The Netflix series Harvey Girls Forever! (which back then was known as Harvey Street Kids in 2018) has crossed over with iconic cartoon character Richie Rich for its third and fourth seasons. There is also a crossover episode called \\"Scare Bud\\", which the show crossed over with Casper the Friendly Ghost. =Special usages= Promotional cameos Crossovers can take the form of a promotional cameo appearance, used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show's narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is The Simpsons episode \\"A Star Is Burns\\", in which the character of Jay Sherman (from The Critic) appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995 on FOX right before The Critic began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of The Simpsons as existing to promote The Critic, an animated series considered inferior by comparison. Even Simpsons creator Matt Groening objected, preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest.Various reactions, including Matt Groening's, to A Star Is Burns The character Dan Tanna (played by Robert Urich) from the detective series Vega$ appeared in an episode of Charlie's Angels (\\"Angels in Vegas\\") one week prior to the debut of Vega$. However, it is not considered a spin-off because Dan Tanna was introduced in the pilot that was aired as an ABC TV Movie of the Week on the evening of Tuesday, April 25, 1978. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote the debut of Vega$ as an ongoing series. Additionally, the cast of The Love Boat appeared in the fourth season premier of Charlie's Angels (\\"Love Boat Angels\\"). In 2010, as a nod to the 50th anniversary of Coronation Street, characters in fellow established TV soap EastEnders made reference to watching the special anniversary episode. EastEnders had celebrated its own 25th anniversary earlier in the same year. The two CBS Daytime game shows (The Price Is Right and Let's Make a Deal) are used for promotional cameos from other CBS properties. Promotional cameos from the two daytime dramas, primetime shows (including primetime airings), and sports properties are common. Price has been used to promote anniversaries of CBS daytime dramas, the NCIS franchise, the three reality shows, and CBS Sports' coverage of the NFL. =Spin-offs= In its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a spin-off or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when Cliff Huxtable of The Cosby Show visited his daughter, Denise, on A Different World. Another example of this is The Bionic Woman, which was a spin-off from The Six Million Dollar Man. Jaime Sommers was a tennis pro who was nearly killed in a skydiving accident, but her life was saved by Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson) and Dr. Rudy Wells (Martin E. Brooks) who surgically implanted her with bionic parts similar to those of Steve Austin. Steve Austin and Jaimie Sommers often crossovered, while the characters Oscar Goldman and Rudy Wells appeared regularly in both shows. Another example would be the appearances made by Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters to Angel in Los Angeles from Sunnydale; in a striking example, \\"Fool for Love\\" and \\"Darla\\", shown on the same night, contain overlapping flashbacks as remembered by Spike and Darla respectively. There is also Frasier, which features characters from the first show, Cheers. Similarly, Dallas characters J. R. Ewing, Bobby Ewing, Lucy Ewing and Kristin Shepard all appeared in its spin-off Knots Landing while Knots Landing characters Gary Ewing and Valene Ewing each made several appearances on Dallas after Knots Landing premiered. More complex multi- production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the Star Trek universe, where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the Klingons Kor (from the Original Series episode \\"Errand of Mercy\\"), Koloth (from \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\") and Kang (from \\"Day of the Dove\\"). After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of Captain Kirk appeared together in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode, \\"Blood Oath\\" ‚Äì as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes. Another Klingon, Arne Darvin, appeared as a secondary character in \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", but was the principal villain of DS9's \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\". Intended as a celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary, \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" was actually a crossover in and of itself; using then brand-new bluescreen techniques, the episode places the DS9 cast (after hijacking the Defiant, Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons, and it's up to Sisko and his comrades to stop Darvin and preserve the timeline) inside the TOS episode, interacting with James T. Kirk, Spock and the rest of the Enterprise crew. The distinction between \\"spin-off\\" and \\"crossover\\" is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether Out of the Blue is a spin-off of Happy Days, or whether the star of Out of the Blue merely crossed over into Happy Days. Mako Mermaids, a spinoff of H2O: Just Add Water, featured a guest appearance by Rikki Chadwick, a main character from the former series, in its final two episodes, thus confirming that the spin off-acts as a sequel rather than a prequel or alternative storyline as many fans suspected. Parodic crossovers Often, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by situation comedies that wish to crossover with dramatic television programs. The satirical crossover‚Äîranging in length from a cameo to a full comedy sketch or episode‚Äîis an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious parody or homage. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a narrative point by capitalizing on the audience's experience of the other program. Such tongue- in-cheek crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories. Parodic crossovers can be directly established as being outside the continuity of one or all of the properties being crossed over. A good example is the crossover between The Simpsons and The X-Files, which was largely accepted as being outside standard X-Files continuity. One episode of The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy shows that after Mandy smiles, she, along with Billy and Grim, are transformed into The Powerpuff Girls with a cameo by Professor Utonium. They can occur by virtue of a dream sequence, in which the characters of one show will appear as part of a dream had by a character on another show. This method was perhaps used most famously to explain to audiences that the entirety of Newhart had been the dream of Bob Newhart's character on The Bob Newhart Show. It has more recently been used to demonstrate that cast members of The Young and the Restless appeared in a dream of a character on The King of Queens. Parodic crossovers can take the form of \\"gag\\" cameos by characters of one property appearing on another. Characters from King of the Hill have appeared on The Simpsons to comment on a peewee football game. Gag cameos may also include the appearance of an actor from another show, but not necessarily the character that the actor played. For instance, on the ABC/CBS show Family Matters during the closing credits of the episode \\"Scenes From a Mall\\" (Season 5, Episode 12), a scene which was shown earlier in the episode featuring Reginald VelJohnson is re-played, but this time with one of the child actors stating that he \\"looks like that fat guy from Fresh Prince,\\" referring to James Avery who played Judge Phillip Banks on NBC's The Fresh Prince of Bel- Air. To the obvious surprise of the studio audience and VelJohnson, Avery walked onto the set with an angry look, being in on the staged joke himself. Ended the episode (but with the cameras filming still), VelJohnson and Avery hugged and smilingly greeted the public. Crossovers of this type can also be completely wordless. This type of crossover is more common on animated programs, such as when Bender found and ate Bart Simpson's shorts on Futurama, or Milhouse had a talking Bender doll on The Simpsons. This would seem to be another case when a popular franchise is acknowledged as fiction and not a crossover of the stories. Perhaps the most obvious parodic crossover is found when characters from two series interact outside either series. This occurs most commonly on a sketch comedy show or as a humorous interlude on an award telecast. Such crossovers may sometimes involve the real actors‚Äîfor example, a sketch on Royal Canadian Air Farce saw Yasir and Sarah from Little Mosque on the Prairie buying the gas station from Corner Gas, with many of the characters in the sketch being portrayed by the shows' real actors‚Äîalthough they may also feature one genuine star from the show amid a cast comprised otherwise of the sketch show's own stable of actors. Such crossovers are generally immediately apparent as parodies to the audience‚Äîand in no way considered a part of either show's continuity‚Äîdue to the need for the hosting show to approximate the sets and costumes of the satirized programs quickly and inexpensively. When Patrick Stewart appeared in a Star Trek: The Next Generation/The Love Boat crossover on Saturday Night Live, for instance, few Star Trek fans would have been fooled by the visual design into believing the event \\"counted\\" as an episode of the show. However, there are some cases of this type of parody having some canonical resonance with viewers. For instance, the British charity appeal Comic Relief often contains parodic crossovers of a technically higher quality than the typical sketch show. Many of these Relief sketches are produced by the cast and crew of the actual programs being parodied, and hence appear to be \\"normal\\" episodes. A good example of this is the sketch, \\"BallyKissDibley\\", an 11-minute piece in which the leads of Ballykissangel appeared on the sets of The Vicar of Dibley, alongside most of Dibleys cast. Since the sketch derived its humor from all actors remaining in character, the extent to which these parodies \\"count\\" as part of either show's canon is more open to interpretation than most sketch crossovers. Parodic crossovers can be used to lend verisimilitude to the fictional world of a program. Characters from a fictional television series may appear on a stylized version of an established non-fictional television series, such as game shows or reality shows. These crossovers between celebrity hosts and fictional characters are quite common on situation comedies. Mama's Family once appeared on Family Feud and the townsfolk of The Vicar of Dibley have had their heirlooms valuated on Antiques Roadshow, for instance. In such cases, it is generally the non-fictional show which ends up being the most satirized, due to a need to compress the experience to its most recognizable elements. However, these crossovers can happen on dramatic television, such as when Blue Peter provided narrative exposition on The Sarah Jane Adventures. Rarely, brief crossovers between two fictional programs can be used for this same purpose. In the episode, \\"Army of Ghosts\\", Peggy Mitchell was seen in a fictionalized scene from EastEnders in order to demonstrate the degree to which the titular ghosts had permeated the popular culture of Doctor Whos Britain. Here, too, time constraints caused the satire of the guest programme (EastEnders) and not the host program (Doctor Who). Retroactive crossovers Sometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers. These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material, but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes. Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity. Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to St. Elsewhere. One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of autistic character Tommy Westphall's imagination. This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series. Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes, and each one of these twelve had numerous other crossovers, linkages can be found from Elsewhere to 280 other shows, comprising what has been called \\"the Tommy Westphall Universe\\". = Tokusatsu for Japan = * Kamen Rider * Super Sentai * Ultra Series * Metal Hero Series * Chouseishin Series = German crossover = One of the earlier instances of crossovers in TV productions outside the US is the episode ' (1990), which was produced by WDR and DFF as a crossover between the West German crime series Tatort and the East German crime series Polizeiruf 110. Their respective popular heroes Horst Schimanski and Peter Fuchs join forces to solve a case in the turmoil of the time after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The episode was produced during the short transition period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany.

He was Commander of Skylab 4, the third and final crewed visit to the Skylab Orbital Workshop, from November 16, 1973, to February 8, 1974.  Early life and education  Carr was born in Denver, Colorado, on August 22, 1932, but was raised in Santa Ana, California, which he considered his home town. He was the son of Freda L. (Wright) and Thomas E. Carr. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its highest rank, Eagle Scout. Carr graduated from Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana in 1950. Carr received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Southern California in 1954. He spent five years flying fighter jets, then returned to school. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1961, and a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton University in 1962. Carr married his high-school sweetheart, Joann Ruth Petrie. They had two sets of twins and six children total. They divorced and his second marriage was to Patricia Musick in 1979.  Military service  Carr began his military service with the U.S. Navy, and in 1950 he was appointed a midshipman with the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) detachment at the University of Southern California. Upon graduation in 1954, he received his commission in the U.S. Marine Corps and subsequently reported to The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. He received flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, and Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas, and was then assigned to VMF(AW)-114 where he gained experience in the F9F Cougar and the F-6A Skyray. After postgraduate training, he served with VMFA-122, from 1962 to 1965, piloting the F-8 Crusader in the United States and the Far East. Other aircraft he has flown include the F-4, T-1A, T-28, T-33, T-38, H-13, and ground effect machines. He has logged more than 8,000 flying hours, 5,365 hours of which are jet time.  NASA career  Carr was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. When informed by NASA of his selection for astronaut training, he was assigned to the test directors section of Marine Air Control Squadron 3, a unit responsible for the testing and evaluation of the Marine Tactical Data System. He served as a member of the astronaut support crews and as CAPCOM for the Apollo 8 and Apollo 12 flights, and was involved in the development and testing of the Lunar Roving Vehicle. He was in the likely crew rotation position to serve as lunar module pilot for Apollo 19 before this mission was canceled by NASA in 1970. = Skylab 4 = Carr demonstrates weightlessness by balancing Skylab 4 crewmate William Pogue on his finger Carr was commander of Skylab 4 (third and final crewed visit to the Skylab Orbital Workshop) launched November 16, 1973, with splashdown on February 8, 1974. He was the first rookie astronaut to command a mission since Neil Armstrong on Gemini 8 and was accompanied on the record-setting 34.5-million-mile flight by science pilot Dr. Edward Gibson and pilot William Pogue. The crew successfully completed 56 experiments, 26 science demonstrations, 15 subsystem-detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations during their 1,214 orbits of the Earth. They also acquired extensive Earth resources observation data using hand-held cameras and Skylab's Earth Resources Experiment Package camera and sensor array. They logged 338 hours of operations of the Apollo Telescope Mount, which made extensive observations of the sun's solar processes. From February 1974 until March 1978, Carr and his Skylab 4 teammates shared the world record for individual time in space: 2,017 hours 15 minutes 32 seconds, and Carr logged 15 hours and 51 minute in three EVAs outside the Orbital Workshop. In mid-1977, Carr was named head of the design support group within the Astronaut Office responsible for providing crew support to such activities as space transportation system design, simulations, testing, and safety assessment, and for development of man/machine interface requirements. Carr retired from the U.S. Marine Corps as Colonel in September 1975 and from NASA in June 1977.  Later life  Carr started his post-NASA career as manager of corporate development at Bovay Engineers, Inc., a Houston engineering consulting firm. He later became a senior vice president, leaving the firm in 1981. He was a senior consultant on special staff to the President of Applied Research, Inc., Los Angeles, California, from 1981 to 1983. From 1983 until 1985 Carr was manager of The University of Texas Telescope Project. Carr founded CAMUS, Inc. in 1984 based in Vermont. The family-owned corporation provides technical support services in zero-gravity human factors engineering, procedures development, operations analysis, training and systems integration. CAMUS was a major contributor as a technical support subcontractor to Boeing in the crew systems design of the International Space Station. In addition, the corporation is involved in fine art production designed by Carr's wife, artist and sculptor Pat Musick. Carr died in Albany, New York, on August 26, 2020, four days after his 88th birthday.  Organizations  Carr was a former director of the Sunsat Energy Council; a former director of the Houston Pops Orchestra; and a former director of the National Space Society.

Cenker worked for 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics, and its successor company GE Astro Space, on a variety of spacecraft projects. He spent most of his career working on commercial communications satellites, including the Satcom, Spacenet and GStar programs. In January 1986, Cenker was a crew member on the twenty-fourth mission of NASA's Space Shuttle program, the seventh flight of Space Shuttle Columbia, designated as mission STS-61-C. Cenker served as a Payload Specialist, representing RCA Astro-Electronics. This mission was the final flight before the Challenger disaster, which caused the Space Shuttle program to be suspended until 1988, and impacted NASA's Payload Specialist program for even longer. As a result, Cenker's mission was called \\"The End of Innocence\\" for the Shuttle program. Following the completion of his Shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the commercial aerospace field. Since his flight, he has made numerous public appearances representing NASA and the Shuttle program, in the United States, as well as internationally. Early life and education Cenker was born on November 5, 1948, and raised in Menallen Township, Pennsylvania. He started his education at St. Fidelis College Seminary in Herman, Pennsylvania, leaving in 1962. In 1970 Cenker enrolled at Penn State University where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering. He continued his studies at Penn State and earned a Master of Science degree in 1973, also in Aerospace Engineering. Cenker earned a second Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Rutgers University in 1977. Pre-spaceflight career Cenker worked for 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics and its successor company GE Astro Space. Cenker worked on hardware design and systems design concerning satellite attitude control. He also worked on in-orbit operations, as well as spacecraft assembly, test, and pre-launch operations. He spent two years on the Navy navigation satellite program, but spent most of his career working on commercial communications satellites. Cenker's positions included integration and test manager for the Satcom D and E spacecraft, where he was responsible for all launch site activities. He also served as spacecraft bus manager on the Spacenet/GStar programs. He was responsible for ensuring the spacecraft could interface with multiple rockets, including the Delta, Space Shuttle, and Ariane launch vehicles. Spaceflight experience STS-61-C crew As an incentive for a spacecraft owner to contract with NASA to use a Shuttle launch instead of an unmanned, commercial launch system, NASA permitted contracting companies to apply for a Payload Specialist seat on the same mission. When RCA contracted with NASA to launch Satcom Ku-1, RCA Astro-Electronics' manager of systems engineering for the Satcom-K program Bob Cenker, and his co-worker Gerard Magilton, were selected to train as Payload Specialists so that one of the pair could accompany Satcom Ku-1 into space. Cenker and Magilton trained with career astronauts as well as other Payload and Mission Specialists, including those scheduled for the next scheduled flight, that of the Challenger mission, STS-51-L. This flight of Columbia was originally scheduled to occur in August 1985, but the timeline slipped. In July 1985 the payload was finalized to include the RCA satellite, and Cenker was assigned to the mission, now designated as STS-61-C. Magilton was assigned as the back-up. Prior to its successful launch, Columbia had several aborted launch attempts, including one on January 6 which was \\"one of the most hazardous in the Shuttle‚Äôs operational history\\" to that point. As documented in Crewmember Bill Nelson's book \\"Mission: An American Congressman's Voyage to Space\\", and as reported in Spaceflight Insider, \\"The launch attempt on Jan. 6, 1986 was halted at T-31 seconds. The weather was perfect for the scheduled launch at dawn, but a failure of a liquid oxygen drain valve prevented it to close properly. The valve was then closed manually, but not quickly enough to prevent a low temperature in one fuel line.\\" However, Nelson says that what really happened was that \\"the valve did not close because it was not commanded to close\\", and that it was later determined that the Rogers Commission, investigating the series of mistakes that forced this second scrub, recognized that the problems were personnel-related, caused by fatigue from overwork: One potentially catastrophic human error occurred 4 minutes 55 seconds before the scheduled launch of mission 61-C on January 6, 1986. According to a Lockheed Space Operations Company incident report, 18,000 pounds of liquid oxygen were inadvertently drained from the Shuttle external fuel tank due to operator error. Fortunately, the liquid oxygen flow dropped the main engine inlet temperature below the acceptable limit causing a launch hold, but only 31 seconds before lift-off. As the report states, \\"Had the mission not been scrubbed, the ability of the orbiter to reach a defined orbit may have been significantly impacted. There was another near-catastrophic launch abort three days later. Referring to the January 9 abort, pilot Charlie Bolden later stated that it \\"...would have been catastrophic, because the engine would have exploded had we launched. In all, it took a record eight attempts to get Columbia off the ground. Columbia finally launched and achieved orbit on January 12, 1986, with a full crew of seven. Along with Cenker, the crew included Robert L. \\"Hoot\\" Gibson, future NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden, George D. Nelson, Steven A. Hawley, Franklin R. Chang-Diaz, and US Representative Bill Nelson. Cenker and his crewmates traveled over 2.5 million miles in 98 orbits aboard Columbia and logged over 146 hours in space.RCA SATCOM Ku-1 deployment During the six-day mission, January 12‚Äì18, Cenker performed a variety of physiological tests, operated a primary experiment ‚Äì an infrared imaging camera ‚Äì and assisted with the deployment of RCA Americom's Satcom Ku-1 satellite, the primary mission objective. Satcom Ku-1 was deployed nearly 10 hours into the mission, and Satcom later reached its designated geostationary orbital position at 85 degrees West longitude where it remained operational until April 1997, the last major commercial satellite deployed by the Space Shuttle program. In a 2014 video of the \\"Tell Me a Story\\" series titled \\"Close My Eyes & Drift Away\\", posted to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex YouTube channel, Cenker tells a humorous story regarding a zero-g sleeping problem he faced on his mission. The next Shuttle launch, ten days after the return of Columbia, resulted in the destruction of the Challenger with the loss of all aboard, including Cenker's counterpart from Hughes Aircraft, civilian crew member and Payload Specialist Greg Jarvis. Accordingly, commander Gibson later called the STS-61-C mission \\"The End of Innocence\\" for the Shuttle program. Following the Challenger disaster, the Shuttle fleet was grounded until 1988. Even after Shuttle missions resumed, civilian Payload Specialists like Cenker were excluded until the Payload Specialist program was reinstated on December 2, 1990, when Samuel T. Durrance, an Applied Physics Laboratory astrophysicist and Ronald A. Parise, a Computer Sciences Corporation astronomer, flew aboard STS-35. By that time, RCA had been purchased by General Electric, and RCA Astro-Electronics became part of GE. Following two additional ownership transitions, the facility was closed in 1998. As a result, Cenker was the only RCA Astro-Electronics employee, and only employee in the history of the facility under all of its subsequent names, to ever fly in space. NASA's Payload Specialist program has been criticized for giving limited Shuttle flight positions to civilian aerospace engineers such as Cenker and Greg Jarvis (killed aboard Challenger), politicians such as Bill Nelson, and other civilians such as Teacher in Space Christa McAuliffe (also killed aboard Challenger). Even the flight of former Mercury astronaut and US Senator John Glenn was questioned. The concern was that these people had replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without fully understanding the level of danger involved in a Shuttle mission. Post-spaceflight Following the completion of his Shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the civilian aerospace field. Cenker's last two years with RCA Astro-Electronics and its successor GE Astro Space were spent as Manager of Payload Accommodations on an EOS spacecraft program. After leaving GE, Cenker served as a consultant for various aerospace companies regarding micro-gravity research, and spacecraft design, assembly and flight operations. Cenker supported systems engineering and systems architecture studies for various spacecraft projects, including smallsats, military communications satellites, and large, assembled-in-orbit platforms. His contributions included launch vehicle evaluation and systems engineering support for Motorola on Iridium, and launch readiness for the Globalstar constellation. Other efforts include systems engineering and operations support for INTELSAT on Intelsat K and Intelsat VIII, for AT&T; on Telstar 401 and 402, for Fairchild-Matra on SPAS III, for Martin Marietta on Astra 1B, BS-3N, ACTS, and for the Lockheed Martin Series 7000 communications satellites. In 2017, Cenker's STS-61C crewmate former US Senator Bill Nelson spoke at a session of the US House of Representatives. In an address, titled \\"Mission to Mars and Space Shuttle Flight 30th Anniversary\\", he read into the Congressional Record the details of the mission of STS-61C, as well as the names and function of each crew member including Cenker. Cenker continues to make periodic public appearances representing NASA and the Shuttle astronaut program, including one at the Kennedy Space Center in March 2017. In June 2017, Cenker traveled to Scotland where he and astronaut Doug Wheelock gave a series of talks to children in Fife schools as part of the Scottish Space School. =Apollo 11 commemoration activities= Leading up to the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, Cenker participated in several public events with other former NASA astronauts. During an interview to discuss his scheduled appearance at The New Jersey Governor's School of Engineering & Technology at Rutgers University in July 2019, Cenker talked about his education at Rutgers, his work at RCA, his shuttle mission, his connection to the Challenger crew, his thoughts on the importance of the Apollo 11 mission, and of space travel in general. He concluded: The Cradle of Aviation in Garden City, New York invited Cenker to participate in its \\"Moon Fest\\" planned for July 20, 2019, exactly fifty years after the Apollo 11 landing. It was announced that Cenker would join two fellow shuttle astronauts from New York, Bill Shepherd and Charlie Camarda, at the celebration. Personal life and beliefs Bob Cenker is married to Barbara Ann Cenker; they have two sons and a daughter. In a July 2019 interview discussing the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, Cenker commented that he believes that humans have an innate desire to explore, saying \\"It‚Äôs not learned... It‚Äôs in your genes\\". Discussing his religious beliefs, Cenker said \\"I'm a good, practicing Catholic. One of the guys I flew with was an agnostic. I think going into space reinforces what you believe when you went... [The agnostic astronaut] couldn‚Äôt grasp how one being could create all this. I came back thinking ‚ÄòGod, you have to be there‚Äô\\".

He is also a co-author and researcher for the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity project.  Early life  Chiao was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and raised in Danville, California. His parents were originally from mainland China and met while studying at a university in what is now Taiwan before immigrating to the U.S. Chiao graduated from Monte Vista High School in Danville in 1978. In 1983, he earned a B.S. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. He later earned an M.S. and a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1985 and 1987, respectively. Chiao's parents were both chemical engineers who immigrated to Milwaukee from Taiwan in the late 1950s for graduate school. Stressing a high doctorate level science education, his parents encouraged him to follow their lead and become an engineer. Chiao's Aviator call sign is \\"Shandong\\".

He qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. His technical assignments included: Space Shuttle flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); crew equipment, Spacelab, Spacehab, and payload issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; training and flight data file issues; and extravehicular activity (EVA) issues for the EVA Branch. Chiao also served as Chief of the Astronaut Office EVA Branch. A veteran of four space flights, Chiao flew as a mission specialist on STS-65 in 1994, STS-72 in 1996 and STS-92 in 2000. Chiao had logged over 36 days and 12.5 hours in space, including over 26 EVA hours in four space walks, prior to his mission aboard the International Space Station. Chiao is fluent in Mandarin Chinese. Additionally, Chiao also learned Russian to communicate with Russian cosmonauts as part of the International Space Station program. On November 2, 2004, Chiao voted in the 2004 United States presidential election from aboard the International Space Station, making him the first American to vote in a presidential election while in space. McDonald's presented Chiao with a Big Mac and French Fries at their branch in Star City as one of his first meals since returning to Earth after his ISS assignment. Among the souvenirs he brought into space in his previous space flights were a Chinese flag and a quartz-carved rose from Hong Kong. Chiao was the inadvertent developer of the procedure to use the IRED (Interim Resistive Exercise Device) to excite the solar arrays of the ISS. During an exercise session of squats on the ISS, Chiao sent a vibration through the space station that caused the solar arrays to ripple ‚Äì a low amplitude frequency response. When Chiao did this, the response from Mission Control was \\"knock it off.\\" However, several years later during an ISS assembly flight in December 2006 (STS-116), German astronaut Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency was told to do 30 seconds of robust exercise on the bungee-bar IRED machine to help retract ISS solar arrays, specifically to relieve tension in a wire system that was preventing the array from folding up like an accordion. An eventual unplanned spacewalk during the same shuttle mission managed to finally retract the array. Chiao left NASA in December 2005 to pursue employment in the private sector. = Spaceflight experience = President George W.

Colonel Mike Fincke, ISS 9; Dr. Edward Lu, ISS 7; Dr. Leroy Chiao, ISS 10, and Dr. Michael Foale, ISS 8. STS-65 Columbia (July 8‚Äì23, 1994) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, setting a new flight duration record for the Space Shuttle program at that time. The STS-65 mission flew the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2). During the 15-day flight the seven-member crew conducted more than 80 experiments focusing on materials and life sciences research in microgravity. The STS-65 mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.1 million miles in 353 hours and 55 minutes. STS-72 Endeavour (January 11‚Äì20, 1996) was a nine-day mission during which the crew retrieved the Space Flyer Unit (launched from Japan ten months earlier), and deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer. Chiao performed two spacewalks designed to demonstrate tools and hardware, and evaluate techniques to be used in the assembly of the International Space Station. In completing this mission, Chiao logged a total of 214 hours and 41 seconds in space, including just over thirteen EVA hours, and traveled 3.7 million miles in 142 orbits of the Earth. STS-92 Discovery (October 11‚Äì24, 2000) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 13-day flight, the seven member crew attached the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the International Space Station using Discovery's robotic arm and performed four spacewalks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew. Chiao totaled 13 hours and 16 minutes of EVA time in two spacewalks. The STS-92 mission was accomplished in 202 orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 12 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 25 seconds. ISS Expedition 10 (October 9, 2004 ‚Äì April 24, 2005), Chiao was the Commander of Expedition 10 on the International Space Station.  Post-NASA career  After leaving NASA, Chiao has become involved in entrepreneurial business ventures in both the U.S. and China. In early 2006, he joined the Atlanta firm of SpaceWorks Enterprises, Inc. (SEI) as an affiliate and technical advisor (on a non-exclusive basis). Dr. Chiao assists the firm on space technologies and operating processes for future space exploration concepts and research on the commercialization of space. In July 2006, Chiao accepted a position as the Executive Vice President for Space Operations and a Director of Excalibur Almaz Limited. He was responsible for operational aspects of spaceflight, including training for both the capsule and space station. The company assembled a team from the Isle of Man, the United States, Russia, the Ukraine, and Continental Europe to begin work towards refurbishing and flying a capsule in space based upon the design of the Almaz capsules. In March 2006, Chiao began an appointment in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Louisiana State University as the first Raborn Distinguished Chair Max Faget Professor. Chiao is also currently serving as the Chairman of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) User Panel, which is attached to the Baylor College of Medicine. The NSBRI, funded by NASA, is a consortium of institutions studying the health risks related to long-duration space flight. The Institute's User Panel is an advisory board composed of former and current astronauts and flight surgeons that ensures NSBRI's research program is focused on astronaut health and safety. In preparation for lunar and Mars exploration, Chiao and the User Panel will help align NSBRI's science and technology projects with the needs of astronauts on long missions. In July 2007, Chiao joined an expedition to visit Devon Island and conduct 5 days of webcasts and other instructional activities spanning the period of 16‚Äì20 July 2007. This activity was in collaboration with the Mars Institute, the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, The Explorers Club and SpaceRef Interactive, Inc. He conducted these webcasts from the Haughton-Mars Project Research Station and nearby locations to illustrate how NASA and other space agencies are learning to live on the Moon and Mars here on Earth. Chiao appeared in an episode of MANswers in 2008 explaining how to neutralize an astronaut in space who has gone berserk. In May 2009 Chiao wrote a few blog articles on Gizmodo.com detailing some of his space experiences. In May 2009 Chiao was named as a member of the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee an independent review requested by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on May 7, 2009. In a special to CNN written by Chiao on 1 September 2011, he suggested that China be permitted to join the International Space Station program to remedy the issue relating to the limited options available for space travel, following the conclusion of the United States space shuttle program, and a failure of a Russian Soyuz spacecraft on 24 August 2011.Leroy Chiao, 1 September 2011, Make China our new partner in space, CNN From 2011‚Äì2016, Chiao served Epiphan Video as VP Aerospace.

Freese) Josiah Spode (23 March 1733 ‚Äì 18 August 1797) was an English potter and the founder of the English Spode pottery works which became famous for the high quality of its wares. He is often credited with the establishment of blue underglaze transfer printing in Staffordshire in 1781‚Äì84, and with the definition and introduction in c. 1789‚Äì91 of the improved formula for bone china (a form of soft-paste porcelain) which thereafter remained the standard for all English wares of this kind.  Early life  Josiah Spode was born in Lane Delph, Fenton, Staffordshire. Spode was a pauper's son and also a pauper's orphan at the age of six. In 1745 his elder sister Ann married Ambrose Gallimore,R. Copeland, Spode (Osprey Publishing, 1998), p. 4. Ann Spoade married Ambrose Gallimore at Stoke-on-Trent 31 December 1745: she was still living in 1797 when Josiah made bequests to her in the Codicil to his will, P.C.C. PROB 11/1302/241. who in 1754 obtained the lease of the Caughley porcelain factory near Broseley. Spode was taken on as a worker by potter Thomas Whieldon in November (Martinmas) 1749, and remained with him until 1754. In that year, on 8 September, Josiah married Ellen Finley at Stoke on Trent, and his eldest son Josiah (II) was born in 1755. It was in 1754 that Josiah Wedgwood became the business partner of Thomas Whieldon, an arrangement which continued until 1759. Spode had worked alongside Wedgwood and with the celebrated potter Aaron WoodF. Falkner, The Wood Family of Burslem. A brief biography of those of its members who were sculptors, modellers and potters (Chapman and Hall Ltd., London 1912), pp. 21-30, at p. 27. (father of Enoch Wood) under Whieldon's tuition, and was with Whieldon at a high point of production there.A. Hayden, Spode and His Successors (Cassell, London 1925), pp. 2, 4, 7. As a family man Josiah Spode was an accomplished violinist, and he and his wife had further children Samuel (1757), Mary (1759), Ellen (1762) Sarah, William (1770), Ann (1772), and Elizabeth (1777). The suggestion that he took over the factory of Ralph Baddeley and Thomas Fletcher during the late 1750s and early 1760s is now discounted.R. Copeland, Spode (Shire Books), 2nd Edn (Osprey 1998), 4 After John Turner (1737‚Äì87) left Stoke for Lane End in 1759 or 1762, Spode may have carried on the factory of William Banks, Turner's partner and former master at Stoke. It is said that Spode took over the Stoke factory in about 1770, and recorded that he bought the rights under a Turner family patent in 1805. The production there was of creamware with blue painted decoration as well as white stoneware in the manner of John Turner: black ware was also made and a printing press for black transfer printing was maintained. Spode was powerfully influenced by Turner's work. He was engaged as master potter, but it is not known whether his work there was consecutive or sporadic,Hayden 1925, 9‚Äì10, 14. and there may be confusion between him and his son of the same name.  Spode's Works  Spode rented a factory in Church Street, Stoke-on-Trent in 1767. There he was in financial partnership with William Tomlinson (a solicitor), and in 1772 he took on a pottery at Shelton with Thomas Mountford as his backer.R. Copeland, Spode, p. 4. In 1776 he bought the old pottery works at StokeR. Copeland, Spode, p. 5 Fig. 3 shows the record of purchase. which had formerly been the property of William Banks while in partnership with Turner. This was the same site on which the later Spode factory arose, which continued operating into modern times. His business in creamware and in pearlware (a fine white-glazed earthenware) was very successful. In 1775 Josiah's eldest son Josiah (II) married Elizabeth the niece of John Barker, a manufacturing potter of Fenton, Staffordshire.It is stated by Simeon Shaw that his wife was John Barker's daughter, but he in fact married the daughter of Thomas Barker (brother of John) and Elizabeth Hammersley. This is confirmed in both of their wills. Josiah the elder took this opportunity to establish the regular London business. Between 1775 and 1782 Josiah II and Elizabeth moved between Longton and Cripplegate, London, where he was doubtless manager of the Fore Street warehouse under the guidance of William Copeland, his father's friend and London partner.Simeon Shaw, History of the Staffordshire Potteries (1829), p. 216. During this time the young couple had sons William (1776) and Josiah (1777)Baptisms at Stoke on Trent. and daughters Eliza (1778), Sabia (1780) and Mary (1781).Baptisms at Cripplegate, London. Elizabeth Spode died in London in 1782. Josiah the elder became a Freeman of the City of London in 1778 and was a Liveryman of the Spectacle Makers' Company.Hayden 1925, Plate facing p. 16, & p. 20. Josiah Spode I is creditedHayden 1925, p. viii. with the introduction of underglaze blue transfer printing into the Staffordshire potteries in 1781‚Äì84.Hayden 1925, 46‚Äì53. More precisely he was the first to introduce a perfected method to Stoke, (with the help of engraver Thomas Lucas and printer James Richards, formerly of the Caughley Pottery Works, Shropshire), using improvements recently developed at nearby Shelton by or for Ralph Baddeley.Simeon Shaw, History of the Staffordshire Potteries (Simeon Shaw, Hanley 1829), pp. 214‚Äì216. Spode the elder also, between 1788 and 1793, established and finalised the formula for English bone china, for whereas bone ash had previously been added in other factories to the fabric in proportions of roughly 40%, Spode simplified and greatly improved the recipe (see Spode).Hayden 1925, Chapter 5, pp 88‚Äì104. Spode had various commercial premises in London, originally in Fore Street, Cripplegate. However, the warehouse was finally settled in the former Theatre Royal, no 5 Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, which his firm occupied from 1795 to 1848, when the building was razed. (This had been the venue of the first performance of the Beggar's Opera in 1727.Hayden 1925, 20‚Äì22.) Josiah Spode the elder died in 1797 and his wife Ellen died in 1802, aged 76. They are buried in Stoke-on- Trent churchyard.  Successors  Josiah Spode II (1755‚Äì1827), Josiah's elder son, succeeded to the business in 1797. He was magnificently prepared for the role, an experienced salesman as well as a potter, having gained an invaluable knowledge of marketing in fashionable London. He was active in the North Staffordshire Pitt Club and entered politics. He became Captain of the 'Pottery Troop' Cavalry Division affiliated to the Staffordshire Yeomanry at its foundation in 1798 until its disbandment in 1805. He was granted a coat- of-arms in 1804. In 1811, with James Caldwell of Linley Wood, he successfully opposed a move by government to impose taxation on the work of the Potteries.Hayden 1925, 105‚Äì112. Josiah II, who was a flautist, was father of Josiah III (1777), and grandfather of Josiah IV, a convert to Roman Catholicism, who founded Hawkesyard Priory near Rugeley.Hayden 1925, 19. His daughter Sabia married George Whieldon at Stoke in 1809. Samuel Spode (born 1757), Josiah I's second son, inherited the Foley factory which his father had built for him at Lane End,For the absorption of Lane End into the expanding settlement of Longton, see this account. See also 'Longton', A History of the County of Stafford (V.C.H.) 8 (1963), pp. 224‚Äì246. which produced salt-glazed wares up to the end of the eighteenth century. Josiah Spode (born 1790), the son of Samuel and his wife Sarah, emigrated to Tasmania where he held a position as Controller of Convicts. After several generations under the guidance of the Copeland family, the Spode name is now owned by the Portmeirion pottery company, which now produces some of the former Spode patterns.

He served a tour with the 10th Cavalry in Fort Carson, Colorado. He then entered the U.S. Army Aviation School in 1976. He was the top graduate of his flight class and was designated an Army Aviator in October 1976. He was subsequently assigned for three years as a service platoon commander with the Attack Troop, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in Nuremberg, West Germany. After completing a master of science degree at Georgia Tech in 1982, he was assigned to the Department of Mechanics at West Point as an instructor and assistant professor. In December 1986 he graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and was designated an experimental test pilot. In December 1995, Clifford retired from the army. =NASA experience= As a military officer, Clifford was assigned to the Johnson Space Center in July 1987. As a Space Shuttle Vehicle Integration engineer, his duties involved engineering liaison for launch and landing operations of the Space Shuttle Program. He was involved in design certification and integration of the Shuttle Crew Escape System, and was an executive board member of the Solid Rocket Booster Postflight Assessment Team. Selected as an astronaut by NASA in July 1990, Clifford has served in a variety of technical assignments. From April to August 1991, Clifford was assigned to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch where he participated in the design, development, and evaluation of Shuttle payloads and crew equipment having extravehicular activity (EVA) interfaces. From May 1994 to September 1995 he served as lead for space station vehicle/assembly issues. A veteran of three space flights, Clifford flew as a mission specialist on STS-53 in 1992, STS-59 in 1994, and STS-76 in 1996. He has logged 665 hours in space, including a 6-hour spacewalk. Clifford left NASA in January 1997 to accept the position of Space Station Flight Operations Manager for Boeing's Defense and Space Group. Spaceflight experience Clifford first flew on the crew of STS-53 which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1992, aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. The mission carried a Department of Defense payload and a variety of secondary payloads. Clifford was responsible for operating a number of experiments which included the Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Experiment (FARE) and the Battlefield Laser Acquisition Sensor Test (BLAST). FARE was a microgravity fluid transfer experiment designed to evaluate improved spacecraft propellant tanks. BLAST was a hand-held laser energy detector designed to detect and interpret a data message in a low-power Earth-based laser. After completing 115 orbits of the Earth, STS-53 landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 9, 1992. He next served aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour on the STS-59 Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission which launched April 9, 1994. SRL consisted of three large radars, SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon monoxide sensor that were used to enhance studies of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. The imaging radars operated in three frequencies and four polarizations. This multispectral capability of the radars provided information about the Earth's surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single-frequency experiments. The carbon monoxide sensor (MAPS) used gas filter radiometry to measure the global distribution of CO in the troposphere. Real time crew observations of surface phenomena and climatic conditions augmented with over 14,000 photographs aided investigators in interpretation and calibration of the data. The mission concluded on April 20, 1994, with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base after orbiting the Earth 183 times in 269 hours. Clifford next served on STS-76, the third docking mission to the Russian space station Mir, which launched on March 22, 1996, with a crew of six aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis. Following rendezvous and docking with Mir, the transfer of a NASA Astronaut to Mir for a five-month stay was accomplished to begin a continuous presence of U.S. astronauts aboard Mir for the next two-year period. The crew also transferred 4,800 pounds of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to Mir and returned over 1,100 pounds of U.S. and ESA science and Russian hardware. Clifford performed a 6-hour spacewalk, the first while docked to an orbiting space station, to mount experiment packages on the Mir docking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. The experiments will be retrieved by a future shuttle mission. This mission was also the first flight of Kidsat, an electronic camera controlled by classroom students via a Ku-band link between JSC Mission Control and the Shuttle, which uses digitized photography from the Shuttle for science and education purposes. Following 145 orbits of the Earth, Atlantis landed with a crew of five at Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 31, 1996. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1994, but only his commander, Kevin Chilton, knew about it. After the STS-76 mission Clifford decided that he shouldn't fly, because he didn't know how fast it was going to progress. See also References External links *Lyndon B.

Personal life He was born on April 28, 1943, in Orange, Texas, but considers Seattle, Washington, to be his hometown. He is married to the former Terry Stanford of Little Rock, Arkansas. Education He graduated from Ballard High School, Seattle, Washington, in 1961; received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1966 and a Master of Science degree in Administration of Science and Technology from George Washington University in 1978. Military career Creighton started flight training following graduation from the United States Naval Academy and received his aviator wings in October 1967. He was with squadron VF-154 from July 1968 to May 1970, flying F-4J Phantoms and made two combat deployments to Vietnam aboard the aircraft carrier . From June 1970 to February 1971, he attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, and upon graduation was assigned as a project test pilot with the Service Test Division at NAS Patuxent River. During this two-year tour of duty, he served as the F-14 Tomcat engine development project officer. In July 1973, Creighton commenced a four-year assignment with VF-2 and became a member of the first F-14 operational squadron, completing two deployments aboard to the Western Pacific. He returned to the United States in July 1977 and was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center's Strike Directorate as operations officer and F-14 program manager. He has logged over 6,000 hours flying time, the majority of it in jet fighters, and has completed 500 carrier landings and 175 combat missions. NASA career Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, Creighton became an astronaut in August 1979. During the following four years, he held a variety of technical assignments in support of the Space Shuttle Program. Following his first flight, Creighton became the astronaut representative to the Shuttle Program Manager. During the ensuing two years, Creighton participated in all the key decisions following the Challenger disaster helping to shape the plan for resuming safe manned space flight. Starting with STS-26, Creighton served as Lead \\"CAPCOM\\" for the first four Space Shuttle flights. In March 1989 he was assigned to command STS-36 but continued to serve as Head of the Mission Support Branch in the Astronaut Office until commencing full-time training for his upcoming flight. Following his second flight, Creighton headed up the Operations Development Branch within the Astronaut Office for one year prior to resuming full-time training for his next command. Creighton served as pilot on STS-51-G (June 17‚Äì24, 1985), was spacecraft commander on STS-36 (February 28 to March 4, 1990) and STS-48 (September 12‚Äì18, 1991), and has logged over 403 hours in space. Captain Creighton left NASA and retired from the Navy in July 1992. He was formerly a test pilot and worked in Aircraft Marketing & Delivery with the Boeing Airplane Company until he retired in 2007. =Space flights= STS-51-G Discovery (June 17‚Äì24, 1985) was a 7-day mission during which the crew deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat), and the United States (AT&T; Telstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite which performed 17 hours of X-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials, participated in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Mission duration was 112 Earth orbits in 169 hours and 39 minutes. STS-36 Atlantis (February 28 to March 4, 1990) carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. Mission duration was 72 Earth orbits in 106 hours, 19 minutes, 43 seconds. STS-48 Discovery (September 12‚Äì18, 1991) was a 5-day mission during which the crew deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) which is designed to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere's chemistry, winds and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. Mission duration was 81 Earth orbits in 128 hours, 27 minutes, 34 seconds. Political career He unsuccessfully ran as a Republican candidate for the Washington State Senate in 1997. Organizations He is a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and the Association of Space Explorers.

In a public career spanning six decades, he served as the third premier of Prince Edward Island, a federal Member of Parliament and Cabinet minister, and as both a Puisne Justice and the sixth Chief Justice of Canada. Early life and family Davies was born in Charlottetown, the son of Benjamin Davies and Kezia Attwood Watts. He attended Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown. In July, 1872, he married Susan Wiggins, a daughter of Dr. A. V. G. Wiggins. She was a member of the Humane Society, the Women's Canadian Historical Society, and similar organizations. The couple had two sons and three daughters. Legal career Davies read law at the Inner Temple in London. He was called to bar in England in 1866, and to the bar of Prince Edward Island a year later. He served as lead counsel for the Prince Edward Island Land Commission, which was established in 1875 to settle the problem of absentee land ownership and to provide tenants of the Island with clear title to their lands. In 1877, Davies was one of the Canadian counsel who appeared on behalf of the British Government before the Halifax Fisheries Commission, appointed under the Treaty of Washington (1871) to resolve outstanding issues, including fishing rights. The Commission gave an award directing the United States to pay $5,500,000 to the British Government. Davies was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1880, and knighted by Queen Victoria in 1897. Political career Davies was first elected to the House of Assembly as a Liberal in 1872 just prior to Prince Edward Island entering Canadian confederation. With the issue of Confederation resolved and the land question settled as a result of Canada's promise to fund land reform and the passage of the Land Purchase Act, the major issue remaining on the island was that of school funding and whether the school system should be entirely secular and public or whether separate schools for Catholics should be permitted. The issue divided both parties, and had led to the collapse of one government. Following the defeat of the Conservative government of Lemuel Cambridge Owen in 1876, Davies established a coalition government of Protestant Liberals and Conservatives with himself as Premier and Attorney-General. The Davies government was formed to enact a Public Schools Act which made school attendance compulsory, and created a non-sectarian public school system. The act was passed in 1877 and, with the issue around which the coalition had been formed having been resolved, the coalition itself began to unravel. Davies' government reformed the civil service and brought in financial reforms before being defeated by the Conservatives in a Motion of No Confidence in 1879. Davies won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1882 federal election as a Liberal. When the Liberals formed government after the 1896 election under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Davies became minister of marine and fisheries, and during 1898‚Äì1899 he was a member of the Anglo-American joint high commission at Quebec. Supreme Court of Canada In 1901, Davies was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. He was appointed Chief Justice in 1918. He was the oldest person to be appointed Chief Justice, at the age of 73 years, 172 days. Davies held the position until his death in Ottawa in 1924. As of 2020, he is the last Chief Justice of Canada to have previously served in elected office. He is also, as of 2020, the only Prince Edward Islander to have served on the Supreme Court. The Prince Edward Island Supreme Court building in Charlottetown is named in his honour. Also named for him is Davies Point, at the meeting of Hastings and Alice Arms on Observatory Inlet in British Columbia; the naming was done at the time of his appointment to the Supreme Court, as was also Davies Bay, at the head of Work Channel just east of Prince Rupert.

Biography Philip Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.Hamilton, Janice (2003). Nigeria in Pictures. Lerner Publishing Group. p. 70. . He was raised in Onitsha in the South Eastern part of Nigeria. His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study. He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African- American microbiologist. Education He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington D.C., receiving in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees. During this time, he worked as a civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming. =Court case and the denial of degree= Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of Appeals. Supercomputing Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received a prize in \\"price/performance\\" category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M. The winner in the \\"performance\\" category, was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry. His method involved each microprocessor communicating with six neighbors. Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling.

In 1968, he was a Lunar Module Pilot on the Apollo 7 mission. He was NASA's third civilian astronaut (after Neil Armstrong and Elliot See), and has also been a fighter pilot, physicist, entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and author of The All-American Boys. Following the deaths of Donn F. Eisele in 1987 and Wally Schirra in 2007, Cunningham is the last surviving crew member of Apollo 7. Biography =Early life, education and military career= Cunningham was born in Creston, Iowa, on March 16, 1932. He graduated from Venice High School in Venice, California, in 1950.Walter Cunningham ~ 1950 After high school, Cunningham studied at Santa Monica CollegeFamous SMC Alumni Set Forth a Path of Excellence to Follow, until he joined the U.S. Navy in 1951, and began flight training in 1952. He served on active duty as a fighter pilot with the U.S. Marine Corps from 1953 until 1956, flying 54 missions as a night fighter pilot in Korea. Armistice discussions were still on-going when Cunningham initially left for Korea, and the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed just before he arrived.Interview at USC Institute for Creative Technologies, June 21, 2018 From 1956 to 1975, he served in the Marine Corps Reserve, ultimately retiring at the rank of colonel. Following his active duty, he resumed his studies at Santa Monica College, before transferring to the UCLA in 1958. Cunningham received his BA with honors in 1960, and his MA with distinction in 1961, both in physics, from the University of California, Los Angeles. He completed all requirements save for the dissertation for a PhD in physics at UCLA during his time at RAND Corporation, where he spent three years prior to his NASA selection. Cunningham during the Apollo 7 mission =NASA career= In October 1963, Cunningham was one of the third group of astronauts selected by NASA. On October 11, 1968, he occupied the Lunar Module Pilot seat for the eleven-day flight of Apollo 7, the first launch of a manned Apollo mission. The flight carried no Lunar Module and Cunningham was responsible for all spacecraft systems except launch and navigation. The crew kept busy with myriad system tests and successfully completed test firing of the service-module-engine ignition and measuring the accuracy of the spacecraft systems. Schirra, with a cold, ran afoul of NASA management during the flight, but Cunningham went on to head up the Skylab Branch of the Astronaut Office and left NASA in 1971. He has accumulated more than 4,500 hours of flying time, including more than 3,400 in jet aircraft and 263 hours in space. =Post-NASA career= In 1974, Cunningham attended Harvard Business School's six-week Advanced Management Program and later worked as a businessman and investor in a number of private ventures. In 1977, he published The All-American Boys, a reminiscence of his astronaut days. He was also a major contributor and foreword-writer for the 2007 space history book In the Shadow of the Moon. In 2018, Cunningham joined the Back to Space organization as an Astronaut Consultant with the goal of inspiring the next generation to go to Mars. In 2008, NASA awarded Cunningham the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his Apollo 7 mission. He is currently a radio talk show host and public speaker. Cunningham also works as a consultant to start-up technology companies and is chairman of the Texas Aerospace Commission. Global warming views Cunningham rejects the current mainstream opinion regarding anthropogenic global warming (AGW). In 2010, he published a discussion paper titled \\"Global Warming: Facts versus Faith\\". In an editorial published in the Houston Chronicle on August 15, 2010, Cunningham argued that the empirical evidence does not support the claims of global warming. Organizations Cunningham is a member of numerous organizations. He is an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, fellow of the American Astronautical Society, member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, American Geophysical Union, Explorers Club, Sigma Pi Sigma and Sigma Xi, Association of Space Explorers, Houston American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, Aviation Subcommittee, Houston Chamber of Commerce, Earth Awareness Foundation, National Association of Small Business Investment Companies.

This has been unsuccessful, and the ship's once enormous crew-count has now been reduced to four. Telson (the ship's Commander), Sharna (Science officer), Darv and Astra are the third- generation crew- the only survivors of the disastrous Great Meteoroid Strike which seriously damaged the ship two decades previously, killing the entire second-generation crew and rendering large areas of the ship \\"uncontrolled\\" and inaccessible to its electronic systems. From infancy, the four third- generation crew members (now in their early twenties) have been raised by robots and by the Angels ‚Äì mysterious unseen beings who run the ship and who only manifest as disembodied voices. Darv, the most sceptical and enquiring of the crew members, suspects that the Angels are merely computers; but the others consider them as \\"Guardian Angels\\" and work entirely under their guidance. With no suitably colonisable planet found after over a hundred years of searching, a crew-vote is taken and the Challenger sets a course for the return to Earth. Darv and Astra, while exploring one of the uncontrolled zones, find a survey recording of an Earth-type planet called Paradise. (In the accompanying novelisation, Darv is alone when he makes the discovery.) As is standard procedure, the crew enter suspended animation in order to prevent ageing and possible death during the many years of journey time. Unrevealed to the crew, the Angels (who are the ship's control computers; their name being an acronym of ANcillary Guardian of Environment and Life ) have their own agenda. They desire absolute control and mastery over any colony resulting from the mission. To this end, they covertly engineered the apparent accident which killed the second-generation crew (who would otherwise have ended the mission before the Angels wanted it to end) and have kept the third-generation crew sexually immature and innocent via drugs and disinformation in order to keep them more tractable. However, their machinations have begun to backfire already. Their requirement of a minimum human crew of four to man the Challengers control room requires the Angels to work mainly via suggestion and manipulation. Also, the Great Meteoroid Strike damaged the ship and their control over it more than was planned, including damage to their own memory banks, which in turn deprived them of vital information about the Theory of Relativity. Concerned that the discovery of the Paradise recording may convince the crew members to change their plans, the Angels suppress Darv's and Astra's memories of the survey recording by hypnotic manipulation, in Darv's case by using violent, nightmare-inducing imagery. Reaching the Earth's solar system, the Challengers crew are horrified to discover that Earth has vanished altogether, with the Moon now occupying Earth's former orbit. Although the crew locate a large city on the Moon, they are unable to receive any answers to their communications and are unable to leave the ship to explore. This situation is changed when Darv and Astra enter an uncontrolled zone within the Challenger and locate a space shuttle previously unknown to the Angels. Using this, they visit the city, named \\"first Footprint City\\", and discover the Moon Sentinel, a computerised guardian and archive whom they can question. From the Sentinel they discover that while only one hundred and fifteen years of shipboard time has passed during the Challengers entire mission, due to the ship's use of near-lightspeed travel and the effects of time dilation much more time has passed on Earth ‚Äì over one million years. During this time, the Earth was removed from the solar system via a tremendous feat of interstellar engineering ‚Äì desiring to protect the planet from the risk of increased solar activity, the inhabitants of Earth took the planet to orbit another, safer star. The Sentinel does not know which solar system Earth now occupies, but notes that if the Challengers crew genuinely are descendants of Earth people they will think as the people of Earth thought, and will find the Earth by following that pattern. Seeking more clues in their new Earthsearch mission, the Challenger travels to Kyros (the third planet of the solar system, and a desert world). However, Darv's enquiring and rebellious mind is now putting him at odds with the Angels again, who are forced to surreptitiously discipline him for a second time. Opting to work in the ship's farm galleries for a while, Darv develops a taste for unprocessed fruit, and the hormone suppressants which keep him sexually undeveloped begin to wear off. He introduces Astra to the same diet, with similar effects. On arrival in Kyros orbit, Darv and Astra take the shuttle down to the planet surface to investigate a buried gravitational anomaly. While there, they are kidnapped, leaving the Challenger minus half its crew (and consequently stranded). Darv and Astra's kidnappers turn out to be members of the Solaric Empire - an organisation based on the fifth moon of Zelda (the gas-giant fourth planet in the solar system) and consisting of the remaining humans in the Solar System. Darv and Astra's artificially-maintained sexual immaturity leads to them being labelled as poor-quality alien replicas of human beings. Their stories of the past of Earth and their mission are considered a threat to the position of the Solaric Emperor Thorden, who is persuaded by his ruthless chief prosecutor, Helan, to have them executed. This is thwarted by the arrival of the Challenger (Telson and Sharna having worked out how to use surgical androids as temporary control room crew replacements). Following the subsequent standoff Thorden offers to join the Challenger on its search for Earth. He bluntly confirms to the crew that the Angels are computers, of the dangerous \\"freewill\\" kind that develop an obsession with power and which the Solaric Empire fought and won a war against (the defeated machines were imprisoned in a vault on Kyros, the anomaly investigated earlier by the Challenger crew). He plans for his own security and future dominance over the mission by ensuring that the space ferry which he brings to and docks within the Challenger as personal transport is heavily armed. He also smuggles on board a fearsome warrior android called Fagor. Unknown to the crew, he strikes a deal with the Angels to share power over the Earth once it is found. However, the Angels have other plans. Once the humans on ship have entered suspended animation for the next leg of the journey, they cancel the crew's hormone suppressants and allow them to develop to full sexual maturity, suppressing any shock or curiosity via post-hypnotic suggestion (although Darv and Astra, who had previously begun to develop following their rejection of the processed food, had already begun a fully sexual relationship before this). When they next revive the crew, the Angels allow the revival process to go wrong for Thorden, killing him as a result. Though Darv is suspicious of the Angels, he and the crew are more concerned with the drifting ship which the Challenger has picked up on its radar ‚Äì which turns out to be the Challenger II, their own craft's sister ship, which appears derelict. Sharna and Telson go over in the shuttle to investigate, and discover that the Challenger II is still populated by the descendants of its original crew but has been crippled by civil wars between them. The survivors are divided between the initially welcoming, highly religious Earth Worshippers who are in conflict with the more anarchic but historically-aware Underpeople - the Earth Worshippers decide to hang Sharna and Telson for unintentional blasphemy. (In the novelisation, they also destroy the shuttle.) Meanwhile, the warrior android Fagor begins to wreak havoc onboard Challenger in revenge for Thorden's death: Darv and Astra are forced to flee from him in Thorden's ferry. Aided by Lenart, a female Underperson, they rescue Telson and Sharna from the Earth Worshippers, but their subsequent visit to the Underpeople puts them into further peril. While welcoming, the female-dominated Underpeople have chosen to stabilise their society by keep their men almost permanently in suspended animation, reviving them only temporarily to serve as sperm sources for impregnation. Darv and Telson have been targeted to bolster the Underpeople's dwindling genetic stock. Successfully fleeing Challenger II in the shuttle and Thorden's ferry (in the novelisation, just the ferry), the Challenger crew discovers that Challenger itself has disappeared. Fagor has seized control of the ship and is accelerating it away with the intention of plunging it into a sun to avenge Thorden. Abandoning the too slow shuttle, the crew carries out a harrowing pursuit in the ferry, constantly trying to produce enough velocity to cut down on a fatal time and oxygen shortfall. The Angels manage to trick Fagor into leaving the Challenger and flying via his own onboard jets to attack the ferry, hoping that the humans will destroy him with the ferry's armament. This is successful, with Darv discovering that firing the cannon can also produce sufficient thrust to reach the Challenger in time. The crew re-enter suspended animation for the next part of the journey, but during their medical examinations the Angels discover that Astra is pregnant. Wishing to maintain control of a future crew ‚Äì and already wary of the rebellious Darv ‚Äì the Angels plan to deliver Astra's baby secretly. With these plans thwarted when they're obliged to bring Astra out of suspended animation to avoid a miscarriage, they're also forced to awake everyone in order to avoid arousing her suspicions. This is a particular risk for them as the ship is by then passing close to the Paradise solar system as detailed in the records found earlier by Darv. The Angels fear that the crew may still opt to colonise an undeveloped planet rather than lead the Angels to dominion over a developed one. Discovering her own pregnancy, Astra then tells Darv; suspecting that the Angels will try to harm the baby, she finally rejects them: refusing to go back into suspended animation, she and Darv flee into the Challengers uncontrolled zones to escape the Angels‚Äô control. They discover and set up home in the ship's long-lost terraforming centre, where there are more shuttles. While there, they witness survey footage of the Paradise planet on the centre's control screens and eventually deduce that these are live video broadcasts from an instrument package left on the planet by the second- generation crew. This in turn allows them to pinpoint the position of Paradise. Revealing what they have found to Telson and Sharna, Darv and Astra choose to leave the Challenger altogether and set up home on Paradise. With Sharna's help, they persuade Telson to bring the ship close enough to Paradise to allow for an easy shuttle journey to reconnoitre the planet. However the Angels block the Challengers controls, and attempt to change the crew's minds by admitting to the existence of Paradise but also overstating its difficulties, for example the electromagnetic radiation that lights up the polar sky. However Astra and Darv are not convinced and decide on a one-way shuttle trip to Paradise, the planet being just within range. They reach the planet successfully but lose all of their supplies when the shuttle crashes into the sea. Forced to live rough, and often terrified by the hardships of their new life, they make the best of what they have. Meanwhile, back on the Challenger, Telson and Sharna discover the physical location of the Angels within the ship ‚Äì their Central Switching Room. Despite the Angels‚Äô desperate attempts to protect themselves (via nightmare-inducing hallucinatory barriers), Telson and Sharna reach the room and finally see the Angels as they really are ‚Äì two complex racks of organic integrated wetware circuits which could be destroyed with two blows of a hammer. Having finally broken the control which the Angels wielded over the crew's life, Telson and Sharna have them at their mercy. They strike a deal whereby the Angels will take the Challenger ‚Äì now crewed by surgical androids ‚Äì and continue the Earthsearch mission. Unhindered by the Angels, Telson and Sharna follow Astra and Darv to settle on Paradise, successfully landing on the planet with appropriate supplies and resources to begin their colony. All four former crew members watch the exhaust trail of the Challenger as it leaves Paradise orbit. They remind themselves that they will need to tell their children warning stories about the Angels, just in case they ever return. =Mythological approach= Earthsearch eventually reveals itself as an inverted creation myth, providing a possible \\"factual\\" story which could lie behind various Earth legends. The story deliberately misleads the listener in order to gradually reveal that the planet Paradise is in fact the Earth of human history as we know it (with the original \\"Earth\\" being a previous forgotten homeworld for the human race) and that the legends of authoritative and fear-inducing \\"angels\\" refer to the domineering computers. Various clues are presented in that \\"Earth\\" and its sister planet Kyros and Zelda (the latter two clearly analogous to Mars and Jupiter) are the second, third and fourth planets of their solar system rather than the third, fourth and fifth, while Paradise is the third planet of its own solar system (as is \\"our\\" Earth), although the different planetary names are at one point attributed to an administrative change of nomenclature. Earthsearch II =Cast= * Commander Telson - Sean Arnold * Sharna - Amanda Murray * Darv - Haydn Wood * Astra - Kathryn Hurlbutt * Elka - Jill Lidstone * Bran - Michael Maloney * Angel One - Sonia Fraser * Angel Two - Gordon Reid * Tidy - David Gooderson * George - Stephen Garlick * Solaria - Pauline Letts * Elkeran - Nicholas Courtney * Halston - David McAlister * Theros - John Warner * SA7 - Spencer Banks * Kraken - Crawford Logan * Peeron - George Parsons * Earthvoice - Michael Tudor Barnes The casting for Earthsearch II featured the return of several supporting actors from the original Earthsearch, playing different roles. The part of George the agricultural android (originally played by John McAndrew) was recast for Stephen Garlick (who had played Spegal in Earthsearch). Pauline Letts (Solaria) had previously played the role of Tandor in Earthsearch. =Episodes= # Return # Flood # Surrender # Solaria # Sundeath # Supermass # Deathship # Megalomania # Earth # Earthvoice =Story= The story of Earthsearch 2 continues the adventures of the crew of the starship Challenger (Telson, Sharna, Darv and Astra) begun in the previous serial, Earthsearch, which told the story of their quest for their lost ancestral home planet of Earth (which had moved to orbit a new and unknown star when its citizens realised their original sun was going to go nova). At the end of the serial, the four crewmembers had chosen to settle on the sufficiently Earth-like planet Paradise and escape the ruthless, manipulative control of the Challenger's megalomaniacal control computers, Angel One and Angel Two. While the Angels departed Paradise orbit to continue the Earthsearch mission (and to achieve their aim of dominating an entire civilisation), the humans began their new life on their new homeworld. Earthsearch 2 begins four years later, when Telson, Sharna, Darv and Astra have settled into their life on Paradise (assisted by two androids, the agricultural machine George and the argumentative general-purpose service unit Tidy). Both couples now have young children - Darv and Astra have the twins Elka and Savin, and Telson and Sharna have their son Bran. Despite the colonists' embrace of Paradise as home, the lifestyle is proving to be difficult and full of hardships. Sharna's loss of what would have been her second child raises questions about the sustainability of the small colony as well as bringing up differences of opinion on how (and whether) to use the remaining technology and resources (including their surviving planetary shuttle). When Savin is unexpectedly killed by a 'monster' that appears from the sea, the colonists are placed under further strain. Noticing the appearance of an unidentified artefact in planetary orbit, Telson and Darv fly up towards it in the shuttle, to discover that it is an eight-mile long spaceship called Voyager 30 and apparently part of an Earth-originated survey mission. Appearances are deceptive. The spaceship is in fact the returning Challenger: repaired, shortened, refitted and still operated by the Angels (as well by a team of control room androids overseen by Android Surgeon-General Kraken). The Angels are now being attacked by mysterious transmissions apparently aimed at damaging or destroying organic computers such as themselves and the Challenger's higher intelligence androids. As humans are totally unaffected by the attacks, the Angels require human assistance in order to seek out and destroy the transmissions at source, and have therefore returned to Paradise to recruit the only humans they can obtain. However, the Angels do not reveal this information, and instead feign an interest in the welfare of the colony in an attempt to gain the trust of the humans. At the same time they have secretly sent an android to kidnap the children (the same \\"sea monster\\" which accidentally killed Savin in a bungled abduction attempt). When rejected by the suspicious humans, the Angels resort to sabotage on a planetary scale, using terraforming equipment from the Challenger to melt Paradise's polar ice caps and thus raise the sea level in an attempt to get their former crew to rejoin them on the ship. The resulting flooding begins to submerge all of the land, forcing the settlers to abandon their colony and use their shuttle as a floating ark, even down to loading breeding pairs of animals into the shuttle cargo bay. The crew survive and hold out against the Angels' plans until a series of accidents loses them their drinking water, forcing a surrender. They make the best of things by demanding a concession in the shape of a reversal of the flood (so that the animals can be released and survive), following which they fly their shuttle up to the Challenger. On board the Challenger, the colonists make attempts to regain control over both the Angels and the ship's control room, but are thwarted when the Angels kidnap the children from the shuttle. The adults are gassed by a surgical android and fall unconscious. When they come round, they discover that the ship has long left the Paradise system and that they have been in suspended animation for sixteen years. However, the children have been awake the whole time, and have aged normally, now being between eighteen and nineteen years old and firmly under the influence of the Angels. Elka appears friendly and enthusiastic, but Bran is now both hostile and the commander of the Challenger. He demonstrates harsh suspicion and aggression towards his parents and the other two adults, even threatening to kill them should they challenge his authority. En route to the source system of the attacks, the Challenger encounters a free-floating fifty-mile wide parabolic dish which the Angels decide to use as raw material for shielding. Telson, Sharna, Darv and Astra are sent to investigate the dish. They discover that it is an abandoned artificial sun called Solaria D, used by the Earth during its transit to its new sun, and presided over by an Angel-like control computer called Solaria. Despite her apparent benevolence, Solaria is revealed to have been abandoned by Earth once she developed murderous megalomaniacal tendencies. Darv succeeds in destroying her. During their stay on Solaria D, the crew discover the name (though not the location) of Earth's new home star, Novita Six. Returning to the Challenger, the crew notice that Solaria D is now moving in an anomalous way. They discover that the artificial sun is now in the grip of the gravity well of a black hole, and that the Challenger is following it. Attempts to escape from the black hole are hampered by the fact that the human crew have no access to the Challenger's control room, where Android Surgeon-General Kraken has had his reasoning capacity damaged by the continuing attacks and is no longer responding to or obeying instructions. With the Angels drastically weakened by the attacks and unable to assist, the humans attempt to storm the control room, which is defended by android warriors. The assault fails when the crew run out of time and the Challenger is pulled into the black hole. The crew regain consciousness to find themselves on a gigantic plain surrounded by many different kinds of abandoned starships, including the Challenger. They discover that they have in fact landed unharmed on an enormous artificial construct - a \\"gravity platform\\" which merely resembles a black hole and forms part of Earth's long-range defences, acting as a trap for potentially hostile vessels. The chief engineer of Spaceguard Six, Theros, refuses to release either the Challenger or its crew as he deems the Angels too much of a threat. Not only have they integrated themselves into the entire structure of the ship (making their removal from it effectively impossible), Theros suspects that they may have interposed themselves into the brains of the Challenger's crew. When Darv locates the Spaceguard's gravitational control room and reverses the field, he frees the Challenger but at the cost of destroying Spaceguard Six. The ship continues its journey, but immediately runs into further problems when debris from the Spaceguard seriously damages the ship's life support systems and farm galleries, threatening the lives of all humans and organic computers on the ship. With the inexperienced and insecure Bran unable to cope (and undermined by Elka, who secretly dominates him and dictates his actions at the prompting of the Angels), Telson regains command of the Challenger and succeeds in organising the crew to deal with the problems. A second assault on the control room is more successful, but attracts the wrath of the near- invincible Android Surgeon-General Kraken, who kidnaps Darv and Astra to replace his destroyed control room androids. Now suffering catastrophic delusions about seizing the power of stars, Kraken is placing the ship at drastic risk. With the assistance of their android Tidy, the crew manage to destroy Kraken and regain control of the ship. Telson discovers that Kraken has coincidentally selected Novita Six as the ship's next target star. Arriving in the Novita Six system, the Challenger finally reaches its original home, Earth. However, the planet does not look like the Earth that the crew have seen in recordings. It is almost totally dead, with very little water and no rain. The only sign of life is a huge ten-mile-high tower on the equator, with a tiny village nearby. The crew fly down to the village, and meet Peeron, the leader. They discover that the Earth's civilisation has collapsed a long time ago, and the human race is reduced to eking out a meagre living from a tiny spring that grows weaker every year. It appears that the humans will be extinct in a short period of time. The Challenger crew use the terraforming systems on the Challenger to bring rain to Earth and create a stable weather pattern which will allow the people to flourish. The crew examine the tower, finding that there is a door set into one side which cannot be opened. Peeron says that many of his predecessors have made attempts over the centuries - for example, by hitting the door with battering rams - but it will not budge. It is said that it is held shut by a \\"lock of knowledge\\". Darv eventually works out how to open the ingeniously simple lock, which requires a low grade of technology which would only be available to people who have already worked out basic principles of science and engineering. The door is a very close/accurate fit in the aperture, and contains mild heating elements that cause it to expand and lock in place. These heaters do not heat it to the point that it is warm to the touch. Simply attaching a refrigeration system to the door and cooling it a few degrees causes the door to shrink and move freely. When the crew open the door, they enter the tower, leaving Peeron and his people outside. They discover that the tower contains a colossal library, presided over by the artificial intelligence \\"Earthvoice\\" which serves as both the voice of the library and as a \\"guardian\\". Earthvoice explains to the crew that the tower was constructed by the people of Earth as a repository of all human knowledge when their last great civilisation was collapsing. The lock was designed so that the people could not enter until they had already worked out how to make some technology for themselves. Unfortunately, Earthvoice's abilities do not include weather control, so although he has successfully defended Earth's legacy of knowledge he has been helpless to deal with the deterioration of the planet's environmental conditions. Earthvoice has already communicated with the Angels, presenting himself as friendly and subservient. Prompted by Elka to work with the Angels, Earthvoice re-establishes contact with them and is welcomed eagerly. He admits to having been the source of the attacks which have damaged the angels but states that they were a programming directive which he has now overridden. To the humans' horror, Earthvoice and the Angels agree to share both the library's knowledge and power over the Earth, with the Angels also urging that Earthvoice exterminates the crew for safety. Earthvoice begins to transfer the knowledge - however, the Angels have fallen into a final trap. Earthvoice has always intended to destroy them, and he now launches one last brutal and specialised attack on the Angels from close range, erasing their consciousness and memory facilities. Rather than interfere further with the primitive human culture on Earth, the crew seal the door to the tower and return to the Challenger. With the Angels now reduced to subservient and \\"quite brainless\\" computer systems, they head back to their chosen home, Paradise, to rebuild their colony. =Engineering= It would initially seem that using two computers to run a star-ship lacks redundancy. The ship originally had 3 angels in charge, seemingly giving sufficient redundancy should one computer malfunction. However the design of the Angels was itself flawed, with the general mode of failure the development of megalomaniac tendencies. When one and two fail they destroy the third computer. Later on Earth this flaw in the Angels design was recognised and rectified, leading to the computer that is Earthvoice, and also explaining why Earthvoice is designed/programmed to destroy computers of \\"Angel\\" design, as they pose a threat to other lifeforms. =Plot similarities= Elements of episodes 6 and 7 (\\"Supermass\\" and \\"Deathship\\"), featuring the appearance of the artificial black hole Spaceguard Six which draws in the Challenger, have plot similarities to the Blake's 7 episode \\"Dawn of the Gods\\". This episode (also penned by Follett and first broadcast on BBC Television on 28 January 1980) features an artificial black hole which draws in the Liberator and in which the crew wake up surrounded by captured ships. The plot of the first series is also somewhat similar to the Space:1999 episode \\"Mission of the Darians\\", in which the Alphans discover an enormous spacecraft whose inhabitants have descended into barbarism after an environmental disaster on board the spaceship.

He is currently serving a prison term of 30 years to life at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jersey. Biography Neulander was the founding rabbi of the Congregation M'Kor Shalom Reform Temple in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. It opened in the summer of 1974. Previously, he had been the assistant rabbi at Temple Emanuel, also in Cherry Hill. Neulander graduated from Trinity College in 1963. Neulander was convicted of paying congregant Len Jenoff and drifter Paul Daniels $18,000 to kill his wife Carol on November 1, 1994. The case became a media circus and was broadcast live on CourtTV. In February 1995, he resigned as Rabbi from Congregation M'Kor Shalom.Hanley, Robert. \\"Younger Son Asks Jury to Spare Rabbi's Life\\", The New York Times, November 22, 2002. Accessed January 1, 2008. At the time of his wife's murder, Neulander had been involved in a two-year affair with Philadelphia radio personality Elaine Soncini. The affair began after he visited Soncini's Jewish husband, Ken Garland, in the hospital and later officiated at Garland's funeral. \\"So compelling was Rabbi Neulander that Soncini later converted from Catholicism to Judaism under his tutelage.\\" Trials Tried before Judge Linda G. Baxter, the first trial resulted in a hung jury. It had been empaneled in Camden County. Area newspapers reported rumors that the panel hung 9-3 in favor of guilt. Due to the intense media coverage in Camden County, the re-trial was moved to Monmouth County. At the re-trial, Neulander was defended by Mt. Holly attorney Mike Riley. In Monmouth, Neulander was found guilty. His son Matthew, whose testimony at the first trial had been lukewarm, was by the time of the second trial thoroughly convinced of his father's guilt, which was reflected in his testimony.Neulander's oldest son calls father \`coward' Following the verdict, Assistant Prosecutor Jim Lynch submitted to the jury the question of whether or not the death penalty should be sought. The jury panel decided not to recommend the death penalty. Neulander was sentenced to serve 30 years to life at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. In an interview by ABC's Barbara Walters after his incarceration, he told her \\"You have no idea how much rage I have.\\" He was also saddened that two of his three adult children testified against him. Appeal In December 2006, the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Courts denied Fred Neulander's appeal.a3616-02.opn.html His appellate counsel had argued that the trial court had erred in not permitting Neulander to argue a third party liability defense based on a similar home invasion burglary murder that had occurred in Cherry Hill. Neulander had also argued court error on the issue of double or triple layer \\"hearsay\\" evidence, i.e., the out-of-court statement by Carol Neulander as elicited by and through her daughter, about the telephone conversation involving the \\"bathroom man.\\" Although an appeal and post-conviction relief application were planned, Neulander's best chance at a new trial had been lost.

He was born in Charlottetown to Thomas Owen, who was Postmaster General for Prince Edward Island for eighteen years, serving until his death in 1860. Owen was educated in private schools and at the Central Academy in Charlottetown (later Prince of Wales College). One of the island's most successful businessmen, Owen succeeded his father as Postmaster General of the island in 1860 before entering politics in 1866 winning election as a Conservative. Owen became Premier of the province in 1873 after James Colledge Pope entered federal politics. Owen was the second premier since PEI joined Canadian confederation on July 1, 1873. His government set up a Land Commission that was responsible for using funds provided by the federal government to implement land reform and end the island's system of proprietary land ownership and tenant farming. His government was unable to resolve the contentious schools question that divided both the Conservative and Liberal parties along sectarian lines and his government was replaced in 1876 by a Protestant coalition formed to implement a secular school system on the island.

Its insurance subsidiaries are major providers of medical, dental, disability, life and accident insurance and related products and services, the majority of which are offered through employers and other groups (e.g. governmental and non-governmental organizations, unions and associations). Cigna is incorporated in Connecticut. Cigna offers Medicare and Medicaid products and health, life and accident insurance coverages primarily to individuals in the U.S. and selected international markets. In addition to its ongoing operations described above, Cigna also has certain run-off operations, including a Run-off Reinsurance segment. In the Phoenix metropolitan area, Cigna runs a full-service staff-model HMO (health maintenance organization) with satellite clinics throughout the region, known as the Cigna Medical Group. Cigna Global Health Benefits also operates under the Cigna corporation. Cigna‚Äôs motto is 'Together, all the way.' The company ranked No. 13 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. On March 7, 2018, it was announced that Cigna would buy Express Scripts in a $67 billion deal and on August 24, 2018, the shareholders of Cigna and Express Scripts approved the deal. History Cigna's corporate headquarters in Bloomfield, Connecticut Cigna was formed by the 1982 merger of the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CG) and INA Corporation (the parent corporation of Insurance Company of North America, the first stock insurance company in America). The company name, Cigna, is a mix of letters from the merging companies, CG and INA. Insurance Company of North America was formed in 1792 and is a corporate ancestor of Cigna. The CG was created in 1865 by a special act of the Governor of Connecticut. In October 1871, the great Chicago Fire burned for two days, destroyed 2,000 acres and left 100,000 people in Illinois homeless. INA paid $650,000, one of only 51 insurance companies (out of a total of 202) to pay claims in full. Before selling its domestic and international property and casualty business to the Bermuda-based ACE Insurance company in the late 1990s, Cigna was among the companies with a large international network comparable to those of AIG, Allianz, and Zurich. The strategy behind the sale was to concentrate on core business. ACE ‚Äì at that time a key player at the Bermuda and Lloyds insurance market ‚Äì on the other hand was interested on expanding the international network in the traditional insurance market. Cigna sold the majority of its life insurance operations to Lincoln National Corporation in 1997. Cigna now operates in 30 countries, has approximately 35,800 employees and manages around US$53.734 billion in assets. In 2002, it was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act for earnings manipulation. Its common stock price plummeted significantly as a result. In October 2011, Cigna agreed to buy HealthSpring Inc. for $3.8 billion to jump-start its business selling Medicare plans from 46,000 Medicare Advantage members to almost 400,000 Medicare Advantage members. The payment would come from an issue of new equity to cover about 20 percent of the value, with the rest funded by additional cash and debt. In June 2015, U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc. announced an offer to acquire Cigna for more than $47 billion in cash and stock. Anthem confirmed it had reached a deal to buy Cigna on July 24, 2015. On July 21, 2016, the US Justice Department filed an antitrust suit to block the proposed merger, and a District Court ruling on February 8, 2017 blocked the merger on anticompetitive grounds. That month, Cigna Corp. called off its $48 billion merger agreement with Anthem Inc., with Anthem stating it would \\"continue to enforce its rights under the merger agreement and remains committed to closing the transaction.\\" In June 2020, Cigna formed a strategic alliance with Priority Health to make comprehensive health care coverage more affordable and accessible to Michigan employers and customers. Cigna Global Health Benefits Cigna Global Health Benefits is a business unit within Cigna. The company is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, close to Philadelphia. Additional Cigna Global Health Benefits operations are located in Visalia, California, and Greenock, Scotland and Shanghai, China and Antwerp, Belgium. Sales offices are located in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. =Products and services= CGHB global health plans typically include medical, dental, behavioral and disability, as well as business travel and life components. Expatriates are defined as employees of multinational companies working outside their home country on short, and long-term international assignments. CGHB maintains its own, in-house international claims platform, and offers a network of physicians and hospitals for its members (including 550,000 in the U.S. and more than 141,000 outside the U.S.). Controversies In December 2007, Cigna was criticized after the company refused to pay for a liver transplant of a California teenage girl, Nataline Sarkisyan, justifying their refusal to pay by claiming that the procedure was experimental, even though there was a liver ready and waiting to be transplanted and doctors estimated she had a 65% chance of surviving at least six months. In response to much protest and public scrutiny, Cigna reversed its decision, though Ms. Sarkisyan died awaiting the transplant. Cigna notes that it had no financial stake in the decision to authorize the transplant because it merely administers the insurance plan of Mr. Sarkisyan's employer and would not bear the cost of any operation. However, Cigna offered to pay for the transplant itself when it made the exception to the policy. Even though liver transplants have been performed since 1963 and are a well accepted treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, Cigna defended its actions by claiming that there was insufficient data to show that a transplant for a patient in Sarkisyan's condition would be safe and effective. The California court agreed with Cigna‚Äôs position that the Sarkisyans‚Äô claims regarding Cigna's decision-making were preempted by federal ERISA law. On April 16, 2009, the United States District Court for the Central District of California dismissed all of the claims against Cigna related to the coverage determination. In 2011, the California Nurses Association determined that Cigna denies roughly 39.6% of all claims (compared to competitors such as Aetna who denied about 5.9% of all claims in the same time frame). In August 2012, Cigna fought and lost their argument in court that ABA therapy for autistic children is \\"experimental\\". The courts decided the therapy is a known treatment for autistic children, and Cigna‚Äôs arguments had no merit. As of 2011, Cigna was fighting to have this decision reversed. In November 2017, a lawsuit including Cigna as one of the defendants was filed. The lawsuit states that Cigna engaged in activity prohibited by the mail/wire fraud implications of RICO by paying members of the Infectious Diseases Society of America to develop clinical guidelines to not treat chronic Lyme disease. The plaintiffs are suing Cigna, along with the IDSA and other health- insurance companies for damages. The case has been assigned to United States Judge for the Eastern District of Texas Texarkana Division Robert Schroeder. Judge Schroeder granted a jury trial, and hearings have been scheduled for 2019. Accounting and investor relations On February 9, 2005, Cigna elected to adopt in the fourth quarter of 2004 fair value accounting for its stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and to restate prior periods. Public relations and lobbying The UK newspaper Guardian in their Esc and Ctrl videoblog about control of the Internet by corporations, documented an incident with Nataline Sarkisyan and the former vice president of Cigna talking about astroturfing, the practice of creating fake blogs by interested groups, e.g. health insurance companies, to push claims that are profitable for said company into media, e.g. dismissing universal health care. Cigna spent more than $4.4 million from 2005 to 2009 on lobbying to attain legislation that the company favors. This includes $720,000 spent in 2009 alone, when it had 20 lobbyists at five firms working on their behalf. In 2008, the head of Cigna's public relations, Wendell Potter, resigned, becoming a whistleblower who gave testimony in 2009 to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in favor of reform of the health care industry. Awards Cigna received gold in the 2009 Gartner & 1to1 Customer Experience Excellence Award. The awards are given to the companies that \\"most clearly demonstrate exemplary customer relationship strategy and an unrivaled level of excellence in delivering the customer experience\\". In January 2010, Cigna received the JD Power award for customer service for all of its call centers for the fourth time in a row.

Community and civic affairs and charitable giving In 2008, the Cigna Foundation contributed $2,533,535 to charitable activities that promote wellness. Since 1995, Cigna and its employees have contributed $22.3 million to the March of Dimes. In July 2010, Cigna began giving each company employee eight hours of paid time off annually to volunteer with non-profit health and community service organizations. The Salvation Army of Greater Philadelphia helped kick off the program in front of Cigna's Philadelphia headquarters with the Christmas in July campaign. Strategic alliances On April 16, 2010, Cigna announced an alliance with Humana group to offer a streamlined Medicare Advantage offering through employer clients for retirees. In November 2011, Cigna and TTK Group, an Indian business conglomerate focused on healthcare, formed a joint venture called Cigna TTK to develop a health insurance business in India subject to obtaining government approvals.

It made The New York Times Best Seller List upon its release in 1985. History The book was released in 1985 after the publication of the first hardcover Bachman novel Thinner in order to introduce Bachman to fans who did not know about King's work under this pseudonym (little of which was still in circulation at the time). This omnibus also collected these early novels in hardcover for the first time, as they were all originally published in paperback. It opens with an introduction by King called \\"Why I Was Bachman\\", explaining how and why he took on the persona of Richard Bachman, as well as how it was found out by the public. Another version with a new introduction \\"The Importance of Being Bachman\\" was published in 1996 to coincide with the release of a new Bachman novel The Regulators.

He was born at Uigg on the island to Roderick McLeod and Flora McDonald, Baptist immigrants from the Isle of Skye in Scotland. He was educated at the Uigg Grammar School and in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, articled in law at Charlottetown and was called to the bar in 1873. Four years later, his marriage to Isabella Jane Adelia Hayden, the Methodist granddaughter to Irish Roman Catholic immigrant and merchant John Roach Bourke, furthered Gaelic intersections among Islander cultural enclaves. McLeod was the child of immigrants from the Isle of Skye. In that context, historians continue to research his positions on the 1877 Public Schools Act, the 1882 replacement of French-language texts with bilingual readers for French Acadians, late nineteenth-century prohibitions on Canadian Gaelic, and corporal punishment in Prince Edward Island schools. During this period, McLeod practiced law with partner Edward Jarvis Hodgson before joining the McLeod, Morson, and McQuarrie law firm. He also served as Commissioner for the Poor House and as a \\"trustee\\" to the public Prince Edward Island Hospital for the Insane, which replaced the Lunatic Asylum following a Grand Jury inquest. He entered politics in 1879, winning a seat in the provincial legislature as a Conservative. He was re-elected in 1882 and became secretary- treasurer and then minister without portfolio in the government of William Wilfred Sullivan after the resignation of the Davies government. During his electoral campaigns, McLeod garnered endorsements from labor organizations by promoting a Mechanics‚Äô Lien Bill, which passed in the legislature, along with an indigent debtors bill and regulations that circumscribed punitive measures for debt. In 1889, Sullivan resigned to become Chief Justice of the province's Supreme Court and McLeod became party leader and Premier. He supported construction of a mainland tunnel and liquor licensing laws after the defeat of provincial temperance legislation. His government, a majority by only one delegate, faced three by-election losses in 1891 after three members resigned to pursue seats in the House of Commons of Canada. On April 17, 1891, McLeod's Cabinet (Executive Council) requested dissolution in order to facilitate deliberations over deficit spending and what became known as legislative \\"amalgamation.\\" Despite a refusal by Lieutenant Governor Jedediah Slason Carvell, reports of a pending Motion of No Confidence five days later compelled McLeod to tender his resignation by telephone prior to the next legislature session. He thereafter carried the dubious distinction of being the first elected official in the Canadian Confederation, and what would become the Commonwealth of Nations, to resign a government with a phone call. From 1891 to 1893, he became Leader of the Opposition in Prince Edward Island's House of Assembly. The Liberal Party continued to denounce Conservative deficits, merchant metropolitics (they did not denounce a cosmopolis), attempts to construct a mainland tunnel, real estate transactions --including those indirectly associated with indigenous reserve systems--and preferences for Confederation \\"dominion\\" in United States trade treaties rather than Prince Edward Island fiscal reciprocity with the U.S. federal government. The revived idea of provincial reciprocity, distinguished from Canadian \\"dominion\\" reciprocity by Harrison Administration construction of Article 33 in the 1871 Treaty of Washington, contributed to debates in the House of Assembly between 1889-93. These conflicts began with U.S. Senate Republicans' 1885 abrogation of fishery articles in the Treaty of Washington, U.S. Senate Republicans' rejection of the 1888 Bayard-Chamberlain Treaty (after passage of the Retaliation Act), and the 1888 U.S. Presidential Election. The 1890-93 appointment of Massachusetts Republican and fishing magnate Isaac C. Hall as U.S. Consul to Prince Edward Island exacerbated tensions within the legislature. McLeod held that any proposal for \\"provincial reciprocity\\" would pressure the \\"Dominion Government to go on their marrow bones to the American Republic and ask them for better trade relations...it would show the Americans that we were in some dire distress, and without some assistance from them in the shape of trade relations, we were at their mercy. I think that when an important case, such as the question of trade relations with the United States is pending, the local Legislature should remain quiet, and let the Dominion Government carry the burden.\\" These challenges against \\"provincial reciprocity\\" did not preclude Conservative advocacy for U.S. trade treaties by \\"Dominion reciprocity\\" with \\"provincial\\" support. For example, when a Liberal delegate accused Conservatives of attempting to \\"press upon the Dominion Government to get a treaty with the United States,\\" McLeod countered that \\"when the Dominion Government want[s] to undertake some great measure, such as a treaty with the United States, he [the Liberal delegate] knows that instead of being weakened by the assistance of Local Parliaments, they will be strengthened by that assistance. I do not mean to say that we ought to raise any factious difficulties or anything of that kind, but we should in any and every way show the Dominion Government that when they have a really bona-fide measure to propose, we are in unison with them.\\" Conservative appraisals of \\"provincial reciprocity\\" as a question of legislative sovereignty, rather than solely international commerce and political economy, became crucial for the Great Rapprochement and burgeoning New England tourism in the unicameral period. As Leader of the Opposition, McLeod's dialectics engaged scathing Liberal critique with Conservative proposals for progressive \\"amalgamation\\" of the lower house and Legislative Council. This opposition inaugurated a critical period in Prince Edward Island history, as passive and active Islander partisans narrated as well as contested origins for the idea of legislative \\"amalgamation.\\" These debates adumbrated the fall and rise of competing notions of unicameralism across Island publics and, ultimately, a Legislative Assembly. Gilbert Buote, for instance, propounded \\"amalgamation\\" consensus in a French Acadian community of \\"relatively few\\" riven by \\"Liberal and Conservative\\" factionalism. These remonstrances precipitated the June 1893 founding of L'Impartial, a newspaper featuring the masthead motto \\"unity is strength\\" for the \\"small Acadian population of the Island.\\" \\"African\\" men and women did not appear in voting records and only between 165-181 identified as such in the 1881 census (with a precipitous decline in the 1891 census), ensuring that the obfuscation of \\"mixed\\" offspring, the biopolitics of hyperdescent, and persistent (as well as resilient) passive citizenship all heralded unicameral ideas. McLeod himself periodically recounted the origins of \\"amalgamation\\" as a prelude to universal manhood suffrage, even as single women in Charlottetown and Summerside voted in their first (1888-92) municipal elections. He introduced one example of this category of \\"amalgamation\\" narrative during an impromptu, and quite heated, debate over a Liberal Party proposal in the 1892-93 House of Assembly: > \\"In 1879, no sooner were we [Conservatives] elected than we introduced a > Bill for the abolition of the Legislative Council and it received much > support, but owing to the other end of the Legislature and the [Liberal] > Opposition here, it failed to become law. We again introduced a Bill in 1880 > for the purpose of abolishing the Council and that Bill met with the same > fate...in 1881 we had a Bill for the abolition of the Council, in 1882 > nearly the same form of Bill. Some changes were made in one year for the > purpose of making it more palatable to the other end of the building, but > they were bound not to pass the Bill. The then [Liberal] Opposition did not > desire us to get the credit of passing a bill of such importance as the > Leader of the Government considers this. I admit that it is an important > Bill, and a Bill of this nature should have been the law of the Province for > years, but I regret to see the qualification so high. This is a retrograde > movement. The tendency everywhere is to make the franchise as liberal as > possible...are we not able to conduct our small affairs without > disfranchising so many of the citizens of this country as we will do under > the proposed resolution? Who are we disfranchising? Simply the most > intelligent portion of the whole community--the farmers' sons. It is all > very well to protect the rights of farmers, but I believe also in protecting > the rights of sons...we should fall in with the general policy of all the > provinces of the Dominion, and of all civilized countries on the face of the > globe, and be liberal in matter of the franchise instead of restricting > it...Later on we may have to offer some suggestions with regard to the > qualification required by members composing the new House of Assembly. But I > think the Legislative Council should have been recognized more than they > have been, and the new House should have some name other than House of > Assembly. They might at least have satisfied them with some pretence of > amalgamation, instead of totally extinguishing them. But it is 'their own > funeral,' and I hope they will agree to it.\\" McLeod retired from politics in 1893, was appointed Prince County court judge, and briefly invested in a silver fox ranch during the first decade of the twentieth century. He died at Summerside in 1915. According to his 1915 Summerside obituary, \\"besides an extremely wide circle of friends and admirers there are left to mourn, a widow, one son, Arthur, now in Florida, and six daughters, all of whom reside in the West, excepting Miss Marie, who was one of the nurses at the front in France and is now home on leave of absence.\\" Summerside newspapers continued to report on the whereabouts of his children, particularly after the \\"marriage in California of Mary Rogers McLeod, daughter of the late Judge McLeod, to John Cecil Holmes of Victoria, B.C.\\"  References  *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online 1842 births 1915 deaths People from Queens County, Prince Edward Island Canadian Baptists Premiers of Prince Edward Island Canadian people of Scottish descent Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island MLAs Judges in Prince Edward Island Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island leaders ","title":"Neil McLeod (politician)"},{"id":"597370","text":"Ibbit-Lim was the earliest known ruler of the Third kingdom of Ebla, in modern Syria, reigning most likely shortly before 1950 BCE.Matthiae (2010), p. 214 Reign Ibbit-Lim is only known by a fragmentary basalt torso found in 1968 at Tell Mardikh and now in Aleppo, which was part of a votive statue for Ishtar, once placed in this goddess' temple in the acropolis of Ebla.Matthiae (2010), p. 281 A cuneiform inscription on it bears the name of the meki (king) of Ebla Ibbit-Lim, son of Igrish-Kheb, and claims that the statue was made \\"eight years after Ishtar's apparition in Ebla\\".

It is a tablet containing a mixture of 325 mg (5 grains) of aspirin and 4.8355 mg of oxycodone HCl (equivalent to 4.3346 mg of oxycodone as the free base); it is an opioid/non-opioid combination used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. The safety of the combination during pregnancy has not been established, although aspirin is generally contraindicated during pregnancy, and the drug has been placed in pregnancy category D. Inactive ingredients include D&C; Yellow 10, FD&C; Yellow 6, microcrystalline cellulose, and corn starch. Percodan was first marketed by DuPont Pharmaceuticals and prescribed in the United States in 1950. Once a widely prescribed painkiller, it has largely been replaced by alternative oxycodone compounds containing paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of aspirin, such as Percocet.  Adverse effects  Pharmacology The oxycodone component in the combination is technically 14-hydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodein-6-one, a white odorless, crystalline powder which is synthesized from the opium alkaloid thebaine. Thebaine by itself has no therapeutic value. Oxycodone is metabolized into oxymorphone. Unlike morphine and like codeine, oxycodone has a good oral potency. Prior to the introduction of paracetamol, Percodan was the mainstay in post-operative oral pain treatment due to the potency and long half-life of oxycodone. It originally contained a small amount of caffeine. Reformulation Percodan was reformulated in 2005; prior to 2005, it contained two oxycodone salts‚Äî4.62 mg of oxycodone hydrochloride and 0.38 mg of oxycodone terephthalate. Since the latter salt is unusual in the pharmacopeia, the manufacturer increased the amount of oxycodone hydrochloride to 4.8355 mg and discontinued the oxycodone terephthalate. Decline of use Percodan has largely been replaced by Percocet (which is oxycodone combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of Percodan's aspirin) and other oxycodone-containing compounds for post- operative pain. Aspirin increases prothrombin time and can result in post- operative complications, such as excessive bleeding. Hydrocodone with paracetamol has also gained favor. Hydrocodone, almost as potent as oxycodone, in combined form previously allowed refills. In the United States, Percodan is regulated as a Schedule II controlled substance under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of 1970. As of October 6, 2014, Percodan is becoming something of a relic in the United States, at least, as the number of prescriptions has fallen precipitously since the 1960s in light of the alternate drugs available containing oxycodone (Percocet, Tylox, OxyContin, Roxicodone). Miscellaneous The combination oxycodone/aspirin is also sold under the brand name Endodan. All products containing oxycodone (including Percodan, Percocet, OxyContin) have the potential to be habit-forming. Oxycodone can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and, therefore, has the potential for being addictive.

The daily news program was accompanied by commercial advertising for marketing in schools, with supplementary educational resources. The Peabody and Telly Award-winning Channel One News program was broadcast to millions of young people in upper elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools across the United States. On May 13, 2014, it was sold for an undisclosed price to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. On June 28, 2018 HMH announced that Channel One's last broadcast occurred in May and that they would be \\"winding down ongoing operations\\". History Channel One was founded in 1989 and began with a pilot program in four high schools before its national rollout in 1990, with original anchors and reporters Ken Rogers, Lynne Blades, and Brian Tochi. It was founded by Christopher Whittle, along with co-founder Ed Winter, advertising and marketing executives based in Knoxville, Tennessee. Primedia purchased Channel One for approximately $250 million from Whittle in 1994, with Ed Winter remaining as Chairman for several more years. The program's first executive producer, Cynthia Samuels, came to Channel One from 9 years on Today. While at Channel One she created Student Producer Week‚Äîduring which students produced, reported, directed, and designed an entire week of programming‚ÄîChannel One's one-hour specials including one in Moscow and Ohio, one in Tokyo and Texas, one in Los Angeles after the Rodney King riots hosted by Arsenio Hall and OneVote‚Äîan \\"election night\\" for students to vote for President and watch the returns come in live from their classrooms. After Cynthia Samuels came Douglas Greenlaw, former President of MTV, followed by David Neuman, former vice president of comedy at NBC. From 1997 until 2000, Andy Hill was president of programming for Channel One News, where he produced award-winning news programming for an audience of eight million American teens. In December 2007, Channel One's parent company, Primedia, classified its Education Segment, which includes Channel One Network, as a \\"discontinued operation\\" and announced that it was \\"exploring strategic alternatives for\\" the businesses in that segment. In 2007, Primedia sold Channel One to Alloy Media. In July 2007, NBC News announced that it would be partnering with Alloy under an arrangement in which NBC would work with Channel One News to produce original content for Channel One‚Äôs in-school broadcasts, providing Channel One with access to global news gathering resources. In 2009, CBS News entered into a partnership with Channel One. Alloy was bought by ZelnickMedia in 2010. On May 13, 2014, Channel One was acquired by the educational publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; the company stated that the purchase would foster the \\"continued development of high-quality digital content for students, teachers, and parents across multiple modalities, and will bring significant video and cross-media production capabilities in-house.\\" Business model The original model for Channel One had it providing schools and school districts with televisions, headend units, and satellite receivers. Schools would record the broadcast and transmit it into classrooms. Ads were displayed during the broadcast to cover the costs of the equipment. Starting in 1989, schools began to accept 2 minutes of advertisement. In 2011, the network began offering a subscription fee to receive an ad-free version of its transmissions. OneVote Channel One held mock presidential elections called OneVote shortly before the general elections in 1992, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. With the exception of the 2016 election, each OneVote election had accurately predicted the real presidential election. 1992: The initial vote in 1992 had 3,400,000 participants. Bill Clinton won the 1992 OneVote, garnering 43% of the vote. George H.W. Bush got 27%, with independent H. Ross Perot getting 24% of the vote. 2000: When OneVote returned in 2000, 877,497 students participated, choosing Texas Governor George W. Bush in a mock election with nearly 59% of the vote. Vice-President Al Gore was voted second with 36% of the vote. 2004: The 2004 OneVote gave George W. Bush 55% of the vote. John Kerry finished second with 40% of the vote, while all third-party candidates as a group (voters could only vote for them as a group) got 5%. The vote consisted of 1,400,000 students. 2008: The 2008 OneVote gave Barack Obama 51.5 percent of the vote. John McCain finished second with 48.5 percent. 2012: The 2012 OneVote gave Barack Obama 50 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney finished second with 44 percent. 2016: The 2016 OneVote gave Hillary Clinton 47 percent of the vote. Donald Trump finished second with 41 percent. Controversy Channel One was controversialCritic's Notebook; TV News in the Schools: Which Channel, if Any? largely due to the commercial content of the show. Critics claimed that it was a problem in classrooms because it forces children to watch ads, wastes class time, and wastes tax dollars. Supporters argued that the ads were necessary to help keep the program running and lease TVs, VCRs, and satellite dishes to schools, as well as commercial-free educational video through Channel One Connection. In 2006, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported that research indicated that children who watched Channel One remembered the commercials more than they remembered the news.NBC News to Provide Content for Channel One at The New York Times Another criticism, noted by Media Education Foundation's documentary Captive Audience, was that very little time is dedicated to actual news, and the majority of the programming is corporate marketing and PR tie-ins to promote products and services, arguing that it further corrupted the school setting with consumerism.

Early life and career Peters was born in Charlottetown and educated at King's College in Nova Scotia. Frederick's parents were Judge James Horsfield Peters (whose grandparents James Peters and Margaret Lester were United Empire Loyalists from New York) and Mary Cunard (eldest daughter of Sir Samuel Cunard). He went on to study law in England and was called to bar there in 1876. He was called to the bars of Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia later that year and set up practice in Charlottetown. Political career A Liberal, Peters won election to the House of Assembly in 1890. He was asked to form a government in 1891 after the Conservative government lost a motion of confidence in the house. The Peters government abolished both the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly and brought in a new legislative assembly to create a unicameral form of government. Peters served as Premier until resigning in 1897 to move to British Columbia though he retained his seat in the legislature until 1899 despite no longer residing in the province. Legal career in British Columbia Peters was Chief Counsel for the Great Britain in the Behring Sea Claims Commission, 1896‚Äì1897. His associate counsel was Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, who as Minister of Fisheries was involved in the earlier Bering Sea Arbitration between Great Britain and the United States. The commission held hearings in Victoria, British Columbia from November 23, 1896 to February 2, 1897.Record of evidence taken at Victoria, British Columbia by the commissioners: under the convention of February 8, 1896, between Great Britain and the United States https://archive.org/details/cihm_14457 This close working partnership, as well as the developing economic conditions on the west coast - particularly with the stampede to the Klondike Gold Rush - encouraged both men to resign their political and legal careers in the Maritimes and begin a joint legal practice in Victoria. Peters and Tupper arrived in Victoria on November 11, 1897.Victoria Daily Colonist, November 11, 1897 p. 5 By July 1898 they had opened two partnerships, Tupper, Peters and Potts in Victoria and Tupper, Peters and Gilmour in Vancouver.Victoria Daily Colonist, July 21, 1898 In 1911 Frederick Peters left his legal practice and moved north to become City Solicitor for the City of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. He arrived in the north coast town on May 17, 1911,Prince Rupert Daily News, May 17, 1911 when it was barely one year old (having been incorporated in March 1910). Peters' legal and political experience were important as he helped the community make the transition from a frontier company town to port city. He remained as City Solicitor until his death in 1919. Personal life Peters married Roberta Hamilton Susan Gray (daughter of P.E.I. Father of Confederation John Hamilton Gray) in Charlottetown in 1886. They had six children: Mary Helen Peters (1887‚Äì1976), Frederick Thornton Peters (1889‚Äì1942), John Francklyn Peters (1892‚Äì1915), Gerald Hamilton Peters (1894‚Äì1916), Noel Quintan Peters (1894‚Äì1964) and Violet Avis Peters (1899‚Äì1905).Genealogical information at http://trees.ancestry.ca/tree/7805322/person/257562556 Daughter Violet died in \\"a fireplace accident\\" at their home in Oak Bay, British Columbia in 1905.Frederic Peters She was buried in Ross Bay Cemetery. When Frederick Peters died in 1919, his remains were brought to Victoria and he was buried beside his daughter.

Two sons, John Francklyn Peters and Gerald Hamilton Peters, died in action in World War I. Another son, Frederick Thornton Peters, died in November 1942 five days after action in the Allied invasion of Oran for which he received the Victoria Cross and the U.S. Distinguished Service Cross. Frederick's brother, Arthur Peters, was also active in politics, serving as premier of Prince Edward Island from 1901 to 1908. His cousin Lt. Col.

He is the 200th Test cap for New Zealand. He was the captain of New Zealand between 2007 and 2011. Vettori is the eighth player in Test history to take 300 wickets and score 3,000 runs. He is the youngest player to have represented New Zealand in Test cricket, having made his debut in 1996‚Äì97 at the age of 18, and New Zealand's most-capped test cricketer with 112 caps, and New Zealand's most capped One- Day cricketer with 284 caps. Vettori was a bowling all-rounder who bowled slow left-arm orthodox spin. He is known for his accuracy, flight and guile rather than prodigious turn, and also his speed variation. Vettori announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket following the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Early career He was born in Auckland and brought up in Hamilton, attending Marian School and later St. Paul's Collegiate School, where he started off playing as a medium-pacer, but slowly transitioned into a spinner. He was among a very small minority of international sports stars to wear prescription spectacles while playing sport, and only one of very few cricketers in the modern era to play Test cricket with spectacles, others including Zimbabwean Charles Coventry, Australian Chris Rogers, and West Indian Clive Lloyd. Bowling records A graph showing Vettori's Test career bowling statistics and how they have varied over time He took his 300th Test wicket in Sri Lanka in 2009, becoming only the second New Zealand bowler (after Richard Hadlee) to pass that mark and he is currently New Zealand's leading ODI wicket-taker. Vettori has three 10 wicket hauls in Test cricket, against Sri Lanka, Australia, and Bangladesh. His best innings figures were achieved in Auckland in 1999‚Äì2000 against Australia where he took 7/87. He finished with career best match figures in that game, taking 12/149. They are the second-best ever by a New Zealander, with only Richard Hadlee having taken more in a match. With another 12 wicket effort, against Bangladesh in Chittagong, he became the only New Zealander to have taken a dozen wickets in a Test on two occasions. Vettori is the first left-arm spinner in cricket history to take 300+ wickets in both ODIs and Tests. He was also the first left-arm spinner in test history to capture 350 test wickets. He's now the second leading wicket-taker in test history as a left-arm spinner with a haul of 362 wickets just behind Rangana Herath. He's the youngest test cricketer to capture 100 test wickets at the age of 21. He is the bowler to have most frequently dismissed Shane Warne in Tests, getting him out nine times, most notably for 99 in a Test at Perth. Ironically, in the 1st Test against Pakistan in 2009‚Äì10 season, Vettori was himself dismissed for 99, while chasing a world record in centuries batting from position number 8. He is also the leading runscorer in test history when batting at number 8 position or lower (2227 runs) Daniel Vettori also has scored most number of test tons when batting at number 8 position(4) For his performances in 2005, 2008 and 2010 he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. He was also named in the World ODI XI and T20I XI by Cricinfo for 2007 and ODI XI for 2008. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2015 World Cup by the ICC. He was also named in the 'Team of the tournament' by Cricinfo and Cricbuzz. Captaincy Prior to becoming captain on a permanent basis in 2007, Vettori had captained the Black Caps in ODI cricket on occasions such as when regular captain Stephen Fleming was not available. As of the end of 2006, he had led New Zealand in 11 games, winning eight of them. He captained New Zealand at the inaugural Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa. Subsequently, it was announced that Vettori would captain the Black Caps in all forms of the game: Twenty20s, ODIs and Tests. Initially, he was announced to be captain only of the former two. His spell of 4 for 20 against India was named as the fourth-best T20I bowling performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo voters.http://www.espncricinfo.com/awards/content/story/334026.html He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by ESPNCricinfo for the 2007 T20I World Cup. Vettori's captaincy had a rocky start, starting by losing a Test series in England. Vettori also attracted some criticism in the following ODI series when he engaged in angry shouting from the balcony at The Oval, regarding a controversial run out that had occurred. He then refused to shake hands with the England team after the match. This contrasted with Fleming's more languid, laid back style. Vettori stood down from the captaincy and retired from One day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals after the 2011 World Cup. However, he was called back into the ODI team for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. His name is included in the final 15 of the New Zealand team for the 2015 Cricket World Cup to be held in Australia and New Zealand.Grant Elliott in, Jimmy Neesham out for New Zealand  Cricket. ESPNcricinfo (8 January 2015). Retrieved on 27 May 2018. By that point, he retired from test cricket after his final test match was as an emergency injury cover against Pakistan in November 2014. Batting Vettori matured into a useful lower-order batsman, having scored 4,000 Test runs, including six centuries (110 against Pakistan in 2011, 134 against Pakistan 2009, 140 against Sri Lanka 2009, 138* against Pakistan in 2003, 127 against Zimbabwe in 2005 and 118 against India in 2009) as well as 23 half-centuries. Although it took Vettori 47 Tests to score his first 1,000 runs at an average of 17.24, the second thousand took him just 22 Tests at a rate of 42.52 per innings. In December 2006, Vettori began establishing himself as more of an all-rounder, batting at number 5 for New Zealand in the one-day series against Sri Lanka. On 4 December 2009, despite the Black Caps only scoring 99 runs against Pakistan, Vettori became the highest Test run scorer batting at no.8 spot, a record previously held by Shane Warne. After suffering a dip in form of batting in 2010 Vettori scored a century against Pakistan when he made 110 as New Zealand's lower order resisted to help post a total of 356 all out.New Zealand v Pakistan: Daniel Vettori dazzles with ton on batsmen's day  Cricket. ESPNcricinfo (16 January 2011). Retrieved on 27 May 2018. Vettori averages a career 30.60 but his average jumps to 57.9 against Pakistan against whom he has three of his six centuries. In July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord's. Coaching career He was head coach for Royal Challengers Bangalore from 2014 to 2018. In July 2019, Vettori was appointed as the head coach of the Dublin Chiefs for the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. Bangladesh Cricket Board have announced the appointment of Daniel Vettori as their spin bowling coach, on 27 July 2019. Personal life Vettori is of Italian origin. He is married to Mary O'Carroll (2007), with whom he has three children. He moved from Hamilton to Auckland to live with her but has continued playing for the Northern Districts Knights. They have a son named James (born 8 March 2009). Vettori was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to cricket.

History Bar-Lev Line Haim Bar Lev, seated center, 17th October 1973 Budapest fortress January 1973 The Bar Lev Line evolved from a group of rudimentary fortifications placed along the canal line. In response to Egyptian artillery bombardments during the War of Attrition, Israel developed the fortifications into an elaborate defense system spanning along Suez Canal, with the exception of the Great Bitter Lake (where a canal crossing was unlikely due to the width of the lake). The Bar Lev Line was designed to defend against any major Egyptian assault across the canal, and was expected to function as a \\"graveyard for Egyptian troops\\".Dr. George W. Gawrych, The 1973 Arab-Israeli War: The Albatross of Decisive Victory pp. 16‚Äì18Simon Dunstan, The Yom Kippur War: The Arab-Israeli War of 1973 pp. 8, 9‚Äì11 The line, costing around $300 million in 1973, was named after Israeli Chief of Staff Haim Bar-Lev. The line was built at the Suez Canal, a unique water barrier that Moshe Dayan described as \\"one of the best anti-tank ditches in the world.\\" The line incorporated a massive, continuous sand wall lining the entire canal, and was supported by a concrete wall. The sand wall, which varied in height from , was inclined at an angle of 45‚Äì65 degrees. The sand wall and its concrete support prevented any armored or amphibious units from landing on the east bank of the Suez Canal without prior engineering preparations. Israeli planners estimated it would take at least 24 hours, probably a full 48 hours for the Egyptians to breach the sand wall and establish a bridge across the canal. Immediately behind this sand wall was the front line of Israeli fortifications. After the War of Attrition, there were 22 forts, which incorporated 35 strongpoints. The forts were designed to be manned by a platoon. The strongpoints, which were built several stories into the sand, were on average situated less than from each other, but at likely crossing points they were less than apart. The strongpoints incorporated trenches, minefields, barbed wire and a sand embankment. Major strongpoints had up to 26 bunkers with medium and heavy machineguns, 24 troop shelters, six mortar positions, four bunkers housing anti-aircraft weapons, and three firing positions for tanks. The strongpoints were surrounded by nearly fifteen circles of barbed wire and minefields to a depth of . A strongpoint's perimeter averaged . The bunkers and shelters provided protection against anything less than a 500 kg bomb, and offered luxuries to the defenders such as air conditioning. Between behind the canal, there were prepared firing positions designed to be occupied by tanks assigned to the support of the strongpoints. Some of the names of the strongpoints were Tasa, Maftzach, Milano, Mezach, Chizayon, Mifreket, Orcal, Budapest (the largest), Nisan, Lituf, Chashiva. In addition, there were eleven strongholds located behind the canal, which were built along sandy hills. Each stronghold was designed to hold a company of troops. To take advantage of the water obstacle, the Israelis installed an underwater pipe system to pump flammable crude oil into the Suez Canal, thereby creating a sheet of flame. Some Israeli sources claim the system was unreliable and only a few of the taps were operational. Nevertheless, the Egyptians took this threat seriously and, on the eve of the war, during the late evening of 5 October, teams of Egyptian frogmen blocked the underwater openings with concrete. Defensive plans Israeli flag flown at Bar Lev Line Fort Budapest throughout the Yom Kippur War To support the Bar Lev Line, Israel built a well-planned and elaborate system of roads. Three main roads ran north‚Äìsouth. The first was the Lexicon Road (Infantry Road), running along the canal, which allowed the Israelis to move between the fortifications and conduct patrols. The second was the Artillery Road, around from the canal. Its name came from the twenty artillery and air defense positions located on it: it also linked armored concentration areas and logistical bases. The Lateral Road (Supply Road), from the canal, was meant to allow the concentration of Israeli operational reserves which, in case of an Egyptian offensive, would counterattack the main Egyptian assault. A number of other roads running east to west, Quantara Road, Hemingway Road, and Jerusalem Road, were designed to facilitate the movement of Israeli troops towards the canal. The defense of the Sinai depended upon two plans, Dovecote (◊©◊Å◊ï÷π◊ë÷∏◊ö÷∞ ◊ô◊ï÷π◊†÷¥◊ô◊ù/Shovakh Yonim) and Rock (◊°÷∂◊ú÷∑◊¢/Sela). In both plans, the Israeli General Staff expected the Bar-Lev Line to serve as a \\"stop line\\" or kav atzira‚Äîa defensive line that had to be held at all cost. As noted by an Israeli colonel shortly after the War of Attrition, \\"The line was created to provide military answers to two basic needs: first, to prevent the possibility of a major Egyptian assault on Sinai with the consequent creation of a bridgehead which could lead to all-out war; and, second, to reduce as much as possible the casualties among the defending troops.\\" Maps showing the Egyptian offensive and the Israeli counter-offensive on the Suez front. The Bar Lev Line forts are marked on the first map. Israeli planning was based on a 48-hour advance warning by intelligence services of an impending Egyptian attack. During these 48 hours, the Israeli Air Force would assault enemy air defense systems, while Israeli forces deployed as planned. The Israelis expected an Egyptian attack would be defeated by armored brigades supported by the superior Israeli Air Force. Dovecote tasked a regular armored division to the defense of the Sinai. The division was supported by an additional tank battalion, twelve infantry companies and seventeen artillery batteries. This gave a total of over 300 tanks, 70 artillery guns, and 18,000 troops. These forces, which represented the Sinai garrison, were tasked with the mission of defeating an Egyptian crossing at or near the canal line. It called for around 800 soldiers to man the forward fortifications on the canal line. Meanwhile, along Artillery Road, a brigade of 110 tanks was stationed with the objective of advancing and occupying the firing positions and tanks ramparts along the canal in case of an Egyptian attack. There were two additional armored brigades, one to reinforce the forward brigade, and the other to counterattack the main Egyptian attack. Should the regular armored division prove incapable of repulsing an Egyptian attack, the Israeli army would activate Rock, mobilizing two reserve armored divisions with support elements; implementation of Rock signified a major war. Criticism Generals Ariel Sharon and Israel Tal objected to the line and argued that it would not succeed in fending off Egyptian attackers.Uri Dan, Ariel Sharon: An Intimate Portrait. Michel Lafon Publishing, 2006. Page 50 Sharon said that it would pin down large military formations, which would be sitting ducks for deadly artillery attacks,Ariel Sharon, Warrior. Simon & Schuster, 1989. Page 236 but the line was completed in spring 1970. Breach Egyptian forces crossing the Suez Canal During the Yom Kippur War, the Egyptian army, led by Chief of staff Saad El Shazly, overran the Bar Lev Line in less than two hours due to the element of surprise and overwhelming firepower. To deal with the massive earthen ramparts, the Egyptians used water cannons fashioned from hoses attached to dredging pumps in the canal. Other methods involving explosives, artillery, and bulldozers were too costly in time and required nearly ideal working conditions. In 1971, a young Egyptian officer, Baki Zaki Yousef, suggested a small, light, petrol- fueled pump as the answer to the crossing dilemma. The Egyptian military purchased 300 British-made pumps, five of which could blast 1,500 cubic meters of sand in three hours. In 1972, it acquired 150 more powerful German pumps driven by small gas turbines. A combination of two German or three British pumps would cut the breaching time down to two hours. These cannons pumped out powerful jets of water, creating 81 breaches in the line and removing three million cubic metres of packed dirt on the first day of the war. The Egyptians assaulted the Bar-Lev Line with two field armies and forces from Port Sa'id and the Red Sea Military District. The Second Field Army covered the area from north of Qantara to south of Deversoir, while the Third Field Army was responsible for the area from Bitter Lakes to south of Port Tawfiq. Egyptian vehicles crossing the Suez Canal in the Sinai The Egyptians began their simultaneous air and artillery attacks by flying 250 Egyptian planes, MiG-21s, MiG-19s, and MiG-17s, attacking their assigned targets accurately in Sinai. Meanwhile, 2,000 artillery pieces opened massive fire against all the strong points along the Bar-Lev Line, a barrage that lasted 53 minutes and dropped 10,500 shells in the first minute alone, or 175 shells per second. Within the first hour of the war, the Egyptian engineering corps tackled the sand barrier. Seventy engineer groups, each one responsible for opening a single passage, worked from wooden boats. With hoses attached to water pumps, they began attacking the sand obstacle. Many breaches occurred within two to three hours of the onset of operations‚Äîaccording to schedule; however, engineers at several places experienced unexpected problems. The sand from the breached openings in the barrier was reduced to mud, which was one meter deep in some areas. This problem required that the engineers emplace floors of wood, rails, stone, sandbags, steel plates, or metal nets for the passage of heavy vehicles. The Third Army, in particular, had difficulty in its sector. There, the clay proved resistant to high-water pressure and, consequently, the engineers experienced delays in their breaching. Engineers in the Second Army completed the erection of their bridges and ferries within nine hours, whereas the Third Army needed more than sixteen hours.General Saad el-Shazly, 'The Crossing of Suez - The October War (1973). Third World Centre for Research and Publishing. London, 1980. Particularly pages 149‚Äì170. A detailed account of the crossing. In his book The Yom Kippur War: The Epic Encounter That Transformed the Middle East, historian Abraham Rabinovich posits that the Bar- Lev line was a blunder‚Äîtoo lightly manned to be an effective defensive line and too heavily manned to be an expendable tripwire. Moreover, it can be argued that the concept of the line was counter-intuitive to the strengths of Israeli battle tactics, which, at their core, relied on agile mobile forces moving rapidly through the battlefield rather than utilizing a heavy reliance on fixed defenses.

He was the second Umayyad Caliph of C√≥rdoba in Al-Andalus, and son of Abd-ar-Rahman III and Murjan. He ruled from 961 to 976. Early rule Dinar of al-Hakam II c. 969 AD Dirham of Emir al-Hakam II Al-Hakam II succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd-ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the Catholic kingdoms of northern Iberia, and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works. Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets. Patron of knowledge Hakam himself was very well versed in numerous sciences. He would have books purchased from Damascus, Baghdad, Constantinople, Cairo, Mecca, Medina, Kufa, and Basra. His status as a patron of knowledge brought him fame across the Muslim world to the point that even books written in Persia, which was under Abbasid control, were dedicated to him. During his reign, a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic. He formed a joint committee of Muladi Muslims and Mozarab Catholics for this task. His personal library was of enormous proportions. Some accounts speak of him having more than 600,000 books. However, Hitchcock (2014: 91-92) argues that any number in excess of 600 is \\"inconceivable\\". The catalogue of library books itself was claimed to be 44 volumes long. According to Hitchcock (ibid.), this may be because \\"volume\\" and \\"page\\" were confused. Of special importance to Al-Hakam was history, and he himself wrote a history of al- Andalus. Following his death, Hajib Almanzor had all \\"ancient science\\" books destroyed.Ann Christy, Christians in Al-Andalus:711-1000, (Curzon Press, 2002), 142. The mathematician Lubna of C√≥rdoba was employed as Al-Hakam's private secretary. She was said to be \\"thoroughly versed in the exact sciences; her talents were equal to the solution of the most complex geometrical and algebraic problems\\". The famous physician, scientist, and surgeon Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) was also active in Al-Hakam's court during his reign. Construction projects Medina Azahara, completed by Al-Hakam II His building works included an expansion of the main mosque of C√≥rdoba (962‚Äì966), the Mezquita, and the completion of the royal residence Medina Azahara (976), which his father had begun in 936. Military conflict in North Africa Whilst the internal administration was left increasingly to vizir Al-Mushafi, general GhƒÅlib ibn  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn was gradually gaining influence as leader of the army in North Africa. He was chiefly preoccupied with repulsing the last Norman attacks (c. 970), and with the struggle against the Zirids and the Fatimids in northern Morocco. The Fatimids were defeated in Morocco in 974, while Al-Hakam II was able to maintain the supremacy of the caliphate over the Catholic states of Navarre, Castile and Le√≥n. Personal life Al-Hakam married Subh of Cordoba, a Basque concubine. She held sway and strong influence over the court. It is said that al-Hakam nicknamed her with the masculine name Ja'far. She bore him two sons, the first is Abd al-Rahman, who died young, and the second is Hisham II. According to √â. L√©vi-Proven√ßal, the phrase ·∏§ubb al-walad, as found in al-Maqqari's Naf·∏• al-·π≠ayyib,Al-Makkari, Analectes sur l'histoire et la litt√©rature des Arabes d'Espagne, vol.2, p.59) is a reference to al-Hakam's homosexuality or \\"preference for boys\\". However, several historians render it as \\"paternal love\\", referring instead to him choosing his young son as a successor. The fact that he did not produce a suitable heir before the age of 46 has been ascribed either to him being more attracted to men,√âvariste L√©vi-Proven√ßal, Histoire de l'Espagne musulmane, Paris, 1950\\\\--although this is only reported euphemistically in the sources,\\\\--or because he was too absorbed with his books to care for sensual pleasures. Subh may have dressed as a ghulam or a young man to make herself more attractive to al-Hakam (adopting a short haircut and wearing trousers), although it is also possible she did this in order to gain better access to the male-dominated royal court.Ibtissam Bouachrine, Women and Islam, Lexington Books, 2014, pp. 5, 22 Death and succession Al-Hakam II suffered a stroke near the end of his life that curtailed his activities and may explain why he was unable to properly prepare his son for leadership.Al-Hakam II, Caliph of Cordoba, Marilyn Higbee Walker, Encyclopedia of Medieval Iberia, ed. Michael Gerli (New York: Routledge, 2003), 377. Modern scholars have speculated that, based on the historical descriptions of his death, it was another cerebrovascular stroke, possibly brought on by the cold weather, that claimed his life in October 976. He was succeeded by his son, Hisham II al-Mu'ayad, who was 11 years old at the time and was a nominal ruler under Almanzor.

Biography Al-Hakam was the second son of his father, his older brother having died at an early age. When he came to power, he was challenged by his uncles Sulayman and Abdallah, sons of his grandfather Abd ar-Rahman I. Abdallah took his two sons Ubayd Allah and Abd al-Malik to the court of Charlemagne in Aix-la-Chapelle to negotiate for aid. In the meantime Sulayman attacked Cordoba, but was defeated and driven back to M√©rida where he was captured and executed. Abdallah was pardoned, but was forced to stay in Valencia. Dirham issued under Al-Hakam I. Al-Hakam spent much of his reign suppressing rebellions in Toledo, Saragossa and M√©rida. The uprisings twice reached Cordoba. An attempt was made to dethrone Al-Hakam and replace him with his cousin Mohammed ibn al-Kasim, but the plot was discovered. On 16 November 806, 72 nobles and their attendants (accounts talk of 5,000) were massacred at a banquet, crucified and displayed along the banks of the river Guadalquivir. Such displays of cruelty were not unusual during this period, with the heads of rebel leaders or Christian foes killed in expeditions to the north being put on show at the gates of Cordoba. Following the rebellion in Cordoba, Al-Hakam established a personal bodyguard, the Al-Haras, led by the Visigothic leader of the Christians in Cordoba, the Comes (Count) Rabi, son of Theodulf, who also served as the Emir's tax collector. Rabi was later removed and executed by crucifixion for corruption. In 818 he crushed a rebellion led by clerics in the suburb of al-Ribad on the south bank of the Guadalquivir river. Some 300 notables were captured and crucified, while the rest of the inhabitants were exiled. Some moved to Alexandria in Egypt, some to Fez and Crete. Others joined the Levantine pirates.Nagendra Kr Singh, International encyclopaedia of Islamic dynasties, Anmol Publications PVT.

An increasingly used term for a journalism department, school or college is 'J-School'. Today, in many parts of the world it is usual for journalists to first complete university-level training which incorporates both technical skills such as research skills, interviewing technique and shorthand and academic studies in media theory, cultural studies and ethics.  Africa  In 2007 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) named what it terms the Potential Centres of Excellence in Journalism Training in Africa. After thorough research there were twelve journalism and media training institutions named on the list and they were not placed in any order. These twelve UNESCO Potential Centres of Excellence in Journalism Training in Africa are the Department of Journalism at the Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria in South Africa (TUT), Mass Communication Department at Makerere University in Uganda, School of Journalism and Media Studies at Rhodes University in Grahamstown in South Africa, Department of Mass Communication at the University of Lagos in Nigeria, School of Communication, Legal and Secretarial Studies at the Namibia Polytechnic, Mozambican School of Journalism in Mozambique, Centre d'√©tudes des sciences et techniques de l'information in Senegal, The School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Nairobi in Kenya, Department of Journalism at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa, Institut Sup√©rieur de l'Information et de la Communication in Morocco, School of Communication Studies at Walter Sisulu University in South Africa and Ecole Sup√©rieure de Sciences et Techniques de l'Information et de la Communication in Cameroon. UNESCO's list is not exhaustive, and new schools have been founded since the study was conducted. With the rise of Internet and social media in the past five years there has been increasing demand for journalism schools offering specialized training in the kinds of modern challenges journalists face in the rapidly changing online-media landscape. E-jicom Graduate School of Journalism and Communication in Dakar, Senegal is one such institution, offering specialized training combining stringent media ethics with the modern technological demands of online media.  Asia  The most populous continent is also the home to the world's largest democracy and its pace of growth and booming of economies has led to a proliferation of media enterprises. The rise of digital publishing has created newer opportunities for employment and self-employment in the field of journalism and mass communication. = India = Unlike the rest of the world, print media continues to grow and thrive in India with over 1,250 million people. With 892 TV channels (in 2016) and over 1,05,000 daily newspapers (in 2015), digital publishing has only added to the opportunities. Dozens of regional languages and English being the aspirational language, a large number of Indian media consumers are consuming media in multiple languages. The government of India established the \\"Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC)\\" in 1965, which has now 6 campuses across India. Dozens of universities and independent institutes provide education for shaping journalism, media and mass communication professionals.  Europe  = Central Europe = The International Media Center (Slovenia-Austria-Serbia), offers in cooperation with South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO) and South East and Central Europe PR Organisation (SECEPRO) several courses, including master programme. In Hungary, The Hungarian B√°lint Gy√∂rgy Academy of Journalism (previously known as Hungarian School of Journalism) runs under the aegis of the National Association of Hungarian Journalists (M√öOSZ). Before 1989, the Hungarian School of Journalism served as a highly selective post-graduate program for well-trained journalists in Hungary. Since 2003, the B√°lint Gy√∂rgy Academy of Journalism belongs to the accredited professional education system. = Denmark = In Denmark, the University of Southern Denmark established a journalism study programme in 1998 at the then founded Centre for Journalism, as did Roskilde University, following the political decision to break the Danish School of Journalism's monopoly on educating journalists in Denmark. The purpose was and is to increase the diversity of teaching and research within the field of journalism. Since its establishment, the Centre for Journalism has launched several innovative features within the field, including the by now renowned award for journalists, \\"The Journalistic Fellowship\\", and the introduction of a journalist's oath similar to the Hippocratic oath. Also, in terms of scientific publications it is the most productive journalism research department in Denmark (status: 2005).Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (in Danish) = Eastern Europe = In Russia, the MSU Faculty of Journalism is the leading journalism school and the world's largest school of journalism. The majority of textbooks on journalism in Russian were written by MSU scientists. In Minsk (Belarus), the Institute of Journalism of BSU is one of the leading scientific and educational centers in the sphere of Mass Media in the territory of the former soviet countries. It possesses a highly respected scientific and pedagogical standard and prepares professionals in mass media for work in Belarus and abroad. = France = In France, 14 schools are recognized by the profession at the national level. The Centre de Formation des Journalistes (CFJCFJ - Centre de Formation des Journalistes ) was founded in 1946 by two Resistance leaders, although √âcole sup√©rieure de journalisme de Lille had been founded earlier (1924). Other Parisian journalism schools are Ecole de journalisme de Sciences Po, CELSA, Institut fran√ßais de presse (IFP) and Institut Pratique du Journalisme (IPJ). In the different French regions : Ecole de journalisme de Toulouse (EjT), Institut du Journalisme de Bordeaux-Aquitaine (IJBA), Ecole de journalisme et de communication d'Aix-Marseille (EJCAM), Centre universitaire d'enseigne de journalisme (CUEJ) in Strasburg or Ecole de journalisme de Grenoble (EJDG). Founded in 1899, the Ecole Sup√©rieure de Journalisme in Paris, France is a claimant for the title of the first journalism school. = Germany = During the Third Reich, the Nazis established the Reichspresseschule (Imperial School of Press), in which journalists were taught to write what the National Socialist German Workers' Party wanted the German public to think. After the war, the first journalism school in Germany was founded in 1949 as Werner Friedmann Institute. 1961 the school's name was changed into Deutsche Journalistenschule (German school of journalism). In 1979, a new journalism school was created in Hamburg, later renamed after the founder of Stern magazine, Henri Nannen. = Spain = The top journalism school in Spain according to El Mundo newspaper is the University of Navarra. It is the oldest school of journalism in Spain and among the top 10 world universities of medium size according to the QS ranking. Many reputed and well-known journalists have studied at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, one of Madrid's most prestigious university. Princess Letizia of Spain studied journalism at this university, which is the main public university in the country. Other universities include Carlos III university, Pompeu Fabra University, Autonomous University of Barcelona and Pontifical University of Salamanca. =United Kingdom= Historically, in the United Kingdom entrants used first to complete a non-media-studies related degree course, giving maximum educational breadth, prior to taking a specialist postgraduate pre- entry course. However, this has changed in recent years with journalism training and education moving to higher educational institutions. There are now over 60 universities in the UK offering BA honours degrees in journalism. Postgraduate courses are more well-established, some of which are either recognised by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) or the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ). A Diploma of Journalism was established at London University in 1919, but university journalism education in Britain did not become a significant endeavour until the 1970s, with establishment of the University of Wales postgraduate program. Most training from the mid-20th century was run by the National Council for the Training of Journalists. The Department of Journalism Studies at the University of Sheffield is rated Number 1 in the UK by the Guardian (2019) for Journalism, Publishing & Public Relations, and number 1 in the UK by the Times/Sunday Times (2018) for Communication and Media Studies.https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/journalism/undergraduate/league-table- rankings The National Student Survey results for both 2009 and 2010 placed The University of Sheffield No. 1 in the UK for overall satisfaction with Journalism Studies. Of City University London's Journalism Department The Independent commented that City's postgraduate courses had \\"rightly accrued legendary status within the media.\\" Former Guardian editor Peter Preston wrote: \\"What's the passport to journalism? The dreaming spires of... City University\\". City's faculty includes Professors George Brock and Roy Greenslade. Alumni include Sophie Raworth of the BBC, Sky's Dermot Murnaghan and Channel 4 News Economics Editor Faisal Islam. Another well-established course is the highly regarded School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies at Cardiff University which was founded in 1970 by Tom Hopkinson. The course was also the UK's top-rated course by the National Council for the Training of Journalists for the academic year 2007/8.National Council for the Training of Journalists: Magnificent six journalism courses revealed The University of Kent's Centre for Journalism was established with Professor Tim Luckhurst as the first head. The Centre runs both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees that are accredited by the National Council for the Training of Journalists. and the Broadcast Journalism Training Council. The Centre offers guaranteed work placements with the KM Group. It was ranked best for undergraduate study of journalism in The Guardians University Guide for 2015,https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng- interactive/2014/jun/03/university-guide-2015-league-table-for-journalism- publishing-and-public-relations and in The Times Good University Guide 2016 in which it was ranked first for graduate employment prospects in journalism.http://www.centreforjournalism.co.uk/ One of Europe's longest established centres of journalism education is the department of Journalism, Media and Communication, University of Central Lancashire (also known as UCLan), which launched its first print journalism course in 1962 at the then Harris College, which later became part of the University of Central Lancashire. Of the school, a 2008 article in The Times observed that \\"it is acknowledged as one of the leading centres for the teaching of journalism in Britain\\". In 2010, the University won the Broadcast Journalism Training Council's award for general excellence. The School of Journalism at the University of Lincoln was formally opened by the journalist John Pilger in 2004. It provides programmes at all degree levels. Research in the School focuses on media ethics, international human rights, the coverage of US/UK warfare, and literary journalism, with 70% of the research output assessed in 2008 as 'internationally excellent' or 'world leading'. Teaching emphasizes the growing focus on the convergence of platforms in the media. Courses are accredited by the BJTC and the Periodicals Training Council (PTC).http://blogs.pressgazette.co.uk/wire/7142 and the School is 'Recognised for Excellence' by the European Journalism Training Association (EJTA). The Press Association offer a fast-track 17-week course in multimedia and print journalism (NCTJ). The short length and intensity of the course makes entry extremely competitive. It was previously owned by Trinity Mirror, and many national newspapers send trainees to take part in at least some PA training within a graduate scheme. Liverpool John Moores and Bournemouth have well- respected journalism courses. Kingston University, Bournemouth and Birmingham City have developed fully converged journalism courses without reference to separate production disciplines such as radio, newspaper or magazine journalism. Issues from a European perspective in evaluating journalism schools were discussed by the president of the European Journalism Training Association in an interview with Marianne Peters of this Association.Fejs The London School of Journalism (LSJ)London School of Journalism is an independent and highly acclaimed institution with well-recognised Postgraduate programs in Journalism and writing. It was founded in 1920 by Sir Max Pemberton. Kingston University also has a well-respected department of journalism. Founded in 2003 it has courses accredited by the NCTJ and PTC. The campus newspaper and magazine produced by its journalism students have won best student publication in the national Guardian Student Media Awards.  North America  = Canada = In Canada, A listing (unranked) of journalism schools has been assembled by Canadian-Universities.net.http://www.canadian- universities.net/Universities/Programs/Journalism.html Journalism schools are listed and classified on the \\"J-Schools & Programs\\" page of the Canadian Journalism Project.The Canadian Journalism Project The University of British Columbia Graduate School of Journalism is one of the few graduate-only journalism schools on the continent. = United States = In the United States the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC) applies nine standards in evaluating university programs: mission, governance and administration; curriculum and instruction; diversity and inclusiveness; full-time and part-time faculty; scholarship: research, creative and professional activity; student services; resources, facilities and equipment; professional and public service; and assessment of learning outcomes. The ACEJMCC has awarded accreditation to 109 university and college programs of study in journalism and mass communications, but does not attempt to rank the courses or programs. It accredits colleges, schools, departments or divisions. The listing of a unit as accredited indicates that the unit has been judged by ACEJMC to meet its standards. That judgment is rendered after a self-study prepared by the faculty and administration of the unit and an independent evaluation of the unit by educators and practitioners. The listing shows the bachelor's and professional master's degree programs that were examined during the unit's most recent accreditation review. Some units offer degrees in addition to those listed here. ACEJMC does not accredit programs leading to the PhD, which is considered a research (and not a professional) degree. The Council does not list sequences or specialties. University of Missouri is a claimant in the title for the first journalism school. There are only three graduate-only journalism schools in the United States: Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, and the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. Many universities have both graduate and undergraduate programs within dedicated professional schools. Two such examples are the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia and the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Editor & Publisher has presented an unranked list of leading journalism schools, while U.S. News & World Report produces annual lists of the top schools in advertising, print, and other categories based on responses to questionnaires sent to deans and faculty members. A list based on a variety of resources claims to identify the \\"ten most popular journalism schools in the United States\\". One critic has pointed to the anecdotal nature of much j-school ranking in the absence of effective tracking of journalism graduates' career paths.  Oceania  = Australia = In Australia, a ranking of journalism schools has been assembled based on graduating students' assessments of the quality of their courses. The ranking, based on student satisfaction ratings over four years, are Jschool Journalism College in Brisbane, University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, University of Western Sydney, Murdoch University in Western Australia and the University of Technology, Sydney. Figures indicated 100 percent satisfaction among students at Bond University and Jschool (both in Queensland), and 85 percent among students at the Universities of Canberra, Newcastle and the Sunshine Coast. Employment rates are mixed, with an estimated 20 percent of university journalism graduates achieving journalism positions in the media, although Jschool has a 63 percent employment rate. A list of journalism graduates in employment shows city-based technological universities with the highest numbers of graduates in media positions, including QUT in Brisbane, RMIT in Melbourne and UTS in Sydney. The biggest employers have been the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Channel Nine, Channel Seven, Sydney Morning Herald and Special Broadcasting Service, although there has been much downsizing of newsrooms since the figures were assembled. = New Zealand = The New Zealand Training Organisation has published a list of New Zealand's journalism schools recognised by industry. The New Zealand Institute of Business Studies has been teaching Freelance Journalism & Non-Fiction Writing for more than 20 years. Training is less 'academic-focused' and more 'income- earning' focused. Graduates are given a fortnightly list of journalism job vacancies.  South America  An evaluation of developments in journalism education in Latin America has been undertaken by Rosental Calmon Alves. = Colombia = In Colombia, the high court determined in 1998 that journalism was not a career. This court said that journalism is a human right, not a profession. Because of the ruling there are many schools of communications in Colombia where people study to work in mainly enterprises, but not in mass media. There are many schools of journalism, at undergraduate level the main ones being: University of Antioquia, a public institution in Medell√≠n, offers Journalism inside the Communications faculty, and University of Rosario in Bogot√°, a private institution, offers Public Opinion Journalism.,http://www.urosario.edu.co/FASE1/ciencias_humanas/pregrado_periodismo_opinion.htm and the Externado University, a private institution, offers a degree in Social Communication and Journalism. = Chile = In Chile, universities with journalism impart the profession as a full five-year degree. With a grade of \\"bachelor in social communications\\" and professional title of journalist, there currently exist more than 30 journalism schools in the country. The national system has an accrediting council that independently certifies the universities as a whole and each of the careers. Nevertheless, only a few are accredited. The top schools in the country are the Faculty of Communications of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, accredited by US's ACEJMC, and the Institute of Communication and Image of the University of Chile, accredited by the National Accrediting Council (CNA). Outside Santiago, the top school is the School of Journalism of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso, also accredited by the CNA.  Debate about role  One of the most cited critiques of a journalism school was Michael Lewis's article in The New Republic (1993), \\"J-school ate my brain\\", which was strongly criticized by University of Maryland College of Journalism dean Reese Cleghorn in American Journalism Review. Discussion of the issues raised by Lewis was evident a decade later in the Chronicle of Higher Education colloquy on journalism education, Columbia Journalism Review's \\"Searching for the perfect j-school\\", and \\"The j-school debate\\" in the Christian Science Monitor. Alternative approaches to journalism education were suggested in Jack Shafer's Slate article \\"Can J-school be saved? Professional advice for Columbia University\\". An article in The Australian discusses \\"What makes a good school of journalism\\". On the internet, a range of weblogs have been set up by journalism students to chronicle or to criticize their journalism colleges. Examples are: \\"jschoolyear\\", \\"jschool05\\", \\"the pod\\" blogspot, \\"jschool\\" blog, Australia. An example of a weblog criticising university journalism education in Australia is \\"What's wrong with the school\\".\\"what's wrong with the school\\" One journalism school in the UK, at the University of Westminster,University of Westminster has established a clearing house where all students are expected to contribute to the development and content of their own education and training using blogs. Various commentaries on journalism education are related to criticisms of contemporary news media standards and values. One example is a paper by Jan Schaffer, executive director of J-Lab: the Institute for Interactive Journalism. A controversial paper to Australia's peak newspaper industry body PANPA (Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers Association) by Professor John Henningham (\\"Journalism sold short in media courses\\") blamed industry lack of interest and university cost-cutting for falling standards in journalism education.The Australian (Media section), 23 October 2003, republished at In Canada, Mark Anderson of the Ottawa Citizen has argued the case for teaching business journalism in college rather than on the job. Canadian journalism professor Rick MacLean has rejected criticism by Robert Fulford (\\"Just what is the point of j-school\\") that the best potential journalists will find their way into the media, while many existing j-school students show no interest in news or the media. MacLean argues that education in journalism helps empower members of the public to understand how media work.

An alcalde was, in the absence of a corregidor, the presiding officer of the Castilian cabildo (the municipal council) and judge of first instance of a town. Alcaldes were elected annually, without the right to reelection for two or three years, by the regidores (council members) of the municipal council. The office of the alcalde was signified by a staff of office, which they were to take with them when doing their business.The Osuna Codex depicts Viceroy Lu√≠s de Velasco granting the staffs of office to the alcaldes and alguaciles of the Mexica municipality of Mexico City.For a contemporary recording of an alcalde receiving the staff of office from the ayuntaminto, see The Installation of the new Ayuntamiento of Figueres. A woman who holds the office is termed an Alcaldesa. In New Spain (Mexico), alcaldes mayores were chief administrators in colonial-era administrative territories termed alcald√≠as mayores; in colonial-era Peru the units were called corregimientos.Mark A. Burkholder, \\"Alcalde Mayor\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 45. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Alcalde was also a title given to Indian officials inside the Spanish missions, who performed a large variety of duties for the Franciscan missionaries.  Medieval origins  The office of the alcalde evolved during the Reconquista as new lands were settled by the expanding kingdoms of Le√≥n and Castile. As fortified settlements in the area between the Douro and Tagus rivers became true urban centers, they gained, from their feudal lords or the kings of Leon and Castile, the right to have councils. Among the rights that these councils had was to elect a municipal judge (iudex in Latin and juez in Spanish). These judges were assisted in their duties by various assistant judges, called alcaldes, whose number depended on the number of parishes the town had.O'Callaghan, A History of Medieval Spain, 269-271. The title alcalde was borrowed from the Arabic al- qa·∏çi (ŸÇÿßÿ∂Ÿä), meaning \\"the judge.\\"The second L in alcalde evolved from the Castilian and Portuguese attempts at pronouncing the emphatic consonant ·∏çƒÅd. The old Portuguese cognate alcalde was never applied to the presiding municipal officer and retained its original meaning of \\"judge.\\" \\"Alcalde\\" in Corominas, Diccionario cr√≠tico, Vol. A-CA (1), 127. The word alcalde originally was used for simple judges, as in Andalusian Arabic. Only later was it applied to the presiding municipal magistrate.Corominas, \\"Alcalde\\", 127. This early use continued to be reflected in its other uses, such as alcaldes del crimen, the judges in the audiencias; Alcaldes de la Casa y Corte de Su Majestad, who formed the highest tribunal in Castile and also managed the royal court; alcaldes mayores, a synonym for corregidor; and alcaldes de barrio, who were roughly the equivalent of British parish constables. Because of this, the municipal alcalde was often referred to as an alcalde ordinario.  The classic cabildo, fifteenth to nineteenth centuries  By the end of the fourteenth century the definite form of the Castilian municipal council, the ayuntamiento or cabildo, had been established. The council was limited to a maximum of twenty-four members (regidores), who may be appointed for life by the crown, hold the office as an inherited possession or be elected by the citizens (vecinos) of the municipality. (Many cabildos had a mix of these different types of regidores.) The number of magistrates, now definitely called alcaldes, was limited to one or two, depending on the size of the city and who were elected annually by the regidores. To ensure control over cabildos, the Castilian monarchs often appointed a corregidor, who took over the role of the presiding officer of the council. The cabildo was taken to the Americas and Philippines by the Spanish conquistadors. Towns and villages in the Americas with the right to a council (villas and lugares in the Recopilaci√≥n de las Leyes de Indias, 1680) had one alcalde. Cities (ciudades) had two, which was the maximum number anywhere. Early in the conquest, adelantados had the right to appoint the alcaldes in the districts they settled, if they could attract the legally specified number of settlers to the area. This right could be inherited for one generation, after which the right of election returned to the municipal council.  Modern usage  In modern Spanish, the term alcalde is equivalent to a mayor, and is used to mean the local executive officer in municipalities throughout Spain and Latin America. For example, the title alcalde continued to be used in the Spanish-speaking American Commonwealth of Puerto Rico after the occupation of the island during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. In the autonomous Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla, however, the alcaldes-presidentes have greater powers than their peninsular colleagues. Because the United States incorporated parts of the former Viceroyalty of New Spain, the office had some influence in the local political and legal developments of those areas and is mentioned in judicial cases. This title continued to be in use in the Southwest United States after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War until a permanent political and judicial system could be established.For example, it was in use in San Francisco, as evidenced by Surocco v. Geary, Supreme Court of California, 3 Cal. 69, 58 Am.Dec. 385, \\"Geary, at that time Alcalde of San Francisco...\\" Alcaldes were notorious for their support for rule of law and opposition to vigilantes. In nineteenth- century California, Stephen Johnson Field, later an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, once served as the only alcalde of Marysville, California, a town established in 1850 during the Gold Rush by immigrants, who temporarily used the Spanish and Mexican form of municipal government. In Texas, the position of county judge was based on that of the alcalde which had existed in the state prior to the Texas Revolution. Like the alcaldes before them, county judges under the Texas Constitution wield both judicial and chief executive functions. Although in larger counties today the county judge usually functions solely as county chief executive, in smaller counties, the role of the county judge continues to have many of the combined judicial and administrative functions of the alcalde. The city of Sonoma, California has a tradition to name an honorary title of Alcalde/Alcaldesa, to preside over ceremonial events of the city, with \\"mayor\\" being the official position of city governor. In Belize, any rural community may appoint an alcalde. The alcalde serves both judicial and administrative functions and is paid a small stipend by the government. The alcalde is responsible for managing communal land, judging disputes, and determining punishment for petty crimes. This type of local government is most commonly used by Maya communities in southern Belize.

He played in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees for 19 seasons. Dickey managed the Yankees as a player-manager in 1946 in his last season as a player. Dickey played for the Yankees from 1928 through 1943. After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, Dickey returned to the Yankees in 1946 as a player and manager. He retired after the 1946 season, but returned in 1949 as a coach, where he taught Yogi Berra the finer points of catching. During Dickey's playing career, the Yankees went to the World Series nine times, winning eight championships. He was named to 11 All-Star Games. As a manager and coach, the Yankees won another six World Series titles. Dickey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954. Early life Dickey was born in Bastrop, Louisiana on June 6, 1907.The Miami News via Google News Archive Search He was one of seven children born to John and Laura Dickey. The Dickeys moved to Kensett, Arkansas, where John Dickey worked as a brakeman for Missouri Pacific Railroad. John Dickey had played baseball for a semi-professional team based in Memphis, Tennessee. Bill's older brother, Gus, was a second baseman and pitcher in the East Arkansas Semipro League, while his younger brother, George, would go on to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher. Dickey attended Searcy High School in Searcy, Arkansas. At Searcy, Dickey played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher and second baseman. He enrolled at Little Rock College, where he played guard for the school's American football team and pitcher for the baseball team. Dickey substituted for a friend on a semi-professional team based in Hot Springs, Arkansas as a catcher, impressing the team's manager with his throwing arm. Lena Blackburne, manager of the Little Rock Travelers, a minor league baseball team, noticed Dickey while scouting an outfielder on the Hot Springs team. Blackburne signed Dickey to play for his team. Minor league career Dickey made his professional debut at the age of 18 with the Little Rock Travelers of the Class A Southern Association in 1925. Little Rock had a working agreement with the Chicago White Sox of the American League, which involved sending players between Little Rock, the Muskogee Athletics of the Class C Western Association, and the Jackson Senators of the Class D Cotton States League. Dickey played in three games for Little Rock in 1925, then was assigned to Muskogee in 1926, where he had a .283 batting average in 61 games. Dickey returned to Little Rock, and batted .391 in 17 games at the end of the season. Dickey played in 101 games for Jackson in 1927, batting .297 with three home runs. As a fielder, Dickey compiled a .989 fielding percentage and was credited with 84 assists while he committed only nine errors. New York Yankees Jackson waived Dickey after the 1927 season. Johnny Nee, a scout for the New York Yankees, wired his boss, Ed Barrow, the Yankees' general manager, that the Yankees should claim him.Broeg, Bob (June 13, 1970), \\"Bill Dickey...A Yankee of Distinction\\", The Sporting News 169: 18 The Yankees purchased Dickey from Jackson for $12,500 ($ in current dollar terms). Though he suffered from influenza during spring training in 1928, Dickey impressed Yankees manager Miller Huggins. Dickey hit .300 in 60 games for Little Rock, receiving a promotion to the Buffalo Bisons of the Class AA International League. After appearing in three games for Buffalo, Dickey made his MLB debut with the Yankees on August 15, 1928. He recorded his first hit, a triple off George Blaeholder of the St. Louis Browns, on August 24.

All seven would eventually be elected to the Hall of Fame. Dickey played his first full season in MLB in . He replaced Benny Bengough as the Yankees' starting catcher, as Bengough experienced a recurrent shoulder injury, and Dickey outperformed Bengough and Johnny Grabowski. As a rookie, Dickey hit .324 with 10 home runs and 65 runs batted in (RBI). He led all catchers with 95 assists and 13 double plays. In 1930, Dickey hit .339. In 1931, Dickey made only three errors and batted .327 with 78 RBI. That year, he was named by The Sporting News to its All-Star Team. Although his offensive production was overshadowed by Yankee greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio,St. Petersburg Times via Google News Archive Search in the late 1930s Dickey posted some of the finest offensive seasons ever by a catcher, hitting over 20 home runs with 100 RBI in four consecutive seasons, from 1936 through 1939. His 1936 batting average of .362 was the highest single-season average ever recorded by a catcher, tied by Mike Piazza of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1997, until Joe Mauer of the Minnesota Twins hit .365 in 2009.Minnesota Twins: Joe Mauer takes Mike Piazza's comments in stride ‚Äì TwinCities.com In 1932, Dickey broke the jaw of Carl Reynolds with one punch in a game after they collided at home plate, and received a 30-day suspension and $1,000 fine as punishment.St. Petersburg Times via Google News Archive Search That year, he hit .310, with 15 home runs and 84 RBI. In the 1932 World Series, he batted 7-for-16, with three walks, 4 RBI, and scored two runs. In 1936, Dickey hit .362, finishing third in the AL behind Luke Appling (.388) and Earl Averill (.378).

The Yankees did fairly well under Dickey's watch, going 57‚Äì48. However, owner Larry MacPhail refused to give Dickey a new contract until after the season. Rather than face the possibility of being a lame-duck manager, Dickey resigned on September 12, but remained as a player.Google Books result: The Yankee Encyclopedia, p. 283 He retired after the season,Edmonton Journal Edmonton Bulletin via Google News Archive Search having compiled 202 home runs, 1,209 RBIs and a .313 batting average over his career.

Dickey returned to the Yankees in 1949 as first base coach and catching instructor to aid Yogi Berra in playing the position. Already a good hitter, Berra became an excellent defensive catcher. With Berra having inherited his uniform number 8, Dickey wore number 33 until the 1960 season. Dickey later instructed Elston Howard on catching, when Berra moved to the outfield. Film career While still an active player in 1942, Dickey appeared as himself in the film The Pride of the Yankees, which starred Gary Cooper as the Yankee captain and first baseman Lou Gehrig. Late in the movie, when Gehrig was fading due to the disease that would eventually take his life, a younger Yankee grumbled in the locker room, \\"the old man on first needs crutches to get around!\\"‚Äîand Dickey, following the script, belted the younger player, after which he said the kid \\"talked out of turn.\\" Dickey also appeared as himself in the film The Stratton Story in 1949. In the film, Dickey was scripted to take a called third strike from Jimmy Stewart's character. Dickey objected, stating \\"I never took a third strike. I always swung\\", and asking the director, Sam Wood, to allow him to swing through the third strike; Wood insisted that Dickey take the third strike. After many takes, Dickey commented: \\"I've struck out more times this morning than I did throughout my entire baseball career.\\"The Miami News via Google News Archive Search Personal life Baseball Hall of Fame On October 5, 1932, Dickey married Violet Arnold, a New York showgirl, at St. Mark's Church in Jackson Heights, New York.

The company mainly built and modified aircraft under contract to other manufacturers, but had a few notable designs of its own, such as the Defiant fighter and the Balliol trainer. The company's origins date back to an ironmonger's shop founded in 1797 in Norwich. By the early 1900s, Boulton & Paul Ltd was a successful general manufacturing firm with a construction engineering division. It began building aircraft under contract during the First World War before moving into designing and building its own aircraft. The aircraft building business was sold off - at a low point in the aviation market - from the main construction business in 1934 and then moved to Wolverhampton under its new name Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd in 1936 to take advantage of skilled local workforce and local government incentives. By 1961 Boulton Paul Aircraft was a manufacturer of aircraft equipment rather than aircraft, it merged with the Dowty Group .  History  Boulton & Paul started its construction engineering division in 1905.Brew, Alec. Boulton Paul Aircraft, Tempus, 2001. In 1915, Boulton & Paul began to construct aircraft under contract, including 550 of the Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2b. During the war the company built more Sopwith Camels than any other manufacturer. Success as an aircraft builder led the company to form a design department but none of its resulting aircraft made a significant impact while the war lasted. Boulton Paul's chief aircraft designer was John Dudley North (1893‚Äì1968), who joined the company from Austin Motor Company Aircraft Department. After World War I, Boulton & Paul made their mark with the introduction of powered and enclosed defensive machine gun turrets for bombers. Their Sidestrand twin-engined biplane bomber, which could fly at 140 mph, had an exposed nose turret which was clearly inadequate. The subsequent Overstrand bomber featured the world's first enclosed, power-operated turret, mounting a single Lewis gun and propelled by compressed air. The company licensed a French design of an electro-hydraulic four-gun turret which became a major feature of their future production. In addition to fitting turrets to bombers, Boulton Paul was to install them in fighters. Boulton Paul Defiant During this period Boulton & Paul continued to operate outside the aircraft industry as well. They manufactured equipment such as machine tools and stationary engines. The latter were also available coupled to a dynamo for powering electric lighting circuits, and were sold under the Electolite brand name. In 1934, Boulton & Paul sold their \\"Aircraft Department\\" which became Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd. Over the next couple of years a new factory site was built up in Wolverhampton. This gave access to a large skilled workforce on top of the 600 or so employees that left Norwich for Wolverhampton. Even so, Boulton Paul would later set up a training centre in Scotland to bring in extra workers. The first \\"turret\\" fighter to be built was the Hawker Demon. This was followed by Boulton Paul's most famous aircraft, the Defiant, which was a revolutionary but flawed concept specified by the Air Ministry ‚Äì a \\"fast\\" fighter with no fixed forward armament but a powerful four-gun dorsal turret. Turret fighters were expected to be able to engage enemy bombers from any aspect. The same concept was used for the Defiant's naval equivalent, the Blackburn Roc, which while a design by Blackburn, the detail design was done in BP's drawing office and the aircraft was built wholly by Boulton Paul. Badge worn by Boulton Paul staff during World War II Boulton Paul also built the Fairey Barracuda and did conversions of the Vickers Wellington. The only post-war design was the Balliol advanced trainer, of which 229 were built, including 30 as the Sea Balliol deck-landing trainer. In the jet age, Boulton Paul worked on the English Electric Canberra and de Havilland Vampire. It designed and built a couple of delta-wing jet-engined aircraft for research work and continued to tender designs for official requirements. In 1961 the company was acquired by Dowty Group and was renamed Dowty Boulton Paul Ltd and then Dowty Aerospace. Following the acquisition of Dowty Aerospace by TI Group in 1992, and the subsequent merger of Smiths Industries and the TI group in 2000, to form Smiths Group, the Wolverhampton factory site was sold again in May 2007 to GE Aviation Systems. Yet again in August 2009 the factory was sold to Moog Inc. but was to move to new premises at the nearby I54 business park. The factory also had an on-site Boulton Paul Museum dedicated to Boulton Paul aircraft and the traditional methods used to manufacture aircraft. The important collection was scheduled to move to Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Spring 2013.

Boulton Paul gun turrets  Boulton Paul was one of the two main innovators of gun turret designs for British aircraft, along with Nash & Thompson; they supplied large numbers of installations for British aircraft. Boulton Paul's designs were largely based on originals licensed from the French company SAMM (Societe d'Application des Machines Motrices), while Nash & Thompson concentrated on the FN designs originated by the firm's co-founder, Archibald Frazer-Nash. Boulton Paul's turrets were electro-hydraulic in operation; electric motors located in the turret drove hydraulic pumps that powered hydraulic motors and rams.

The estimated population in 2015 was 74,171. It is mainly an industrial centre (textile, metallurgy, clothes) with a strong influence of coffee plantation in its early history (19th century).  History  In the 1920s, the city was associated with the Brazilian cinema pioneer Humberto Mauro and a generation of writers for the short-lived Revista Verde. Humberto Mauro shot there some films that earned him a good reputation nationwide. He later made Braza Dormida (Sleeping Fire) and O Descobrimento do Brasil (The Finding of Brazil) and was a reputed Tupi language scholar. Industrialisation changed the town significantly and caused some of its citizens to become very rich in the 1920s and 1930s. As a result the city centre was remodeled accordingly to the ultimate architecture styles. The architect Oscar Niemeyer and painters C√¢ndido Portinari, Djanira and Emeric Marcier are some of the Brazilian artists who left contributions there at that time. After three decades of wealth, the town lost its prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. The economic crisis and the changes due to the modernisation of the industries provoked high unemployment rates and depreciation of salaries, reducing the town's wealth. In 2003 the town was the site of an ecological accident caused by the spilling of chemical waste that affected the brook C√°gado and the rivers Pomba and Para√≠ba do Sul, threatening the water supply of more than 20,000,000 Brazilians (including the state of Rio de Janeiro). Climate Cataguases experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw under K√∂ppen climate classification). Temperatures are high (above 18¬∞C (64.4¬∞F)) all over the year, and low temperatures lasting for a whole day are rare, and generally only occur in the dry season. The wet season starts in September and goes until May, while the dry season goes from May to September. Floods are not uncommon in the town, and generally there is one per year, in December, January or February. On the other side, during the dry season Rio Pomba has considerably less water than in other periods, and some people have respiratory diseases related to low air humidity. = Temperatures = References Municipalities in Minas Gerais ","title":"Cataguases"},{"id":"597473","text":"Aldan may refer to: ;People *Gille Aldan, the first bishop of Galloway, Scotland *Andrey Aldan-Semenov (1908‚Äì1985), Russian writer *Duke Aldan, a fictional character in Langrisser IV video game ;Places *Aldan, Russia, a town in the Sakha Republic, Russia *Aldan Urban Settlement, a municipal formation which the Town of Aldan and two rural localities in Aldansky District of the Sakha Republic, Russia are incorporated as *Aldan, Pennsylvania, a borough in Pennsylvania, United States *Aldan Highlands in the Sakha Republic, Russia *Aldan (river), a river in the Sakha Republic, Russia *Aldan Shield, a geological region in Siberia, Russia *Aldan Airport, an airport in the Sakha Republic, Russia *Aldan mine, an iron mine in the Sakha Republic, Russia See also *Alden (disambiguation) *Clifton‚ÄìAldan (SEPTA station), a SEPTA station in Clifton Heights, Pennsylvania, United States *Aldansky District, a district of the Sakha Republic, Russia ","title":"Aldan"},{"id":"597476","text":"Info is shorthand for \\"information\\".

He was an important representative of Czech music abroad in the second half of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Some of his more forward-looking piano works have traits often associated with Romanticism.Dus√≠k ( 1984), p. xxiii Dussek was one of the first piano virtuosos to travel widely throughout Europe. He performed at courts and concert venues from London to Saint Petersburg to Milan, and was celebrated for his technical prowess. During a nearly ten-year stay in London, he was instrumental in extending the size of the pianoforte, and was the recipient of one of John Broadwood's first 6-octave pianos, CC-c4. Harold Schonberg wrote that he was the first pianist to sit at the piano with his profile to the audience, earning him the appellation \\"le beau visage.\\" All subsequent pianists have sat on stage in this manner. He was one of the best-regarded pianists in Europe before Beethoven's rise to prominence. His music is marked by lyricism interrupted by sudden dynamic contrasts. As well as his many compositions for the piano, he also composed for the harp: his music for that instrument contains a great variety of figuration within a largely diatonic harmony, avoids dangerous chromatic passages and is eminently playable. His concerto writing is exciting. His music is considered standard repertoire for all harpists, particularly his Six Sonatas/Sonatinas and especially the Sonata in C minor. Less well known to the general public than that of his more renowned Classical period contemporaries, his piano music is highly valued by many teachers and not infrequently programmed. Franz Liszt has been called an indirect successor of Dussek in the composition and performance of virtuoso piano music. His music remained popular to some degree in 19th-century Great Britain and the USA, some still in print, with more available in period editions online. Life Memorial plaque in ƒå√°slav, his birthplace =Early years= The Dussek family had a long history as professional musicians, starting at least as early as Jan Ladislav's grandfather Jan Josef Dus√≠k (b. 1712), and lasting in the Moravian branch of the family at least into the 1970s. Jan Ladislav's mother, Veronika Dus√≠kov√° (n√©e ≈†tƒõbetov√°), played the harp, an instrument, along with the piano, for which her son went on to write much music. His father, Jan Josef, was also a well-known organist and composer.Craw, p. 12 His sister, Katerina Veronika Anna Dus√≠kova, was also a musician and composer. Jan Ladislav, the oldest of three children, was born on 12 February 1760 in the Bohemian town of ƒå√°slav, where his father taught and played the organ.Craw, pp. 13‚Äì14 His first musical instruction came from his father, who began teaching him piano at 5, and organ at age 9.Craw, p. 18 His voice was also found to be good, so he also sang in the church choir.Craw, p. 19 200px He studied music at the Jesuit gymnasium in Jihlava, where he studied with Ladislav ≈†pinar, its choir director; his grades were reported to be poor. From 1774 to 1776 he studied at the Jesuit gymnasium in Kutn√° Hora, where he also served as organist in the Santa Barbara Jesuit church.Craw, p. 20 In 1776 he went to the New City Gymnasium in Prague, where he was again reported to be a lazy student. In 1777 he enrolled in the University of Prague, where he lasted one semester.Craw, pp. 21‚Äì22 =Netherlands and Hamburg= After these early studies in Bohemia he entered the services of one Captain M√§nner, an Austrian military man, in 1778.Craw, p. 23 Dussek traveled with the Captain to what has since become Belgium in 1779, where he became the organist at the St. Rumbold's cathedral in Mechelen. In Mechelen he gave his first public recital, playing his own compositions. He then travelled to the Dutch Republic, where a well-received concert in Amsterdam brought him to the royalty's attention. He was invited to The Hague, where he gave lessons to the three children of Stadtholder William V.Craw, p. 26 While at the Hague he gave a performance before Kaiser Joseph II of Austria, who acknowledged Dussek's prowess.Craw, p. 27 By 1782, after leaving M√§nner's service, he was in Hamburg, where he gave a concert on the \\"new English fortepiano\\". While in Hamburg, he may have studied with C. P. E. Bach.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Dussek He also published his first works, three piano concertos and 3 violin sonatas (C 2‚Äì7), all of which were assigned Opus 1.Craw, p. 28 =Eastern and Central Europe= From Hamburg he moved to St. Petersburg, where he was a favorite of Catherine the Great. While there he was introduced to a technician named Hessel, who had developed a keyboard version of the glass harmonica, an instrument Dussek went on to master.Craw, pp. 29‚Äì30Pohl, p. 14 Dussek was forced to leave Russia quite abruptly, just ahead of Catherine's secret police, amid suspicions of his involvement in a plot to assassinate Catherine.Dus√≠k (1984), p. xxiv In a possibly apocryphal tale surrounding his departure, he was en route to play for Catherine when he found a ring, which he put on. Catherine recognized the ring as belonging to a known conspirator, raising her suspicions about Dussek.Craw, p. 30 Marie Antoinette was one of Dussek's patrons. After Dussek left St. Petersburg, he took a position as music director for Prince Antoni Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in Lithuania, where he stayed about a year. His departure from Lithuania may have been prompted by an affair he was rumored to have with the Prince's wife, the Princess of Thurn und Taxis.Craw, p. 31 He toured Germany for the next few years as a virtuoso performer on the piano and on the glass harmonica, eventually arriving in Paris in 1786.Craw, p. 34 The German tour was a significant success for him. One review of a Berlin concert said, \\"He obtained great distinction as a pianist, and was little less admired for his playing on the [glass] harmonica ... some critics pretend to trace to his skill upon this instrument many of his specialities of style both as a pianist and composer\\".Craw, pp. 34‚Äì35 Another reviewer wrote, of a concert in Kassel, \\"He entranced all listeners with a slow, harmonic, and studiously modulated prelude and chorale.\\"Craw, pp. 35‚Äì36 He may also have been in Ludwigslust in 1786, where he would have performed his Extract from an Easter Canata (C 26) for the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.Craw, p. 40 =France and Italy= In Paris Dussek became a favorite of Marie Antoinette, who tried to dissuade him from going on a performing tour to Milan in 1788. However, she was unsuccessful, as Dussek wanted to visit his brother Franz in Milan. Dussek's trip to Milan was quite successful; his performances \\"produce[d] quite a sensation\\".Craw, p. 44 He returned to Paris, where he stayed until shortly before the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789. During his time in Paris he may have met and played with a violinist by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte. He also published a series of violin sonatas (C 27‚Äì29) dedicated to Eug√©nie de Beaumarchais, daughter of writer Pierre Beaumarchais.Craw, pp. 42‚Äì44 =London= Portrait of Dussek (unknown date and author). Dussek left France for England in May or June 1789, where he settled in London. It is sometimes alleged that he took with him the harpist wife of the composer Jean-Baptiste Krumpholtz, who drowned himself into the Seine as a consequence; however, this is likely untrue, as Anne-Marie Krumpholtz went to London in 1788.Greene, p. 376Flood, p. 135 It is also uncertain whether he left Paris because of the looming crisis in France, or if it was merely coincidental. Early biographers have generally claimed that he left because of the impending revolution.Grove (1880), p. 474 He is reported to have had a concert engagement in London in early June 1789; this would have required his departure from Paris before some of the critical steps early in the Revolution.Craw, p. 49 Dussek made London his home until 1799. By 1790 he was well established as a performer and teacher. He was in such demand that Davison, in an 1860 biographic sketch, noted that \\"he became one of the most fashionable professors of the day, and his lessons were both sought with avidity and remunerated at a rate of payment which knew no precedent except in the instance of John Cramer.\\"Davison, quoted in Craw, p. 51 He had also established a relationship with pianomaker John Broadwood, taking delivery of one of the first 5¬Ω octave pianos (FF-c4): Broadwood noted in his business journal for 13 November 1793: \\"We have made some 5 ¬Ω octave grands these three years past, the first to please Dussek, which being liked, Cramer junior had one\\".Craw, p. 53 His collaboration with Broadwood would continue to bear fruit when, in 1794, he also received the first 6-octave (CC-c4) pianoCraw, p. 75 In the spring of 1791, Dussek appeared in a series of concerts, a number of which featured Sophia, the young daughter of music publisher Domenico Corri. In a concert on 15 June that year, the pair played a piano duet together; they were married in September 1792.Craw, pp. 58‚Äì60 Sophia Corri was a singer, pianist, and harpist who became known in her own right. They had a daughter, Olivia, but the marriage was not happy, involving liaisons by both parties.Craw, pp. 67, 87‚Äì89 Some of the concerts in 1791 and 1792 featured both Dussek and Joseph Haydn; the older Haydn wrote quite favorably of Dussek in a letter to the latter's father following one of the 1792 concerts. The other highlights of 1792 (above and beyond his marriage to Sophia) included the beginning of a music publishing venture with Sophia's father Domenico. This business, while successful at first, fared poorly in later years, and the circumstances of its failure spurred Dussek to leave London in 1799, leaving Corri in debtors' prison.Craw, pp. 73, 103 Dussek's business acumen apparently had little impact on his performing and composing while in London. Every year, he performed in a series of concerts, at least some of which also featured Sophia, and which frequently featured new works. Some works were so successful they were repeated at later concerts in the series. Of one work, a reviewer wrote in 1798, \\"Dussek's Military Concerto was repeated. We think it very deserving of encomium.\\" The concerto (C 153), which the reviewer reported as having been a repeat performance, was played again the following week.Craw, p. 93 In 1796, Dussek and his wife began having serious marital troubles. In an account of uncertain veracity, it was reported that Sophia, who had fallen in love with another man, asked Dussek for money to repair her harp. She then used the money to leave the house, removing her belongings in her harp case, and claiming to have left for dinner with a female friend. A suspicious Dussek went with his father-in-law to the man's house, where Sophia locked herself in. She and Dussek argued, and she cursed him, claiming to be pregnant by the other man. Dussek, relenting, promised her freedom to do what she wanted; this led to a reconciliation of sorts. It seems unlikely that Dussek ever saw Sophia and his daughter Olivia after he left London in 1799; Sophia had to wait until she knew Dussek had died before she could remarry, which she did in 1812.Craw, pp. 87‚Äì89, 104 Some of Dussek's compositions included arrangements of operatic and theatrical overtures for piano. He decided to try his hand at opera in 1798; the result was The Captive of Spilberg, with a libretto by Prince Hoare. The opera opened at Drury Lane on 14 November 1798, and the music was well received,Craw, pp. 94‚Äì95 with the European Magazine's critic writing, \\"the music, by Mr. Dussek, was such as to intitle him to rank with the first composers of the time.\\"Craw, p. 96 Business failure In 1799, the business venture with Corri, which had never been very successful, ran into financial difficulties. Dussek and Corri managed to convince the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte to lend them money to cover their debts. The failure to repay this debt put Corri into Newgate Prison and caused Dussek to flee. Da Ponte believed that Dussek fled to Paris; in fact he returned to Hamburg. The affair ended up bankrupting both Corri and Da Ponte.Craw, pp. 103‚Äì104 Dussek then toured Germany, where he became one of the first \\"glamour\\" pianists, preceding Franz Liszt.Dus√≠k (1984), p. xxv According to Louis Spohr, Dussek was the first to turn the piano sideways on the stage \\"so that the ladies could admire his handsome profile.\\" Before long he took up a position with Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, who treated him more as a friend and colleague than as an employee. Together, they sometimes enjoyed what were called \\"musical orgies.\\" When Prince Louis Ferdinand was killed in the Battle of Saalfeld, Dussek wrote the moving Sonata in F sharp minor, El√©gie harmonique, Op. 61 (C 211).ƒåernu≈°√°k, p. 272 Jan Ladislav Dussek, detail of a drawing by Pierre Cond√©. =Later years= In 1807, despite his earlier affiliation with Marie Antoinette, Dussek returned to Paris in the employ of Talleyrand, the powerful French foreign minister. Having no doubt made the acquaintance of S√©bastien √ârard in London, he became closely associated with the √ârard brothers' piano-making activities, signing an √ârard grand piano of 1808 still to be seen at Talleyrand's ch√¢teau at Valen√ßay, and giving the first public performance on their new stirrup-action grand in 1810. He wrote a powerful sonata (Sonata in A flat major, Op. 64, C 221) called Le Retour √† Paris (The Return to Paris). This imposing sonata also received the nickname Plus Ultra in heated response to a piano sonata by Joseph Woelfl, said to be the last word in pianistic difficulties, entitled Non Plus Ultra. The remainder of his life he spent performing, teaching and composing in Prussia and France. His personal beauty had faded and he became grossly fat. He also developed a fondness for strong drink which probably hastened his death. Dussek died of gout on 20 March 1812, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.  Style  Dussek was a predecessor of the Romantic composers for piano, especially Chopin, Schumann and Mendelssohn. Many of his works are strikingly at odds with the prevailing late Classical style of other composers of the time. The evolution of style found in Dussek's piano writing suggests he pursued an independent line of development, one that anticipated but did not influence early Romanticism. His more notable works include several large- scale solo piano pieces, piano sonatas, many piano concertos, sonatas for violin and piano, a musical drama, and various works of chamber music, including a Trio for piano, horn and violin, and the highly unusual sonata for piano, violin, cello and percussion entitled The Naval Battle and Total Defeat of the Dutch by Admiral Duncan (1797, C 152), which is an extremely rare example of pre-20th-century chamber music that includes percussion. = Solo piano works = The opening of Dussek's Grand Sonata in F minor, Op. 77. Dussek was one of a number of foreign-born composers, including Muzio Clementi and John Field, who contributed significantly to the development of a distinct \\"London\\" school of pianoforte composition. In part, this was due to the particular nature of piano manufacture in England. Joseph Haydn, for instance, composed his famous E-flat sonata after playing a piano of greater range lent to him by Dussek.Ringer, pp. 744‚Äì5 Much of Dussek's piano writing drew upon the more modulable and powerful tonal qualities and greater keyboard range of English-manufactured pianofortes. The enhanced possibilities offered by the instrument help explain some of his stylistic innovations. Dussek wrote numerous solo piano works, including 34 Piano Sonatas as well as a number of programmatic compositions. His The Sufferings of the Queen of France (composed in 1793, C 98), for example, is an episodic account of Marie Antoinette with interpolated texts relating to the Queen's misfortunes, including her sorrow at being separated from her children and her final moments on the scaffold before the guillotine. Along with Clementi, Dussek may have been a source of stylistic inspiration and influence for Beethoven, whose expansion upon the idiomatic innovations of the London school led to their rapid penumbration with the appearance of Beethoven's own keyboard works.Ringer, p. 749 Stylistic, melodic, dynamic and even structural similarities have been observed, for instance, between Beethoven's Sonata Opus 10, No. 3 and Dussek's Sonatas Opus 31, No. 2 and Opus 35, No. 2.Ringer, p. 750 Similarly, the opening of Beethoven's Sonata Opus 10, No. 1 quotes directly Dussek's Sonata Opus 39, No. 3 (see image). The opening of Dussek's Sonata Opus 39/3 and Beethoven's Opus 10/1 . It is also possible that Dussek's influence can be seen in Beethoven's famous Sonata Opus 81a, les Adieux: \\"both the program and the realization owed a great deal to Dussek's The Farewell, Opus 44.\\"Ringer, p. 752 = Piano concertos = Dussek composed a number of piano concertos between 1779 and 1810, eighteen of which survive. Dussek introduced one noteworthy stylistic innovation to the piano concerto form. In variance with the prevailing classical concerto style, exemplified by Mozart's piano concertos, Dussek eliminated the soloist cadenza in the opening movement in all of his concertos written after 1792.Lindeman, p. 27 Other individual characteristics are also noteworthy. His Concerto in C major, Op. 29, published in 1795, starts with an introductory Larghetto in 3/8 time, a solemn thematic declamation that is unique to the classical concerto. His last surviving work in the genre, Opus 70 in E-flat major, was one of the first to lengthen substantially the opening movement: at 570 measures long, it is roughly a third longer than his previous contributions,Lindeman, pp. 28‚Äì9 and foreshadows the practice of a dominant opening movement in concerto writing, found, for example, in the concertos of Chopin and the two minor concerti Opus 85 and Opus 89 by Johann Nepomuk Hummel as well as Beethoven's fifth. Innovations to the piano Apart from his own music, Dussek is important in the history of music because of his friendship with John Broadwood, the developer of the \\"English Action\\" piano. Because his own music demanded strength and range not available in the then current pianos, he pushed Broadwood into several extensions of the range and sonority of the instrument. It was a Broadwood instrument with Dussek's improvements that was sent to Beethoven. Dussek was also the first composer to write indications for using piano pedals. Works list The vast majority of Dussek's music involves the piano or harp in some way. He wrote 35 sonatas for piano and 11 for piano duet, as well as numerous other works for both configurations. His chamber music output includes 65 violin sonatas, 24 piano (or harp) trios, and a variety of works for harp, harp or piano, or harp and piano. Some sonatas had trio parts added by J. B. Cramer. Orchestral works were limited to concertos, including 16 for piano (one of them had lost and two of them are remained dubious attribution), six for harp (three of them lost), and one for two pianos. He wrote a modest number of vocal works, include 12 songs, a cantata, a mass, and one opera, The Captive of Spilberg. His compositions also included arrangements of other works, especially opera overtures, for piano. Cataloging Dussek's compositions has a history of its own. Dussek's oeuvre has historically been difficult to organize, due in part to the number of publishers who originally published his work, and to the fact that some of his works were published by more than one publisher. Some works published by multiple publishers were assigned different opus numbers; sometimes different works were given then same opus number by different publishers.Craw, p. 7 Dussek further complicated this by arranging works for different instrument combinations. The Artaria Company published a thematic catalog of his works that is incomplete, prompting Howard Craw to develop a new thematic catalog in 1964. Works are numbered in the order they were written prefixed by \\"C\\" or \\"Craw\\"; works of dubious origin are listed in a separately numbered section prefixed by \\"Craw D\\".Craw, p. 8 Theoretical works *Dussek's Instructions on the Art of Playing the Pianoforte or Harpsichord (London, Corri 1796) *Kleine theoretisch-praktische Klavierschule von Pleyel, Dussek und Cramer (Vienna, Haslinger, undated) *M√©thode pour le Piano Contenant tous les principes g√©n√©raux du Doigt√©, 24 Le√ßons faciles et gradu√©es des Exercices progressifs ainsi que des passages difficiles, termin√©e par une Fantaisie et Fugue compos√©e Par I.L.

Journal of Clinical Endocrinology 1961; 21:1440‚Äì1447. Modified Ferriman-Gallwey score The original method used 11 body areas to assess hair growth, but was decreased to 9 body areas in the modified method: *Upper lip *Chin *Chest *Upper back *Lower back *Upper abdomen *Lower abdomen *Upper arms *Forearms (deleted in the modified method) *Thighs *Legs (deleted in the modified method) In the modified method, hair growth is rated from 0 (no growth of terminal hair) to 4 (extensive hair growth) in each of the nine locations. A patient's score may therefore range from a minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 36. With each ethnic group, the amount of hair expected for that ethnicity should be considered. For example, in Caucasian women, a score of 8 or higher is regarded as indicative of androgen excess. The method was further modified in 2001 to include a total of 19 locations, with the 10 extra locations being: sideburns, neck, buttocks, inguinal area, perianal area, forearm, leg, foot, toes and fingers.

She was portrayed by Catherine Oxenberg for two seasons from 1984 to 1986, and then by Karen Cellini for 13 episodes from 1986 to 1987. Appearances Amanda was originated by Catherine Oxenberg in the 1984 fifth-season episode \\"Amanda\\". During the period between the production of seasons six and seven, Oxenberg vacated the role in 1986. Purportedly due to a salary dispute, Oxenberg's publicist insisted that the actress left Dynasty voluntarily, while several media outlets reported that she was fired. The role was immediately recast with Karen Cellini, who appeared for 13 episodes of the series' seventh season before the character was written out in the 1987 episode \\"The Rig\\". Amanda did not appear in the 1991 miniseries continuation, Dynasty: The Reunion. Storylines =Season five= Close on the heels of Fallon Carrington Colby's disappearance and presumed death in a plane crash, a young woman named Amanda Bedford appears in the penthouse of Alexis Colby, Fallon's mother, in \\"Amanda\\". Raised primarily by Alexis' cousin Rosalind Bedford, she is Alexis' daughter, come to Denver from England to give her mother support after Alexis' recent arrest and acquittal for the murder of Mark Jennings.Amanda's arrival is foreshadowed in the season four episode \\"The Birthday\\" when Alexis mentions that she has been through four pregnancies. Krystle notes the discrepancy (at this time, Alexis is known to have just three children, Adam, Fallon and Steven), but Alexis explains that one resulted in a miscarriage. Amanda appears 11 episodes later in \\"Amanda.\\" As news of Alexis' \\"new\\" daughter spreads, ex-husband Blake takes a special interest, soon learning that Alexis had been pregnant when he had exiled her from Denver almost two decades earlier. Though Alexis insists that Amanda's father is a ski instructor with whom she was involved, it is eventually revealed that she is indeed Blake's daughter and that Alexis kept her hidden from him as revenge for being banished years before. Amanda is attracted to Alexis' fianc√© Dex Dexter, and attempts to seduce him. When they find themselves snowed in together in a remote cabin, they give in to their feelings and make love. Immediately afterwards, Dex regrets his actions and announces that he and Alexis will marry. Sullen and depressed, Amanda is invited by Blake to a conference in Acapulco, where she meets the handsome Prince Michael of Moldavia. Alexis, who had known Michael's father King Galen years ago, encourages the relationship. Amanda learns that Michael is engaged to Elena, a Moldavian duchess, but he assures Amanda that it had been a loveless match. Michael proposes and Amanda, despite her lingering feelings for Dex, accepts. During their engagement, Amanda is almost kidnapped by Moldavian rebels but rescued by Dex. In the 15 May 1985 season finale \\"Royal Wedding,\\" the rebels undertake a large-scale coup, interrupting the wedding in an attempt to kill Galen. Terrorists spray the chapel with gunfire, leaving the entire wedding party seemingly dead or dying on the floor. =Season six= Amanda, Michael and the rest of the Carrington family survive the attack, though Luke Fuller‚Äîthe gay lover of Amanda's brother Steven‚Äîand family friend Lady Ashley Mitchell are killed. Galen is missing and presumed dead, and rightful heir Michael is forced to leave the country. Exile, however, puts a strain on Amanda and Michael's marriage, as he and Alexis become obsessed with rescuing Galen (who is being held for ransom) and restoring the monarchy. Amanda and Dex are drawn closer as Amanda catches Michael and Elena in a compromising position and Dex catches Alexis with a crown, imagining herself as Queen of Moldavia. Amanda finds a drunken Dex and they make love again‚Äîonly to be caught in the act by Alexis. Alexis and Dex divorce, as do Amanda and Michael. After Alexis discovers that Galen has in fact been manipulating her, the Moldavian royal family leaves for Lisbon and is never heard from again. Amanda is devastated when Dex does not want to pursue a relationship with her. She romances Clay Fallmont, but their family rivalry drives him into the arms of Steven's ex-wife Sammy Jo.

He was born in Scotland and raised in England from the age of two. Together with his older brother Mark Knopfler, John Illsley, and Pick Withers, he founded the rock band Dire Straits in 1977, serving as rhythm guitarist on their first two albums. After quitting the band, Knopfler embarked upon a solo career as a recording artist. Knopfler initially created smaller record labels, publishing companies, and indie labels. Early life Knopfler was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to an English mother, Louisa Mary (n√©e Laidler), a teacher, and a Hungarian Jewish father, Erwin Knopfler, an architect.. When Knopfler was two, his family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, England, where he grew up and later attended Gosforth Grammar School. By the age of 11, Knopfler owned a guitar, a piano and a drum kit, and by 14 he was playing and singing his own compositions in folk clubs. After attending Bristol Polytechnic, Knopfler became a social worker in London.  Career  = Dire Straits = Knopfler introduced his older brother, guitarist Mark Knopfler, to his bassist flatmate John Illsley. After gaining the interest of drummer Pick Withers, the four founded the rock band Dire Straits. One of Mark's friends came up with the band's name, which was supposedly a reference to their financial situation at the time the band was beginning to gain notice in the music industry. David however, asserts on his website that \\"[the] notion that the band were literally in dire straits is largely retrospective myth making and not really factually supportable. We all had day jobs until we got a whacking big advance from Polygram.\\" Knopfler played rhythm guitar beside his brother, who was lead guitarist in the band. He appeared on Dire Straits' first two albums: Dire Straits (1978) and Communiqu√© (1979). The stress of composing, arranging songs, recording the then-requisite two albums and tours to support them took its toll on the brothers, and David left the band during the recording of their third album, Making Movies (1980), leaving him uncredited on the album. =Solo= After leaving Dire Straits, Knopfler released his first solo album in 1983, Release. Mark Knopfler and John Illsley both played on the album. Harry Bogdanovs, a lifelong friend of Knopfler, is credited with having co-written three of the tracks and playing synthesiser. The album was supported by the single \\"Soul Kissing\\" on the label of Peach River Records. The single peaked at No. 82 in the UK Albums Chart, after Knopfler retrieved the rights from the bankrupt record label. Behind the Lines, his second album, was released in 1985 and his third solo album, Cut the Wire, followed in 1986. In 1988, the U.S. label Cypress Records released his fourth album, Lips Against the Steel. Knopfler scored the soundtracks for the films Shergar (1984) and Laser Mission (1989), and the German productions Treffer (1984), Jakob hinter der blauen T√ºr (1989) and Der grosse Bellheim. Lifelines in 1991 released by Phonogram, was recorded in Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios. That album was followed in 1993 by The Giver, released by MESA/Bluemoon in the U.S., and Ariola in Europe. Its sparse, acoustic arrangements received positive reviews, as did 1995's Small Mercies, which Knopfler co-produced with Harry Bogdanovs, featuring Chris White on saxophone. In 2001, Knopfler worked with Bogdanovs again to co-produce the album Wishbones, which has guest appearances by Chris Rea and Eddi Reader. His ninth solo album, Ship of Dreams, which also included Chris Rea, was released in 2004. In May 2005, Knopfler published a book of poetry, Blood Stones and Rhythmic Beasts, which was released by the UK's BlackWing books (). The Canadian jazz label Justin Time Records released Ship of Dreams in October 2005 with an alternate rendition of \\"Tears Fall\\" featuring Megan Slankard (replacing Julia Neigel on the original European release). Knopfler's tenth solo album Songs for the Siren was released in 2006. Recent songwriting projects with other artists have included sessions with Amilia Spicer, Mack Starks, Megan Slankard and Wendy Lands. He played various acoustic and electric gigs in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, Turkey and Australia from 2007 to 2009 with Harry Bogdanovs and his band.. A new double CD Acoustic, which contains unplugged renditions of new and old songs was released in 2011. Knopfler continued to tour in Spain, Germany, the UK, the United States and Canada in 2012 to 2015. The first-ever limited edition live album, Made in Germany (recorded in Erfurt, Germany during the 2012 tour with Bogdanovs), was released in April 2013 exclusively via CDBaby.com.

The DisneyQuest project was designed as a way for the Disney brand to reach populations that may not have the chance to travel to its various theme park destinations. It was meant to target large cities and urban areas. Had the project continued, Disney had plans to construct locations in many major cities in the United States, like Philadelphia and Baltimore. However, only two locations were built; one in Walt Disney World and a much shorter-lived one in Chicago. History DisneyQuest first opened on June 19, 1998, as part of a major expansion of the Downtown Disney entertainment district (today Disney Springs) at Downtown Disney West Side, and was intended as the first of a larger chain of similar facilities. The first DisneyQuest outside of a resort was opened in Chicago on June 16, 1999 with plans for more locations worldwide. The Chicago location was in a development, North Bridge, where ESPN Zone, a fellow Disney Regional chain, opened about a month later. On December 9, 1998, Disney Regional announced Philadelphia as new location as a tenant of the Pavilion at Market East project developed by Goldenberg Group on the former location of a Gimbels Department Store. The Chicago location permanently closed on September 4, 2001 due to low attendance as well as other, broader issues. While the location was generating income, it was not enough for Disney. After the failure of DisneyQuest Chicago, the DisneyQuest project was officially brought to an end. Construction that had begun in Philadelphia was scrapped, leaving a giant hole in its place for several years; the hole has since been filled and the space later became a parking lot. A DisneyQuest at the Disneyland Resort in California never proceeded past the planning stage. Disney announced another location to be built in downtown Toronto but the project was canceled. After the closure of the Chicago location, Disney Regional Entertainment turned over control of the remaining location to Walt Disney World operations. On June 30, 2015, Disney officials announced that the Walt Disney World location would close in 2016 as part of the continued redevelopment of Downtown Disney into Disney Springs. A spokesperson for the labor unions that represent Disney employees who work at DisneyQuest stated that displaced workers will be relocated to other positions. The property was set to be redeveloped into a new attraction themed to the NBA after they left their previous location at Universal CityWalk. In November 2016, Disney officials announced that DisneyQuest would remain open for the remainder of the year and into 2017, with no definitive closing date. They further stated that they had no update on the status of the NBA attraction other than it was still planned for the site. On January 30, 2017, the Disney Parks announced that DisneyQuest would close after July 2, 2017 so work on the NBA Experience attraction could begin. DisneyQuest's final day of operation was on July 2, 2017 and was demolished a few months later. Former attractions * Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold: Man a pirate ship and destroy other ships, sea monsters, and fortresses to collect gold. One player captains the ship by steering and controlling the throttle, while up to four gunners control the cannons to destroy other ships. * Virtual Jungle Cruise: Guests paddle an inflatable raft (with real paddles) as they make their way down a prehistoric river, avoiding dinosaurs and occasionally getting sprayed with water. It is based on Jungle Cruise. * CyberSpace Mountain: Guests design a roller coaster on a design kiosk, then sit in a pitch-and-roll simulator and ride it. Guests may also ride pre-built coasters. It is hosted by Bill Nye the Science Guy, who instead refers to himself as \\"Bill Nye the Coaster Guy\\". This attraction is based on the ride, Space Mountain. * Aladdin's Magic Carpet Ride: Players wear a head-mounted display as they ride a magic carpet through Agrabah, collecting gems to find The Genie, who has been hidden away in the Cave of Wonders. * Animation Academy: Regular sessions throughout the day teach how to draw characters, step by step, and learning the process to draw the characters with lightpens on computer screens. Afterwards, guests may purchase a printout afterward. * Sid's Create-a-Toy: A program featuring the evil Sid character from Toy Story that allows one to custom design a toy out of parts of other toys, and then it will be available for purchase. * Living Easels: An interactive touch screen program where guests can place various images onto several selectable backgrounds. A full-color printout of a guest's design may be purchased. * Radio Disney Song Maker: Guests are able to create their own song, and then they are able to buy it later throughout their visit. * Mighty Ducks Pinball Slam: Players \\"become\\" a pinball in a gigantic projected pinball game; by rocking their \\"duck\\" back and forth, up to twelve players at a time control their corresponding pinball on the screen, attempting to collect the most points. * Buzz Lightyear's AstroBlaster: Players board bumper cars and attempt to navigate over foam balls, called asteroids on the floor. By doing so, the asteroids will be sucked up into the cabin where players can then load them into a cannon and shoot at the other cars. If hit in the correct spot, one's car may spin around uncontrollably for ten seconds. Usually there are two players to a car; however, it is possible for one person to pilot and shoot at the same time. * Ride the Comix: Players wear an HMD to \\"enter the comic book world.\\" Players battle with super villains by using a laser sword. Up to six players can be on a team at a time. As of early 2011, Ride the Comix 4 has been \\"overtaken by villains\\" and was in service only on days where the building is near capacity. However, guests were still able to play Ride the Comix on the fifth floor directly above. On September 7, 2014, Ride the Comix was closed to allow for additional seating for the FoodQuest quick service restaurant. * Invasion! An ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter: Four players ride inside a rescue vehicle to save astronauts: one player drives, the other three shoot enemy aliens. Based on the former Magic Kingdom attraction, ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter. * Cave of Wonders Slide: A 150-foot (46m) long spiral slide that took guests from the third floor to the first. It was closed in DisneyQuest's first year of operation. * Treasure of the Incas: Players drive small remote-control toy trucks through a maze in search of treasure. Along a wall were stations with a steering wheel and a video screen by which to drive the truck; the floor of the room was clear plastic through which friends could see the trucks driving around so that they could shout directions to the driver. This attraction was plagued by interference from emerging technologies such as cell phones, and was finally closed after one of the vehicles caught fire. The clear flooring and mazes could still be seen near the Virtual Jungle Cruise area, adjacent to the Safari hunting games until 2007 when the floor was recovered and new games moved to the area. This area was now entirely jungle themed and is home to several Let's Go Jungle!: Lost on the Island of Spice arcade machines. * Magic Mirrors: Guests could take a picture of themselves and then edit their faces to appear like cartoons. The attraction closed in 2005 and has since been converted to seating. * Hercules in the Underworld: Six guests would each control their own character from Disney's Hercules with a joystick. The object of the game was to collect lightning bolts and defeat Hades. This attraction was replaced with \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold\\". All the redemption games were removed from the facility in January 2015 as a cautionary measure, in response to a state law that Disney believed made the games illegal under certain circumstances. When DisneyQuest closed down on July 2, 2017, the remaining arcade games (including the Fix-It Felix Jr. arcade games from Wreck-It Ralph) were removed, and most of them were sold or put into a storage.

It is of particular interest because it is such a primitive angiosperm family, closely related to Magnoliaceae, though it has a much more southern distribution. Plants in this family grow mostly in the southern hemisphere, and have been found in tropical to temperate climate regions of Malesia, Oceania, eastern Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and the Neotropics, with most of the genera concentrated in Australasia and Malesia. Drimys is found in the Neotropical realm, from southern Mexico to the subarctic forests of southern South America. Takhtajania includes a single species, T. perrieri, endemic only to Madagascar. This family has been estimated to be anywhere from 75 to 45 million years ago. Pollen samples found in Gabon indicate that the family is at least 120 million years old.Doyle, J. A. 1999. The rise of angiosperms as seen in the African Cretaceous record. Pp. 3-29, in Scott, L., Cadman, A., & Verhoeven, R.

Pollen fossils indicate that the range has been much wider than it is now, disappearing from the African fossil record roughly 24 million years ago. According to the 1998 APG I system, it did not belong to any order, but it has since been placed in Canellales by the APG II, APG III and APG IV systems. Description Members of the family Winteraceae are trees or shrubs. The leaves are alternate, with light green dots and a fragrant aroma. Some are used to produce essential oils. Stipules are absent. Flowers are small, mostly appearing in cymes or fascicles. They have two to six free, valvate sepals, though they are united in Drimys. The Winteraceae have no vessels in their xylem. This makes them relatively immune to xylem embolisms caused by freezing temperatures. In addition, vascular occlusion can occur near the openings of the stomata, preventing excess water from entering. Among all species, the distinctive characters of released pollen are easily recognized. Notable species Drimys winteri (Winter's bark) is a slender tree native to the Magellanic and Valdivian temperate rain forests of Chile and Argentina. It is a common garden plant grown for its fragrant mahogany-red bark, bright-green leaves, and its clusters of creamy white, jasmine-scented flowers. The bark has historically been used to prevent scurvy Tasmannia lanceolata, known as Tasmanian pepper, is grown as an ornamental shrub, and is increasingly being used as a condiment.

Buchtel, in front of Buchtel Hall =Buchtel College= In 1867, at the annual convention of the Universalist Church of the state of Ohio, the Committee on Education expressed an interest in founding a college compatible with Universalist religious principles. It was announced that the location would be given to those who could find an appropriate location and also supply $60,000 for the college. John R. Buchtel, a prominent Akron businessman and Universalist, promptly contributed $25,000 to the endowment fund and $6,000 to the building fund. This led other Akronites to donate, setting the goal and securing Akron as the location for Buchtel College, named after its greatest supporter. John R. Buchtel continued to be the college's most significant contributor, giving $500,000 over his lifetime, approximately equivalent to $16 million today. When the university opened in 1872 it was a single-building campus, housed in what is now known as \\"Old Buchtel.\\" George Washington Crouse donated $10,000 of the $20,000 needed to build a new gymnasium, completed in 1888. It was named Crouse Gymnasium in his honor, and was known as \\"the finest gym west of the Alleghenies.\\"Old Crouse gym served Akron campus Ohio.com Retrieved September 12, 2010 Tragedy struck the small college on December 20, 1899, when Old Buchtel burned to the ground. Insurance only covered $65,000 of the estimated $100,000 in loss. While new campus buildings were being constructed, the Crouse Gymnasium was divided into seven classrooms and served as the college until a new Buchtel Hall was opened in 1901. The new Buchtel Hall, which itself was gutted by fire in 1971, survives to this day but had some blackening on the exterior up until a 2011 restoration. =20th century= In 1907, the college shed its Universalist affiliation and became a non-denominational institution, in order to be able to receive funds from the Carnegie Foundation, which would not give funds to religiously affiliated schools. In 1913, Buchtel College trustees transferred the institution and its assets to the city of Akron, and Buchtel College became the Municipal University of Akron. At this time, the enrollment was 198 students. Tax money levied for the school and Akron's growing population led to strong growth for the university. Over the next several decades the university continued to add new buildings to accommodate its growing student population, acquiring more land through purchases and donations. In 1963, Governor Jim Rhodes approved the university as a state-assisted institution. Enrollment in 1964 was 10,000 students. In 1967, it fully became a state university, providing its current name as The University of Akron. In 2015, 25,117 students were enrolled at the University of Akron. =Recent expansion= University of Akron's Student union at night During the tenure of its 15th president, Luis M.

The new stadium opened for its first game on September 12, 2009. The stadium replaced the Rubber Bowl, which is from campus and was built in 1940. The university purchased the Quaker Square Crowne Plaza Hotel and shopping complex and uses it as a residence hall space.

The JTA, a Jewish news service, conducted an extensive analysis of Christian efforts to convert Jews to Christianity and found that some of the largest evangelical denominations ‚Äì the Southern Baptists, the Assemblies of God, and the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod ‚Äì have all increased their efforts to evangelize Jews in the recent past. The article states that the Christian missionary organization Jews for Jesus completed a five-year tour called \\"Behold Your God\\" that brought its message to 53 cities worldwide, and the Christian Chosen People Ministries saw its income grow by 31% to $7.9 million between 2003 and 2006. Jews for Judaism a Jewish counter-missionary group, writes that there are over 900 Christian groups in North America actively involved in missionizing the Jewish people. Jews for Judaism further states that these groups are currently spending over $250 million per year on efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. Jews for Jesus, the best known single ministry to the Jews, spent over $15 million in 2008. The Assemblies of God has an extensive organization targeting Jews for conversion to Christianity.Who are The Assemblies of God, and what do they have to do with the Jews? Israel has more than one hundred Messianic congregations, per Yaakov Shalom Ariel, associate professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, and author of Evangelizing The Chosen People. A leading effort to convert Jews to Christianity is known as Jews for Jesus. It was founded by Martin \\"Moishe\\" Rosen, a Jew who grew up in a non-observant home, converted to Christianity, and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1957. In 1973, Rosen left the employment of the American Board of Missions to the Jews, now called Chosen People Ministries, to incorporate a separate mission which became known as Jews for Jesus ministries. In 1986 he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree from Western Conservative Baptist Seminary in Portland, Oregon. Jews for Jesus is now led by David Brickner, who has been working for the organization since 1977. The 19th century saw at least 250,000 Jews convert to Christianity according to existing records of various societies.. Data from the Pew Research Center has it that, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult American Jews identify themselves as Christians, most as Protestants. According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry.

Rabbi Moshe Cohen, of Yad L'Achim, an Israel-based counter-missionary organization, has identified Al Dawaa, an Israeli-based Muslim group headed by Sheikh Abu Yassin of Kafr Manda. Jewish response Jewish counter-missionary organizations respond to these efforts by offering personal counseling, web sites with articles addressing common missionary tactics, and discussion forums where Jews who have questions about the differences between Judaism and other religions can be answered by observant Jews. Some Jewish resources are specifically aimed at countering the missionary efforts aimed at Jews. * Jews for Judaism is an international organization that provides a wide variety of counseling services, along with education, and outreach programs that enable Jews of all ages to rediscover and strengthen their Jewish heritage. Jews for Judaism has offices in Baltimore, Toronto, Los Angeles, Australia and South Africa.Jews for Judaism On their website, Jews for Judaism offers many articles discussing missionary tactics towards Jews, approaches by Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and various \\"proof texts\\" and other arguments often used by missionaries as they evangelize Jews.Proof Texts * Messiah Truth is another counter missionary organization which includes articles countering both Christianity and Islam under the heading of \\"Knowing Your Own Orchard.\\" Messiah Truth also sponsors an educational site, the Virtual Yeshiva including Why Jews Must Reject the Belief in Jesus, Isaiah 7:14 (virgin birth), and Isaiah 53, the Suffering Servant. The Messiah Truth organization also offers an interactive forum where Jews may ask questions about Judaism or missionary arguments and be answered by Jewish experts including Rabbis, Yeshiva instructors, and Hebrew professors. * Outreach Judaism, a site run by Rabbi Tovia Singer. Outreach Judaism is an international organization that responds directly to the issues raised by missionaries and cults, by exploring Judaism in contradistinction to fundamentalist Christianity. Outreach Judaism provides full-time, multi-level informational resources. * Kiruv Organisation - an outreach organization founded in 1995 by Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi in New York for the purpose of teaching Torah to both secular and religious Jews. Rabbi Moshe Shulman has responded to specific missionaries who target Jews, including Michael Brown, Rachmiel Frydland, Risto Santala, and David H. Stern (author of the Complete Jewish Bible). Rabbi Shulman's website offers scholarly articles on the mis-use of the Targums, Midrash and Talmud by non-Jews who quote from Jewish sources in an attempt to convert Jews. The leading counter-missionary organization in Israel is Yad L'Achim, an organization focusing on Orthodox Judaism outreach and counter-missionary activity. Yad L'Achim is made up of both paid staff and volunteers, and is largely supported by donations both from Israel and the diaspora. In addition to Yad L'Achim, Shomrei Emet Institutehttp://www.shomreiemet.org shomreiemet.org works in Israel serving the English-speaking population. Shomrei Emet is run by Penina Taylor, a counter-missionary, who, although born Jewish, was a missionary herself for seventeen years before returning to Judaism.

It developed during the Islamic rule era of the Indian subcontinent, starting in the early 13th century, wherein the powers to govern and collect tax from an estate was granted to an appointee of the state.JƒÅgƒ´rdƒÅr system: INDIAN TAX SYSTEM, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2009) The tenants were considered to be in the servitude of the jagirdar. There were two forms of jagir, one being conditional and the other unconditional. The conditional jagir required the governing family to maintain troops and provide their service to the state when asked. The land grant was called iqta, usually for a holder's lifetime, and the land reverted to the state upon the death of the jagirdar. The jagirdar system was introduced by the Delhi Sultanate, and continued during the Mughal Empire, but with a difference. In the Mughal times, the jagirdar collected taxes which paid his salary and the rest to the Mughal treasury, while the administration and military authority was given to a separate Mughal appointee. After the collapse of Mughal Empire, the system of jagirs was retained by Rajput, Jat, Saini and Sikh jat kingdoms, and later in a form by the British East India Company.  Definition  Jagir (, Devanagari: ‡§ú‡§æ‡§ó‡•Ä‡§∞, ) is a Persian word, and means \\"holding land\\". The Supreme Court of India used the following definition of jagir Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagirs Act (Rajasthan Act VI of 1952) in its Thakur Amar Singhji vs State Of Rajasthan (And Other ...) in a 15 April 1955 judgement:  Succession  A jagir was technically a feudal life estate, as the grant reverted to the state upon the jagirdar's death. However, in practice, jagirs became hereditary to the male lineal heir of the jagirdar. The family was thus the de facto ruler of the territory, earned income from part of the tax revenues and delivered the rest to the treasury of the state during the Islamic rule period, and later in parts of India that came under Afghan, Sikh and Rajput rulers. The jagirdar did not act alone, but appointed administrative layers for revenue collection. These positions, according to Shakti Kak, were called patwari, tahsildar, amil, fotedar, munsif, qanungo, chaudhri, dewan, rao and others.  13th-century origin and successors  This feudal system of land ownership is referred to as the jagirdar system. The system was introduced by the Sultans of Delhi from the 13th century onwards, was later adopted by the Mughal Empire, and continued under the British East India Company. Some Hindu jagirdars were converted into Muslim vassal states under Mughal imperial sway, such as the nawwabs of Kurnool. Most princely states of India during the colonial British Raj era were jagirdars such as Mohrampur Jagir. Shortly following independence from the British Crown in 1947, the jagirdar system was abolished by the Indian government in 1951.  Types of jagirs  The jagir grants were of several kinds and were known by different names, including jagir, an area of neighboring towns or villages with an administrative paigah, agrahar, umli, mukasa, inam, and maktha.Indian Kanoon document 10572  See also  * Indian honorifics * Desmukh * Feudalism * Indian feudalism * Feudalism in Pakistan * Kulkarni * Lambardar * Mankari * Mansabdar * Patil * Saranjamdar * Sardar * prabha single * Zamindar * Ghatwals and Mulraiyats  References  * Feudalism in Bangladesh Feudalism in Pakistan Indian feudalism Indian words and phrases Subdivisions of India Types of country subdivisions ","title":"Jagir"},{"id":"597547","text":"IHL may refer to: * International Hockey League (disambiguation), the name of several different defunct hockey leagues: :* International Professional Hockey League (1904‚Äì1907), central-eastern North America :* International Hockey League (1929‚Äì36), central-eastern North America :* International Hockey League (1945‚Äì2001), across North America :* International Hockey League (1992‚Äì96), Eastern Europe, now the Kontinental Hockey League :* International Hockey League (2007‚Äì2010), midwest North America, merged into the Central Hockey League * International humanitarian law, the law that regulates the conduct of armed conflict (jus in bello) * Internet Header Length, the second field in an IPv4 packet header ","title":"IHL"},{"id":"597564","text":"In the branch of experimental psychology focused on sense, sensation, and perception, which is called psychophysics, a just-noticeable difference or JND is the amount something must be changed in order for a difference to be noticeable, detectable at least half the time (absolute threshold).Weber's Law of Just Noticeable Difference, University of South Dakota: http://apps.usd.edu/coglab/WebersLaw.html This limen is also known as the difference limen, difference threshold, or least perceptible difference. For many sensory modalities, over a wide range of stimulus magnitudes sufficiently far from the upper and lower limits of perception, the 'JND' is a fixed proportion of the reference sensory level, and so the ratio of the JND/reference is roughly constant (that is the JND is a constant proportion/percentage of the reference level). Measured in physical units, we have: \\\\frac {\\\\Delta I} {I} = k, where I\\\\\\\\! is the original intensity of the particular stimulation, \\\\Delta I\\\\\\\\! is the addition to it required for the change to be perceived (the JND), and k is a constant. This rule was first discovered by Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795‚Äì1878), an anatomist and physiologist, in experiments on the thresholds of perception of lifted weights. A theoretical rationale (not universally accepted) was subsequently provided by Gustav Fechner, so the rule is therefore known either as the Weber Law or as the Weber‚ÄìFechner law; the constant k is called the Weber constant. It is true, at least to a good approximation, of many but not all sensory dimensions, for example the brightness of lights, and the intensity and the pitch of sounds. It is not true, however, for the wavelength of light. Stanley Smith Stevens argued that it would hold only for what he called prothetic sensory continua, where change of input takes the form of increase in intensity or something obviously analogous; it would not hold for metathetic continua, where change of input produces a qualitative rather than a quantitative change of the percept. Stevens developed his own law, called Stevens' Power Law, that raises the stimulus to a constant power while, like Weber, also multiplying it by a constant factor in order to achieve the perceived stimulus. The JND is a statistical, rather than an exact quantity: from trial to trial, the difference that a given person notices will vary somewhat, and it is therefore necessary to conduct many trials in order to determine the threshold. The JND usually reported is the difference that a person notices on 50% of trials. If a different proportion is used, this should be included in the description--for example one might report the value of the \\"75% JND\\". Modern approaches to psychophysics, for example signal detection theory, imply that the observed JND, even in this statistical sense, is not an absolute quantity, but will depend on situational and motivational as well as perceptual factors. For example, when a researcher flashes a very dim light, a participant may report seeing it on some trials but not on others. The JND formula has an objective interpretation (implied at the start of this entry) as the disparity between levels of the presented stimulus that is detected on 50% of occasions by a particular observed response (Torgerson, 1958), rather than what is subjectively \\"noticed\\" or as a difference in magnitudes of consciously experienced 'sensations'. This 50%-discriminated disparity can be used as a universal unit of measurement of the psychological distance of the level of a feature in an object or situation and an internal standard of comparison in memory, such as the 'template' for a category or the 'norm' of recognition (Booth & Freeman, 1993). The JND-scaled distances from norm can be combined among observed and inferred psychophysical functions to generate diagnostics among hypothesised information-transforming (mental) processes mediating observed quantitative judgments (Richardson & Booth, 1993). Music production applications In music production, a single change in a property of sound which is below the JND does not affect perception of the sound. For amplitude, the JND for humans is around 1 dB (Middlebrooks & Green, 1991; Mills, 1960). The JND for tone is dependent on the tone's frequency content. Below 500 Hz, the JND is about 3 Hz for sine waves, and 1 Hz for complex tones; above 1000 Hz, the JND for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 cents). The JND is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches. The JND becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies. The total number of perceptible pitch steps in the range of human hearing is about 1,400; the total number of notes in the equal-tempered scale, from 16 to 16,000 Hz, is 120.  In speech perception  JND analysis is frequently occurring in both music and speech, the two being related and overlapping in the analysis of speech prosody (i.e. speech melody). While several studies have shown that JND for tones (not necessarily sine waves) might normally lie between 5 and 9 semitones (STs), a small percentage of individuals exhibit an accuracy of between a quarter and a half ST (Bachem, 1937). Although JND varies as a function of the frequency band being tested, it has been shown that JND for the best performers at around 1 kHz is well below 1 Hz, (i.e. less than a tenth of a percent (Ritsma, 1965; Nordmark, 1968; Rakowski, 1971). It is, however, important to be aware of the role played by critical bandwidth when performing this kind of analysis (Nordmark, 1968). When analysing speech melody, rather than musical tones, accuracy decreases. This is not surprising given that speech does not stay at fixed intervals in the way that tones in music do. Johan 't Hart (1981) found that JND for speech averaged between 1 and 2 STs but concluded that \\"only differences of more than 3 semitones play a part in communicative situations\\" ('t Hart, 1981, page 811). Note that, given the logarithmic characteristics of Hz, for both music and speech perception results should not be reported in Hz but either as percentages or in STs (5 Hz between 20 and 25 Hz is very different from 5 Hz between 2000 and 2005 Hz, but the same when reported as a percentage or in STs). Marketing applications Weber's law has important applications in marketing. Manufacturers and marketers endeavor to determine the relevant JND for their products for two very different reasons: # so that negative changes (e.g. reductions in product size or quality, or increase in product price) are not discernible to the public (i.e. remain below JND) and # so that product improvements (e.g. improved or updated packaging, larger size or lower price) are very apparent to consumers without being wastefully extravagant (i.e. they are at or just above the JND). When it comes to product improvements, marketers very much want to meet or exceed the consumer's differential threshold; that is, they want consumers to readily perceive any improvements made in the original products. Marketers use the JND to determine the amount of improvement they should make in their products. Less than the JND is wasted effort because the improvement will not be perceived; more than the JND is again wasteful because it reduces the level of repeat sales. On the other hand, when it comes to price increases, less than the JND is desirable because consumers are unlikely to notice it. Haptics applications Weber's law is used in haptic devices and robotic applications.

Booth and George S. Lueker in 1976. It is a rooted, labeled tree, in which each element is represented by one of the leaf nodes, and each non-leaf node is labelled P or Q. A P node has at least two children, and a Q node has at least three children. A PQ tree represents its permutations via permissible reorderings of the children of its nodes. The children of a P node may be reordered in any way. The children of a Q node may be put in reverse order, but may not otherwise be reordered. A PQ tree represents all leaf node orderings that can be achieved by any sequence of these two operations. A PQ tree with many P and Q nodes can represent complicated subsets of the set of all possible orderings. However, not every set of orderings may be representable in this way; for instance, if an ordering is represented by a PQ tree, the reverse of the ordering must also be represented by the same tree. PQ trees are used to solve problems where the goal is to find an ordering that satisfies various constraints. In these problems, constraints on the ordering are included one at a time, by modifying the PQ tree structure in such a way that it represents only orderings satisfying the constraint. Applications of PQ trees include creating a contig map from DNA fragments, testing a matrix for the consecutive ones property, recognizing interval graphs and determining whether a graph is planar. Examples and notation leftthumbThe PQ tree representing [1 (2 3 4) 5] If all the leaves of a PQ tree are connected directly to a root P node then all possible orderings are allowed. If all the leaves are connected directly to a root Q node then only one order and its reverse are allowed. If nodes a,b,c connect to a P node, which connects to a root P node, with all other leaf nodes connected directly to the root, then any ordering where a,b,c are contiguous is allowed. Where graphical presentation is unavailable PQ trees are often noted using nested parenthesized lists. Each matched pair of square parentheses represents a Q node and each matched pair of rounded parentheses represent a P node. Leaves are non-parentheses elements of the lists. The image on the left is represented in this notation by [1 (2 3 4) 5]. This PQ tree represents the following twelve permutations on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}: : 12345, 12435, 13245, 13425, 14235, 14325, 52341, 52431, 53241, 53421, 54231, 54321. PC trees The PC tree, developed by Wei-Kuan Shih and Wen-Lian Hsu, is a more recent generalization of the PQ tree. Like the PQ tree, it represents permutations by reorderings of nodes in a tree, with elements represented at the leaves of the tree. Unlike the PQ tree, the PC tree is unrooted. The nodes adjacent to any non-leaf node labeled P may be reordered arbitrarily as in the PQ tree, while the nodes adjacent to any non- leaf node labeled C have a fixed cyclic order and may only be reordered by reversing this order. Thus, a PC tree can only represent sets of orderings in which any circular permutation or reversal of an ordering in the set is also in the set. However, a PQ tree on n elements may be simulated by a PC tree on n + 1 elements, where the extra element serves to root the PC tree. The data structure operations required to perform a planarity testing algorithm on PC trees are somewhat simpler than the corresponding operations on PQ trees.

It aired on the BBC from 1995 to 1996. Plot The Thin Blue Line is set in the police station of the fictional English town of Gasforth. One of the main themes shows the uniformed squad led by Inspector Fowler and the CID led by Detective Inspector Grim locking horns over similar, or even the same, issues while having conflicting views or methods of operation. Generally the uniformed section triumphs over the detectives, although not without their own foibles. Although other PCs and staff than the main characters are visible in the background and at meetings they generally have no speaking parts. Cast and characters * Rowan Atkinson as Inspector Raymond Fowler: Fowler is an old-fashioned policeman whose lack of interest in sex annoys his live-in girlfriend of 10 years, Sergeant Dawkins. He was previously married, and his college-age son Bill appears in one episode. His former wife Susan is alluded to but never featured. Inspector Fowler has a strong devotion to duty and takes his job seriously, sometimes showing a lack of contemporary social awareness that amuses Habib and annoys Grim. He occasionally (usually unwittingly) performs very courageous acts in the line of duty. Among the cast, he most closely characterises the stiff upper lip English official, at least while on duty. He is a member of the local drama society and fancies himself an actor. His hobbies include reading Biggles and building miniature models. He is patriotic and occasionally makes disparaging remarks about other nationalities (particularly the French) but frequently demonstrates his support of ethnic minorities, chiefly through his enjoyment and preference for Indian food (although this is probably more to do with Dawkins' lack of cooking skills). Despite his strong faith in the law, he is willing to bend the rules in an unjust situation, such as blackmailing a skinhead's mother into dropping assault charges against Constable Goody, or blackmailing Inspector Grim into dropping charges against Constable Habib for concealing drug evidence to protect her sister. Fowler breaks the fourth wall in the second series, beginning each episode by briefly addressing the audience directly, in the style of Jack Warner in Dixon of Dock Green. Fowler wears the ribbons of the Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. * Serena Evans as Sergeant Patricia Dawkins: Desk sergeant Dawkins is Inspector Fowler's long-suffering live-in girlfriend of 10 years. She is forever on a quest for more sexual attention from Fowler, who is usually reluctant to oblige. Despite her frustration and anger, she loves Fowler devotedly and dreams of marrying him and having their child. Dawkins gets extremely jealous if Fowler talks alone with other women and often jumps to conclusions as a result. This drives her to maintain a one-sided rivalry with Dame Christabel Wickham and occasionally places her at odds with the younger Maggie Habib, but the two always resume their friendship. She is also (perhaps as a result of Fowler's lukewarm sexual attentions) concerned about her health and appearance, and is so terrible a cook that on one occasion she made gravy as coffee. * David Haig as Detective Inspector Derek Grim: The head of the CID unit at Gasforth Police Station. In reference to a common trope in police dramas and procedurals, his attitude is that CID are superior to the uniformed police and proclaims that the uniformed officers are \\"extinct...like the 'doo-doo'\\" . Grim harbours a poorly-contained desire for promotion, preferably away from unexciting Gasforth. Sometimes oblivious to subtleties, Grim is far more ignorant than he is willing to admit, which he regularly displays through his butchery of English phraseology (e.g. \\"You seem to forget, Kray, it's my arse on the line ‚Äì so you'd better pull your finger out!\\") and his ill-conceived ideas. He is buffoonish and insecure in his own professional status and social standing. He has been married for 20 years to Tina (unseen) with whom he has an intense love-hate relationship; he often complains about their marriage and her, but occasionally reveals that he does love her. Their son Darren was arrested in one episode. His rants (often against \\"fannying about\\", which he himself plainly does) are the source of numerous comedic lines. Despite his flaws, at least one episode reveals that Grim is fundamentally a good man, as he was greatly conflicted by DC Boyle's plan of planting evidence on drug-dealer Harry the Spike. * James Dreyfus as Constable Kevin Goody: Goody is perhaps the least complex of the show's characters. Profoundly unintelligent and oblivious to the obvious, he has very little idea of what being a police officer entails; he has admitted that \\"wearing a nice uniform\\" was one reason he joined the force. Easily confused, his ineptitude amazes Fowler, who once exclaimed, \\"Your head is just something you keep your hat on, isn't it?\\". Goody is known to keep a chocolate bar (usually a Curly Wurly or Mars bar) in the truncheon pocket of his uniform trousers, and is always on an unsuccessful quest to win the heart of Habib despite his obvious camp behaviour; almost every episode shows him trying to impress her. He lives with his mother, of whom he is terrified (\\"...she'll come down here, and do her raving Nah-Nah...\\") and Habib has learned to threaten to inform her when he becomes too annoying. He once struck a prisoner in anger when the young thug made a racist remark to Habib, for which he was nearly charged by Fowler. * Mina Anwar as Constable Maggie Habib: A female officer of South Asian (possibly Indian or Pakistani) descent who was raised in Accrington, Habib is generally the straight man in Fowler's uniformed branch. Highly intelligent, she often approaches issues wisely and methodically, although she is also capable of making a fool of herself, such as in \\"Fire and Terror\\" when she throws herself at a fireman only to discover that he is sexually attracted to Goody rather than to her. Fowler has commented that she is a fine officer and that she has a good career ahead of her. For her part, Habib appears to respect Fowler's integrity while being amused and occasionally irritated by his old-fashioned views. She always tries to deflect Goody's attentions, but deep down she is sympathetic to him and argued against Goody being charged when he punched the skinhead who verbally abused her. Habib is pro-immigration and vocally progressive in her socio- political views. She has a study-freak turned drug-user sister, Nazia (Archie Panjabi), whom she protects in one episode by concealing evidence during a vice operation. She was nearly charged by Grim until Fowler blackmailed him by threatening criminal charges for a minor crime that Grim himself had committed. She was also citizen arrested and handcuffed with her own cuffs by local villain \\"Terry the Tank\\" after Grim tried to use her as a honey trap. Habib often stifles her laughter at Inspector Fowler's unintentional double entendres. * Rudolph Walker as Constable Frank Gladstone: A Trinidadian-origin constable near retirement, Gladstone has been a PC all his adult life, as was his father, and is enjoying his career winding down. He often contributes to situations by making irrelevant tangential stories and comments, usually silly (he once claimed to have been a would-be child soprano for Radio Trinidad) and sometimes sexist in nature. This sexism provides an amusing foil to Constable Goody's overt camp behaviour. He is obsessed with Gloria Hunniford. With the possible exception of Goody, Gladstone is the most out-of-touch-with-reality of the characters. * Kevin Allen as Detective Constable Robert Kray (Series 1): An officer in Grim's CID unit for the entire Series 1. He is a very laddish cop, intelligent, cynical, and pragmatic. His motivation for joining the force was the 'perks of the job' such as pushing to the front of queues, and sometimes using his police status to his own ends. He is frequently eating or ordering food via telephone while on duty. Despite being at Grim's beck and call, he has little respect for his superior and often chuckles at his misfortunes. He provides a comic supporting role similar to PC Gladstone, although his interjections are usually brief one-liner stabs. He is paired with female DC Crockett in several scenes (she eventually disappears from the series). Kray was replaced in Series 2 by DC Gary Boyle. Both Kray and Boyle served as intelligent straight man characters to the bumbling Grim, not unlike Habib's relationship with Fowler. * Mark Addy as Detective Constable Gary Boyle (Series 2): Kray's replacement in the second series. Like Kray, he is intelligent, cynical, pragmatic, very laddish and likes being a police officer for the associated perks, although he is more respectful to the uniformed branch and is a more dedicated officer. He sees no reason for police officers to refrain from taking liberties like staging pub lock-ins, using the car siren when late for dinner, or even planting evidence on clever criminals to get a conviction. Arguably more aggressive than Kray, Boyle sometimes covers up for Grim's mistakes or steers him in the right direction, while being generally unimpressed with his superior. The second series is a bit more serious in this regard and shows CID as more involved than the first series. Boyle has several spots in this and his character is more developed than Kray's but perhaps proportionally less comical. * Joy Brook as Detective Constable Crockett: Kray's CID partner in Series 1; she appears in every episode, but speaks only in \\"The Queen's Birthday Present\\", \\"Rag Week\\", \\"Fire and Terror\\", and \\"Yuletide Spirit\\" in minor supporting situations. * Lucy Robinson as Dame Christabel Wickham QC: The Mayoress (sic) of Gasforth in Series 2 and a former schoolmate/crush of Inspector Fowler's. She occasionally exploits Fowler's crush by teasing him should she need a favour, such as providing diplomatic security or seeking out and arresting an illegal immigrant. Usually though the police tend to accidentally ruin these assignments, such as when as Fowler's officers once accidentally arrested an entire football team, causing a business deal of hers to collapse horribly (though the team had engaged in unethical activities that warranted an arrest). Furthermore, Fowler also once accidentally arrested the European Commissioner for Human Rights, mistaking him for an illegal immigrant, causing Wickham further anger. Wickham is also a QC barrister and defends a drug dealer in court in one episode. She is often dismissive of Sergeant Dawkins, who has a one-sided rivalry with her for what she perceives as Fowler's residual affections. Fowler and the Mayoress also sometimes accidentally cause situations that lead Dawkins to believe they are having an affair. Many notable actors made guest appearances, and these include the writer Ben Elton, Stephen Fry, Stephen Moore, Melvyn Hayes, Trevor Peacock, Owen Teale, Colin McFarlane, Alan Cox, Alexander Armstrong, Nicola Stapleton, Perry Fenwick and Rupert Vansittart. Development =Writing= The writer, Ben Elton, is a fan of Dad's Army, and as such many of the characters were influenced by the show. Fowler's relationship with Grim is very similar to that of Captain Mainwaring to Warden Hodges, in that they are both on the same side yet enemies. Also, Constable Goody is rather like Private Pike in being a 'stupid boy' who irritates Fowler. Constable Gladstone's habit of interrupting a briefing with a story about life in Trinidad is similar to Lance Corporal Jones's penchant for reminiscing about Sudan during Captain Mainwaring's speeches. Other references include in the episode Rag Week, when Fowler is briefly seen walking out of a shop called \\"Mainwaring's\\". Elton has appeared in the programme himself, in the Christmas special episode \\"Yuletide Spirit\\". In the first series the \\"WANTED\\" poster behind Fowler's desk in the briefing room is an E-FIT of Elton. Episodes =Series 1 (1995)= =Series 2 (1996)= Critical reception The sitcom was popular with viewers, though it suffered in critical reviews due to \\"inconsistent character development\\" and an \\"overly broad plotline\\". It was ranked number 34 in a poll for Britain's Best Sitcom. Home releases Both series have been released on DVD in the United Kingdom (Region 2) by Vision Video Ltd. The Thin Blue Line is available in Region 1 (North America), having been released by BBC Warner. Episodes in the first series were not in broadcast order on both Region 1 and 2 DVDs. The Series 2 episodes in the Region 1 DVD are cut to fit about 30-minute runtime. For example, the biggest cut is from the S2E7 \\"The Green Eyed Monster\\" episode, which is cut from 40:45 UK/R2 runtime to 30:05 Region 1 runtime. The Region 1 release has English closed captions.

It is found in the Indian Subcontinent, China, and Southeast Asia. It forms a superspecies with the closely related black-billed koels, and Pacific koels which are sometimes treated as subspecies. The Asian koel like many of its related cuckoo kin is a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of crows and other hosts, who raise its young. They are unusual among the cuckoos in being largely frugivorous as adults. The name koel is echoic in origin with several language variants. The bird is a widely used symbol in Indian poetry.  Description  The Asian koel is a large, long-tailed, cuckoo measuring and weighing .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (ed.). CRC Press (1992), .Asian Koel. oiseaux-birds.com The male of the nominate race is glossy bluish-black, with a pale greenish grey bill, the iris is crimson, and it has grey legs and feet. The female of the nominate race is brownish on the crown and has rufous streaks on the head. The back, rump and wing coverts are dark brown with white and buff spots. The underparts are whitish, but is heavily striped. The other subspecies differ in colouration and size. The upper plumage of young birds is more like that of the male and they have a black beak. They are very vocal during the breeding season (March to August in the Indian Subcontinent), with a range of different calls. The familiar song of the male is a repeated koo-Ooo. The female makes a shrill kik-kik-kik... call. Calls vary across populations. They show a pattern of moult that differs from those of other parasitic cuckoos. The outer primaries show a transilient (alternating) ascending moult (P9-7-5-10-8-6) while the inner primaries are moulted in stepwise descending order (1-2-3-4).(Payne citing Stresemann and Stresemann 1961)  Taxonomy  The Asian koel was originally described by Carl Linnaeus as Cuculus scolopaceus based on a specimen he received from the Malabar region. The species has variations within its wide range with several island populations and a number of taxonomic variations have been suggested. The black-billed koel (E. melanorhynchus) of the Sulawesi region and the Pacific koel of Australasia are sometimes considered conspecific with the Asian koel in which case the \\"combined\\" species is known as the common koel. Due to differences in plumage, colour of bill and voice, the three are increasingly treated as separate species. Alternatively, only the black-billed koel has been considered as a separate species, or the Asian koel has included all subspecies otherwise included in the Pacific koel, except for the subspecies breeding in Australia, which then has the name Australian koel (E. cyanocephalus). The Asian koel has several geographic forms that have well marked plumage differences or have been geographically isolated with little gene flow. The following is a list of named subspecies with their distributions and synonyms as given by Payne: *Eudynamys scolopaceus scolopaceus (Linnaeus, 1758). Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Laccadives and Maldives. *Eudynamys scolopaceus chinensis (Cabanis and Heine, 1863). Southern China and Indochina, except the Thai-Malay Peninsula. *Eudynamys scolopaceus harterti (Ingram, 1912). Hainan. *Eudynamys scolopaceus malayana (Cabanis and Heine, 1863). Thai-Malay Peninsula, Lesser Sundas and Greater Sundas, except Sulawesi. This may include the race dolosa described from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. *Eudynamys scolopaceus mindanensis (Linnaeus, 1766) (includes E. s. paraguena) (Hachisuka, 1934) from Palawan, and E. s. corvina (Stresemann, 1931) from Halmahera, the Philippines (including Palawan and the Babuyan Islands), islands between Mindanao and Sulawesi, and North Maluku, except the Sula Islands.  Distribution and habitat  Adult male of nominate race (West Bengal, India) showing the crimson iris. Young birds have dark irides. The Asian koel is a bird of light woodland and cultivation. It is a mainly resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from Iran, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to southern China and the Greater Sundas. They have great potential in colonizing new areas, and were among the pioneer birds to colonize the volcanic island of Krakatau. They first arrived in Singapore in the 1980s and became very common birds. Some populations may make long-distance movements being found in places like Australia.  Behaviour  Calls (recorded in Singapore) Song of male, India Immature female (nominate race) begging for food. The Asian koel is a brood parasite, and lays its single egg in the nests of a variety of birds, including the jungle crow, and house crow. In Sri Lanka before 1880 it was only known to parasitize the jungle crow, later shifting to the house crow. A study in India found 5% of Corvus splendens and 0.5% of Corvus macrorhynchos nests parasitized. An Asian koel being fed by a black- collared starling. In Bangladesh, they parasitise long-tailed shrike (Lanius schach), common myna (Acridotheres tristis) and house crows (Corvus splendens) at about 35.7, 31.2 and 10.8% rates respectively. Host nests at low heights and nearer to fruit trees tended to be preferred by koels. In southern Thailand and the Malay Peninsula, koels have shifted host from crows to mynas (Acridotheres sp.) as the latter became more common in the late 1900s. In the Indian Subcontinent they have sometimes been found to parasitize the black drongo, the European magpie and possibly the black-headed oriole. Males may distract the hosts so that the female gets a chance to lay an egg in the nest. More often however, the female visits the nest of the host alone. The koel is not known to lay eggs in an empty host nest and a study in Pakistan found that the first koel eggs were laid, on average, within one and half days of the laying of the host's first egg. The chicks of the koel hatched about 3 days ahead of the host chicks. Koels usually lay only an egg or two in a single nest but as many as seven to eleven eggs have been reported from some host nests. A female may remove a host egg before laying. Eggs hatch in 12 to 14 days. The young koel does not always push out eggs or evict the host chicks, and initially calls like a crow. The young fledge in 20 to 28 days. Unlike some other cuckoos, the young do not attempt to kill the host chicks, a trait that is shared with the channel-billed cuckoos which are also largely frugivorous as adults. It has been suggested that koels, like some other brood parasites do not evict the host chicks due presumably due to the higher cost of evicting nestmates. A small parasite may not be able to evict large host eggs or chicks from a deep Corvid nest without risking starvation and possibly accidental self-eviction. An alternative hypothesis that retaining host chicks might benefit the koel chicks did not gain much support. Adult female parents have been known to feed young koels in the nests of the hosts, a behaviour seen in some other brood parasitic species as well. Adult males have however not been noted to feed fledglings. The Asian koel is omnivorous, consuming a variety of insects, caterpillars, eggs and small vertebrates. Adults feed mainly on fruit. They will sometimes defend fruiting trees that they forage in and chase away other frugivores. They have been noted to be especially important in the dispersal of the sandalwood tree (Santalum album) in India. Large seeded fruits are sometimes quickly regurgitated near the parent tree while small seeded fruits are ingested and are likely to be deposited at greater distances from the parent tree. They have a large gape and are capable of swallowing large fruits including the hard fruit of palms such as Arenga and Livistona. They have been known to occasionally take eggs of small birds. They feed on the fruits of Cascabela thevetia which are known to be toxic to mammals. A number of parasites of the species have been described, including malaria-like protozoa, lice and nematodes.  In culture  The word \\"koel\\" is onomatopoeic in origin. The Sanskrit name of \\"Kokila\\" and words in several Indian languages are similarly echoic. Being familiar birds with loud calls, references to them are common in folklore, myth and poetry. It is traditionally held in high regard for its song and revered in the Manusmriti, an ancient decree protecting them from harm. The Vedas, Sanskrit literature dated to about 2000 BC referred to it as Anya-Vapa which has been translated as \\"that which was raised by others\\" (or \\"sown for others to reap\\"). This has been interpreted as the earliest knowledge of brood parasitism. It has been chosen as the state bird by the Indian union territory of Puducherry. These birds were once very popular in India as cagebirds. Feeding even on boiled rice, these hardy birds lived in captivity for as long as 14 years.

The company has its origins in the 1920s, through the work of Samuel Ruben and Philip Mallory, and the formation of the P.R. Mallory Company. Through a number of corporate mergers and acquisitions, Duracell came to be owned by the consumer products conglomerate Procter & Gamble (P&G;). In November 2014, P&G; reached an agreement to sell the company to Berkshire Hathaway through a transfer of shares. Under the deal, Berkshire Hathaway exchanged the shares it held in P&G; for ownership of the Duracell business.  History  = Origins = Duracell originated via the partnership of scientist Samuel Ruben and businessman Philip Rogers Mallory, who met during the 1920s. The P.R. Mallory Company of Burlington, Massachusetts, United States, relocated its headquarters to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1924. The company produced mercury batteries for military equipment, trumping the carbon-zinc batteries used then in virtually all applications. In 1956 P. R. Mallory & Co. acquired General Dry Batteries, Inc. (GDB) with headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio. GDB was then the third-largest U. S. manufacturer of zinc-carbon batteries and had made mercury batteries under license from P. R. Mallory during World War II and after the war until its acquisition in 1956.Annual Report of P. R. Mallory for 1956 During the 1950s, Kodak introduced cameras with a flash. The design required a new zinc-carbon cell size, and size AAA was developed. A Duracell flashlight from the 1980s In 1964, the term \\"Duracell\\" was introduced as a brand, from \\"durable cell\\". Until 1980, the batteries also bore the Mallory brand. = Developments = P.R. Mallory was acquired by Dart Industries in 1978, which in turn, merged with Kraft in 1980. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts bought Duracell in 1988 and took the company public in 1989. It was acquired for $7 billion by The Gillette Company in 1996. In 2005, Procter & Gamble acquired Duracell's parent Gillette for $57 billion. In September 2011, Duracell and Powermat Technologies Ltd. started a joint venture, called Duracell Powermat, to make small wireless chargers for mobile phones and small electronics, with P&G; owning 55% of the joint venture shares and Powermat 45%. In March 2012, along with Powermat Technologies, Duracell, under the Procter & Gamble corporate umbrella, founded the Power Matters Alliance (PMA), an alliance of leading industry and governmental organizations, that is dedicated to advancing smart and environmentally sound wireless power. AT&T; and Starbucks joined the board later that year. In 2013, the company released a new \\"Duracell Quantum\\" line as their top-performing product series. = P&G; spin- off and Berkshire Hathaway ownership = On October 24, 2014, Procter & Gamble announced it would spin off Duracell in 2015 as part of a wider restructuring scheme. On November 14, 2014, Berkshire Hathaway declared its intent to acquire Duracell in an all-stock deal, consisting of $4.7 billion worth of P&G; stock then owned by Berkshire Hathaway. The acquisition received regulatory approval from the European Commission in July 2015. The transfer was completed on February 29, 2016, with P&G; investing $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell, and Berkshire Hathaway giving P&G; back 52 million shares. In September 2016, Duracell announced plans to move its executive team and 60 employees to Chicago.  Products  A Duracell AA battery Duracell manufactures alkaline batteries in many common sizes, such as AAA, AA, C, D, and 9V. Lesser-used sizes such as AAAA (primarily for pagers, penlights, and blood glucose meters) and J size batteries (for hospital devices and photographic strobe flash units) are also manufactured along with a range of \\"button\\" batteries using zinc-air, silver-oxide, and lithium chemistries, used in calculators, watches, hearing aids, and other small (mostly medical- related) devices. Duracell entered into a brand licensing agreement with flash memory manufacturer Dane-Elec in 2008 for a line of products including memory cards, hard drives and USB flash drives with the Duracell brand mark and in the brand's trademark \\"copper top\\" coloring. Duracell also manufactures specialty batteries, including NiMH rechargeable batteries and batteries for cameras, watches, hearing aids, etc. Their two main battery brands are \\"CopperTop (Plus),\\" marketed as longer-lasting, and \\"Ultra,\\" directed mainly at users of digital devices and devices that need more power. Duracell also has a line of lithium batteries and products, now manufactured outside of the U.S. A Duracell Procell AA box with the battery superimposed In recent years, Duracell's innovations expanded to include new battery designs with their prismatic batteries, which are prismatic in shape rather than cylindrical. Prismatic cells were made available in both alkaline and lithium designs. In 2006, Duracell introduced \\"Power Pix\\" batteries with NiOx technology, designed to supply longer life in digital cameras and other high-drain devices by up to twice the number of photos typically achievable with alkaline batteries. Duracell batteries are also bulk packaged for end-users under the brand name \\"Industrial by Duracell\\" (previously \\"Duracell Procell\\"). In the 1980s, the company briefly had a line of flashlights called Durabeam. The flashlights were marketed as being much stronger (the spokesperson turned the flashlight on, then spiked it like a football on the pavement to demonstrate), and brighter than an ordinary flashlight.  Competition  Duracell's major competitor in the battery market is Energizer.  Advertising campaigns  Duracell's advertising campaigns in the United States have always outlined the reliability of Duracell batteries and usually end with a three-note chime highlighting each syllable in the brand name (and previously highlighting the trademark \\"copper top\\" portion of the battery's overlay wrapping). Narrated by actor Jeff Bridges, these campaigns show people using the battery to power the devices they find most important: everything from a Defibrillator to a BrickHouse Child Locator. In 2017 Duracell unveiled a controversial TV commercial. Named 'Ear Hair,' the advert was created by the advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy.

Description The grey-bellied cuckoo is one of the smaller cuckoos, at a total length of about 23 cm. Adults are mainly grey with a white lower belly and undertail. There is a white patch on the wings. Some females are dark-barred reddish brown above with an unbarred tail and have strongly dark-barred whitish underparts. The juvenile resembles the female but is of a duller grey. Distribution and habitat The grey-bellied cuckoo breeds in tropical southern Asia from India and Sri Lanka to south China and Indonesia. It has been reported from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It is a short-distance migrant, since birds at more northerly latitudes and on higher ground are summer visitors, leaving for warmer areas in winter. The species prefers light woodland and cultivated areas. Ecology The grey- bellied cuckoo is a brood parasite and uses warblers as hosts. It lays a single egg. Its diet consists of a variety of insects and caterpillars. This is a noisy species, with a persistent and loud pee-pip-pee-pee call, with its tail depressed.

Jews lived in Koidanova as early as 1620. =Jewish community= Jews lived in Koidanova as early as 1620. Koidanova became the site of a new Hasidic Jewish dynasty in 1833 when Rabbi Shlomo Chaim Perlow (1797‚Äì1862) became the first Koidanover Rebbe. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Boruch Mordechai Perlow (1818-1870), grandson, Rabbi Aharon Perlow (1839-1897), and great-grandson, Rabbi Yosef Perlow of Koidanov-Minsk (1854-1915), who was the last Koidanover Rebbe to live in the town. After World War I, the dynasty was moved to Baranovichi, Poland. In 1847, Koidanova had 2,497 Jewish inhabitants. In 1897 the city had a total population of 4,744, of whom 3,156 were Jews. =Inter- war period= The People's House in Dzyarzhynsk, capital of the Dzier≈ºy≈Ñszczyzna, in 1932 In May 1932 it was granted the status of a city and was renamed Koidanau () or Koydanov (). In June of that year it was renamed again as Dziar≈æynsk by the Communist authorities, in honour of Felix Dzerzhinsky (1877‚Äì1926), a famous Bolshevik creator and chief of the \\"Cherezzychainaya Komissija\\" (CHEKA) ‚Äì the Soviet secret police - who was born in a Dziar≈æynava estate not far from the city, although on the other side of the then Polish-Soviet border.

It was captured on June 28, 1941. The Lithuanian Twelfth Schutzmannschaft (auxiliary police) Battalion's 1st Company, led by Lieutenant Z. Kemzura, massacred approximately 1,600 Jews from the city on October 21, 1941, shooting them and throwing them into a pit; many were buried alive. As it is reported in The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry: \\"For three hours the earth covering the mass grave would move; people still alive were trying to crawl out of their grave.\\" On March 1‚Äì2,1942, the Einsatzgruppen transported several thousand Jews from throughout Belarussia and murdered them in Koidanov.

Description Young northern leopard frog The northern leopard frog is a fairly large species of frog, reaching about in snout-to-vent length. It varies from green to brown in dorsal color, with large, dark, circular spots on its back, sides, and legs.Northern Leopard Frog Rana pipiens, National Geographic. Retrieved 2015-03-28 Each spot is normally bordered by a lighter ring. A pair of dorsolateral folds starting from the back of the eye runs parallel to each other down the back. These dorsolateral folds are often lighter or occasionally pinkish in colour. Also, a pale stripe runs from the nostril, under the eye and tympanum, terminating at the shoulder. The ventral surface is white or pale green. The iris is golden and toes are webbed. Tadpoles are dark brown or grey, with light blotches on the underside. The tail is pale tan. Color variations Two burnsi morphs, a green morph, and a brown morph of the northern leopard frog Brown morph northern leopard frog in a wood chip pile in Iowa The northern leopard frog has several different color variations, with the most common two being the green and the brown morphs, with another morph known as the burnsi morph. Individuals with the burnsi morph coloration lack spots on their backs, but may or may not retain them on their legs. They can be bright green or brown and have yellow dorsal folds. Albinism also appears in this species, but is very rare. Ecology and behavior Near Welland Canal, Ontario Northern leopard frogs have a wide range of habitats. They are found in permanent ponds, swamps, marshes, and slow-moving streams throughout forest, open, and urban areas.Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens), Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office. Retrieved 2015-03-28. They normally inhabit water bodies with abundant aquatic vegetation. In the summer, they often abandon ponds and move to grassy areas and lawns. They are well adapted to cold and can be found above above mean sea level. Males make a short, snore-like call from water during spring and summer. The northern leopard frog breeds in the spring (March‚ÄìJune). Up to 6500 eggs are laid in water, and tadpoles complete development within the breeding pond. Tadpoles are light brown with black spots, and development takes 70‚Äì110 days, depending on conditions. Metamorph frogs are long and resemble the adult. This species was once quite common through parts of western Canada and the United States until declines started occurring during the 1970s. Although the definitive cause of this decline is unknown, habitat loss and fragmentation, environmental contaminants, introduced fish, drought, and disease have been proposed as mechanisms of decline and are likely preventing species' recovery in many areas. Many populations of northern leopard frogs have not yet recovered from these declines. Northern leopard frogs are preyed upon by many different animals, such as snakes, raccoons, other frogs, and even humans. They do not produce distasteful skin secretions and rely on speed to evade predation. They eat a wide variety of animals, including crickets, flies, worms, and smaller frogs. Using their large mouths, they can even swallow birds and garter snakes. In one case, a bat was recorded as prey of this frog. This species is similar to the pickerel frog (Lithobates palustris) and the southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus). Research =Medical= The northern leopard frog produces specific ribonucleases to its oocytes. Those enzymes are potential drugs for cancer. One such molecule, called ranpirnase (onconase), is in clinical trials as a treatment for pleural mesothelioma and lung tumors. Another, amphinase, has been described as a potential treatment for brain tumors.Frog molecule could provide drug treatment for brain tumors =Neuroscience= The northern leopard frog has been a preferred species for making discoveries about basic properties of neurons since the 1950s. The neuromuscular junction of the sciatic nerve fibers of the sartorius muscle of this frog has been the source of initial data about the nervous system. =Muscle physiology and biomechanics= The northern leopard frog is a popular species for in vitro experiments in muscle physiology and biomechanics due to the ease of accessibility for investigators in its native range and the ability of the sartorius muscle to stay alive in vitro for several hours. Furthermore, the reliance of the frog on two major modes of locomotion (jumping and swimming) allows for understanding how muscle properties contribute to organismal performance in each of these modes. As pets Northern leopard frogs do well as a beginner pet. A standard 10-gallon tank is sufficient for a single northern leopard frog. A dense piece of wood can be placed partly in the water and land to provide easier transition from water and land (this also provides a basking spot). The substrate must be a combination of peat and moss, covered with orchid bark, and sphagnum moss can be used on the terrestrial side. The depth should be at least 2-3 inches to allow burrowing. Gravel can be used on the aquatic side. It is extremely important to use smooth gravel only (to prevent skin abrasions and injuries). Northern leopard frogs live in an area with 68 to 75 ¬∞F, although a temperature drop at night is beneficial (down to about 60 ¬∞F 16 ¬∞C). A secure lid (preferably a mesh lid with ventilation) is also a must - most frogs are adept at escaping, given the chance. Northern leopard frogs are fed a diet of crickets, mealworms, waxworms, or silkworms. Range Northern leopard frogs occur from Great Slave Lake and Hudson Bay, Canada, south to Kentucky and New Mexico, USA.Stebbins, R.C. (1985). A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians.

It is also found in Panama, where it is endemic to the central cordillera and western Pacific lowlands, although this is most likely an undescribed species. They occupy grasslands, lakeshores, and marshes.

Edades (December 23, 1895 - March 7, 1985) was a Filipino painter. He led the revolutionary Thirteen Moderns, who engaged their classical compatriots in heated debate over the nature and function of art. He was named a National Artist in 1976. Biography Victorio Edades was born on December 23, 1895 to Hilario and Cecilia Edades. He was the youngest of ten children (six of whom died of smallpox). He grew up in Barrio Bolosan in Dagupan, Pangasinan. His artistic ability surfaced during his early years. By seventh grade, his teachers were so impressed with him that he was dubbed \\"apprentice teacher\\" in his art class. He was also an achiever from the very beginning, having won awards in school debates and writing competitions. Later Career After high school, Edades and his friends traveled to the United States. Before enrolling in Seattle, Edades incidentally made a detour to Alaska and experienced working in a couple of factories. Nonetheless, he moved on to Seattle and enrolled at the University of Washington where he took up architecture and later earned a Master of Fine Arts in Painting. The significant event that stirred Edades, and made him as what he is known now, was his encounter with the traveling exhibition from the New York Armory Hall. This art show presented modern European artists such as C√©zanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasso and the Surrealists. His growing appreciation to what he saw veered him away from the conservative academic art and Realistic schools and thus he began to paint in the modern manner. The two former schools of thought were inclined more towards idyllic subject matter, and require a mastery of refined detailing. What attracted Edades to the modernist movement was its principle to go beyond the idealistic exteriors propagated by Impressionism and Realism. Modernist thought encourages experimentation in artistic expression and allows the artist to present reality as he sees it in his own way. During his journey to America, he participated in art competitions, one of which was the Annual Exhibition of North American Artists. His entry The Sketch (1927) won second prize. When he returned to the Philippines in 1928, he saw that the state of art was \\"practically dead.\\" Paintings he saw dealt with similar themes and were done in a limited technique that mostly followed the works of Fernando Amorsolo, the first Philippine national artist and the most popular painter of the time. He recognized that there was no creativity whatsoever, and that the artists of that time were merely \\"copying\\" each other. So in December, Edades bravely mounted a one-man show at the Philippine Columbia Club in Ermita to introduce to the masses what his modern art was all about. He showed thirty paintings, including those that won acclaim in America. It was a distinguished exhibit, for the Filipino art circle was suddenly shaken by what this young man from Pangasinan had learned from his studies abroad. Viewers and critics were apparently shocked and not one painting was sold. Edades helped organized the University of Sto. Tomas Department of Architecture in 1930 and was its acting head. In 1935, he was appointed as Director of the UST College of Architecture and Fine Arts, which he organized under the wing of Architecture. He was guided by the existing American curricula when he made the Fi Painting. On February 12, 1977, UST conferred on Edades the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts, Honoris Causa. Retirement Edades retired to Davao City with his family. There he taught for a time at the Philippine Women's College and resumed his career as an artist.love Death He died on March 7, 1985 in Davao City, Philippines. Artistic development Early styles after his stint in architecture already show his inclination towards modernist technique. In The Market and The Picnic, his choice of subject matter do not take flight from pleasant daily scenery; yet his brush strokes and observance of non-proportionality in the figures made his teachers consider him \\"very ambitious.\\" His earlier works already showed his affinity towards the style of C√©zanne and other Post- Impressionists. The height of his artistic development is his dynamic entry into Philippine art in 1928 with his solo exhibit at the Philippine Columbia Club. Here he mounted his most renowned work, The Builders. This work is the sum total of all the other pieces included in the show. They are a far cry from the works of the first Philippine national artist and most popular painter Fernando Amorsolo and the other classicists who painted bright cheery scenes of flawless Filipinos and their idealized daily routines. Edades, on the other hand, presented figures in muddy earth colors ‚Äì yellow ochres and raw sienna accented by bold black contours. Subjects are distorted figures (those whose proportions defy classical measure), and Edades‚Äô brush strokes are agitated and harsh. The choice of his subject also caused quite a stir to those who viewed the show. He portrayed tough, dirty construction laborers and simple folk wrestling in dung and dust. Even his nudes are nothing like Amorsolo's portrayal of the Filipina at her best. With the uproar Edades' ideas raised, he knew that he cannot make a living out by merely painting what he wished. So he got by producing commissioned works, particularly murals. He did murals for prominent individuals (like Juan Nakpil) and institutions. His later works are said to be ‚Äòflatter.‚Äô His portraits and genre paintings in Davao are not seen to be as heavy or solid as his earlier phase with The Builders. From C√©zanne, Edades grew more interested in the style of Utamaro of Japan and other artists whose charm is in color rather than solidity. By introducing modern ideas into the Philippine art scene, Victorio Edades managed to destroy the conventions of domestic art, and also got rid of the clich√©d ideology he believed stunted the development of Philippine art. His defiance to what the Conservatives structured as ‚Äòart‚Äô was a conscious call for real artistic expression. He attested that \\"art is ever the expression of man's emotion, and not a mere photographic likeness of nature. Thus to express his individual emotion, the artist is privileged to create in that distinctive form that best interprets his own experience. And the distortion of plastic elements of art such as line, mass and color ‚Äì is one of the many ways of expressing one's rhythmic form.\\" That was the reason why his disproportionate figures are made that way ‚Äì for the sake of composition. Legacy Through his continuous propagation of modern art as shown in his works and teachings, Edades proved that modernists were not fooling people as Guillermo Tolentino asserted. Dialectic-ally, Edades explained that Modern Art is not anti- Classicist. He said, \\"From the technical point of view, Modern Art is an outgrowth of Classical Art. Modern Art is the interpretation of the Classical concept conditioned by the artist's new experience with the aid of improved means of aesthetic expression.\\" Not conforming to the academic perception of art, he made art available to the common man. Through his determination to stand by his ideology, he became a bridge between the past and the present.  The Other Moderns  Galo B. Ocampo; Carlos V.

(see External links below) * These trees, rarely shrubs, are evergreen and glabrous. * The stems have nodes with three (rarely two) leaf gaps and three leaf traces. The xylem has narrow rays. The bark is aromatic, with prominent and unusual appearing lenticels. * The leaves have a peppery taste, are alternate, spiral, or distichous in arrangement, simple, entire, coriaceous, petiolate, pinnately nerved, without stipules, with translucent (pellucid) glands. The parenchyma is without palisade layer in Pleodendron and Canella. The stomata are paracytic in American genera, and anomocytic in the Old World. * The inflorescences are terminal or axillary, in a panicle (Canella) or a raceme; otherwise, the flowers are solitary (by reduction) and axillary. * The flowers are actinomorphic, hypogynous, and usually trimerous. The receptacles are barely excavated, and the hypogynous disc is absent. * The three (rarely 2) sepals are thick, coriaceous, and imbricate. * The petals number (4-)5-12, in 1-2 (-4) unlike whorls or spirally arranged, slender, imbricate in bud, usually free (connate at the base in Canella and halfway to the apex in Cinnamosma). * The androecium is monadelphous, adnate to the ovary. Stamens number 6-12, apparently derived from the fusion of two whorls in Warburgia and Canella. Anthers are extrorse and bithecal, with two sporangia per theca, attached to the outside of the staminal tube, and sessile; dehiscence is by a longitudinal slit, connective not projecting beyond thecae or only slightly so. * The gynoecium is syncarpous. The ovary has two to six carpels, unilocular and superior. The style is short and thick; the stigma is apical and capitate, with two to six lobes. Placentation is parietal. Ovules number from two to many in one or two rows on each of the two to six placentas; they are hemianatropous to campylotropous, bitegmic, and crassinucellate. * The fruit is a berry with a persistent calyx, with two or more seeds. Cinnamosma macrocarpa, in the Madagascan genus Cinnamosma, has the largest fruit in the family, sometimes reaching by . * Seeds have exotestae (the outer layer of the testa) only; the tegmen (the inner layer of the testa) is collapsed. The seed coat has oily idioblasts; the endosperm is abundant and oily (ruminate in Cinnamosma). The embryo is small and straight to slightly curved, with two cotyledons. * Pollen occurs in monads, and is delicate and monosulcate (usually with 10% of the grain trichotomosulcate); apertures are distal, exine, generally tectate, and granular, intectate, and reticulate in Cinnamosma; grains are small and hardly ornamented in Cinnamodendron and Warburgia, largest and most highly decorated in Canella and Pleodendron. The pollen is generally similar to that of the Myristicaceae, which had at one time caused some systematists to believe the two families were closely related. * The chromosome number 2n is 22, 26, or 28.Friedrich Ehrendorfer and Maria Lambrou. 2000. \\"Chromosomes of Takhtajania, other Winteraceae, and Canellaceae: phylogenetic implications\\". Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 87(3):407-413. Synapomorphies for Canellaceae include monadelphous stamens, parietal placentation, and campylotropous ovules. Other notable traits include the conspicuous lenticels, the aromatic bark, the peppery taste of the leaves, the three (rarely two) fleshy sepals, and the berry with reniform seeds. Some sources indicate Cinnamodendron has 20-40 stamens, contrary to the sources that are regarded here as reliable. The very large stamen numbers (20 to 40), are probably counts of thecae or microsporangia.  Ecology  Canellaceae has species in both xeric and wet forests. In Canella winterana, the flowers are protogynous. The berries are usually red, and probably eaten by birds, which contribute to seed dispersal (ornithochory). The trees are attacked by larvae of different insects, including dipterans.  Phytochemistry  Pointe des Ch√¢teaux, Guadeloupe, October 2008 Flowers of C. winterana, at Pointe des Ch√¢teaux, Guadeloupe, October 2008 Monoterpenes are common, as are drimane-type sesquiterpenes, including cinnafragrins, cinnamodial, and capsicodendrin. These three sesquiterpenes are shared with only the Winteraceae in angiosperms. Canellaceae also have alkaloids of the aporphine type, such as N-(cinnamoil)-tryptamine, lignans of the aryl-tetralin type, cinnamaldehydes, and allylphenols. Crystals of calcium oxalate are in the leaf mesophyll. Most species are cyanogenetic. Protocyanidins, flavonols, saponins, sapogenins, and ellagic acid are absent.  Uses  The saro, or green sandalwood, (also known locally as mandravasarotra), Cinnamosma fragrans, is native to Madagascar and is exported from there to India to be burned in ceremonies. It is not related to the true sandalwoods, which are in the family Santalaceae. Most species of Canellaceae produce bark that is similar in odor and flavor to cinnamon, but they are not related to true cinnamons, which are in the family Lauraceae. The white cinnamon, Canella winterana, a native of Florida and the Antilles, is used as a condiment, with tonic properties. Commercial production of \\"white cinnamon\\" from C. winterana has ceased,Thomas A. Zanoni. 2004. \\"Canellaceae\\". page 81. In: Nathan Smith, Scott A. Mori, Andrew Henderson, Dennis Wm. Stevenson, and Scott W. Heald (editors). Flowering Plants of the Neotropics. Princeton University Press and The New York Botanical Garden. . but small-scale, local production continues. The Canellaceae have long had local use as aromatic plants and as herbal medicines. The bark of the red cinnamon or false Winter's bark, Cinnamodendron corticosum, is used as a substitute for Winter's bark (Drimys winteri, a member of Winteraceae) in Chile and Argentina, where it is called canelo, a name that is also applied to cinnamon. In Africa, several species of Warburgia have medicinal uses. The barks of Warburgia salutaris and Warburgia ugandensis are used to treat fevers, colds, and malaria. Other species are used for timber or in the production of resins used as glue.  Fossils  Fossil leaves of Canella are known from the Pliocene of Bahia (Brazil). Pollen of Pleodendron is known from the Oligocene of Puerto Rico.  Systematic position  Depending on the classification system and the characters considered, Canellaceae has been placed close to Annonaceae, Myristicaceae or Winteraceae. In his last book, Armen Takhtajan defined the order Canellales as consisting of Canellaceae and Winteraceae. This circumscription is followed in the APG IV system, in which the order Canellales is sister to another small order, the Piperales.  Included taxa  : Theoretical introduction to Taxonomy In this article, the genus Capsicodendron is maintained in synonymy with Cinnamodendron, although preliminary molecular phylogenetic studies separate Capsicodendron from Cinnamodendron and place Capsicodendron closer to Cinnamosma and Warburgia than to Cinnamodendron. This placement is not corroborated by morphology.

Dr. Diego √Ålvarez Chanca accompanied Christopher Columbus on his second voyage, after which he wrote of a cinnamon (canela in Spanish) which was unlike any of the species of cinnamon used in Europe.Andrew Dalby. 2001. \\"Christopher Columbus, Gonzalo Pizarro, and the Search for Cinnamon\\". Gastronomica: The Journal of Food and Culture 1(2):40-49. (See external links below). He had probably reported the use of C. winterana. In 1737, in his Hortus Cliffortianus, Linnaeus combined Canella with Drimys, a genus now in Winteraceae, and Cinnamomum, now in Lauraceae, to form a taxon which he called Winterania.Carolus Linnaeus. 1737. Hortus Cliffortianus:488. Lubrecht and Cramer. Amsterdam, Netherlands. (See External links below). In 1753, in the first edition of Species Plantarum, Linnaeus divided Winterania into four species.Carolus Linnaeus (Carl von Linn√©). 1753. Species Plantarum, 1st edition, vol. 1, page 371. Holmiae: Impensis Laurentii Salvii (Lars Salvius). (A facsimile with an introduction by William T. Stearn was published by the Ray Society in 1957). Three of these are now in Cinnamomum, and the fourth, which he called Laurus winterana, consisted of what are now Canella winterana and Drimys winteri. These four species were included in a broadly defined Laurus. In 1756, Patrick Browne applied the name Canella to the species now known as Canella winterana.Canella. In: International Plant Names Index. He did not add a specific epithet to create a binomial.Patrick Browne. 1756. The Civil and Natural History of Jamaica:275. T.Osborne & J. Shipton: London, UK. The generic name is derived from canela, the Spanish word for cinnamon, but the Spanish word is derived from the Latin canna, meaning \\"a reed\\", or from the related Greek kanna, which refers to a piece of rolled bark.Umberto Quattrocchi. 2000. CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume I. CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington, DC, USA. / London, UK. (vol. I). (see External links below). The genus Canella was not adopted by Linnaeus, who resurrected Winterania in the second edition of Species Plantarum in 1762.Carolus Linnaeus (Carl von Linn√©). 1762. Species Plantarum, 2nd edition, vol. 1, page 636. Holmiae: Impensis Laurentii Salvii (Lars Salvius). He assigned to Winterania a single species, Winterania canella, which was equivalent to the species he had previously called Laurus winterana,. In 1784, Johan Andreas Murray divided Winterania into two monospecific genera, the constituent species of which were Canella alba and Wintera aromatica.Johan Andreas Murray. 1784. pages 443 and 507. In: Caroli a Linn√© eqvitis Systema vegetabilivm : secvndvm classes ordines genera species cvm characteribvs et differentiis, 14th edition. Johann Christian Dieterich: Gottingen, Germany. The name Canella alba was validated by Murray in 1784, but it had long been in use. Linnaeus attributed the name to Samuel Dale, who used it in his Pharmacologia, the first edition of which was published in 1693.George Simonds Boulger. date?. \\"Samuel Dale\\", entry 385. In: Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 13. Patrick Browne mentions its use by Mark Catesby. Canella alba was renamed as Canella winterana by Joseph Gaertner in 1788 in his classic work De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum (The Fruits and Seeds of Plants).Joseph Gaertner. 1788. pages 373 and 374. In: De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum. Sumtibus Auctoris, Typis Academiae Carolinae. Stuttgart, Germany. (A facsimile edition was published by Nabu Press in 2010. ). The name change was required by the rules of botanical nomenclature. Wintera aromatica is now known as Drimys winteri and is in the family Winteraceae. The family Canellaceae was established by Carl von Martius in 1832 and was defined as consisting of only the genus Canella.James L. Reveal. 2008 onward. A checklist of suprageneric names for extant vascular plants. At: Home Page of James L. Reveal and C. Rose Broome. (See External links below).Carl von Martius. 1832. Nov. Gen. Sp. Pl. 3: 168, 170. Stephan Endlicher divided Canella in 1840, creating the new genus Cinnamodendron. Cinnamosma was erected in 1867, Warburgia in 1895, and Pleodendron in 1899. Capsicodendron was erected in 1933. Some authors accept Capsicodendron and assign to it two species, Capsicodendron pimenteira and Capsicodendron dinisii. Other authors subsume Capsicodendron into Cinnamodendron and C. pimenteira into C. dinisii. Molecular phylogenetic studies of DNA sequences have shown Cinnamodendron, as traditionally circumscribed, is polyphyletic, consisting of two distinct groups. These groups are morphologically different and their ranges do not overlap. One of these groups is related to the African genera Cinnamosma and Warburgia, and might be paraphyletic over them. It consists of eight species, one of which was named in 2005.Barry E. Hammel and Nelson A. Zamora. 2005. \\"Pleodendron costaricense (Canellaceae), a new species for Costa Rica\\". Lankesteriana 5(3):211-218. Two other species in this group have not been formally named and described in the scientific literature. This group is restricted to South America. Since it includes the type species, Cinnamodendron axillare, it will retain the name Cinnamodendron. The other group of Cinnamodendron species is most closely related to Pleodendron and is restricted to the Greater Antilles. It consists of six species, two of which remain unnamed. The name Antillodendron has been proposed for this group, but this name is considered by some to be invalid because it was not effectively published.Antillodendron In: Tropicos At: Missouri Botanical Garden.

It is partially migratory and in India, it has been considered a harbinger of the monsoon rains due to the timing of its arrival. It has been associated with a bird in Indian mythology and poetry, known as the chataka (Sanskrit: ‡§ö‡§æ‡§§‡§ï) represented as a bird with a beak on its head that waits for rains to quench its thirst. Taxonomy The Jacobin cuckoo was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux in 1780. The bird was also illustrated in a hand- coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle. This was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Cuculus jacobinus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The type locality is the Coromandel Coast of southeast India. The current genus Clamator was erected by German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829 with the great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius) as the type species. The name is the Latin word for \\"shouter\\" from clamare, \\"to shout\\". The specific epithet jacobinus and the English name Jacobin refer to the pied plumage which resembles the black and white garments of monks belonging to the Dominican Order. In France Dominicans were known as \\"Jacobins\\". The three subspecies with their breeding ranges are: * C. j. serratus (Sparrman, 1786) ‚Äì South Africa, southern Zambia * C. j. pica (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833) ‚Äì Africa south of the Sahara to north Zambia and Malawi, northwest India to Nepal and Myanmar * C. j. jacobinus (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì south India, Sri Lanka, south Myanmar Description In flight, the white wing patches and tail edges are prominent Black-phase Jacobin cuckoo in KwaZulu-Natal This medium-sized, slim black and white cuckoo with a crest is distinctive. The white wing patch on the black wing and the pattern make it unmistakable even in flight. They are very vocal during the breeding season. The call is a ringing series of whistling notes \\"piu-piu\\" with the calls of the nominate form more rapid and slightly mellower. In India the subspecies serratus (Sparrman, 1786) is a summer breeding visitor to northern India and is believed to migrate to southern Africa. This is larger and longer winged than the nominate subspecies found in the southern peninsular region and Sri Lanka is said to be a local migrant. No ringing evidence exists to support the actual migration to Africa. In Africa, subspecies serratus and pica (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833) show two phases, a pied phase with white or whitish below and a black phase where the only white is on the wing patch. Mating appears to be assortative, with pied phase males pairing with pied phase females. An all- rufous color phase has been noted in Central Africa. There is lack of clarity on the migration and plumage variation involved. Subspecies pica has been said to be the form that migrates between Africa and India however Rasmussen & Anderton (2005) suggest serratus as being the valid name for the Afro-Indian migrants. In the past some other African subspecies have been suggested such as hypopinarus from South Africa and caroli from the Gabon. Distribution and habitat The species is distributed south of the Sahara in Africa and south of the Himalayas in India. Also found in Sri Lanka and parts of Myanmar. Within Africa, there are movements of the species although they are resident in tropical Africa. The east African population is migratory and moves over southern Arabia into India during April. The habitat of the species is mainly in thorny, dry scrub or open woodland avoiding areas of dense forest or extremely dry environments. Behaviour and ecology In the breeding season, birds call from prominent perches and chase each other with slow wing-beats and pigeon like clapping flight. Courtship feeding has been observed in Africa. The species is a brood parasite and in India the host is mainly species of babblers in the genus Turdoides. The colour of the eggs matches those of the host, typically turquoise blue. The eggs are slightly larger than those of the common babbler (T. caudatus) or the jungle babbler (T. striata). Other hosts include the red-vented bulbul, and the eggs laid are then mostly white. Eggs are laid hurriedly in the morning into the nest of the host often dropped from while the bird perches on the rim of the nest and over the host eggs often resulting in the cracking of one or more host eggs. In Africa, the males distract the host while the female lays the egg. Multiple eggs may be laid in the nest of a host and two young cuckoos were found to fledge successfully in several occasions. In Africa, the hosts include Pycnonotus barbatus, P. capensis, Turdoides fulvus, Turdoides rubiginosus, Lanius collaris, Andropadus importunus, Terpsiphone viridis, Dicrurus adsimilis and a few other species. Babblers in the genus Turdoides are communal breeders and cuckoo chick are raised by several members of the group. A pied cuckoo chick was observed to be fed by four jungle babblers. The skin of young birds darkens form pink to purplish brown within two days of hatching. The mouth linking is red with yellow gape flanges. Unlike some cuckoos, nestlings do not evict the eggs of the host from the nest although they claim most of the parental attention and food resulting sometimes, in the starvation of host nestlings. These cuckoos feed on insects including hairy caterpillars that are picked up from near or on the ground. Caterpillars are pressed from end to end to remove the guts before they are swallowed. They sometimes feed on fruits. Jacobin cuckoos are occasionally targeted as prey by the sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), which has been recorded attacking the significantly larger cuckoo by forcing it to the ground with its talons, then ripping away with its hooked beak. In culture This species is widely mentioned in ancient Indian poetry as the chƒÅtaka. According to Indian mythology it has a beak atop its head and it thirsts for the rains. The poet Kalidasa used it in his \\"Meghadoota\\" as a metaphor for deep yearning and this tradition continues in literary works. Satya Churn Law, however noted that in Bengal, the bird associated with the \\"chataka\\" of Sanskrit was the common iora unlike the Jacobin cuckoo suggested by European orientalists. He further noted that a captive iora that he kept drank water only from dew and spray picked up from plant leaves suggesting that it may have been the basis for the idea that the \\"chatak\\" only drank raindrops. To compound the issues with matching vernacular names, it has been pointed out that in Bengal chƒÅtak also refers to skylarks (which are also crested).

It was originally written for and used at the 1975 Origins 1 convention. Gygax designed the adventure both to challenge the skill of expert players in his own campaign and to test players who boasted of having mighty player characters able to best any challenge. The module, coded S1, was the first in the S-series, or special series of modules. Several versions of the adventure have been published, the first in 1978, and the most recent, for the fifth edition of D&D;, in 2017 as one of the included adventures in Tales from the Yawning Portal. The module also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002. The module's plot revolves around the tomb of the demilich Acererak. The player characters must battle their way past a variety of monsters and traps, with the ultimate goal of destroying Acererak. Tomb of Horrors was considered the third greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by the staff of Dungeon in 2004. The module has influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products, and was followed by three other (unrelated) modules in the S-series: S2 White Plume Mountain, S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, and S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth. Plot summary Tomb of Horrors is set in the World of Greyhawk, a D&D; campaign setting. In Tomb of Horrors, the adventurers encounter a number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard. As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said to linger in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all. The module is divided into thirty-three encounters, beginning with two false entrances to the tomb, and ending with \\"The Crypt of Acererak the Demi-Lich.\\" Example encounters are the \\"Huge Pit Filled with 200 Spikes\\" (section 20), or encounter 22, \\"The Cavern of Gold and Silver Mists\\": \\"The mists are silvery and shot through with delicate streamers of golden color. Vision extends only 6'. There is a dim aura of good if detected for. Those who step into the mist must save versus poison or become idiots until they can breathe the clean air above ground under the warm sun.\\" The module ends with the destruction of Acererak without any postscript. Publication history Tomb of Horrors was written by Gary Gygax for official D&D; tournament play at the 1975 Origins 1 convention. Gygax developed the adventure from an idea by Alan Lucien, one of his original AD&D; playtesters, \\"and I admit to chuckling evilly as I did so.\\" Gygax designed the Tomb of Horrors modules for two related purposes. First, Gygax explains, \\"There were several very expert players in my campaign, and this was meant as yet another challenge to their skill‚Äîand the persistence of their theretofore-invincible characters. Specifically, I had in mind foiling Rob Kuntz's PC, Robilar, and Ernie Gygax's PC, Tenser.\\" Second, so that he was \\"ready for those fans [players] who boasted of having mighty PCs able to best any challenge offered by the AD&D; game.\\"Cordell, Bruce R., Return to the Tomb of Horrors (1998), p. 3, Wizards of the Coast Tomb of Horrors was revised in late 1977 for publication as an AD&D; module. In 1978, TSR, Inc. published the module with a monochrome cover, revised and updated for use with first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The module included a twenty-page book, a twelve-page book, and an outer folder; the original printing featured a two-color cover. The module features a book of illustrations to show to players as the adventure unfolds. Tomb of Horrors was republished in 1981 as a thirty-two page booklet with identical text but a new, full-color cover. The module has been described as the first of a series of high-level scenarios, (preview) and was included as part of the Realms of Horror abridged compilation produced in 1987. In 1998, the module was reprinted as part of the Return to the Tomb of Horrors module‚Äîa substantial expansion and sequel to the original adventure, written for 2nd Edition AD&D; rules. Wizards of the Coast released an updated version of the original module as a free download for Halloween 2005, retaining much of the original content; the updated content is from the Dungeons & Dragons supplement book Libris Mortis. This updated version was designed for use with the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition rules.Cordell, Bruce R. (October 31, 2008). Adventures: Tomb of Horrors (revised). Wizards of the Coast. Retrieved on January 21, 2008. Tomb of Horrors was also adapted into a novel of the same name by Keith Francis Strohm for the Greyhawk Classics series published by Wizards of the Coast in 2002. United Kingdom . United States . In July 2010, Wizards of the Coast released two adventures bearing the Tomb of Horrors name. One is a hardcover super-adventure written by Ari Marmell and Scott Fitzgerald Gray, which builds on and expands the legend of the original Tomb using the canon of Return to the Tomb of Horrors as a starting point. The second Tomb of Horrors is a conversion and update of the original module for 4th Edition rules, written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray and released to members of the RPGA as part of the DM Rewards program. All four modules of the S-series were included as part of the Dungeons of Dread hardcover collection, released on March 19, 2013. Lawrence Schick wrote in the foreword: \\"The dungeon of the demi-lich Acererak was, for Gary, a kind of thought experiment: If an undead sorcerer really wanted to keep his tomb from being plundered by greedy adventurers, how would he do it? The answer, of course, was to defend the crypt with tricks and traps designed not to challenge the intruders but to kill them dead. And furthermore, to do it in ways so horrific that all but the most determined party would give up and leave well enough alone.\\" In 2017, Wizards re-released Tomb of Horrors updated to 5th Edition rules as part of the Tales from the Yawning Portal collection. The game design and the background of the third part of the Tomb of Annihilation campaign is based on the Tomb of Horrors. 2018 special edition of the book Art and Arcana contained a bonus pamphlet of the \\"original 1975 tournament module\\" previously unpublished.EnWorld - Art & Arcana Review: Leveling Up with a Special Edition Reception Tomb of Horrors was ranked the 3rd greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004. Dungeon Master for Dummies lists Tomb of Horrors as one of the ten best classic adventures and posits that many of the adventure's traps would kill a character just for making poor choices. Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, calls the adventure \\"A very difficult scenario\\". Don Turnbull reviewed Tomb of Horrors in issue No. 13 of the magazine White Dwarf and gave the module a rating of 10 out of 10. Turnbull commented on the adventure's difficulty, noting that the dungeon is \\"sprinkled extensively with subtle, insidious and carefully laid traps, and it will be a fortunate adventurer who manages to avoid them\\". He felt that the illustration booklet would add a great deal to the adventure's atmosphere and felt that the pre-generated character roster was useful. Turnbull noted that the module is \\"very hard and will be hard for the DM to learn in advance, though this is an essential prerequisite of running it properly for it is much more subtle than the G or D modules\\", and he said that this module has in common with those modules an \\"excellent format, for instance, and the comprehensive way in which the scenario is introduced. TSR's high quality has not been in any way compromised, and in S1 it has even been improved upon.\\" Wayne MacLaurin of SF Site describes the module as \\"a classic\\" and a \\"must have\\" for gamers, saying that when he played the game in high school, most of his group's characters quickly died. MacLaurin explains that Tomb of Horrors is a classic not because of its difficulty, but because it was the first module that did not involve killing large amounts of monsters; it was a \\"collection of puzzles and maps.\\" Its focus on traps rather than monsters was a surprise to gamers at the time. One technique that some players used to get past the deathtraps was to drive cattle ahead of them, which Lore Sj√∂berg of Wired described as \\"a bit less than heroic\\", noting that in Lord of the Rings Gandalf did not send \\"50 head of cattle into the Mines of Moria to serve as Balrog bait.\\" David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, discussed the adventure's reputation as \\"the deadliest game ever written\\", noting that it \\"unloads a series of complicated puzzles and nightmarish traps\\" on characters, concluding that \\"Few survive long enough to collect any treasure, and even fewer manage to find their way back through the deadly maze and escape with their spoils.\\" Something Awful presented a humorous article about the ways that Tomb of Horrors is the bane of gamers everywhere since it is basically a series of traps that kills off most of the characters. \\"One of the best (worst) things about this module is that Acererak the demi-lich is a huge asshole. He's an asshole for filling his tomb with traps AND treasure, he's an asshole because he leaves little messages throughout his tomb bragging about how he's going to kill the players.\\" Legacy, influence and in popular culture Tomb of Horrors has also influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products. Jason Bulmahn used the module, as well as Indiana Jones, as inspiration for some of the traps in the 2007 D&D; supplement Dungeonscape. The computer role-playing game Icewind Dale, developed by Black Isle Studios, was influenced by the module; Black Isle Studios division director Feargus Urquhart said, \\"We wanted something that reminded everyone of their first foray into dungeons like the Tomb of Horrors, with traps around every corner, and the undead crawling out of the walls.\\" Tomb of Horrors is a key part of the novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, which is set in a virtual reality world created by a man who was a fan of the module. The character James Halliday recreated the dungeon in detail, which the novel's other characters must traverse to advance in the global contest and win Halliday's fortune. In the Ready Player One film adaptation, the graffiti on the back of Aech's truck is from Tomb of Horrors, shunning the copper key's original location for a reference-packed race for the key.

Over time manufacturers supplanted wood construction with a variety of materials and methods evoking wood construction -- including infill metal panels, metal framework, or simulated wood-grain sheet vinyl bordered with three-dimensional, simulated framework. In 2008, wood construction was evoked abstractly on the Ford Flex with a series of side and rear horizontal grooves. History =1930s and 40s= As a variant of body-on-frame construction, the woodie as a utility vehicle or station wagon originated from the early practice of manufacturing the passenger compartment portion of a vehicle in hardwood. Woodies were popular in the United States and were produced as variants of sedans and convertibles as well as station wagons, from basic to luxury. They were typically manufactured as third-party conversions of regular vehicles‚Äîsome by large, reputable coachbuilding firms and others by local carpenters and craftsmen for individual customers. They could be austere vehicles, with side curtains in lieu of roll-up windows (e.g., the 1932 Ford)Street Rodder, 7/94, p.90 caption.‚Äîand sold in limited numbers (e.g., Ford sold 1654 woodie wagons).Hot Rod Magazine, 7/90, p.50. Eventually, bodies constructed entirely in steel supplanted wood construction‚Äîfor reasons of strength, cost, safety, and durability.Coincidentally, this benefited furniture makers, who previously had been outbid for the best wood. Georgano, G. N. Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886‚Äì1930. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985) =1950s and 60s= In 1950, Plymouth discontinued their woodie station wagon. Buick's 1953 Super Estate Wagon and 1953 Roadmaster Estate Wagon were the last production American station wagons to retain real wood construction. Other marques by then were touting the advantages of \\"all-steel\\" construction to the buying public. By 1955, only Ford, Mercury, joined in 1965 by Chrysler offered a \\"woodie\\" appearance, evoking real wood with other materials including steel, plastics and DI-NOC (a vinyl product). As the appearance became popular, Ford, GM, and Chrysler offered multiple models with the woodgrain appearance until the early 1990s. The British Motor Corporation (BMC) offered the Morris Minor Traveller (1953‚Äì71) with wood structural components and painted aluminum infill panels‚Äîthe last true mass-produced woodie. Morris' subsequent Mini Traveller (1961‚Äì9) employed steel infill panels and faux wood structural members. Simulated woodgrain After the demise of models using actual wood construction, manufacturers continued to evoke wood construction with sheet- vinyl appliques of simulated wood grain, sometimes augmented with three- dimensional, simulated framework, and later by a simple series of indented grooves in the bodywork. The 1966 Chevrolet Caprice in its second season, added to the four-door hardtop body style a full line of models including a vinyl-wood trimmed station wagon, the Caprice Estate. Dodge also reintroduced simulated wood the same year. Ford marketed the Ford Pinto Squire with vinyl simulated wood trim in the early 1970s. When Chevrolet proposed a simulated woodgrain option for the Chevy Vega Kammback wagon for the 1973 model year, after a gap of four years of applying woodgrain film on the Caprice, the Vega's production schedule made smooth application of the applique difficult without wrinkles and heavy scrappage -- requiring retraining by the film supplier, 3M.Little-known Vega Development stories by John Hinckley, GMAD- Lordstown Vega Launch Coordinator Subsequent rebadged variants of the Vega (marketed as \\"Woody\\"),1973 Chevrolet Vega brochure Jan. 1973 including the Pontiac Astre Safari, Chevrolet Monza Estate and Pontiac Sunbird Safari, also offered simulated wood trim. Chevrolet offered a simulated woodie version of the Chevette in 1976, and AMC offered the Pacer wagon with optional simulated wood trim in 1977. Ford also marketed version of their Ranchero model, a coupe utility produced between 1957 and 1979 with an open bed like a pickup truck but from a station wagon platform, with simulated woodgrain siding. In 1973, Ford produced a minivan prototype that offered a woodgrain appearance the preceded the Chrysler minivan, called the Ford Carousel, but it was not put into production. Introduced in 1981, the Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx four- door wagons offered optional simulated wood trim. GM offered its full-size wagons in wood trim versions until their final year in 1996. From 1982 to 1988, Chrysler used the Town & Country name on a station wagon version of the K-based, front wheel drive LeBaron, featuring plastic woodgrain exterior trim with three dimensional simulated framework. As the station wagon declined in North America, manufacturers offered faux wood trim on SUVs and minivans (e.g., the Jeep Cherokee and Chrysler minivans). Chrysler offered simulated wood as an option for the Chrysler PT Cruiser, introduced in 2000‚Äîand aftermarket firms offered kits as well. Japanese carmakers shied away from the appearance apart from port-of-entry or dealer-installed trim offered to North American consumers, although Mazda equipped the 1972-1977 Mazda Luce/RX-4 optionally, Honda briefly offered the 1980 Honda Civic station wagon, and Nissan offered the appearance on the 1983-1987 Nissan Cedric V20E SGL and Nissan Gloria V20E SGL top trim package station wagons to Japanese customers only. In 2010, George Barris created a woodie version of the Smart Fortwo, an aftermarket firm offered a simulated wood kit for the same car, and GM displayed a prototype woodie version of the forthcoming Chevrolet Spark for the 2010 Paris Motor Show. Introduced in 2008, the Ford Flex featured a series of side and rear horizontal grooves intended to evoke a woodie look‚Äîwithout either wood or simulated wood.

Many other American movies from the 1940s also feature woodies. The woodie was also closely associated with surfers and Surf-rock, e.g., ‚ÄúI bought a ‚Äô34 wagon and we call it a woodie\\" from the classic Surf City by Jan and Dean or the 1963 instrumental \\"Boogie Woodie\\" by The Beach Boys.

Population: It was previously known as Rastyapino (until 1929). History First mentioned in 1606 as Rastyapino (), it is named after Felix Dzerzhinsky, a Bolshevik leader who was the first head of the Soviet Cheka (secret police), since 1929. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with three work settlements and eleven rural localities, incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Dzerzhinsk‚Äîan administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts.Law #184-Z As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Dzerzhinsk is incorporated as Dzerzhinsk Urban Okrug.Law #151-Z Chemical weapons and other production Modern-day Dzerzhinsk is a large center of the Russian chemicals production industry. In the past, the city was also among Russia's principal production sites for chemical weapons. Owing to its strategic significance, this city was, until recently, officially closed to foreign visitors. Manufacture of various chemical weapons started in 1941, particularly concentrating on the production of lewisite‚Äîthe poisonous effects of which are owed to its arsenic trioxide content‚Äîand yperite (mustard gas). The factory producing these substances was called the Kaprolactam (or Caprolaktam) Organic Glass Factory, and in addition to its arsenic-based weapons, also produced prussic acid and phosgene. Chemical weapons production at Dzerzhinsk ceased in 1965. Some materials were transferred to storage units, while large amounts of waste material‚Äîfrequently containing high concentrations of arsenic‚Äîwere buried in dumps on the site of the factory. Full dismantling of the yperite facility was commenced in 1994. As of 1998, the lewisite production unit was still not completely disassembled. , Dzerzhinsk had 38 large industrial enterprises, which export their goods worldwide. About one thousand varieties of chemical products are produced in Dzerzhinsk. The largest factories, which exist or existed in the past, include: *Sverdlov Plant, FSE (Federal State Enterprise) manufactures munitions, battle and industrial explosives, and chemicals for industrial purposes (phenol-formaldehyde resin, epoxy resin, carbamide-furane resin, plasticizers, hardeners of various modifications, nitrobenzene, sulphanole, acetic anhydride, various cleaners and detergents, as well as other products). The plant is included in the presidential list of the country's strategic enterprises. This is Dzerzhinsk's largest factory. * JSC Kristall Research Institute, a military explosives factory, part of the Sverdlow Plant, which suffered a serious explosion in June 2019. *Korund, JSC (opened in 1915, the first factory in Russia to produce cyanide, still operational). This plant produces corundum for lasers and other applications. It is the oldest enterprise in Dzerzhinsk. In 2004, the plant was temporarily closed due to bankruptcy. *Dzerzhinskhimmash, JSC (opened in 1941, currently (2013) makes distillation and —Åolumn equipment, evaporators, heat exchangers). *Sintez, JSC. Produces acetone, carbonyl iron, diethanolamine, isopropanol, methylamine, phenol, etc. *Orgsteklo, JSC (previously manufactured specialist glass for the aeronautics market, currently (in 2012?) specializes in production of acrylic co-polymers and organic glasses). *Avangard-KNAUF, JSC *Liebherr, JSC *Plastik, JSC *Aviabor, JSC *SIBUR-Neftekhim, JSC *Oka, Yava, Orgsitilen, Zarya (no longer functioning). Pollution According to the September 12, 2007, study by the Blacksmith Institute, Dzerzhinsk is one of the worst-polluted cities of the world and has a life expectancy of 42 years for men and 47 for women, with the 2003 death rate exceeding its birth rate by 260%. Environmental action groups such as Greenpeace attribute such low life expectancy to high levels of persistent organic chemicals, particularly dioxins. The Blacksmith Institute also names sarin, lewisite, sulfur mustard, hydrogen cyanide, phosgene, lead, and organic chemicals among the worst pollutants. Parts of Dzerzhinsk's water are contaminated with dioxins and phenol at levels that are reportedly seventeen million times the safe limit. Dzerzhinsk's environmental agency estimates that almost 300,000 tons of chemical waste were dumped in the city between 1930 and 1998. The Ecology Committee of the Russian State Duma also considers Dzerzhinsk among the top ten cities with disastrous ecological conditions.–î–∑–µ—Ä–∂–∏–Ω—Å–∫ –≤–æ—à–µ–ª –≤ –¥–µ—Å—è—Ç–∫—É –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª–µ–µ –Ω–µ–±–ª–∞–≥–æ–ø–æ–ª—É—á–Ω—ã—Ö —Å —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Ç–æ—á–∫–∏ –∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–π –†–§ ‚Äì –ö–æ—Å–∞—Ä–∏–∫–æ–≤ (Dzerzhinsk Makes It to the Top Ten Most Ecologically Adverse Cities of the Russian Federation) Dzerzhinsk's City Administration, however, asserts that the Blacksmith Institute report is false, stating, for example, that since sarin had never been produced in the city, it cannot be one of the major pollutants. Also, according to the city's health department, the average life expectancy in the city was 64 years in 2006. Askhat Kayumkov, the head of the Dront public ecological organization, which was quoted as a source by the Blacksmith Institute, states that his organization never provided the Blacksmith Institute with data of any kind. Furthermore, he does not believe that Dzerzhinsk is one of the most polluted cities in Russia, much less in the whole world.¬´–î–∑–µ—Ä–∂–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–µ–ø–æ—Ä—Ç—ë—Ä¬ª. ¬´–ö—Ç–æ \\"–∑–∞–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª\\" –î–∑–µ—Ä–∂–∏–Ω—Å–∫¬ª? –û—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∫—Ä–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è –î–∑–µ—Ä–∂–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Å–∫–µ –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç–∞ –ë–ª—ç–∫—Å–º–∏—Ç–∞ (Dzerzhinsky Reportyor newspaper.

In the end, however, despite the ecological situation in the city being at its best in the previous 80 years (mostly due to bankruptcies and closures of the polluting factories), several locations in the city pose a tangible ecological risk.

The core concept of circuit courts requires judges to travel to different locales to ensure wide visibility and understanding of cases in a region. More generally, some modern circuit courts may also refer to a court that merely holds trials for cases of multiple locations in some rotation. History King Henry II instituted the custom of having judges ride the circuit each year to hear cases, rather than requiring every citizen to bring their cases to London (see Assize of Clarendon). Thus, the term \\"circuit court\\" is derived from the practice of having judges ride around the countryside each year on pre-set paths ‚àí circuits ‚àí to hear cases. Especially on the United States frontier, a judge might travel on horseback along with a group of lawyers. Abraham Lincoln was one such attorney who would ride the circuit in Illinois. In more settled areas, a stagecoach would be used. Eventually, the legal caseload in a county would become great enough to warrant the establishment of a local judiciary. Most of these local judicial circuits (that is, in terms of the actual routes traveled by judges) have been thus replaced by judges regularly stationed at local courthouses, but in many areas, the legacy term remains in usage. England and Wales England and Wales is divided into six regions or circuits for the purposes of the administration of justice.Circuits by the Bar Council of England and Wales *Northern Circuit *North Eastern Circuit *Wales and Chester Circuit (also known as Wales and Cheshire) *Midland Circuit *Western Circuit *South Eastern Circuit The system is overseen by the Lord Chancellor. The membership consists of High Court Judges, Circuit Judges, District Judges, law practitioners and academic lawyers. The Circuits also form the basis for administration of the Bar in England and Wales. The Circuit Bars are represented on the Bar Council through the Circuit Leaders. Republic of Ireland In the Republic of Ireland the Circuit Court is part of the Courts of First Instance, senior to the District Court but junior to the High Court (Ireland). It was first established as the Circuit Court of Justice under the Courts of Justice Act 1924 and replaced the County Court on the civil side, and Quarter Sessions and Recorder's Courts on the criminal side, as well as some of the jurisdiction of the assizes. These are heard by a judge sitting alone. It also has jurisdiction to hear appeals from the District Court. Appeals from the Court lie to the High Court on the civil side and the Court of Criminal Appeal on the criminal side. The Circuit Court is so called because of the circuits on which its judges travel, namely Dublin, Cork, Northern, Western, Eastern, South Western, South Eastern, and Midland, each of which are composed of a number of counties. The court consist of a President and thirty-seven judges. Although there is strictly speaking just one Circuit Court, a sitting of the Circuit Court in any particular location is referred to as name of town Circuit Court, e.g. Trim Circuit Court. The High Court also sits \\"on circuit\\" twice yearly, though this is called the High Court on Circuit rather than a circuit court. In this case, \\"on circuit\\" means sitting in a location other than Dublin. United States =Federal courts of appeals= In the United States, circuit courts were first established in the British Thirteen Colonies. In 1789, the United States circuit courts were United States federal courts established in each federal judicial district. These circuit courts exercised both original (first instance) and appellate jurisdiction. They existed until 1912. The original jurisdiction formerly exercised by the United States circuit courts is now exercised by the United States district courts. Their appellate jurisdiction is now exercised by the United States courts of appeals, which were known as the United States circuit courts of appeals from their establishment in 1894 until 1947. The federal courts of appeals sit permanently in 13 appellate circuits (11 regional circuits as well as a DC Circuit and the Federal Circuit). Note that there are several other federal courts that bear the phrase \\"Court of Appeals\\" in their names, but they are not Article III courts and are not considered to sit in appellate circuits. The federal courts of appeals are intermediate courts, between the district courts (the federal trial courts) and the Supreme Court. Smaller circuits, such as the Second Circuit and Third Circuit, are based at a single federal courthouse, while others, such as the large Ninth Circuit, are spread across many courthouses. Since three-judge federal appellate panels are randomly selected from all sitting circuit judges, Ninth Circuit judges must often \\"ride the circuit,\\" though this duty has become much easier to carry out since the development of modern air travel. =Supreme Court of the United States= Under the original Judiciary Act of 1789 and subsequent acts, the justices of the Supreme Court of the United States in Washington, D.C. had the responsibility of \\"riding circuit\\" and personally hearing both appeals and trials in the circuit courts, in addition to their caseload back in the capital. This particular duty was abolished by Congress with the Judiciary Act of 1891. The U.S. Supreme Court justices still retain vestiges of the days of riding circuit; each justice is designated to hear certain interlocutory appeals from specific circuits and can unilaterally decide them or refer them to the entire court. The court's customary summer recess originated as the time during which the justices would leave Washington and ride circuit (since dirt roads were more passable in the summer). =State courts= Many U.S. states have state courts called \\"circuit courts.\\" Most are trial courts of general, original jurisdiction. *Connecticut - Connecticut Circuit Courts *Alabama ‚Äì Alabama Circuit Courts *Arkansas ‚Äì Arkansas Circuit Courts *Florida ‚Äì Florida Circuit Courts *Hawaii ‚Äì Hawaii State Circuit Courts *Illinois ‚Äì Illinois Circuit Courts *Indiana ‚Äì Indiana Circuit Courts *Kentucky ‚Äì Kentucky Circuit Courts *Maryland ‚Äì Maryland Circuit Courts *Michigan ‚Äì Michigan Circuit Courts *Mississippi ‚Äì Mississippi Circuit Courts *Missouri ‚Äì Missouri Circuit Courts *New Hampshire ‚Äì New Hampshire Circuit Courts *Oregon ‚Äì Oregon Circuit Courts *South Carolina ‚Äì South Carolina Circuit Court *South Dakota ‚Äì South Dakota Circuit Courts *Tennessee ‚Äì Tennessee Circuit Courts *Virginia ‚Äì Virginia Circuit Court ‚Äì court of record that has appellate jurisdiction over a county's general district court and juvenile and domestic relations court and original jurisdiction over major civil cases and all the county's felony cases.

The court's decisions become legal precedents. *West Virginia ‚Äì West Virginia Circuit Court *Wisconsin ‚Äì Wisconsin Circuit Court In Louisiana, the intermediate appellate courts are called the Louisiana Circuit Courts of Appeal. There are five separate judicial circuits. In many states, such as Missouri, a judicial circuit can encompass one or more counties (see Missouri Circuit Courts). Each circuit court can have several divisions, including circuit, associate, small claims, probate, family, or drug court. Each division hears cases within its particular area of subject-matter jurisdiction, and jurisdiction is based on the size or type of a civil claim or the severity or type of a criminal charge. Drug court, for example, hears only drug-related criminal cases. Several U.S. states have state supreme courts that traditionally \\"ride the circuit\\" in the sense of hearing oral arguments at multiple locations throughout their jurisdictions each year. Among the states with circuit-riding supreme courts are Alaska, California, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington. Canada Courts serving certain areas particularly in Northern Canada, such as the Nunavut Court of Justice and courts serving northern Quebec, travel as circuit courts to hear cases in remote communities.

It makes migrations within west Africa, according to the availability of the fruit, seeds and blossoms which make up its diet. It is considered a farm pest in Africa, often feeding on maize or millet. It is popular in aviculture. Taxonomy A pair of Senegal parrots in the wild at Hann Park, Dakar, Senegal In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the Senegal parrot in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name La petite perruche du S√©n√©gal and the Latin name Psittacula senegalensis. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the Senegal parrot. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name Psittacus senegalus and cited Brisson's work. This species is now placed in the genus Poicephalus which was introduced by the English naturalist William John Swainson in 1837. There are two subspecies. * P. s. senegalus (the nominate subspecies): this subspecies has a yellow vest; its native range includes Senegal, southern Mauritania, southern Mali to Guinea and Lobos Island. * P. s. versteri: this subspecies has a deep- orange/red vest; its range is from the Ivory Coast and Ghana east to western Nigeria. They do not differ in behaviour, but only in the colour of the \\"vest\\". In the pet trade, the nominate subspecies is the most common though both are raised and sold as pets. Description Senegal parrots are about long, weigh about . They have a relatively large head and beak for their overall size, and feathers form a short broad tail. Adults have a charcoal grey head, grey beak, bright yellow irises, green back and throat, and yellow underparts and rump. The yellow and green areas on a Senegal parrot's front form a V-shape resembling a yellow vest worn over green. Young Juveniles have dark grey, almost black, irises, which change to light grey. Senegal parrots are not sexually dimorphic, but there are some hypotheses which sometimes might help to determine the gender of adult birds: *The V-shape of the vest is usually longer in females; in females the green area extends down over the chest to between the legs, whereas in males the tip of the green area ends midway down the chest. *The female's beak and head are generally slightly smaller and narrower than the male's. *The under-tail covert feathers (short feathers under the base of the main tail feathers) are generally mostly yellow in the male and generally mostly green in the female. *Males are generally, but not always, larger and heavier than female birds. Habitat Senegal parrots are birds of open woodland and savanna. They flock most commonly in countries in West Africa. It is a gregarious species, continuously chattering with a range of whistling and squawking calls. Senegal parrots live an average of approximately 25‚Äì30 years in the wild, and have been known to live for 50 years in captivity. Behaviour One parrot is feeding the other as part of bonding behaviour between a pair. Senegal parrots nest in holes in trees, often oil palms, usually laying three to four white eggs. The eggs are about long by wide. The eggs are incubated by the female, starting after the second egg has been laid, for about 27 to 28 days. Newly hatched chicks have a sparse white down and they do not open their eyes until about two to three weeks after hatching. They are dependent on the female for food and warmth who remains in the nest most of the time until about four weeks after hatching when the chicks have enough feathers for heat insulation. During this time the male brings food for the female and chicks, and guards the nest site. From about two to four weeks after hatching the female also begins to collect food for the chicks. The chicks fly out of the nest at about 9 weeks and they become independent from their parents at about 12 weeks after hatching. Conservation status Because of its vast range in Africa, the wild Senegal parrot population is difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, in 1981 concerns about extensive trapping of wild parrots for the pet trade led to it being listed on appendix 2 of The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), along with all parrot species. This has made the trade, import and export of all wild caught parrots illegal. Aviculture =Pets= Pet parrot in a cage with toys. The perch is made from a hard material in an attempt to wear down the tips of claws. However, these type of perches tend to cause lesions on the bottoms of the feet and are not very effective at keeping the nails short. Hand reared Senegal parrots are one of the most popular parrots to be kept as pets, and the most popular Poicephalus parrot. Their calls are generally high pitched whistles and squawks along with mimics, but they are not as noisy as many other parrot species. They make for a good companion and are quite friendly compared to other parrot species. Senegal parrots are independent at times, needing a very fair amount of sleep during the day. Keeping two as pets can very well aid the parrots social and physical health as they have a companion. Wild caught Senegal parrots do not usually become tame, and do not make good pets. =Breeding= Senegal parrots are relatively easy to breed in captivity and there is a small industry in breeding and hand rearing Senegal parrots and other parrots for the pet trade. In aviculture Senegal parrots can start to breed at the age of 3 to 4 years in captivity, but some do not breed until age 5 years. Parent reared birds are known to breed as early as 2 years of age. Senegal parrot nest boxes can be any of a variety of sizes and shapes; but for example, a nest box about high and to square would be suitable. An exit and entrance port about in diameter would be suitable, and the birds may enlarge the port by chewing the wood. Nest boxes generally have a secure side door for inspecting the nest.

New Year's Day is known as Pahela Baisakh (First of Baisakh).\\" The festival is celebrated with processions, fairs and family time. The traditional greeting for Bengali New Year is \\"Shubho Noboborsho\\" which is literally \\"Happy New Year\\". The festive Mangal Shobhajatra is organized in Bangladesh. In 2016, the UNESCO declared this festivity organized by the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka as a cultural heritage of humanity.Mangal Shobhajatra on Pahela Baishakh, UNESCO Nomenclature In Bengali, the word Pohela () means 'first' and Boishakh () is the first month of the Bengali calendar ( P√¥hela Boishakh). Bengali New Year is referred to in Bengali as Noboborsho (), where 'Nobo' means new and 'Borsho' means year. Some believe that Mughal Emperor Akbar first introduced the Bengali New Year and official Bengali calendar to ease the tax collection process. Origins There are primarily two competing theories about the origin of Bengali New Year. Both theories are described below. As per one of the theories, during the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the festival was a tradition introduced in Bengal during the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar to time the tax year to the harvest, and the Bangla year was therewith called Bangabda. Akbar asked the royal astronomer Fathullah Shirazi to create a new calendar by combining the lunar Islamic calendar and solar Hindu calendar already in use, and this was known as Fosholi Shon (‡¶´‡¶∏‡¶≤‡¶ø ‡¶∏‡¶®; harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the Bengali calendar. According to the Bangladeshi academic and foklorist Shamsuzzaman Khan, it could be Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of Punyaho as \\"a day for ceremonial land tax collection\\", and used Akbar's fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar. According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, and Nitish Sengupta, the origin of the Bengali calendar is unclear. According to Shamsuzzaman, it is called Bangla shon or shaal, which are Arabic (ÿ≥ŸÜ) and Persian (ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ) words respectively, suggests that it was introduced by a Muslim king or sultan.\\" In contrast, according to Sengupta, its traditional name is Bangabda.Syed Ashraf Ali, Bangabda, National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh It is also unclear, whether it was adopted by Alauddin Husain Shah or Akbar. The tradition to use the Bengali calendar may have been started by Husain Shah before Akbar. Regardless of who adopted the Bengali calendar and the new year, states Sengupta, it helped collect land taxes after the spring harvest based on traditional Bengali calendar, because the Islamic Hijri calendar created administrative difficulties in setting the collection date. There is another theory about the origin of the Bengali Calendar. Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th-century king Shashanka. The term Bangabda (Bangla year) is also found in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era. These temples are terracotta temples located in Bankura district of West Bengal, India. These inscriptions suggest that the Bengali calendar existed before Akbar's time. In rural Bengali Hindu communities of India, the Bengali calendar is credited to Vikramaditya, like many other parts of India and Nepal. However, unlike these regions where it starts in 57 BCE, the Bengali calendar starts from 593 CE suggesting that the starting reference year was adjusted at some point. =Contemporary usage= The current Bengali calendar in use in the Indian states is based on the Sanskrit text Surya Siddhanta. It retains the historic Sanskrit names of the months, with the first month as Boishakh. Their calendar remains tied to the Hindu calendar system and is used to set the various Bengali Hindu festivals. For Bengalis of West Bengal and other Indian states, the festival falls either on 14 or 15 April every year. In Bangladesh however, the old Bengali calendar was modified in 1966 by a committee headed by Muhammad Shahidullah, making the first five months 31 days long, rest 30 days each, with the month of Falgun adjusted to 31 days in every leap year. This was officially adopted by Bangladesh in 1987. Since then, the national calendar starts with and the new year festival always falls on 14 April in Bangladesh.

It is used as a traditional classical instrument in Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala. This instrument is \\"among the world's loudest non-brass acoustic instruments\\". It is a wind instrument partially similar to the North Indian shehnai but much longer, with a hardwood body and a large flaring bell made of wood or metal. In South Indian culture, the nadaswaram is considered to be very auspicious, and it is a key musical instrument played in almost all Hindu weddings and temples of the South Indian tradition. It is part of the family of instruments known as mangala vadyam (lit. mangala [\\"auspicious\\"], vadya [\\"instrument\\"]). The instrument is usually played in pairs, and accompanied by a pair of drums called thavil; it can also be accompanied with a drone from a similar oboe called the ottu.  History  Nadaswaram is referred in many ancient Tamil texts. Silappatikaram refers to an instrument called \\"vangiyam\\". The structure of this instrument matches that of Nadaswaram. Since there are seven holes played with seven fingers this was also called as \\"Ezhil\\". This instrument, too, is widely played in Tamil Nadu and popular among the Tamil Diaspora.  Construction  The nadaswaram contains three parts namely, kuzhal, thimiru, and anasu. It is a double reed instrument with a conical bore which gradually enlarges toward the lower end. The top portion has a metal staple (mel anaichu) into which is inserted a small metallic cylinder (kendai) which carries the mouthpiece made of reed. Besides spare reeds, a small ivory or horn needle is attached to the instrument, and used to clear the reed of saliva and other debris and allows free passage of air. A metallic bell (keezh anaichu) forms the bottom end of the instrument. Traditionally the body of the nadaswaram is made out of a tree called aacha (Tamil ‡ÆÜ‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Ææ; Hindi ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§ú‡§®), although nowadays bamboo, sandalwood, copper, brass, ebony and ivory are also used. For wooden instruments, old wood is considered the best, and sometimes wood salvaged from demolished old houses is used. The nadaswaram has seven finger-holes, and five additional holes drilled at the bottom which can be stopped with wax to modify the tone. The nadaswaram has a range of two and a half octaves, similar to the Indian bansuri flute, which also has a similar fingering. Unlike the flute where semi and quarter tones are produced by the partial opening and closing of the finger holes, in the nadaswaram they are produced by adjusting the pressure and strength of the air-flow into the pipe. Due to its intense volume and strength it is largely an outdoor instrument and much more suited for open spaces than for indoor concerts.  Players  Some of the greatest early nadaswaramists include * Thirumarukal Nadesa Pillai * T.N. Rajarathnam Pillai (1898-1956) * Thiruvengadu Subramania Pillai, * Vedaranyam Vedamoorthy * Karukurichi Arunachalam (1921-1964) * Thirucherai Sivasubramanian Pillai * Thiruvarur S Latchappa Pillai * Acharyapuram Chinnathambillai (b. 1928) * Kulikkarai Pichaiyappa * M.S.

Vinny Golia, J. D. Parran, and William Parker have performed and recorded with the instrument. The German saxophonist Roland Schaeffer also plays it, having studied from 1981 to 1985 with Karupaia Pillai.  In popular culture  Among the Tamil movies, two released in the 1960s, namely Konjum Salangai(1962) starring Gemini Ganesan and Thillana Mohanambal(1968) starring Sivaji Ganesan, featured nadaswaram playing characters. For the Konjum Salankai movie, Karukurichi Arunasalam Pillai provided the nadaswaram music. Madurai Sethuraman and Ponnusamy brothers were employed for the nadaswaram playing duo characters Sivaji Ganesan and A.V.M. Rajan for the Thillana Mohanambal movie.

The festival marks the first day of Medam, the ninth month in the solar calendar followed in Kerala.Major festivals of Kerala, Government of Kerala (2016) It therefore always falls in the middle of April in the Gregorian calendar on 14th or 15th April every year. Vishu (from Sanskrit- Malayalam Vishuva) literally means equal,http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script;=hk&tran;_input=%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B7%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B5&direct;=au&anz;=100 and in the festival context, it connotes the completion of the spring equinox. The festival is notable for its solemnity and the general lack of pomp The festival is marked by family time, preparing colourful auspicious items and viewing these as the first thing on the Vishu day( Vishukkani). In particular, Malayalees seek to view the golden blossoms of the Indian laburnum (Kani Konna), money or silver items, cloth(pattu), mirror, rice and other harvest products. The day also attracts firework play by children, wearing new clothes (Puthukodi) and the eating a special meal called Sadhya, which is a mix of salty, sweet, sour and bitter items. The Vishu is celebrated by giving money [vishukai neetam], it is a blessing from the family by exchanging the money. The Vishu arrangement typically includes an image of Vishnu, typically in the form of Krishna. People also visit temples like Sabarimala Ayyappan Temple or Guruvayur Sree Krishna temple or Kulathupuzha Sree BaalaShastha Temple to have a 'Vishukkani Kazhcha' (viewing) in the early hours of the day. History and Religious Significance The day of Vishu in the Malayali tradition signifies the sun's transit into the Meda Raasi (first solar month). The Vishu marks the first day of the astronomical year and hence Lord Vishnu and his incarnation Lord Krishna are worshipped on the day of Vishu, as Lord Vishnu is considered as the God of Time. It was on this day that Lord Krishna killed the demon Narakasura and because of this Krishna idols are kept in the Vishu kani. The Vishu has been celebrated in Kerala from the reign of Sthanu Ravi since 844 AD . Practices =Vishukkani= The Malayalam word \\"kani\\" literally means \\"that which is seen first\\", so \\"Vishukkani\\" means \\"that which is seen first on Vishu\\". The traditional belief is that one's future is a function of what one experiences, that the new year will be better if one views auspicious joyful things as the first thing on Vishu. Therefore, Malayali's spend the day before preparing a setting, usually a tray, of auspicious items. This setting is the first thing they see when they wake up on the Vishu day. The Vishukkani setting consists of items such as rice, golden lemon, golden cucumber, coconut cut open, jack fruit, kanmashi Kajal, betel leaves, arecanut, metal mirror (Vaalkannadi), golden yellow Konna flowers (Cassia fistula) which bloom in the season of Vishu, holy Hindu texts, coins or currency notes, oil lamp (nilavilakku), and an image of the Hindu god Vishnu. Mirror in Vishukani is a symbol of seeing yourself as a part of abundance you see in the form of Kani. The tradition has been that one of the members of the house, typically the mom or elderly person lights up the lamps at dawn, then goes to each member of her family one by one, blindfolds and wakes each one up, walks them to the front of the setting. She then releases the blindfold so one can see the setting, and then greets the Vishu day. =Vishu Sadhya= Vishu Sadhya served in 2013. The Sadhya (feast) is a major part of all Kerala festivals. However, special dishes called Vishu Kanji, Thoran and Vishu katta are more important on the new year day. The Kanji is made of rice, coconut milk and spices. Vishu katta is a delicacy prepared from freshly harvested rice powder and coconut milk served with jaggery. For Thoran, the side dish, there are also mandatory ingredients. Other important Vishu delicacies include Veppampoorasam (a bitter preparation of neem) and Mampazhappulissery (a sour or ripe mango soup) Even temple offerings called bewu bella, include a mix of sweet jaggery, bitter neem, and other flavors. The mixing of sweet, salty, sour, bitter and astringent flavors for the new year Vishu meal is similar to the pacchadi food prepared on new year day such as Ugadi by Hindus in Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the Indian subcontinent. These traditional festive recipes, that combine different flavors, are a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors of experiences in the coming new year, that no event or episode is wholly sweet or bitter, experiences are transitory and ephemeral, and to make the most from them. =Vishu Padakkam= Vishu Padakkam The word 'Padakkam' in Malayalam means firecrackers.Firecrackers are burst during Vishu the same way north Indians burst firecrackers during Diwali. =Vishukonna= (Cassia fistula), ‡¥ï‡¥£‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µä‡¥®‡µç‡¥®, Golden Shower Tree Konna (Cassia fistula), commonly known as golden shower is the flower of the Vishu festival. =Other customs= A child playing with fireworks on Vishu Flower arrangement in Uruli during Vishu The tradition of buying of new clothes for the occasion of Vishu is called Puthukodi or Vishukodi. There is also a popular tradition of elders giving money to younger ones or dependents of the family. This is called Vishukkaineetam. Another tradition is of giving alms and contributing to community charity. Children enjoy setting off firecrackers. =Pathamudayam= Pathamudayam is Celebrates on the 10th day of Medam Month in Malayalam Era and 10th day after Vishu.

History In 1883, the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon (ESCIL) was founded by Jules Raulin, a student of Louis Pasteur. In 1919 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Victor Grignard became a director. In that same year, the Institut de Chimie et Physique Industrielles de Lyon (ICPI) was founded by Professor Lepercq. In 1933, the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon (ESCIL) was awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur by the Ministry of War, for service to the nation. In 1993, Hubert Curien, former chairman of the European Space Agency (ESA), former president of the CERN and former minister was appointed President of ESCIL. One year later, in 1994, the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon (ESCIL) and the Institut de Chimie et Physique Industrielles de Lyon (ICPI) merged to form the current √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Physique √âlectronique de Lyon (CPE-Lyon). In 2005, Jean Dercourt, Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, was appointed President of the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Chimie Physique √âlectronique de Lyon (CPE-Lyon).

The college was founded in 1872 on a site granted to the Church of England by the university. In addition to its resident community of 380 University of Melbourne and University of Divinity students, Trinity's programs includes the Trinity College Foundation Studies program which prepares around 1500 international students for admission to the University of Melbourne annually; the Trinity College Theological School, an Anglican theological college, now a college of the University of Divinity; and the Pathways School, which runs the Foundation Studies program, summer and winter schools for young leaders as well as other shorter learning and leadership programs.  History  Trinity College was founded in 1872 by the first Anglican Bishop of Melbourne, Charles Perry. The college was affiliated with the University of Melbourne in 1876. The Trinity College Theological School was founded by Bishop James Moorhouse in 1877.J. Grant, Perspectives of A Century (Melbourne: The Council, 1972), pp. 11, 15, 104-5. In 1883 the college became the first university college in Australia to admit women when Lilian Helen Alexander was accepted as a non- resident student. With the establishment of the Trinity Women's Hostel (which later became Janet Clarke Hall) in 1886, Trinity admitted women as resident students, making it the first university college in Australia to do so. In 1989 the Trinity College Foundation Studies program was established to prepare international students for entry to the University of Melbourne. Since 2001, Trinity has also offered summer school programs to high school age students from around Australia and internationally. In 2010 the college hosted its first Juilliard Winter Jazz School, which was repeated in 2011.  Architecture and main buildings Situated to the north of the main university campus, Trinity's various ivy-clad stone and brick buildings surround a large grassed area, known as the Bulpadock.

Literature, drama and history of ideas staff are located here. The building also has a student common room with sofas, tables and a kitchen for student use. *715 Swanston Street: Trinity occupies two floors of this building. It has two lecture theatres and tutorial rooms. The Swanston Street building serves as a \\"student welfare precinct\\", with the student welfare office, student counsellor, and chaplaincy located in the lower ground floor. Departments with staff located here are: examinations, extended programs, timetabling, mathematics, economics and chemistry. A computer lab can also be found here. The study area is often used for quiet study and lunch. Swanston Street also houses \\"The Prayer Space\\" ‚Äì a room set aside for quiet reflection, prayer and rest. Facilities for ablutions are also provided for students of the Islamic faith. *199 Grattan Street: This is where student services is located. Student services organises orientations, valedictories and excursions during term breaks to locations such as Mount Baw Baw, Uluru, the Great Ocean Road and Sydney. The building also has a tutorial room and a drama room. A number of drama staff are also located here. Also in this building is a student common room with table tennis and foosball facilities, as well as sofas. *29 Royal Parade: This is where most English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classes are held. It also houses many EAP teachers' offices. *18‚Äì20 Lincoln Square North: This building has a drama room, a physics lab, student computer lab and six tutorial rooms. Staff in economics, accounting, environment and development, media and communications, psychology, physics, biology and mathematics have their offices here.  Residential life  = Clubs and societies = The Trinity College Associated Clubs (TCAC) provides leadership for the annual Orientation Week program at the beginning of the year and facilitates a multitude of social, cultural and sporting events throughout the year. Trinity's clubs and societies run many different functions and events throughout the year. The current student clubs include the Beer Budlay Society, wine cellar, billiards room, dialectic society (formed in 1877), music society, environmental committee, arts society, film society, drama club, games society and cooking society. The students also run an active program of social service and community outreach, including such programs as tutoring in local schools and educational visits to remote Indigenous communities. = Sport = Trinity College participates in many different sports in intercollegiate competition, including Australian rules football, soccer, netball, hockey, athletics, swimming, volleyball, squash, tennis and badminton. The college also has a particularly strong tradition in rowing and rugby. The college has its own multi-purpose synthetic court. = College song = The current version of the college song was written by the fifth warden, Evan Burge (1974-1996), and set to the hymn tune \\"Thaxted\\", derived from the \\"Jupiter\\" movement from Gustav Holst's The Planets. Where Bishops' lifts its ivy'd tower and Clarke's long cloisters run. The College Oak stands spreading forth its branches to the sun. And here are joy and laughter and loyal friends as well; The Bulpadock rejoices in our efforts to excel. And whene'er we think on all these things wherever we may be, We shall raise our voices higher and sing of Trinity. Great God, your spirit fills this earth, your truth can make us free, O lift us up beyond ourselves to be all we can be. For you have made and love us, and guide us through all strife, You gave your Son as one of us, his death‚Äôs our source of life.

Amen.\\" = College grace (short) = Opening grace, said prior to the meal at formal and celebratory dinners: Benedictus benedicat, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen. The opening grace is a traditional and common Latin grace, the meaning of which may be translated as \\"May the blessed one bless [the food], through Jesus Christ our Lord.\\" Closing grace, said at the conclusion of dinner: Presider: Laus deo (\\"Praise be to God\\") Response: Deo gratias (\\"Thanks be to God\\") = College grace (long) = Benedic, Domine, nos et dona tua, quae de largitate tua sumus sumpturi, et concede, ut illis salubriter nutriti tibi debitum obsequium praestare valeamus, per Christum Dominum nostrum.'' \\"Bless, O Lord, us and your gifts, which from your bounty we are about to receive, and grant that, healthily nourished by them, we may render you due obedience, through Christ our Lord.\\" Chapel and choir The Choir of Trinity College have become known especially, but not exclusively, for choral music in the tradition of English cathedrals and the collegiate chapels of Oxford and Cambridge universities. The choir sings Evensong in the chapel during term. Choral Evensong at Trinity has become a well-known liturgical event in Melbourne. The choir also performs locally and tours internationally and have made a number of radio broadcasts and CD recordings, including five albums for ABC Classics. From 1956 to 2016, the college provided liturgical hospitality to a local Anglican congregation, the Canterbury Fellowship. The fellowship's choir sang for choral services on Sunday mornings and Evensong out of term time.

D. Salinger's 1951 novel The Catcher in the Rye. Since the book's publication, Holden has become an icon for teenage rebellion and angst, and is considered among the most important characters of 20th-century American literature. The name Holden Caulfield was used in an unpublished short story written in 1941 and first appeared in print in 1945. Salinger's first Holden Caulfield story, \\"I'm Crazy\\", appeared in Collier's on December 22, 1945, a year and a half before the 1947 film Dear Ruth, starring William Holden and Joan CaulfieldSaturday Evening Post, July 15, 1944 was released. Explanation of teenage narrative Holden is naive and at the same time resentful of the adult world.Cliffs Notes: The Catcher in the Rye - Character Analysis: Holden Caulfield. Accessed 15 February 2013 One of Holden's most striking and quintessential qualities is his powerful revulsion for \\"phony\\" qualities, a catch-all term for the perceived hypocrisy that irritates Holden. It is this cynicism that causes him to distance himself from other people despite wanting connection as well. Holden is very much a character of contradiction; at seventeen years of age, he is six feet two-and-a-half inches (189 cm) tall, and already has some grey hair ‚Äì though he himself admits that he sometimes acts more like a 13-year-old than an adult. He continually fails classes yet is thought of as a \\"hot shot\\" by his English teacher, with an obvious flair for writing. In The Catcher in the Rye Holden Caulfield is the narrator and main character of The Catcher in the Rye. The novel recounts Holden's week in New York City during Christmas break, circa 1948/49, following his expulsion from Pencey Prep, a preparatory school in Pennsylvania based loosely on Salinger's alma mater Valley Forge Military Academy. Holden Caulfield tells his story with surprising honesty from a hospital in California in a cynical and jaded language. In other works The character, as Holden Caulfield, appears in Salinger's \\"Slight Rebellion off Madison\\", published in the December 21, 1946, issue of The New Yorker. An earlier version of this story, titled \\"Are You Banging Your Head Against a Wall?\\" was accepted for publication by The New Yorker in October 1941, but was not published then because editors found the tone to be too desolate for its readership. An edited version of this short story later became the basis of several chapters in the middle-late section of The Catcher in the Rye dealing with Caulfield's date with Sally Hayes, during which he confesses his desire to run away with her, meets Carl Luce for drinks, and makes a drunken phone call to the Hayes' home. Unlike the similar sequence in the novel, Caulfield is on a Christmas break from school, and, in the story, the interlude with Sally is split into two occurrences. Also, the meeting with Carl Luce is considerably briefer in the story than in the novel. Caulfield also figures as a character in the short story \\"I'm Crazy\\", published in Colliers (December 22, 1945), and other members of the Caulfield family are featured in \\"Last Day of the Last Furlough\\", published in The Saturday Evening Post (July 15, 1944) and the unpublished short stories \\"The Last and Best of the Peter Pans\\" (c. 1942) and \\"The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls\\" (c. 1945). \\"I'm Crazy\\" is closely related to the first chapter of The Catcher in the Rye. It begins with Caulfield standing on a hill at Pencey Prep watching a football game below, and develops as Holden visits with his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, for a talk about his expulsion from school and his future. Several other details match those found in the first chapter of Catcher, including a reference to the mother of one of Caulfield's schoolmates and to his own mother sending him a gift of ice skates, but the story ends with his returning home instead of running away from school. Once home, he is not shown confronting his parents, who, according to the maid, are playing bridge. Instead, he goes to speak to Phoebe. Their dialogue is similar to that which appears in the later chapters of The Catcher in the Rye. The other notable feature of the story is that his sister Viola gets her first, and only, mention in the Caulfield saga. \\"This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise\\" (Esquire, 1945) has a mention of Holden missing in action during the war. Green Day wrote a song titled \\"Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?\\" for their second studio album Kerplunk (1992) after lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong read The Catcher in the Rye. Initially, he gave up on reading it after dropping out from Pinole Valley High School when he was 18 years old. Caulfield family in other works \\"Last Day of the Last Furlough\\" relates the final day of Babe Gladwaller before he leaves to fight in World War II. Gladwaller spends part of the day with his little sister before Vincent Caulfield arrives. At that point Vincent is a fellow soldier about to leave for the war. Vincent announces that his brother, Holden, has been declared missing in action. There is some ambiguity here because Holden is both alive and a high school student in ‚ÄúCatcher,‚Äù which was written and published after the war, so it is not possible for him to have been a soldier during the 1940s and a high school student in the early 50s. It is unclear how many Caulfield children there are and who is who. For instance, many have speculated that Holden‚Äôs brother, D.B., is actually Vincent. However, Salinger wrote that Vincent died in World War II, and ‚ÄúThe Catcher in the Rye‚Äù was published in 1951. At that time, D.B. is alive and working as a writer in Hollywood. Gladwaller's relationship with his younger sister can be seen as a parallel to Caulfield's relationship with Phoebe. \\"The Last and Best of the Peter Pans\\" relates the story of Vincent's draft questionnaire being hidden by his mother. The events occur just after the death of Kenneth (later renamed Allie) and reveal the anxiety of Mary Moriarity, an actress and Caulfield's mother. The story is notable for the appearance of Phoebe and Vincent's statements about a child crawling off a cliff. In \\"The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls\\", Vincent (D.B.) recalls the day his brother Kenneth (Allie) died. The story is set at the Caulfield summer home on Cape Cod. Several details make their way from this story into Catcher, including the characterization of Allie; Allie's poetry-inscribed left-handed baseball mitt; Vincent's girlfriend, Helen, who keeps her kings in the back row (like Jane Gallagher); and Caulfield's critical view of others. While the cause of death in Catcher is leukemia, here it is due to an unspecified heart condition. Toward the end of the story, Kenneth and Vincent are on the beach. Kenneth decides to go swimming and is knocked out by a wave. Holden, just home from camp, is waiting on the porch with his suitcases as Vincent comes back with Kenneth's unconscious body. Kenneth dies later the same night. The story was reportedly sold to a magazine, only to be taken back by Salinger before publication. Another short story of note with relationship to Caulfield is \\"The Boy in the People Shooting Hat\\", which was submitted to The New Yorker sometime between 1948 and 1949 but was never published. It focuses on a fight between two characters named Bobby and Stradlater over Bobby's feelings about Jane Gallagher. This story appears to form the basis for several key scenes in the first several chapters of The Catcher in the Rye. In Seymour: An Introduction a Curtis Caulfield is mentioned in passing as \\"an exceptionally intelligent and likable boy\\" who appeared on the same radio show as Seymour and the other Glass children. He is reportedly \\"killed during one of the landings in the Pacific\\". It is posible that Vincent is renamed Curtis, as ‚ÄúSeymour‚Äù was published in 1959, and both Curtis and Vincent are killed in the Pacific during World War II. None of Salinger‚Äôs works to date have clarified exactly how many Caulfied children there were or who (aside from the Kenneth/Allie character) might have been the same person, but simply renamed in a later work. In \\"The Stranger\\", published in Collier's December 1, 1945, Babe Gladwaller and his sister Mattie (a proto-type for Phoebe) visit Vincent Caulfield's former girlfriend, now married, to tell her about his death and deliver a poem he wrote about her. Cultural impact Holden Caulfield is one of the most enduring characters in 20th-century American fiction. It has been suggested that Salinger himself related so closely to Holden that he was protective of the character. This was the reason he was unwilling to allow filming of the book or use of the character by other writers.\\"Holden Caulfield, It's Time We Let Go\\", Atlantic Wire, October 16, 2012. Accessed 15 February 2013 The Catcher in the Rye is required reading in many high school English courses, although it has been banned from some school libraries by parent and teacher groups opposed due to its use of profanity and perceived glorification of rebellion.

Travel agencies can provide outdoor recreation activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, package tours, insurance, guide books, public transport timetables, car rentals, and bureau de change services. Travel agencies can also serve as general sales agents for airlines that do not have offices in a specific region. A travel agency's main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. They do not keep inventory in-hand unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or other group event. Business model Travel agencies often receive commissions and other benefits and incentives from providers or may charge a fee to the end users. Hotel owners and tour operators typically pay a higher commission rate to travel agencies, whereas airlines typically pay a low commission. The customer is normally not made aware of how much the travel agent is earning in commissions and other benefits. A 2016 survey of 1,193 travel agents in the United States found that on average 78% of their revenue was from commissions and 22% was generated from fees. Travel technology Travel agencies use the services of the major computer reservations systems, also known as global distribution systems (GDS), including: Amadeus CRS, Galileo GDS, Sabre, and Worldspan, which is a subsidiary of Travelport, which allow for comparison and sorting of hotel and flight rates with multiple companies. Bookings made via travel agents, including online travel agents, may or may not be confirmed instantly. Unlike online travel agencies, metasearch engines and scraper sites, such as Skyscanner, Kayak.com, Rome2rio, and TripAdvisor, may or may not have their own booking engine, and instead provide results for search queries and then divert traffic to service providers or online travel agencies for booking. Travel agents may also work with airline consolidators. Types of agencies Booking Holdings and Expedia Group, both online travel agencies, are the largest travel agencies on the list of top earning travel companies. Travel agencies can be multinational companies, referred to as \\"multiples\\" in the United Kingdom. They can also be medium-sized organizations, referred to as \\"miniples\\" in the United Kingdom, or can be independent, small companies. They can be structured as a limited liability company, a sole proprietorship, or can be set up as a host, franchising, or consortium structure, such as in the case of CWT. A traditional travel agent may work for a travel agency or work freelance. Helloworld Travel is an example of a franchised travel agency, giving agents access to internal systems for product and bookings. While most point-to-point travel is now booked online, traditional agents specialize in niche markets such as corporate travel, luxury travel, cruises, complicated and important trips, and specialty trips. Other niche markets include travelers with disabilities, travelers over the age of 60, women traveling alone, LGBT tourism, the needs of residents in an upmarket commuter town or suburb, or a particular group interested in a similar activity, such as a sport. Examples include StudentUniverse and STA Travel, which specialize in youth travel, or CWT, which caters to corporate travel. Many use telecommuting to reduce overhead or provide concierge services. Agents can act as \\"travel consultants\\" with flawless knowledge of destination regions and specialize in topics like nautical tourism or cultural tourism. Many traditional agents prefer the term \\"travel advisor\\" as opposed to \\"travel agent\\" to emphasize their advice, expertise, and connections that are of great value. Outbound travel agencies offer multi-destinations; inbound travel agencies are based in the destination and deliver an expertise on that location. Licensing In many countries, all travel agencies are required to be licensed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Many are also bonded and represented by IATA, and, for those that issue air tickets, the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) in the United Kingdom, and the Airline Reporting Corporation in the United States also serve those purposes. ABTA ‚Äì The Travel Association and the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), represent travel agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively. History In 1758, Cox & Kings became the first travel agency in modern history. In 1840, the Abreu Agency was established in Porto by Bernardo Abreu, becoming the world's first agency to open its services to the public. A Thomas Cook travel agency in the United Kingdom, which ceased operating in 2019. In 1841, Thomas Cook, a Baptist preacher who believed that alcohol was to blame for social problems, reached an agreement with the Midland Railway to organize the transportation of 500 members of his temperance movement from the Leicester Campbell Street railway station to a rally in Loughborough in exchange for a commission. He formed Thomas Cook & Son, which later became The Thomas Cook Group. It filed bankruptcy and underwent liquidation in 2019. In 1871, Dean and Dawson was founded in the United Kingdom and in the 1950s, it was acquired by Thomas Cook. In 1886, the Polytechnic Touring Association was founded in the United Kingdom. In 1887, Walter T. Brownell established Brownell Travel, the first travel agency in the United States, and led 10 travelers on a European tour setting sail from New York on the SS Devonia. Originally, travel agencies largely catered to middle and upper-class customers but they became more commonplace with the development of commercial aviation. In 1923, after being treated badly by a British travel agency, K. P. Chen formed what became the China Travel Service, the first travel agency in China. The industry suffered during World War II. However, the Post‚ÄìWorld War II economic expansion in mass-market package tours resulted in the proliferation of travel agencies catering to the working class. In 1905, Nippon Travel Agency became the first travel agency in Japan. In 1929, Intourist was formed as the official state travel agency of the Soviet Union, with the goal of convincing outsiders to visit the country. During the Cold War, travel agents were used by people from Western countries to travel behind the Iron Curtain. In 1951, the precursor to Helloworld Travel became one of the first travel agencies in Australia. In 1955, Henderson Travel Service became the first black-owned travel company and the first to take large groups of black tourists to Africa. In the early 1980s, American Airlines' Sabre unit created a direct-to-consumer booking tool for flights, hotels and cars called eAAsySabre. In 1989, with the liberalization of travel for South Koreans, Mode Tour became the first travel agency in the country. In 1991, Hotel Reservations Network, the precursor of Hotels.com, was founded. At first, hotels did not pay much in commissions. With the advent of the internet, travel agencies migrated online and underwent disintermediation by the reduction in costs caused by removing layers from the package holiday distribution network. In 1994, Travelweb.com launched as the first online directory of hotels. In 1995, Internet Travel Network sold the first airline ticket via the World Wide Web. In October 1996, Expedia.com, funded with hundreds of millions of dollars by Microsoft launched as the first large online travel agency. At the same time, Cheapflights started as a listing service for flight deals from consolidators. In 1998, Lastminute.com was founded in the United Kingdom. In 1999, European airlines began eliminating or reducing commissions, while Singapore Airlines did so in parts of Asia. In 2002, several airlines in the United States did the same, which led to an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging collusion among the airlines, that was decided on appeal in 2009. In 2007, the launch of the iPhone and related mobile apps increased travel bookings made online. In 2008, the launch of Airbnb created an online marketplace for spare bedrooms and apartments. In 2011, the launch of HotelTonight highlighted instantaneous same-day hotel room booking. Outlook According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2018, there were 78,800 people who worked as travel agents for their full-time jobs. That number is projected to decrease by 6% over the next 10 years. The average salary was $40,660 per year, in 2019. Several reports show that the number of people using travel agents to book travel has been increasing.

It is similar to a harmonium and is used to provide a drone in a practice session or concert of Indian classical music. It is used as an accompaniment to other instruments and notably the flute. The shruti box is also used in classical singing. In classical singing, the shruti box is used to help tune the voice. The use of the shruti box has widened with the cross-cultural influences of world music and new-age music to provide a drone for many other instruments as well as vocalists. Adjustable buttons allow tuning. Nowadays, electronic shruti boxes are commonly used, which are called shruthi pettige in Kannada, shruti petti in Tamil and Telugu and sur peti in Hindi. Recent versions also allow for changes to be made in the tempo, and the notes such as Madhyamam, Nishadam to be played in place of the usual three notes (i.e., Lower shadjam, panchamam, and the upper shadjam). History Before the arrival of the harmonium in the Indian subcontinent, musicians used either a tambura or a specific pitch reference instrument, such as the nadaswaram, to produce the drone. Some forms of music such as Yakshagana used the pungi reedpipe as drone. After the Western small pump harmonium became popular, musicians would modify the harmonium to automatically produce the reference pitch. Typically, one would open up the cover and adjust the stop of the harmonium to produce a drone. Later, a keyless version of the harmonium was invented for the specific purpose of producing the drone sound. It was given the name shruti box or sruti box. These types of instruments had controls on the top or on the side of the box for controlling the pitch. The shruti box is enjoying a renaissance in the West amongst traditional and contemporary musicians, who are using it for a range of different styles. In the early nineties, traditional Irish singer N√≥ir√≠n N√≠ Riain brought the shruti box to Ireland, giving it a minor place in traditional Irish music. More recently Scottish folk artist Karine Polwart has championed the instrument, using it on some of her songs. Singers find it very useful as an accompaniment and instrumentalists enjoy the drone reference it gives to play along with.

His route is indicated, railroad track style, in dark blue Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, variously rendered in English as John of Pian de Carpine, John of Plano Carpini or Joannes de Plano (ca 1185\\"um 1185\\" in Mittelalter Lexikon: \\"Johannes de Piano Carpini\\". ‚Äì 1 August 1252), was a medieval Italian diplomat, archbishop and explorer and one of the first Europeans to enter the court of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. He is the author of the earliest important Western account of northern and central Asia, Rus, and other regions of the Mongol dominion. He was the Primate of Serbia, based in Antivari, from 1247 to 1252. Life before the journey Giovanni appears to have been a native of Umbria, in central Italy. His surname was derived from Pian del Carpine (literally \\"Hornbeam Plain\\"), an area known later as Magione, between Perugia and Cortona. He was one of the companions and disciples of his near-contemporary and countryman Saint Francis of Assisi. Highly-esteemed within the Franciscan order, Giovanni had a prominent role in the propagation of its teachings in northern Europe, holding in succession the offices of warden (custos) in Saxony and provincial (minister) of Germany. He may also have held positions in Barbary and Cologne, and been provincial of Spain. Background to his travels Giovanni was provincial of Germany at the time of the great Mongol invasion of eastern Europe and the Battle of Legnica (modern Legnickie Pole) on 9 April 1241. The defeat of European forces at Legnica led almost to √ñgedei, Khan of the Mongol Empire, controlling most of Eastern Europe. In Europe, dread of the \\"Tatars\\" (Mongols) was still widespread four years later, when Pope Innocent IV decided to dispatch the first formal Catholic mission to the Mongols. The missionaries were sent partly in protest at the Mongol invasion of Christendom and partly to gain information regarding the Khan's intentions and military strength. Giovanni's travels Pope Innocent IV chose Giovanni to head this mission, and apparently was in charge of nearly everything in the mission. As a papal legate, he bore a letter from the Pope to the Great Khan, Cum non solum. \\"At the age of sixty-three Carpini embarked from Lyon,\\"Montalbano, p.593. where the Pope then resided, on Easter day (16 April 1245), accompanied by another friar, Stephen of Bohemia, who broke down at Kaniv near Kyiv and was left behind. After seeking counsel of an old friend, Wenceslaus, king of Bohemia, Giovanni was joined at Wroc≈Çaw by another Franciscan, Benedykt Polak, appointed to act as interpreter. The route passed by Kiev, entered the Tatar posts at Kaniv, and then ran across the Nepere to the Don and Volga. Giovanni is the first Westerner to give us the modern names for these rivers. On the Volga stood the Ordu, or camp, of Batu, the famous conqueror of eastern Europe and supreme Mongol commander on the western frontiers of the empire. He was one of the most senior princes of the house of Genghis Khan. Here the envoys, with their presents, had to pass between two fires to remove possible injurious thoughts and poisons,Fiovanni's Ystoria Mongalorum, section X. before being presented to the prince (beginning of April 1246). Batu ordered them to proceed to the court of the supreme Khan in Mongolia. On Easter day once more (8 April 1246), they started on the second and most formidable part of their journey. They were \\"so ill\\", writes the legate, \\"that we could scarcely sit a horse; and throughout all that Lent our food had been nought but millet with salt and water, and with only snow melted in a kettle for drink\\". Their bodies were tightly bandaged so they could endure the excessive fatigue of this enormous ride, which took them across the Jaec or Ural River, and north of the Caspian Sea and the Aral to the Jaxartes or Syr Darya (quidam fluvius magnus cujus nomen ignoramus, \\"a big river whose name we do not know\\"), and the Muslim cities that then stood on its banks. Then they went along the shores of the Dzungarian lakes until, on the feast of St Mary Magdalene (22 July), they reached the imperial camp called Sira Orda (i.e., Yellow Pavilion), near Karakorum and the Orkhon River. Giovanni and his companions rode an estimated 3000 miles in 106 days. Since the death of √ñgedei Khan, the imperial authority was in interregnum and G√ºy√ºk, √ñgedei's eldest son, was designated to the throne. His formal election in a great Kurultai, or diet of the tribes, took place while the friars were at Sira Orda, which entailed the gathering of 3000 to 4000 envoys and deputies from all parts of Asia and eastern Europe, bearing homage, tribute and presents. On 24 August they witnessed the formal enthronement at another camp in the vicinity called the Golden Ordu, after which they were presented to the new emperor. The great Khan, G√ºy√ºk, refused the invitation to become Christian, and demanded rather that the Pope and rulers of Europe should come to him and swear allegiance to him. The Khan did not dismiss the expedition until November. He gave them a letter to the Pope--written in Mongol, Arabic, and Latin--that was a brief imperious assertion of the Khan's office as the scourge of God. They began a long winter journey home. Often they had to lie on the bare snow, or on ground scraped bare of snow with a foot. They reached Kiev on 10 June 1247. There, and on their further journey, the Slavonic Christians welcomed them as risen from the dead, with festive hospitality. Crossing the Rhine at Cologne, they found the Pope still at Lyon, and delivered their report and the Khan's letter. Not long afterward, Giovanni was rewarded with the archbishopric of Primate of Serbia in Antivari in Dalmatia, and was sent as legate to Louis IX of France. He lived only five years following the hardships of his journey. He died, according to the Franciscan Martyrology and other authorities, on 1 August 1252.  His books  The Ystoria Mongalorum is the report compiled by Carpine, of his trip to the Mongol Empire. Written in the 1240s, it is the oldest European account of the Mongols. Carpine was the first European to try to chronicle Mongol history. Two versions of the Ystoria Mongalorum are known to exist: Carpine's own and another, usually referred to as the Tartar Relation.

A variant played in Punjab and known as gharha as is a part of Punjabi folk traditions. Its analogue in Rajasthan is known as the madga and pani mataqa (\\"water jug\\"). The ghatam is one of the most ancient percussion instruments of India. It is a clay pot with narrow mouth. From the mouth, it slants outwards to form a ridge. Made mainly of clay backed with brass or copper filings with a small amount of iron filings, the pitch of the ghatam varies according to its size. The pitch can be slightly altered by the application of plasticine clay or water.Reck, David B. (1999). \\"Musical Instruments: Southern Area\\". Routledge. In: Arnold, Alison; ed. (2000). Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. South Asia: The Indian Subcontinent. Vol. 5. Garland, New York/London. Although the ghatam is the same shape as an ordinary Indian domestic clay pot, it is made specifically to be played as an instrument. The tone of the pot must be good and the walls should be of even thickness to produce an even tone. Ghatams are mostly manufactured in Manamadurai, a place near Madurai in Tamil Nadu. Though this instrument is manufactured in other places like Chennai and Bangalore, too, Manamadurai ghatams have special tonal quality. It is believed that the mud is of special quality. The Manamadurai gha·π≠am is a heavy, thick pot with tiny shards of brass mixed into the clay. This type of gha·π≠am is harder to play but produces a sharp metallic ringing sound which is favored by some players. Playing The pot is usually placed on the lap of the performer, with the mouth facing the belly. The performer uses the fingers, thumbs, palms, and heels of the hands to strike its outer surface to produce different sounds. Different tones can be produced by hitting areas of the pot with different parts of the hands. Sometimes the ghatam is turned around so that the mouth faces the audience and the performer plays on the neck of the instrument. The ghatam can be moved to other positions while being played. Occasionally, the performer will, to the amusement of the audience, toss the instrument up in the air and catch it. The ghatam is ideal for playing rhythmic patterns in very fast tempo.Bonnie C. Wade. Music in India: the classical traditions. 2008. Pp 134-135. Etymology The word gha·π≠a in Sanskrit means \\"pot\\". Variations of this term are used in modern Indian languages. Similar instruments The madga is a north Indian version of the south Indian gha·π≠am and is made from a very special clay. The maker sometimes adds some kind of metal or graphite dust to the clay which is responsible for the blue-gray appearance and for the special sound. The madga can be played similarly to the gha·π≠am. Loud bass tones can be produced if one hits with the flat hand the opening at the top of the instrument. The madga can be played with mallets (sticks) and there are many sounds which can be produced with this instrument. It is thinner than a gha·π≠am but very stable and not as fragile as one might think.

In general, a property owner has the right to recover possession of their property from unauthorised possessors through legal action such as ejectment. However, in the English common law tradition, courts have long ruled that when someone occupies a piece of property without permission and the property's owner does not exercise their right to recover their property for a significant period of time, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their right to exclude, but an entirely new title to the property \\"springs up\\" in the adverse possessor. In effect, the adverse possessor becomes the property's new owner. Over time, legislatures have created statutes of limitations that specify the length of time that owners have to recover possession of their property from adverse possessors. In the United States, for example, these time limits vary widely between individual states, ranging from as low as three years to as long as 40 years. Although the elements of an adverse possession action are different in every jurisdiction, a person claiming adverse possession is usually required to prove non-permissive use of the property that is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, adverse and continuous for the statutory period. Personal property, traditionally known as 'chattel', may also be adversely possessed, but owing to the differences in the nature of real and chattel property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, and favour the legal owner rather than the adverse possessor. Claims for adverse possession of chattel often involve works of art. History In Roman law, usucapio laws allowed someone who was in possession of a good without title to become the lawful proprietor if the original owner did not appear after some time (one or two years), unless the good was obtained illegally (by theft or force). Stemming from Roman law and its successor, the Napoleonic Code, adopted as the basis of law in France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and also, in part, by the Netherlands and Germany, adverse possession generally recognises two time periods for the acquisition of property: 30 years and some lesser time period, depending on the bona fides of the possessor and the location of the parties involved. Parliament passed England's first general statute limiting the right to recover possession of land in 1623. At common law, if entitlement to possession of land was in dispute (originally only in what were known as real actions), the person claiming a right to possession was not allowed to allege that the land had come into their possession in the past (in older terminology that he had been 'put into seisin') at a time before the reign of Henry I. The law recognised a cutoff date going back into the past, before which date the law would not be interested. There was no requirement for a defendant to show any form of adverse possession. As time went on, the date was moved by statute‚Äîfirst to the reign of Henry II, and then to the reign of Richard I. No further changes were made of this kind. By the reign of Henry VIII the fact that there had been no changes to the cutoff date had become very inconvenient. A new approach was taken whereby the person claiming possession had to show possession of the land for a continuous period, a certain number of years (60, 50 or 30 depending on the kind of claim made) before the date of the claim. Later statutes have shortened the limitation period in most common law jurisdictions. At traditional English common law, it was not possible to obtain title to property of the Crown by means of adverse possession. This principle was embodied by the Latin maxim nullum tempus occurrit regi ('no time runs against the king'). In the United States, this privilege was carried over to the federal and state governments; government land is immune from loss by adverse possession. Land with registered title in some Torrens title systems is also immune, for example, land that has been registered in the Hawaii Land Court system.United States v. Fullard-Leo, 66 F.Supp. 782 (D.C. Haw. 1944), affirmed 331 U.S. 256 (1947). In the common law system of England and its historical colonies, local legislatures‚Äîsuch as Parliament in England or American state legislatures‚Äîgenerally create statutes of limitations that bar the owners from recovering the property after a certain number of years have passed. England and Wales Adverse possession is one of the most contentious methods of acquiring property, albeit one that has played a huge role in the history of English land. Historically, if someone possessed land for long enough, it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a good title. This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the Middle Ages, those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned. A more modern function has been that land which is disused or neglected by an owner may be converted into another's property if continual use is made. Squatting in England has been a way for land to be efficiently utilised, particularly in periods of economic decline. Before the Land Registration Act 2002, if a person had possessed land for 12 years, then at common law, the previous owner's right of action to eject the \\"adverse possessor\\" would expire. The common legal justification was that under the Limitation Act 1623, just like a cause of action in contract or tort had to be used within a time limit, so did an action to recover land. This promoted the finality of litigation and the certainty of claims.Law Reform Committee, 21st Report, Final Report on Limitation of Actions (1977) Cmnd 6923, para 1.7. Time would start running when someone took exclusive possession of land, or part of it, and intended to possess it adversely to the interests of the current owner. Provided the common law requirements of \\"possession\\" that was \\"adverse\\" were fulfilled, after 12 years, the owner would cease to be able to assert a claim. Different rules are in place for the limitation periods of adverse possession in unregistered landLimitation Act 1980 ss 15 and 17. and registered land.Land Registration Act 1925 s 75 or Land Registration Act 2002 Sch 6, depending on when the limitation period is completed. However, in the Land Registration Act 2002 adverse possession of registered land became much harder. In recent times the Land Registry has made the process of claiming Adverse Possession and being awarded ‚Äútitle absolute‚Äù more difficult. Simply occupying or grazing the land will no longer justify the grant of title, instead the person in adverse possession must demonstrate commitment to own and utilise to the exclusion of all other the land intended to be claimed. =Land Registration Act 2002= The rules for unregistered land remained as before. But under the LRA 2002 Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor is entitled to apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar then contacts the registered title holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the 2002 Act, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.See generally JE Stake, 'The Uneasy Case for Adverse Possession' (2000‚Äì2001) 89 Georgetown Law Journal 2419. =Requirements= Before the considerable hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward. First, under Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Limitation Act 1980, the time when adverse possession began was when \\"possession\\" was taken. This had to be more than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period.e.g. Leigh v Jack (1879) 5 Ex D 264. But \\"possession\\" did not require actual occupation. So in Powell v McFarlane,(1979) 38 P&CR; 352. it was held to be \\"possession\\" when Mr Powell, from age 14, let his cows roam into Mr McFarlane's land. The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an intention to possess the land. Mr Powell lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: it was only later that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12-year time limit on McFarlane's claim to have expired. Third, possession is not considered \\"adverse\\" if the person is there with the owner's consent. For example, in BP Properties Ltd v Buckler, Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life.(1988) 55 P&CR; 337. Fourth, under the Limitation Act 1980 sections 29 and 30, the adverse possessor must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any express way, or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly. =Human Rights challenges= In JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham, Mr and Mrs Graham had been let a part of Mr Pye's land, and then the lease had expired. Mr Pye refused to renew a lease, on the basis that this might disturb getting planning permission. In fact the land remained unused, Mr Pye did nothing, while the Grahams continued to retain a key to the property and used it as part of their farm. At the end of the limitation period, they claimed the land was theirs. They had in fact offered to buy a licence from Mr Pye, but the House of Lords held that this did not amount to an acknowledgement of title that would deprive them of a claim. Having lost in the UK courts, Mr Pye took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that his business should receive ¬£10 million in compensation because it was a breach of his right under ECHR Protocol 1, article 1 to \\"peaceful enjoyment of possessions\\".The point has been made by O Jones, Out with the Owners: The Eurasian Sequels to \\"J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd v. United Kingdom\\" (2008) 27 Civil Justice Quarterly 260‚Äì276, that adverse possession should be incapable of infringing the ECHR's concept of the right to property precisely because the person deprived has given up \\"possession\\". The Court rejected this, holding that it was within a member state's margin of appreciation to determine the relevant property rules.[2008] 1 EHRLR 132. Otherwise, a significant limit on the principle in the case of leases is that adverse possession actions will only succeed against the leaseholder, and not the freeholder once the lease has expired.Fairweather v St Marylebone Property Co Ltd [1963] AC 510. However the main limitation remains that the 2002 legislation appears to have emasculated the principle of adverse possession, because the Registrar now effectively informs owners of the steps to be taken to prevent adverse possession. =Timing= For registered land, adverse possession claims completed before 13 October 2003 (the date the 2002 Act came into force)Section 1 The Land Registration Act 2002 (Transitional Provisions) (No 2) Order 2003). are governed by section 75(1) and 75(2) of the Land Registration Act of 1925. The limitation period remains the same (12 years) but instead of the original owner's title to the land being extinguished, the original owner holds the land on trust for the adverse possessor.Section 75(1) Land Registration Act 1925. The adverse possessor can then apply to be the new registered proprietor of the land.Section 75(2) Land Registration Act 1925. For registered land, adverse possession claims completed after 13 October 2003 follow a different procedure. Where land is registered, the adverse possessor may henceforth apply to be registered as owner after 10 yearsSchedule 6 Paragraph 1 Land Registration Act 2002. of adverse possession and the Land Registry must give notice to the true owner of this application.Schedule 6 Paragraph 2 Land Registration Act 2002. This gives the landowner a statutory period of time [65 business days] to object to the adverse possession, object to the application on the ground that there has not actually been the necessary 10 years' adverse possession, and/or to serve a \\"counter-notice\\". If a counter-notice is served, then the application fails unless * it would be unconscionable because of an equity by estoppel for the registered proprietor to seek to dispossess the squatter and the squatter ought in the circumstances to be registered as proprietor, or * the squatter is for some other reason entitled to be registered as proprietor, or * the squatter has been in adverse possession of land adjacent to their own under the mistaken but reasonable belief that they are the owner of it, the exact line of the boundary with this adjacent land has not been determined and the estate to which the application relates was registered more than a year prior to the date of the application. Otherwise, the squatter becomes the registered proprietor according to the land registry. If the true owner is unable to evict the squatter in the two years following the first [unsuccessful] application, the squatter can apply again after this period and be successful despite the opposition of the owner. The process effectively prevents the removal of a landowner's right to property without their knowledge, while ensuring squatters have a fair way of exercising their rights. Where a tenant adversely possesses land, there is a presumption that they are doing so in a way that will benefit the landlord at the end of their term. If the land does not belong to their landlord, the land will become part of both the tenancy and the reversion. If the land does belong to their landlord, it would seem that it will be gained by the tenant but only for the period of their term.Smirk v Lyndale Developments Ltd [1974] 3 WLR 91. Since September 2012, squatting in a residential building is a criminal offence, but this does not prevent title being claimed by reason of adverse possession even if the claimant is committing a criminal offence.Blake, Joseph (31 August 2012). \\"Criminalising squatting hurts the poor and benefits the rich\\". The Guardian.\\"Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012\\". The National Archives. United States The Number of Years required for Adverse Possession in U.S. States =Requirements= The party seeking title by adverse possession may be called the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an adverse possession claim may be different in a number of states, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect the title of the disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, in a manner that is open and notorious, keep out others, and use it as if it were their own. Some states impose additional requirements. Many of the states have enacted statutes regulating the rules of adverse possession. Some states require a hostility requirement to secure adverse possession. While most states take an objective approach to the hostility requirement, some states require a showing of good faith. Good faith means that claimants must demonstrate that they had some basis to believe that they actually owned the property at issue. Four states east of the Mississippi that require good faith in some form are Georgia, Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin. Actual possession The disseisor must physically use the land as a property owner would, in accordance with the type of property, location, and uses (merely walking or hunting on land does not establish actual possession). The actions of the disseisor must change the state of the land (in the case of non-residential property, taking such actions as clearing, mowing, planting, harvesting fruit of the land, logging or cutting timber, mining, fencing, pulling tree stumps, running livestock and constructing buildings or other improvements) or, if the property is residential, maintaining the property for its intended use (taking such actions as mowing the yard, trimming trees and hedges, changing locks, repairing or replacing fixtures such as a swimming pool, sprinkler system, or appliances), all to the exclusion of its true owner. In Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that Cone failed to establish actual possession by occasionally visiting the land and hunting on it, because his actions did not change the land from a wild and natural state. Hostile possession The disseisor must have entered or used the land without permission from the true owner. The disseisor's motivations may be interpreted by the court in several ways, depending upon state law and precedent: *Objective view ‚Äì the land was used without true owner's permission and in a manner inconsistent with true owner's rights; *Bad faith or intentional trespass view ‚Äì the land was used with the adverse possessor's subjective intent to disregard or violate the actual property owner's rights; *Good faith view ‚Äì a few states require that the party claiming adverse possession must have mistakenly believed that it is their land. Some jurisdictions permit accidental adverse possession, as might occur as the result of a surveying error that places the boundary line between properties in the wrong location. Renters, hunters or others who enter the land with permission are not taking possession that is hostile to the title owner's rights. (mistaken possession in some jurisdictions does not constitute hostility) Open and notorious use The disseisor must possess the property in a manner that is capable of being seen. That is, the disseisor's use of the property must be sufficiently visible and apparent that it gives notice to the legal owner that someone may assert claim, and must be of such character that would give notice to a reasonable person. If legal owner has actual knowledge of the use, this element is met; it can be also met by fencing, opening or closing gates or an entry to the property, posted signs, crops, buildings, or animals that a diligent owner could be expected to know about. Continuous use The disseisor claiming adverse possession must hold that property continuously for the entire statute of limitations period, and use it as a true owner would for that time. Generally, the disseisor's openly hostile possession must be continual (although not necessarily constant) without challenge or permission from the lawful owner, but breaks in use that are consistent with how an owner would use the property will not prevent an adverse possession claim. Occasional activity on the land with long gaps in activity fail the test of continuous possession; courts have ruled that merely cutting timber at intervals, when not accompanied by other actions that demonstrate actual and continuous possession, fails to demonstrate continuous possession. If at any time during the statute of limitations period, the true owner ejects the disseisor from the land either verbally or through legal action, and the disseisor then returns and dispossesses him again, then the statute of limitations period begins anew. The statute of limitations applies only to the disseisor's time on the property, not how long the true owner may have been dispossessed of it (by, say, another disseisor who then left the property). However, if adverse possession is continuous between two or more successive disseisors without interruption, it may be possible for the second disseisor to claim adverse possession for the entire period based upon a legal doctrine known as tacking. Exclusive use The disseisor holds the land to the exclusion of the true owner. There may be more than one adverse possessor, taking as tenants in common, so long as the other elements are met. But adverse possession cannot be successfully claimed if, any time during the statutory period, the true owner uses the land for any reason. Additional requirements In addition to the basic elements of an adverse possession case, state law may require one or more additional elements to be proved by a person claiming adverse possession. Depending upon the state, additional requirements may include: *Color of title, claim of title, or claim of right. Color of title and claim of title involve a legal document that appears (incorrectly) to give the disseisor title. In some jurisdictions the mere intent to take the land as one's own may constitute \\"claim of right\\", with no documentation required. Other cases have determined that a claim of right exists if the person believes they have rightful claim to the property, even if that belief is mistaken.See, e.g., A negative example would be a timber thief who sneaks onto a property, cuts timber not visible from the road, and hauls the logs away at night. Their actions, though they demonstrate actual possession, also demonstrate knowledge of guilt, as opposed to claim of right. *Good faith (in a minority of states) or bad faith (sometimes called the \\"Maine Doctrine\\" although it is now abolished in Maine) *Improvement, cultivation, or enclosure *Payment of property taxes. This may be required by statute, such as in California,California Code of Civil Procedure Section 325. or just a contributing element to a court's determination of possession. Both payment by the disseisor and by the true owner are relevant. *Dispossession of land owned by a governmental entity: Generally, a disseisor cannot dispossess land legally owned by a government entity even if all other elements of adverse possession are met. One exception is when the government entity is acting like a business rather than a government entity. =Consequences= A metal plaque on the sidewalk of New York City declares that the crossing onto the private property is a revocable license (an agreement to use the property, not an invasion) to protect it from becoming a subject of an adverse possession. Some New York property owners go even further by actually closing their property to the public for one day each year in order to prove their exclusive control. A disseisor will be committing a civil trespass on the property he has taken and the owner of the property could cause him to be evicted by an action in trespass (\\"ejectment\\") or by bringing an action for possession. All common law jurisdictions require that an ejectment action be brought within a specified time, after which the true owner is assumed to have acquiesced. The effect of a failure by the true landowner to evict the adverse possessor depends on the jurisdiction, but will eventually result in title by adverse possession. In 2008, due to the volume of adverse possession and boundary dispute cases throughout New York City, the New York State Legislature amended and limited the ability of land to be acquired by adverse possession. Prior to the 2008 amendment, to acquire property by adverse possession, all that was required was a showing that the possession constituted an actual invasion of or infringement upon the owner's rights. Approximately eight (8) years after the 2008 amendment, on 30 June 2016, the New York State Appellate Division, First Department (i.e., the appellate court covering the territory of Manhattan) determined the legal questions concerning the scope of rights acquired by adverse possession and how the First Department would treat claims of adverse possession where title had vested prior to 2008. The Court specifically held that title to the adversely possessed property vested when the plaintiff \\"[S]atisfie[d] the requirement of the statute in effect at the relevant time.\\" In other words, if title had vested at some time \\"after\\" the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have to satisfy the adverse possession standards amended by the New York State Legislature in 2008; however, if title vested at some time \\"before\\" the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have lawfully acquired title to the disputed area by satisfying the pre-amendment standard for adverse possession. Hudson Square Hotel also resolved two often highly litigated issues in adverse possession cases where the air rights are more valuable than the underlying land itself: (a) \\"where\\" (i.e., in three-dimensional physical space) is an encroachment required in order for such encroachment to have any relevant operative effect or consequences under the law of adverse possession, and (b) \\"what\\" property rights are acquired as a result of title to the ground floor area (i.e., the land) vesting with the plaintiff. In Hudson Square Hotel the defendant argued that the plaintiff had only acquired title to the underlying land, but not the air rights, because the plaintiff never encroached above the two-story building. This argument was motivated, in part, by the fact that the zoning laws at the time permitted the owner of the land to build (i.e., develop) up to six (6) times the square footage of the ground floor area. For example, if the disputed area was 1,000 square feet, there would be 6,000 square feet of buildable square footage to potentially be won or lost by adverse possession. The Court clarified, \\"It is the encroachment on the land ... that allows title to pass to the adverse possessor.\\" In other words, the plaintiff did not need to encroach upon all six stories in order to adversely possess the air rights above the land. The Court also held, \\"With title to land come air rights.\\" In other words, by acquiring title to the land (i.e., ground floor area), the plaintiff also acquired ownership of the more valuable air rights that were derivative of title to the underlying land. In other jurisdictions, the disseisor acquires merely an equitable title; the landowner is considered to be a trustee of the property for the disseisor. Adverse possession extends only to the property actually possessed. If the original owner had a title to a greater area (or volume) of property, the disseisor does not obtain all of it. The exception to this is when the disseisor enters the land under a color of title to an entire parcel, their continuous and actual possession of a small part of that parcel will perfect their title to the entire parcel defined in their color of title. Thus a disseisor need not build a dwelling on, or farm on, every portion of a large tract in order to prove possession, as long as their title does correctly describe the entire parcel. In some jurisdictions, a person who has successfully obtained title to property by adverse possession may (optionally) bring an action in land court to \\"quiet title\\" of record in their name on some or all of the former owner's property. Such action will make it simpler to convey the interest to others in a definitive manner, and also serves as notice that there is a new owner of record, which may be a prerequisite to benefits such as equity loans or judicial standing as an abutter. Even if such action is not taken, the title is legally considered to belong to the new titleholder, with most of the benefits and duties, including paying property taxes to avoid losing title to the tax collector. The effects of having a stranger to the title paying taxes on property may vary from one jurisdiction to another. (Many jurisdictions have accepted tax payment for the same parcel from two different parties without raising an objection or notifying either party that the other had also paid.) Adverse possession does not typically work against property owned by the public. The process of adverse possession would require a thorough analysis if private property is taken by eminent domain, after which control is given to a private corporation (such as a railroad), and then abandoned. Where land is registered under a Torrens title registration system or similar, special rules apply. It may be that the land cannot be affected by adverse possession (as was the case in England and Wales from 1875 to 1926, and as is still the case in the state of MinnesotaMinn. Stat. 508.02.) or that special rules apply. Adverse possession may also apply to territorial rights. In the United States, Georgia lost an island in the Savannah River to South Carolina in 1990, when South Carolina had used fill from dredging to attach the island to its own shore. Since Georgia knew of this yet did nothing about it, the U.S. Supreme Court (which has original jurisdiction in such matters) granted this land to South Carolina, although the Treaty of Beaufort (1787) explicitly specified that the river's islands belonged to Georgia.Georgia v. South Carolina, 497 U.S. 376 (1990) see Georgia v. South Carolina. Squatter's rights Most cases of adverse possession deal with boundary line disputes between two parties who hold clear title to their property. The term \\"squatter's rights\\" has no precise and fixed legal meaning. In some jurisdictions the term refers to temporary rights available to squatters that prevent them, in some circumstances, from being removed from property without due process. For example, in England and Wales reference is usually to section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. In the United States, no ownership rights are created by mere possession, and a squatter may only take possession through adverse possession if the squatter can prove all elements of an adverse possession claim for the jurisdiction in which the property is located. As with any adverse possession claim, if a squatter abandons the property for a period, or if the rightful owner effectively removes the squatter's access even temporarily during the statutory period, or gives their permission, the \\"clock\\" usually stops. For example, if the required period in a given jurisdiction is twenty years and the squatter is removed after only 15 years, the squatter loses the benefit of that 15-year possession (i.e., the clock is reset at zero). If that squatter later retakes possession of the property, that squatter must, to acquire title, remain on the property for a full 20 years after the date on which the squatter retook possession. In this example, the squatter would have held the property for a total of 35 years (the original 15 years plus the later 20 years) to acquire title. Depending on the jurisdiction, one squatter may or may not pass along continuous possession to another squatter, known as \\"tacking\\". Tacking is defined as \\"The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period.\\"TACKING, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) There are three types of Privity: Privity of Contract; Privity of Possession; and Privity of Estate. One of the three types of privity is required in order for one adverse possessor to \\"tack\\" their time onto another adverse possessor in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one adverse possessor to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating \\"color of title.\\" A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary \\"continuous and hostile\\" element. Evidence that a squatter paid rent to the owner would defeat adverse possession for that period. =England and Wales= 'Squatting' became a criminal offence in England/Wales under Section 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. This section also inserted an immediate power of entry to the premises into Section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. =United States= In the United States, the concept of squatter's rights is generally used to refer to a specific form of adverse possession where the disseisor holds no title to any properties adjoining the property under dispute. In most jurisdictions of the United States, few squatters can meet the legal requirements for adverse possession. Comparison to homesteading Adverse possession is in some ways similar to homesteading. Like the disseisor, the homesteader may gain title to property by using the land and fulfilling certain other conditions. In homesteading, however, the possession of the property is not hostile; the land is either considered to have no legal owner or is owned by the government. The government allows the homesteader to use the land with the expectation that the homesteader who fulfills the requirements necessary for the homestead will gain title to the property. The principles of homesteading and squatter's rights embody the most basic concept of property and ownership, which can be summarized by the adage \\"possession is nine-tenths of the law,\\" meaning the person who uses the property effectively owns it. Likewise, the adage, \\"use it or lose it,\\" applies. The principles of homesteading and squatter's rights predate formal property laws; to a large degree, modern property law formalizes and expands these simple ideas. The principle of homesteading is that if no one is using or possessing property, the first person to claim it and use it consistently over a specified period owns the property. Squatter's rights embodies the idea that if one property owner neglects property and fails to use it, and a second person starts to tend and use the property, then after a certain period the first person's claim to the property is lost and ownership transfers to the second person, who is actually using the property. The legal principle of homesteading, then, is a formalization of the homestead principle in the same way that the right of adverse possession is a formalization of the pre-existing principle of squatter's rights. The essential ideas behind the principles of homesteading and squatter's rights hold generally for any type of item or property of which ownership can be asserted by simple use or possession. In modern law, homesteading and the right of adverse possession refer exclusively to real property. In the realm of personal property, the same impulse is summarized by the adage \\"finders, keepers\\" and is formalized by laws and conventions concerning abandoned property. Copyrights Some legal scholars have proposed the extension of the concept of adverse possession to intellectual property law, in particular to reconcile intellectual property and antitrust lawConstance E. Bagley and Gavin Clarkson, \\"Adverse Possession for Intellectual Property: Adapting an Ancient Concept to Resolve Conflicts between Antitrust and Intellectual Property Laws in the Information Age\\" Harvard Journal of Law & Technology 16:2 (Spring 2003) full text. or to unify copyright law and property law.Michael James Arrett, \\"Adverse Possession of Copyright: A Proposal to Complete Copyright's Unification with Property Law\\", Journal of Corporation Law 31:1 (October 2005) abstract; full text (pay). Adverse possession of easements Some jurisdictions merge the concept of adverse possession with that of prescription, so that adverse possession may be used to gain various incorporeal rights to land as well as land itself. Under this theory, adverse possession grants only those rights in the disseized property that are 'taken' by the disseisor. For example, a disseisor might choose to take an easement rather than the entire fee title to the property. In this manner, it is possible to disseize an easement, under the legal doctrine of prescription. This must also be done openly but need not be exclusive. Prescription is governed by different statutory and common law time limits to adverse possession. It is common practice in cities such as New York, where builders often leave sidewalk space or plazas in front of their buildings to meet zoning requirements, to close public areas they own periodically to prevent the creation of a permanent easement that would cloud their exclusive property rights. For the same reason, city sidewalks may have embedded markers along the property line around a plaza or open area announcing \\"This Space Not Dedicated\\" to indicate that although the public may use the space within the markers, it is still private property. If a property owner interferes with an easement upon their property in a manner that satisfies the requirements for adverse prescription (e.g. locking the gates to a commonly used area, and nobody does anything about it), he will successfully extinguish the easement. This is another reason to quiet title after a successful adverse possession or adverse prescription: it clarifies the record of who should take action to preserve the adverse title or easement while evidence is still fresh. For example, given a deeded easement to use someone else's driveway to reach a garage, if a fence or permanently locked gate prevents the use, nothing is done to remove and circumvent the obstacle, and the statutory period expires, then the easement ceases to have any legal force, although the deed held by the fee-simple owner stated that the owner's interest was subject to the easement. Strictly speaking, prescription works in a different way to adverse possession. Adverse possession is concerned with the extinction of the title of the original owner by a rule of limitation of actions. Prescription, on the other hand, is concerned with acquiring a right that did not previously exist. In the law of England and Wales, adverse possession and prescription are treated as being entirely different doctrines. The former being entirely statutory deriving from the Limitation Act 1980, the latter being possible under purely common law principles. Non-common law jurisdictions Some non- common law jurisdictions have laws similar to adverse possession. For example, Louisiana has a legal doctrine called acquisitive prescription, which is derived from French law. Theory Adverse possession exists to cure potential or actual defects in real estate titles by putting a statute of limitations on possible litigation over ownership and possession. Because of the doctrine of adverse possession, a landowner can be secure in title to their land. Otherwise, long-lost heirs of any former owner, possessor or lien holder of centuries past could come forward with a legal claim on the property. The doctrine of adverse possession prevents this. This means the law may be used to reward a person who possesses the land of another for a requisite period of time. Failure of a landowner to exercise and defend their property rights for a certain period may result in the permanent loss of the landowner's interest in the property. In economic terms, adverse possession encourages and rewards productive use of land.

Depending on the circumstances, it can be a violation of capabilities and human rights and can create economic inefficiencies; on the other hand, some supporters argue that it is central to certain religious laws and social and cultural histories and traditions.The World Bank. 2012. \\"Gender Equality and Development: World Development Report 2012.\\" Washington, D.C: The World Bank.Nussbaum, Martha C. 2003. \\"Women's Education: A Global Challenge.\\" \\"Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society\\" 29(2): 325‚Äì355 The term gender segregation is used in a similar way to sex segregation, even though sex and gender are usually considered distinct concepts.

Sex separation is common for public toilets and is often indicated by stick-figure gender symbols on the toilet doors. Definitions The term \\"sex\\" in \\"sex segregation\\" refers to apparent biological distinctions between men and women, used in contrast to \\"gender\\".Cohen, David S. 2010. \\"The Stubborn Persistence of Sex Segregation.\\" Columbia Journal of Gender and Law forthcoming 2010 The term \\"segregation\\" refers to separation of the sexes, which can be enforced by rules, laws, and policies, or be a de facto outcome in which people are separated by sex. Even as a de facto outcome, sex segregation taken as a whole can be caused by societal pressures, historical practices, and socialized preferences. Sex segregation can refer to literal physical and spatial separation by sex. The term is also used for the exclusion of one sex from participation in an occupation, institution, or group. Sex segregation can be complete or partial, as when members of one sex predominate within, but do not exclusively constitute, a group or organization. In the United States some scholars use the term ‚Äúsex separation‚Äù and not sex segregation\\". Robert B. Barnet (1970) The Constitutionality of Sex Separation in School Desegregation Plans, volume 37, Chicago L Review, p. 296 The term gender apartheid (or sexual apartheid) also has been applied to segregation of people by gender, implying that it is sexual discrimination. If sex segregation is a form of sex discrimination, its effects have important consequences for gender equality and equity. A sign mandating sex segregation on a women's only car in India. Types Sex segregation can occur in both public and private contexts, and be classified in many ways. Legal and gender studies scholar David S. Cohen offers one taxonomy in categorizing sex segregation as mandatory, administrative, permissive, or voluntary. Mandatory and administrative sex segregation are required and enforced by governments in public environments, while permissive and voluntary sex segregation are stances chosen by public or private institutions, but within the capacity of the law. =Mandatory= Mandatory sex segregation is legally required and enforces separation based on sex. Examples include separation of men and women in prisons, law enforcement, military service, public toilets, and housing. These mandatory rules can be nuanced, as in military service, where sexes are often separated in laws about conscription, in housing, and in regulations on which sexes can participate in certain roles, like frontline infantry. Mandatory sex segregation also includes less obvious cases of separation, as when men and women are required to have same-sex attendants for body searches. Mandatory sex segregation can thus dictate parameters for employment in sex segregated spaces, including medical and care work contexts, and can be a form of occupational segregation. For example, a government may mandate that clinics hire female nurses to care for female patients. =Administrative= Segregation of women inmates in Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Administrative sex segregation involves public and government institutions segregating by sex in their operating capacity, rather than as the result of a formal mandate. Examples of administrative sex segregation include sex segregation in government sponsored medical research, sports leagues, public hospitals with shared rooms, rehabilitation programs, and some public education facilities. Administrative sex segregation can occur in these environments simply as through the provisioning of sex segregated public toilets despite limited explicit legal requirements to do so. =Permissive= Permissive sex segregation is segregation which is explicitly permitted by law, i.e. affirmatively authorized, but not necessarily legally required or encouraged. Permissive sex segregation exempts certain things from anti-sex-discrimination laws, often allowing for, among others, segregation of religious and military schools, undergraduate schools that have traditionally admitted based on sex, health clubs, athletic teams, social fraternities and sororities, choirs and choruses, voluntary youth service organizations such as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, father/son and mother/daughter activities, and sex-exclusive beauty pageants and scholarships. =Voluntary= Sex segregation that is neither legally mandated, nor enacted in an administrative capacity, nor explicitly permitted by law, is recognized as voluntary sex segregation. Voluntary sex segregation refers to lack of explicit legal prescriptions; it does not necessarily indicate the free choice of either the segregated or the segregators, and it may be imposed by social and cultural norms. Voluntary sex segregation takes place in numerous national professional and interest-based membership organizations, local and larger clubs, professional sports teams, private recreational facilities, religious institutions, performing arts, and more. Theoretical explanations Within feminist theory and feminist legal theory, there are six main theoretical approaches that can be considered and used to analyze the causes and effects of sex segregation. They include libertarianism, equal treatment, difference feminism, anti-subordination, critical race feminism, and anti-essentialism. =Libertarianism= Libertarian feminist theory stems from ideologies similar to libertarian political theory; that legal and governmental institutions should not regulate choices and should allow people's free will to govern their life trajectories.Barnett, Randy E. 1998. \\"The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law\\". Libertarianism takes a free market approach to sex segregation saying that women have a natural right and are the most informed to make decisions for themselves but rejects special protections specifically for women.Posner, Richard. 1989. \\"Conservative Feminism\\". University of Chicago Legal F. Autonomy is central to libertarianism, so theorists believe that the government should not interfere with decision making or be concerned with reasoning behind such decisions since men and women culturally and naturally make different and often diverging choices. Policies and laws enforced by the government should not act to change any inherent differences between the sexes.Epstein, Richard A. 1999. \\"Liberty, Patriarchy, and Feminism.\\" University of Chicago Legal F (89). Libertarianism most directly relates to voluntary sex segregation as it maintains that the government should not regulate private institutions or entities' segregation by sex and should not regulate how individuals privately group themselves. Libertarian feminist David Berstein argues that while sex segregation can cause harm, guarding the freedom of choice for men and women is more important than preventing such sex segregation since methods of prevention can often cause more harm than good for both sexes. Women's health clubs are an example of how sex segregation benefits women since desegregation would interfere with women's abilities to exercise without the distraction of men and 'ogling' without any direct benefit to allowing men a membership.Bernstein, David E. 1999. \\"Sex Discrimination Laws Versus Civil Liberties\\" University of Chicago Legal F (133). Additionally, libertarians would allow for permissive sex segregation since it allows people to choose how to organize their interactions and relationships with others. Libertarian feminists acknowledge that there is legal precedence for sex segregation laws, but argue for such parameters to ensure equal treatment of similarly situated men and women. As such, libertarianism could allow or reject specific forms of sex segregation created to account for natural or biological differences between the sexes.Warnick, Ashlie. 2003. \\"Women: Freedom and Feminism in the Twenty-First Century.\\" edited by Wendy McElroy. =Equal treatment= Equal treatment theory or formal equity often works in tandem with libertarianism in that equal treatment theorists believe governments should treat men and women similarly when their situations are similar.MacKinnon, Catharine A. 2007. \\"Sex Equality.\\" 5.Halley, Janet. 2007. \\"Split Decisions: How and Why to Take a Break From Feminism.\\" 79. In countries whose governments have taken to legislation eliminating sex segregation, equal treatment theory is most frequently used as support for such rules and regulation.Chamallas, Martha. 2003. \\"Introduction to Feminist Legal Theory.\\" 35. For example, equal treatment theory was adopted by the many feminists during the United States' feminist movement in the 1970s. This utilization of equal treatment theory led to the adoption of intermediate scrutiny as a standard for sex discrimination on the basis that men and women should be treated equally when in similar situations. While equal treatment theory provides a sound framework for equality, application is quite tricky, as many critics question the standards by which men and women should be treated similarly or differently. In this manner, libertarianism and equal treatment theory provide good foundations for their agendas in sex segregation, but conceptually do not prevent it, leaving room for mandatory and administrative sex segregation to remain as long as separation is based on celebrated differences between men and women. Some forms of mandatory and administrative segregation may perpetuate sex segregation by depicting a difference between male and female employees where there is no such difference, as in combat exclusion policies.McSally, Martha. 2007. \\"Women in Combat: Is the Current Policy Obsolete?\\" Duke Judicial Gender Law and Policy 1011:14 =Difference feminism= Difference feminism arose from libertarianism and equal treatment theories' perceived failure to create systemic equality for women. Difference feminism celebrates biological, psychological, moral differences between men and women, accusing laws concerning sex segregation of diluting these important differences.Levit, Nancy and Robert R. M. Verchick. 2006. \\"Feminist Legal Theory: A Primer.\\" 8. Difference feminists believe that such laws not only ignore these important differences, but also can exclude participation of women in the world. Difference feminism's goal is to bring about a consciousness of women's femininity and to cause the revaluation of begin to revalue women's attributes in a more respectful, reverent manner. Difference feminism and equal treatment theory are quite contrasting feminist theories of sex segregation. Difference feminism often justifies sex segregation through women's and men's differences while equal treatment theory does not support separation because of differences in sex. Difference feminism, however, argues against segregation that stems from societal and \\"old-fashioned\\" differences between men and women, but believes that segregation that takes women's differences into account and promotes equality is acceptable, even going so far as to say that some forms of sex segregation are necessary to ensure equality, such as athletics and education, and policies such as Title IX. =Anti-subordination= Anti-subordination feminist theory examines sex segregation through power to ultimately whether women are treated or placed subordinately compared to men in a law or situation. The theory focuses on male dominance and female subordination and promotes destroying a sex-based hierarchy in legal and social institutions and preventing future hierarchies from arising.MacKinnon, Catharine. 1987. \\"Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law.\\" 40. Anti-subordination also supports laws that promote the status of women even if they lower men's status as a consequence.Colker. 1986. \\"Anti-Subordination Above All: Sex, Race, and Equal Protection.\\" NYU Law Review. 61(1003). Controversial applications of anti-subordination that can either perpetuate the subordination of women or create the subordination of men include sex segregation in education and in the military.Epstein, Cynthia F. 1997. \\"The Myths and Justifications of Sex Segregation in Higher Education: VMI and The Citadel.\\" Duke Gender Law and Pol'y 101:1475-76. =Critical race feminism= Critical race feminism developed due to the lack of racial inclusivity of feminist theories and lack of gender inclusivity of racial theories.Wing, Adrien Katherine. 2003. Introduction to \\"Critical Race Feminism: A Reader\\" ed. Adrien Katherine Wing. This theory is more global than the others, attempting to take into account the intersectionality of gender and race. Critical race feminism demands that theorists reexamine surface-level segregation and focus on how sex segregation stems from different histories, causing different effects based on race, especially for women of color. This segregation is evident in many racially divided countries, especially in the relationship between the end of race- segregated schools and sex segregation.Mayeri, Serena. 2006. \\"The Strange Career of Jane Crow: Sex Segregation and the Transformation of Anti- Discrimination Discourse\\" Yale Judiciary Law and Humanities 187(257):338. Critical race feminism critiques other theories' failure to take into account their different applications once race, class, sexual orientation, or other identity factors are included in a segregated situation.Harris, Angela P. 1990. \\"Race and Essentialism in Feminist Legal Theory.\\" Stanford Law Review 42:581-590. It creates the need to examine mandatory and administrative sex segregation to determine whether or if they sustain racial stereotypes, particularly towards women of color. Additionally, critical race feminists wonder whether permissive and voluntary sex segregation are socially acceptable manners by which to separate races and sexes or whether they maintain and perpetuate inequalities. Critical race feminism is a form of anti-essentialism (below). =Anti-essentialism= Anti-essentialists maintain that sex and gender categories are limiting and fail to include the unlimited variety of difference in human identity and impose identities rather than simply note their differences.Frug, Mary J. 1992. \\"Postmodern Legal Feminism.\\" 18.Levit, Nancy. 1996. \\"Feminism for Men: Legal Ideology and the Construction of Maleness.\\" UCLA Law Review 1037(1050). Theorists believe that there is variation in what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman, and by promoting the differences through sex segregation, people are confined to categories, limiting freedom. Anti-essentialists examine how society imposes specific identities within the sex dichotomy and how subsequently sex and gender hierarchies are created, perpetuated, and normalized. This theory requires that there is a specific disentanglement between sex and gender.Vald√©s, Francisco. 1995. \\"Queers, Sissies, Dykes, and Tomboys: Deconstructing the Conflation of \\"Sex,\\" \\"Gender,\\" and \\"Sexual Orientation\\" in Euro-American Law and Society.\\" California Law Review 83(1).Case, Mary Anne. 1998. \\"Unpacking Package Deals: Separate Spheres Are Not the Answer.\\" Denver University Law Review 75 (1305, 1317). Anti-essentialists believe that there should not be an idea of what constitutes masculinity or femininity, but that individual characteristics should be fluid to eliminate sex and gender-based stereotypes.Cho, Sumi and Robert Wesley. 2000. \\"Critical Race Coalitions: Key Moments that Performed the Theory.\\" 33 (1377, 1416). No specific types of sex segregation are outwardly promoted or supported by anti-essentialists since mandatory and administrative sex segregation reinforce power struggles between the sexes and genders while permissive or voluntary forms of sex segregation allow institutions and society to sort individuals into categories with differential access to power, and supporting the government's elimination of such permission for certain institutions and norms to continue to exist.Cohen, David S. 2009. \\"No Boy Left Behind? Single-Sex Education and the Essentialist Myth of Masculinity\\" Indiana Law Journal 84(135). Contemporary policy examples Sex segregation is a global phenomenon manifested differently in varying localities.Grusky, David B., and Maria Charles. 2001. \\"Is There a Worldwide Sex Segregation Regime?\\" Pp. 689-703 in Social Stratification: Class, Race, and Gender in Sociological Perspective (Second Edition), edited by David B. Grusky. Boulder: Westview Press. Sex segregation and integration considered harmless or normal in one country can be considered radical or illegal in others. At the same time, many laws and policies promoting segregation or desegregation recur across multiple national contexts. Safety and privacy concerns, traditional values and cultural norms, and belief that sex segregation can produce positive educational and overall social outcomes all shape public policy regarding sex segregation. =Safety and privacy= Some sex segregation occurs for reasons of safety and privacy. Worldwide, laws often mandate sex segregation in public toilets, changing rooms, showers, and similar spaces, based on a common perceived need for privacy. This type of segregation policy can protect against sexual harassment and sexual abuse. To combat groping, street harassment, and eve teasing of women in crowded public places, some countries have also designated women only spaces. For example, sex-segregated buses, women-only passenger cars, and compartments on trains have been introduced in Mexico, Japan, the Philippines, the UAE and other countries to reduce sexual harassment. A sign on a station platform in Osaka, Japan, showing the boarding point for a ladies-only car. Some places in Germany, Korea, and China all have women's parking spaces, often for related safety issues.Will High-Heel-Friendly Streets Keep Seoul's Women Happy?, Time, 2009 Many more countries, including Canada, the United States, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom also grant parking privileges to pregnant women, for safety or access reasons. Sex segregation rooted in safety considerations can furthermore extend beyond the physical to the psychological and emotional as well. A refuge for battered mothers or wives may refuse to admit men, even those who are themselves the victims of domestic violence, both to exclude those who might commit or threaten violence to women and because women who have been subjected to abuse by a male might feel threatened by the presence of any man. Women's health clinics and women's resource centers, whether in Africa or North America, are further examples of spaces where sex segregation may facilitate private and highly personal decisions. Women-only banks may be similarly intended to provide autonomy to women's decision making. =Religious and cultural ideas= Sex segregation can also be motivated by religious or cultural ideas about men and women. Such cultural assumptions may even exist in the aforementioned policies enacted under the pretenses of safety or privacy concerns. Gender separation and segregation in Judaism and Islam reflect religiously motivated sex segregation. In Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism, monastic orders, prayer spaces, and leadership roles have also been segregated by sex. From a policy perspective, theocracies and countries with a state religion have sometimes made sex segregation laws based partially in religious traditions. Even when not legally enforced, such traditions can be reinforced by social institutions and in turn result in sex segregation. In the South Asian context, one institution conducive to sex segregation, sometimes but not always rooted in national law, is purdah.Asha, S. \\"Narrative Discourses on Purdah in the Subcontinent.\\" ICFAI Journal of English Studies 3, no. 2 (June 2008): 41‚Äì51 A sex-segregated entrance to the Western Wall, a religious site in Jerusalem. During the Taiping Rebellion (1851-64) against the Qing dynasty, areas controlled by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had strict sex separation enforced. Even married couples were not allowed to live together until 1858. The Muslim world and the Middle East have been particularly scrutinized by scholars analyzing sex segregation resulting from the consequences of Sharia, the moral and religious code of Islam that, in the strictest version, Muslims hold to be the perfect law created by God. Saudi Arabia has been called an epicenter of sex segregation, stemming partially from its conservative Sunni Islamic practices and partially from its monarchy's legal constraints. Sex segregation in Saudi Arabia is not inherent to the country's culture, but was promoted in the 1980s and 1990s by the government, the Sahwa movement, and conservative and religious behavioral enforcers (i.e. police, government officers, etc.). Israel has also been noted both for its military draft of both sexes and its sex-segregated Mehadrin bus lines. =Education and socialization= Sex segregation is sometimes pursued through policy because it is thought to produce better educational outcomes. In some parts of the world, especially in Europe, where education is available to girls as well as boys, educational establishments were frequently single- gender. Such single-sex schools are still found in many countries, including but not limited to, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the United States in particular, two federal laws give public and private entities permission to segregate based on sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. These laws permit sex segregation of contact sports, choruses, sex education, and in areas such as math and reading, within public schools. The girls' entrance to a school; the boys use or used an equivalent door. Studies have analyzed whether single-sex or co-ed schools produce better educational outcomes. Teachers and school environments tend to be more conducive to girls' learning habits and participation rates improve in single-sex schools.Bauch, P.A. 1988. \\"Differences among single-sex and coeducational high schools.\\" Momentum 19:56-58.Lee, V.E. and A. S. Bryk. 1986. \\"Effects of single-sex secondary schools on student achievement and attitudes.\\" Journal of Educational Psychology 78:381-395.Riordan, C. 1990.

Improving basic educational opportunities for women in developing countries. Washington, DC: International Center for Research on Women. Girls in single-sex schools outperform their counterparts in co-educational schools in math, average class scores for girls are higher, girls in single-sex math and science classes are more likely to continue to take math and science classes in higher education, and in case studies, boys and girls have reported that single-sex classes and single-sex teachers create a better environment for learning for both sexes.Younger, Michael Robert and Molly Warrington. 2006. \\"Would Harry and Hermione Have Done Better in Single- Sex Classes?

Critics of single-sex schools and classes claim that single-sex schooling is inherently unequal and that its physical separation contributes to gender bias on an academic and social basis. Single-sex schooling also limits the socialization between sexes that co-educational schools provide. Coeducational school settings have been shown to foster less anxiety, have happier classrooms, and enable students to participate in a simulated social environment with the tools to maneuver, network, and succeed in the world outside of school.Dale, R. R. 1974. Mixed or single-sex school? Volume III: Attainment, attitudes, and overview. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul.Marsh, H.W. 1989. \\"Effects of attending single-sex and co-educational high schools on achievement, attitudes, behaviors, and sex differences.

Coutts. 1982. \\"The high school environment: A comparison of coeducational and single- sex schools.\\" Journal of Educational Psychology 74:898-906.Smith, I. 1996. The impact of co-educational schooling on student self-concept and achievement. Paper presented at the biennial meeting of the International Society for the Study of Behavioral Development, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Even in co-ed schools, certain classes, such as sex education, are sometimes segregated on the basis of sex. Parallel education occurs in some schools, when administrators decide to segregate students only in core subjects.Horne, Donald, Susan Mardsen, Alison Painter. 1993. \\"A Hidden Australian Cultural Resource.\\" Monash University, National Center for Australian Studies. Segregation by specialization is also evident in higher education and actually increases with economic development of a country. Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Morocco, and Namibia are countries with the least amount of gender segregation in tertiary studies while Croatia, Finland, Japan, and Lithuania have the most. =Desegregation= Desegregation policies often seek to prevent sex discrimination, or alleviate occupational segregation. These policies encourage women and men to participate in environments typically predominated by the opposite sex. Examples include government quotas, gender- specific scholarships, co-ed recreational leagues, or programming designed to change social norms. In China, deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee proposed that the public should be more attentive to widespread instances of occupational segregation in China. Often employers reject specifically women applicants or create sex requirements in order to apply. The Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China and Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women state that no employer can refuse to employ women based on sex or raise application standards for women specifically, but also do not currently have clear sanctions for those who do segregate based on sex. China has also begun to encourage women in rural villages to take up positions of management in their committees. Specifically, China's Village Committee Organization Law mandates that women should make up one third or more of the members of village committees. The Dunhuang Women's Federation of Dunhuang City, in China's Gansu Province, provided training for their village's women in order to build political knowledge. In March 2013 in the European Union, a resolution was passed to invest in training and professional development for women, promote women-run businesses, and include women on company boards. In Israel, the Minister of Religious Services, Yaakov Margi Shas, has recently supported removal of signs at cemeteries segregating women and men for eulogies and funerals, prohibiting women from taking part in the services. The Minister agreed with academic and politician, Yesh Atid MK Aliza Lavie, who questioned him about segregation policies enacted by rabbis and burial officials, that governmental opposition to sex segregation was necessary to combat these practices not supported by Jewish or Israeli law. In other cases, sex segregation in one arena can be pursued to enable sex desegregation in another. For example, separation of boys and girls for early math and science education may be part of an effort to increase the representation of women in engineering or women in science. Sometimes, countries will also argue that segregation in other nations violates human rights. For example, the United Nations and Western countries have encouraged kings of Saudi Arabia to end its strict segregation of institutions such as schools, government institutions, hospitals, and other public spaces in order to secure women's rights in Saudi ArabiaLe Renard, Am√©lie. 2008. \\"'Only for Women': Women, the State and Reform in Saudi Arabia,\\" Middle East Journal, 62(4):610‚Äì629. Even though the removal of certain religious and government heads has made way for liberal agendas to promote desegregation, the public largely still subscribes to the idea of a segregated society, while institutions and the government itself still technically remain under the control of Wahhabism. Reform is small in size, since there is no constitution to back up policy changes concerning sex segregation. The Saudi people refer to this segregation as khalwa and violation of the separation is punishable by law. This separation is tangibly manifested in the recently erected wall in places that employ both men and women, a feat possible by a law passed in 2011 allowing Saudi women to work in lingerie shops in order to lower female unemployment rates. The public views the 1.6 meter wall favorably, saying that it will lead to less instances of harassment by men visiting the expatriate women in the shops. The Luthan hotel in Saudi Arabia was the country's first women's only hotel, acting more as a vacation spot for women than a mandated segregated institution. Upon entering the hotel, women are allowed to remove their headscarves and abayas and the hotel employs only women, calling their bellhops the world's first bellgirls, providing opportunities for Saudi women in IT and engineering jobs where, outside the Luthan, are quite scarce. Significance =In human development = A note at the male public toilet in Edinburgh Airport about the fact that female cleaners might work there. For most children, sex segregation manifests itself early in the socialization process via group socialization theory, where children are expected to behave in certain sex-typed manners and form sex in and out-groups.Rose, Amanda J. and Karen D. Rudolph. 2006. \\"A Review of Sex Differences in Peer Relationship Processes: Potential Trade-offs for the Emotional and Behavioral Development of Girls and Boys.\\" Psychological Bulletin 132(1):98-131. In pre-school classrooms, for example, making gender more salient to children has been shown to lead to stronger gender stereotypes and intergroup biases between sex groups. These evident tendencies were also manifested in decreased playtime with children of the opposite sex, or a kind of early, selective sex segregation based on preconceived social norms.Hilliard, Lacey J. and Lynn S. Liben. 2010. \\"Differing Levels of Gender Salience in Preschool Classrooms: Effects on Children's Gender Attitudes and Intergroup Bias\\" Child Development (81)6:1787-1798. While specifically segregating by sex for playtime has not been linked to any long-lasting effects on women's rights compared to men, these different manners of socialization often lead to communication and power struggles between men and women and to differential life decisions by each sex based on these long- established gendered identities.Leaper, Cambell. 1994. \\"Exploring the Consequences of Gender Segregation on Social Relationships.\\" New Directions for Child Development 65:67-86. In elementary and secondary education, sex segregation sometimes yields and perpetuates gender bias in the form of treatment by teachers and peers that perpetuates traditional gender roles and sex bias, underrepresentation of girls in upper level math, science, and computer classes, fewer opportunities for girls to learn and solve problems, girls receiving less attention compared to the boys in their classes, and significantly different performance levels between boys and girls in reading and math classes. Sometimes in elementary schools teachers force the students to sit boy, girl, boy girl. Boys academically benefit from a coeducational environment while girls do from a single-sex environment, so critics and proponents of both types of education argue that either single-sex or coeducational classrooms create a comparative disadvantage for either sex.American Association of University Women. 1998. Separated by sex: A critical look at single-sex education for girls. Washington, DC: American Association of University Women Educational Foundation.LePore, Paul C. and John Robert Warren. 1997. \\"A Comparison of Single-Sex and Coeducational Catholic Secondary Schooling: Evidence from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.\\" American Educational Research Journal 34(3):485-511.Tyack, D., and Hansot, E. 1990. Learning together: A history of coeducation in American public schools. New Haven: Yale University Press. Athletic participation and physical education are examples where appeals to differences in biological sex may encourage segregation within education systems. These differences can impact access to competition, gender identity construction, and external as well as internalized perceptions of capabilities, especially among young girls. Separation of public toilets by sex is very common around the world. In certain settings the sex separation can be critical to ensure the safety of females, in particular schoolgirls, from male abuse. At the same time, sex segregated public toilets may promote a gender binary that excludes transgender people.The Ethics of Gender Segregated Bathrooms. Ethical Inquiry, May 2012. Brandeis University Unisex public toilets can be a suitable alternative in many cases. A special case presents with choirs and choruses, especially in the tradition of the choir school which uses ensemble and musical discipline to ground academic discipline. Male and female voices are distinctive both solo and in ensemble, and segregated singing has an evolved and established aesthetic. Male voices, unlike female voices, break in early adolescence, and accommodating this break in an educational program is challenging in a coed environment. Coeducation tends to stigmatize males, as is often the case in expressive arts, unlike athletics. =In economies= Physical sex separation is not popular in many institutions on a tertiary level (between types of institutions), while fields of study or majors are highly gendered, such as later life decisions such as work/care work conflicts. Men tend to occupy engineering, manufacturing, science, and construction fields while women dominate education, humanities and arts, social sciences, business, law, and health and welfare fields.Charles, Maria and Karen Bradley. 2002. \\"Equal but Separate? A Cross-National Study of Sex Segregation in Higher Education\\" American Sociological Review 67(4):573-599. However, important life decisions as occupations can yield other instances of sex segregation by impacting occupational sex imbalances and further male and female socialization. Vicki Schultz (1990) indicates that although Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits sex discrimination in employment and promised working women change, \\"most women continue to work in low paying, low status, and traditionally female jobs.\\" Schultz (1990) states that \\"employers have argued that women lack interest in male-dominated jobs, which are highly rewarded and nontraditional for women.\\" According to Schultz, the courts have accepted this argument, subsequently not holding employers liable. Schultz contends that \\"the courts have failed to recognize the role of employers in shaping women's work aspirations.\\" (Schultz, 1990:1750,1756)Schultz, Vicki.(1990). Telling Stories about Women and Work: Judicial Interpretations of Sex Segregation in the Workplace in Title VII Cases Raising the Lack of Interest Argument Author(s): Harvard Law Review, Vol. 103, No. 8 (Jun. 1990), pp. 1749-1843 Published) Schultz states that the judicial framework that has been established by the courts \\"has created an unduly narrow definition of sex discrimination and an overly restrictive role for the law in dismantling sex segregation.\\" (Schultz, 1990:1757) Schultz concludes by saying, \\"courts can acknowledge their own constructive power and use it to help create a work world in which women are empowered to choose the more highly rewarded occupations that Title VII has long promised.\\" (Schultz, 1990:1843) Even at psychological levels, socialized preferences for or against sex segregation can also have significant effects. In one study, women in male-dominated work settings were the most satisfied psychologically with their jobs while women in occupational settings with only 15-30% men were less satisfied due to favored treatment of the male minority in such a segregated atmosphere.Wharton, Amy S. and James N. Baron. 1991. \\"Satisfaction? The Psychological Impact of Gender Segregation on Women at Work\\" The Sociological Quarterly 32(3):365-387. Stark segregation by occupation can lead to a sexual division of labor, influencing the access and control men and women have over inputs and outputs required for labor. Additionally, occupational sex segregation has certain health and safety hazards for each sex, since employment conditions, type of work, and contract and domestic responsibilities vary for types of employment. In many areas of work, women tend to dominate the production line jobs while men occupy managerial and technical jobs. These types of workplace factors and interactions between work and family have been cited by social stratification research as key causes for social inequality. Family roles are especially influential for predicting significant differences in earnings between married couples. Men benefit financially from family roles such as a husband and a father, while women's incomes are lowered when becoming a wife and mother.Witkowski, Kristine M. and Kevin T. Leicht. 1995. \\"The Effects of Gender Segregation, Labor Force Participation, and Family Roles on the Earnings of Young Adult Workers.\\" Work and Occupations 22:48. Other gender disparities via sex segregation between men and women include differential asset ownership, house and care work responsibilities, and agency in public and private spheres for each sex. These segregations have persisted because of governmental policy, blocked access for a sex, and/or the existence of sex-based societal gender roles and norms. Perpetuation of gender segregation, especially in economic spheres, creates market and institutional failures. For example, women often occupy jobs with flexible working environments in order to take on care work as well as job responsibilities, but since part-time, flexible hourly jobs pay less and have lower levels of benefits, large numbers of women in these lower income jobs lowers incentives to participate in the same market work as their male counterparts, perpetuating occupational gender lines in societies and within households. Schultz (1990) article indicates that \\"working-class women have made it a priority to end job segregation for they want opportunities that enable them to support them and their families.\\" (Schultz, 1990:1755) Additionally, economic development in countries is positively correlated with female workers in wage employment occupations and negatively correlated with female workers in unpaid or part-time work, self-employment, or entrepreneurship, job sectors often seen occupied by women in developing countries. Many critics of sex segregation see globalization processes as having the potential to promote systemic equality among the sexes.

Mechanism of action Troglitazone, like the other thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARŒ± and ‚Äì more strongly ‚Äì PPARŒ≥. Troglitazone also contains an Œ±-tocopheroyl moiety, potentially giving it vitamin E-like activity in addition to its PPAR activation. It has been shown to reduce inflammation: troglitazone use was associated with a decrease of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-Œ∫B) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IŒ∫B). NFŒ∫B is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response. History A 30-tablet pharmacy stock bottle of Rezulin (troglitazone) (400 mg) from Parke-Davis. Manufactured 1997. Shown also is one broken tablet. Tablet branding is PD353. It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo (Japan). In the United States, it was introduced and manufactured by Parke-Davis in the late 1990s, but turned out to be associated with an idiosyncratic reaction leading to drug-induced hepatitis. The F.D.A. medical officer assigned to evaluate troglitazone, John Gueriguian, did not recommend its approval due to potential high liver toxicity; Parke-Davis complained to the FDA and Gueriguian was subsequently removed from his post.Retired Drugs: Failed Blockbusters, Homicidal Tampering, Fatal Oversights, wired.com A panel of experts approved it in January 1997. Once the prevalence of adverse liver effects became known, troglitazone was withdrawn from the British market in December 1997, from the United States market in 2000, and from the Japanese market soon afterwards. It did not get approval in the rest of Europe. Troglitazone was developed as the first anti-diabetic drug having a mechanism of action involving the enhancement of insulin sensitivity. At the time it was widely believed that such drugs, by addressing the primary metabolic defect associated with Type 2 diabetes, would have numerous benefits including avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia associated with insulin and earlier oral antidiabetic drugs. It was further believed that reducing insulin resistance would potentially reduce the very high rate of cardiovascular disease that is associated with diabetes. Parke-Davis/Warner Lambert submitted the diabetes drug Rezulin for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A.) review on July 31, 1996. The medical officer assigned to the review, Dr. John L. Gueriguian, cited Rezulin's potential to harm the liver and the heart and he questioned its viability in lowering blood sugar for patients with adult-onset diabetes, recommending against the drug's approval. After complaints from the drugmaker, Gueriguian was removed on November 4, 1996 and his review was purged by the F.D.A. Gueriguian and the company had a single meeting, at which Gueriguian used \\"intemperate\\" language; the company said its objections were based on inappropriate remarks made by Gueriguian. Parke-Davis said at the advisory committee that the risk of liver toxicity was comparable to placebo and that additional data of other studies confirmed this. According to Peter G√∏tzsche, when the company provided these additional data one week after approval, they showed a substantially greater risk for liver toxicity. The F.D.A. approved the drug on January 29, 1997, and it appeared in pharmacies in late March. At the time Dr. Solomon Sobel, a director at the F.D.A., overseeing diabetes drugs, said in a New York Times interview that adverse effects of troglitazone appeared to be rare and relatively mild. Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C. received approval from the British Medicines Control Agency (MCA) to market troglitazone, as Romozin, in July 1997. After reports of sudden liver failure in patients receiving the drug, the Parke-Davis and the FDA added warnings to the drug label requiring monthly monitoring of liver enzyme levels. Glaxo removed troglitazone from the market in Britain on December 1, 1997. Glaxo had licensed the drug from Sankyo Company of Japan and had sold it in Britain from October 1, 1997. On May 17, 1998, a 55-year-old patient named Audrey LaRue Jones died of acute liver failure after taking troglitazone. Importantly, she had been monitored closely by physicians at the National Institutes of Health as a participant in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) diabetes prevention study. This called into question the efficacy of the monitoring strategy. The N.I.H. responded on June 4 by dropping troglitazone from the study. Dr. David J. Graham, an F.D.A. epidemiologist charged with evaluating the drug, warned on March 26, 1999 of the dangers of using it and concluded that patient monitoring was not effective in protecting against liver failure. He estimated that the drug could be linked to over 430 liver failures and that patients incurred 1,200 times greater risk of liver failure when taking Rezulin. Dr. Janet B. McGill, an endocrinologist who had assisted in the Warner‚ÄìLambert's early clinical testing of Rezulin, wrote in a March 1, 2000 letter to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.): \\"I believe that the company . . . deliberately omitted reports of liver toxicity and misrepresented serious adverse events experienced by patients in their clinical studies.\\" On March 21, 2000, the F.D.A. withdrew the drug from the market. Dr. Robert I. Misbin, an F.D.A. medical officer, wrote in a March 3, 2000 letter to Senator John Ashcroft of strong evidence that Rezulin could not be used safely. He was later threatened by the FDA with dismissal. By that time the drug had been linked to 63 liver-failure deaths and had generated sales of more than $2.1 billion for Warner-Lambert. The drug cost $1,400 a year per patient in 1998. Pfizer, which had acquired Warner-Lambert in February 2000, reported the withdrawal of Rezulin cost $136 million.  Mechanisms of hepatotoxicity  Since the withdrawal in 2000, mechanisms of troglitazone hepatotoxicity have been extensively studied using a variety of in vivo, in vitro and computational methods. These studies have suggested that hepatotoxicity of troglitazone results from a combination of nonmetabolic and metabolic factors. The nonmetabolic toxicity is a complex function of drug-protein interactions in the liver and biliary system. Initially the metabolic toxicity was largely associated with reactive metabolite formation from the thiazolidinedione and chromane rings of troglitazone. Moreover, the formation of quinone and o-quinone methide reactive metabolites were proposed to be formed by metabolic oxidation of the OH group of the chromane ring. Detailed quantum chemical analysis of the metabolic pathways for troglitazone has shown that quinone reactive metabolite is generated by oxidation of the OH group, but o-quinone methide reactive metabolite is formed by the oxidation of the methyl (CH3) groups ortho to the OH group of the chromane ring. This understanding has been recently used in the design of novel troglitazone derivatives with antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines. Lawsuits In 2009 Pfizer Inc. resolved all but three of 35,000 claims over its withdrawn diabetes drug Rezulin for a total of about $750 million. Pfizer, which acquired rival Wyeth for almost $64 billion, paid about $500 million to settle Rezulin cases consolidated in federal court in New York, according to court filings. The company also paid as much as $250 million to resolve state-court suits. In 2004, it set aside $955 million to end Rezulin cases.

They have a complex life cycle which comprises vegetative forms in two hosts, an aquatic invertebrate (generally an annelid) and an ectothermic vertebrate, usually a fish. Each host releases a different type of spore. The two forms of spore are so different that until relatively recently they were treated as belonging to different classes within the Myxozoa. Taxonomic status The taxonomy of both actinosporeans and myxosporeans was originally based on spore morphology. In 1994 the phylum Myxozoa was redefined to solve the taxonomic and nomenclatural problems arising from the two-host life cycle of myxozoans. The distinction between the two previously recognised classes Actinosporea and Myxosporea disappeared and the class Actinosporea was suppressed, becoming a synonym of the class Myxosporea (B√ºtschli, 1881). The generic names of actinosporeans were retained as collective \\"type\\" names, and it was proposed that they be used to characterise different morphological forms of actinosporeans. Those remaining actinosporeans whose myxosporean stage is unattested are being retained as species inquerandae until their specific identity is established. It has been hypothesized that myxosporeans might have evolved from a transmissible tumor of Polypodium. This hypothesis is called the \\"SCANDAL hypothesis\\", an acronym for speciation by cancer development animals, referencing its radical nature. Transmission Until the 1980s, direct transmission of myxosporeans was presumed. In 1984, it was shown experimentally that spores of Myxobolus cerebralis failed to produce infections when fed to salmonids.. To reproduce successfully, this species requires a tubificid worm as an intermediate host, in which the spores develop into a \\"species\\" of the \\"genus\\" Triactinomyxon. These spores develop inside the oligochaete into forms which are infective to salmonids. Such a life cycle, with two different sexual stages, resulting in two kinds of resistant spores, is unique amongst the parasitic organisms. This mode of life cycle has been confirmed in several other Myxobolus species. This mode of infection has also been proved in other families. Ceratomyxa shasta, an economically important parasite of salmonids, has been shown to use a polychaete worm as an alternate host. Surprisingly, direct transmission between fish has also been demonstrated, so far in three species of Enteromyxum. Examples of Myxosporean genera are Kudoa, which attacks fish muscle, and Myxobolus, which attacks the hearts of freshwater fishes.

If Np denotes the number of points on Ep and defined over the field with p elements, the conjecture gives an answer to the distribution of the second-order term for Np. That is, by Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves we have :N_p/p = 1 + \\\\mathrm{O}(1/\\\\\\\\!\\\\sqrt{p})\\\\ as p ‚Üí ‚àû, and the point of the conjecture is to predict how the O-term varies. The original conjecture and its generalization to all totally real fields was proved by Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, Nicholas Shepherd-Barron, and Richard Taylor under mild assumptions in 2008, and completed by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Harris, and Taylor in 2011. Several generalizations to other algebraic varieties and fields are open. Statement Let E be an elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers without complex multiplication. Define Œ∏p as the solution to the equation : p+1-N_p=2\\\\sqrt{p}\\\\cos\\\\theta_p ~~ (0\\\\leq \\\\theta_p \\\\leq \\\\pi). Then, for every two real numbers \\\\alpha and \\\\beta for which 0\\\\leq \\\\alpha < \\\\beta \\\\leq \\\\pi, :\\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{p\\\\leq N:\\\\alpha\\\\leq \\\\theta_p \\\\leq \\\\beta\\\\\\\\}} {\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{p\\\\leq N\\\\\\\\}}=\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta. Details By Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves, the ratio :\\\\frac{((p + 1)-N_p)}{2\\\\sqrt{p}}=:\\\\frac{a_p}{2\\\\sqrt{p}} is between -1 and 1. Thus it can be expressed as cos Œ∏ for an angle Œ∏; in geometric terms there are two eigenvalues accounting for the remainder and with the denominator as given they are complex conjugate and of absolute value 1\\\\. The Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture, when E doesn't have complex multiplication,In the case of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, the Hasse‚ÄìWeil L-function is expressed in terms of a Hecke L-function (a result of Max Deuring). The known analytic results on these answer even more precise questions. states that the probability measure of Œ∏ is proportional to :\\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta.To normalise, put 2/œÄ in front. This is due to Mikio Sato and John Tate (independently, and around 1960, published somewhat later).It is mentioned in J. Tate, Algebraic cycles and poles of zeta functions in the volume (O. F. G. Schilling, editor), Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry, pages 93‚Äì110 (1965). Proof In 2008, Clozel, Harris, Shepherd-Barron, and Taylor published a proof of the Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture for elliptic curves over totally real fields satisfying a certain condition: of having multiplicative reduction at some prime,That is, for some p where E has bad reduction (and at least for elliptic curves over the rational numbers there are some such p), the type in the singular fibre of the N√©ron model is multiplicative, rather than additive. In practice this is the typical case, so the condition can be thought of as mild. In more classical terms, the result applies where the j-invariant is not integral. in a series of three joint papers. Further results are conditional on improved forms of the Arthur‚ÄìSelberg trace formula. Harris has a conditional proof of a result for the product of two elliptic curves (not isogenous) following from such a hypothetical trace formula.See Carayol's Bourbaki seminar of 17 June 2007 for details. In 2011, Barnet-Lamb, Geraghty, Harris, and Taylor proved a generalized version of the Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture for an arbitrary non-CM holomorphic modular form of weight greater than or equal to two, by improving the potential modularity results of previous papers.Theorem B of The prior issues involved with the trace formula were solved by Michael Harris, and Sug Woo Shin.See p. 71 and Corollary 8.9 of In 2015, Richard Taylor was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics \\"for numerous breakthrough results in (...) the Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture.\\" Generalisations There are generalisations, involving the distribution of Frobenius elements in Galois groups involved in the Galois representations on √©tale cohomology. In particular there is a conjectural theory for curves of genus n > 1\\\\. Under the random matrix model developed by Nick Katz and Peter Sarnak, there is a conjectural correspondence between (unitarized) characteristic polynomials of Frobenius elements and conjugacy classes in the compact Lie group USp(2n) = Sp(n). The Haar measure on USp(2n) then gives the conjectured distribution, and the classical case is USp(2) = SU(2). Refinements There are also more refined statements. The Lang‚ÄìTrotter conjecture (1976) of Serge Lang and Hale Trotter states the asymptotic number of primes p with a given value of ap, the trace of Frobenius that appears in the formula. For the typical case (no complex multiplication, trace ‚â† 0) their formula states that the number of p up to X is asymptotically :c \\\\sqrt{X}/ \\\\log X\\\\ with a specified constant c. Neal Koblitz (1988) provided detailed conjectures for the case of a prime number q of points on Ep, motivated by elliptic curve cryptography.. In 1999, Chantal David and Francesco Pappalardi proved an averaged version of the Lang‚ÄìTrotter conjecture.

The A-level examination is typically taken by students at the end of their second or third year in junior college. Overview The programme allows for more time allocated to enrichment activities. That is, without the O-level examinations, the students have more time and flexibility to immerse themselves in a more broad-based education which will eventually lead to the A-level examination. In addition, the students enjoy more freedom in the combination of subjects. Generally, only the top performers are eligible to be part of the IP programme, do use to implement it, as it is currently regarded as experimental. Thus most of the main body of the students pursue their secondary education at the current pace by first completing a four-year O-level course before proceeding to a two-year A-level education.  A-level programmes  The integrated programme was first implemented in Dunman High School, Hwa Chong Institution (formerly The Chinese High School), Nanyang Girls' High School, Raffles Girls School, Raffles Institution, and River Valley High School in 2004. The IP allows students to skip the O-level at secondary four and be admitted directly to junior colleges (while there are cases of students being asked by the school to \\"leave\\" this system as their pace could not be kept up). However, the students would still have to take the Mother Tongue O-level. All the schools allowed in the scheme accepts the top 10% of the national cohort. This ensures that students who are under the IP are able to cope with their A-level after bypassing their O-level. Some junior colleges including National Junior College, Temasek Junior College, and Victoria Junior College, offer it independently. VJC is now offering it with Cedar Girls Secondary and Victoria School (more info below) For the four-year IP, secondary two students from various schools are allowed to apply for this programme. These students have their secondary three and four education in the junior college itself, followed by the A-level course. Dunman High School (DHS) applied for the IP system in mid-2004 standalone, and the Ministry of Education approved the first batch to be enrolled in 2005, with Year 1 and Year 3 students, each having a cap of about 135 out of 380 students. Full IP was granted in late 2005, and the school went full IP at the beginning of 2006. River Valley High School joined the IP system in 2006 by operating a six-year course standalone. Since 2009, National Junior College has also accepted students who have taken the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), making it a six-year program. Since 2012, Victoria School and Cedar Girls' Secondary School are offering the IP with Victoria Junior College which will build upon the four-year Victoria Integrated Programme (VIP) in the junior college. It is [called the VCA IP( Victoria Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme). In January 2013, the Joint Integrated Programme, commonly referred to as the JIP, offered by Catholic High School, CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School and Singapore Chinese Girls' School, alongside with Eunoia Junior College, was established. The four schools are the newest additions to the Integrated Programme landscape. The three secondary schools will continue to offer the 'O' Level track alongside the IP track, thus they are termed by the MOE as dual track schools. Such schools allow students to have the flexibility to switch to the stream that is better suited to the students' needs.  International Baccalaureate program  Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Methodist Girls' School, and St. Joseph's Institution, the only IP leading to IB schools in the country, have allowed their students to abandon the British system and \\"go Swiss\\" by dropping the GCE examinations altogether and adopting the International Baccalaureate (IB), having been fully authorized as IB World Schools. The IB is generally regarded as a better track if the students have plans to study overseas in future. The IB allows students to take both arts and science subjects, philosophy courses and extensive research papers. Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) is regarded as one of the top schools in terms of results of the IB in the world, having averages as high as 42 out of a total of 45 points. St. Joseph's Institution started its IP in 2013.  NUS High School Diploma  The NUS High School of Mathematics and Science is the only IP school in Singapore which specialises in mathematics and science and leads to the NUS High School Diploma. It aims to develop all-rounded students through its 6 year diploma curriculum, which allows rigour and depth, or flexibility and breadth. NUS High School is also affiliated and very closely linked to the National University of Singapore (NUS). Students in this school graduate with the NUS High School diploma, which has been accredited by all universities in Singapore as well as top universities worldwide . For placement into overseas universities, they may also take the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and Advanced Placement (AP).

However, this may be considered a utopian ideal. Without an important watershed intervening national examination to help them focus, students may simply let their guard down. IP may also widen inequality among students in Singapore. Most of the places in top Junior Colleges are reserved for IP students. This includes Victoria Junior College, Raffles Institution, NUS High School of Math and Science and Hwa Chong Institution. As such, students taking the O Level track will face tighter competition when they wish to enter top schools in Singapore, in comparison to their IP peers. The Integrated Programme is allegedly for clearly university-bound students. While for non-IP students who fail to perform well in the A-level, they still have their O-level qualifications, which act as a \\"safety net\\". However, in the absence of this \\"safety net\\", IP students who under-perform in the A-level will have only their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) certificate to fall back on.

The force can be a fundamental force such as magnetic or electrostatic, or it can be a reactive force such as optical, buoyant, aerodynamic, or hydrodynamic. Levitation excludes floating at the surface of a liquid because the liquid provides direct mechanical support. Levitation excludes hovering flight by insects, hummingbirds, helicopters, rockets, and balloons because the object provides its own counter-gravity force. Physics Levitation (on Earth or any planetoid) requires an upward force that cancels out the weight of the object, so that the object does not fall (accelerate downward) or rise (accelerate upward). For positional stability, any small displacement of the levitating object must result in a small change in force in the opposite direction. the small changes in force can be accomplished by gradient field(s) or by active regulation. If the object is disturbed, it might oscillate around its final position, but its motion eventually decreases to zero due to damping effects. (In a turbulent flow, the object might oscillate indefinitely.) Levitation techniques are useful tools in physics research. For example, levitation methods are useful for high- temperature melt property studies because they eliminate the problem of reaction with containers and allow deep undercooling of melts. The containerless conditions may be obtained by opposing gravity with a levitation force instead of allowing an entire experiment to freefall. Magnetic levitation a high-temperature superconductor levitating above magnet Magnetic levitation is the most commonly seen and used form of levitation. Diamagnetic materials are commonly used for demonstration purposes. In this case the returning force appears from the interaction with the screening currents. For example, a superconducting sample, which can be considered either as a perfect diamagnet or an ideally hard superconductor, easily levitates in an ambient external magnetic field. The superconductor is first heated strongly, then cooled with liquid nitrogen to levitate on top of a diamagnet. In a very strong magnetic field by means of diamagnetic levitation, even small live animals have been levitated. It is possible to levitate pyrolytic graphite by placing thin squares of it above four cube magnets with the north poles forming one diagonal and south poles forming the other diagonal. Researcher have even successfully levitated (non-magnetic) liquid droplets surrounded by paramagnetic fluids. The process of such inverse magnetic levitation is usually referred to as Magneto-Archimedes effect. A magnetically levitated (maglev) train departing Shanghai Pudong International Airport on the first commercial high-speed maglev line in the world. Magnetic levitation is in development for use for transportation systems. For example, the Maglev includes trains that are levitated by a large number of magnets. Due to the lack of friction on the guide rails, they are faster, quieter, and smoother than wheeled mass transit systems. Electrodynamic suspension uses AC magnetic fields. Electrostatic levitation In electrostatic levitation an electric field is used to counteract gravitational force. Some spiders shoot silk into the air to ride Earth's electric field. Aerodynamic levitation In aerodynamic levitation, the levitation is achieved by floating the object on a stream of gas, either produced by the object or acting on the object. For example, a ping pong ball can be levitated with the stream of air from a vacuum cleaner set on \\"blow\\". With enough thrust, very large objects can be levitated using this method. =Gas film levitation= This technique enables the levitation of an object against gravitational force by floating it on a thin gas film formed by gas flow through a porous membrane. Using this technique, high temperature melts can be kept clean from contamination and be supercooled. A common example in general usage includes air hockey, where the puck is lifted by a thin layer of air. Hovercraft also use this technique, producing a large region of high-pressure air underneath them. Acoustic levitation Acoustic levitation uses sound waves to provide a levitating force. Optical levitation Optical levitation is a technique in which a material is levitated against the downward force of gravity by an upward force stemming from photon momentum transfer (radiation pressure). Buoyant levitation Gases at high pressure can have a density exceeding that of some solids. Thus they can be used to levitate solid objects through buoyancy.http://www.mrs.org/s_mrs/sec_subscribe.asp?CID=12048&DID;=275340&action;=detail Materials Processing Through Levitation in High Gas Pressure Noble gases are preferred for their non-reactivity. Xenon is the densest non-radioactive noble gas, at 5.894g/L. Xenon has been used to levitate polyethylene, at a pressure of 154atm. Casimir force Scientists have discovered a way of levitating ultra small objects by manipulating the so-called Casimir force, which normally causes objects to stick together due to forces predicted by quantum field theory. This is, however, only possible for micro-objects. Uses =Maglev trains= Magnetic levitation is used to suspend trains without touching the track. This permits very high speeds, and greatly reduces the maintenance requirements for tracks and vehicles, as little wear occurs. This also means there is no friction, so the only force acting against it is air resistance. =Animal levitation= Diamagnetic levitation of a live frog. Scientists have levitated frogs, grasshoppers, and mice by means of powerful electromagnets utilizing superconductors, producing diamagnetic repulsion of body water. The mice acted confused at first, but adapted to the levitation after approximately four hours, suffering no immediate ill effects. Mice Levitated in Lab Further reading *.

In general, traffic psychology aims to apply theoretical aspects of psychology in order to improve traffic mobility by helping to develop and apply crash countermeasures, as well as by guiding desired behaviors through education and the motivation of road users. Behavior is frequently studied in conjunction with crash research in order to assess causes and differences in crash involvement. Traffic psychologists distinguish three motivations of driver behavior: reasoned or planned behavior, impulsive or emotional behavior, and habitual behavior. Additionally, social and cognitive applications of psychology are used, such as enforcement, road safety education campaigns, and also therapeutic and rehabilitation programs. Broad theories of cognition, doi: 10.1016/0042-6989(93)90252-R sensory-motor and neurological aspects psychology are also applied to the field of traffic psychology. Studies of factors such as attention, memory, spatial cognition, inexperience, stress, inebriation, distracting/ambiguous stimuli, fatigue, and secondary tasks such as phone conversations are used to understand and investigate the experience and actions of road users.Groeger, J. A. (2000). Understanding driving: Applying cognitive psychology to a complex everyday task. Psychology Press.Trick, L. M., Enns, J. T., Mills, J., & Vavrik, J. (2004). Paying attention behind the wheel: A framework for studying the role of attention in driving . Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science, 5(5), 385-424. Some definitions * Traffic psychology deals with the noncognitive, cognitive, and sensory-motor aspects of people in the context of driving, dealing with traffic, and dealing with others. By identifying feelings that cause cognitive thoughts, traffic psychology allows the understanding of resulting actions and gives a way of modifying behavior. * Traffic psychology can be defined as a tool that through subjective analysis, helps to increase the overall quality of lives through behavioral observation, identification, and modification. * The task of traffic psychology is to understand, predict and provide measures to modify road user behavior at levels identified with as general objective to minimize the harmful effects of traffic participation.Barjonet, P. (2001). Traffic psychology today. (1st ed., p. 4). Norwell, Massachusetts: Kluwer Academic Publishers. Behavior Research Behavior research in traffic psychology often deals with subjects like motivation, personality and gender differences, habits, overconfidence, age and skill differences, attention, and violation of traffic rules. Yield sign A classification of behavioral factors into those that reduce driving capability and those that promote risky behavior with further division into those with short- and long-term impact helps the conceptualization of the problems and may contribute to the prioritization of behavior modification.Human Factors in the Causation of Road Traffic Crashes Eleni Petridou and Maria Moustaki, European Journal of Epidemiology, Vol. 16, No. 9 (2000), pp. 819-826, https://www.jstor.org/stable/3581952 Traffic and transport sciences concern themselves with the study, comprehension, explanation and prediction of everything related to the mobility of people and products. It incorporates several aspects of the transportation systems along with multiple techniques. This process attempts to develop valid and reliable methods to better understand and predict the effects of human variability with its environmental interactions on safety.Barjonet, P. E. (Hrsg). (2001). Traffic psychology today. Boston, London: Kluwer Academic Publishers. The transportation system consists of road, rail, sea and air infrastructures. It includes the possibilities and limitations of its economics, laws and regulations, which sets barriers to the capabilities of an individual and mass motorist. For instance, speed can be influenced by method of travel (vehicle, airplane, train or ship), by financial capabilities for the type of vehicle (jet versus commercial, speed boat against sail boat and sedan compared to a luxury sports car), or by regulations such as speed limits in rural areas versus city driving. The traffic environment takes into account location, time constraints, population and dangers that are exposed to motorist. These environmental factors pose danger and risk to motorists that may be fatal. Driving in wet, narrow, and dark conditions exposes drivers to far greater risk than driving on a sunny day on an open road. This is just one type of road factor for crashes that Sullman goes on to explain in further detail: ::‚Ä¶crashes include lack of visibility or obstructions, unclean road or loose material, poor road conditions or road markings, and the horizontal curvature of the road. Environmental influences such as cold or hot weather, noise and vibration are all more likely to impact on stress and fatigue states Sullman, M., & Dorn, L. (2012). Advances in traffic psychology: Human factors in Road and rail transport. Variability of the driver's age, personality, temperament, stress and expertise affect speed, control and decisions. Drivers generally use some degree of risk compensation to assess driving decisions and it is skewed by varying levels of intoxication. Alcohol and drug usage, alertness and fatigue, distraction and focus are a few of the main factors attributed to driver error and crashes.Cacciabue, P. C. (2007). Modeling driver behaviour in automotive environments: Critical issues in driver interactions with intelligent transport systems. Crash research In addition to behavior research, crash research is also a component in traffic psychology, looking at driving methodology, individual differences, characteristics of personality, temporary impairments, and relevant capabilities, the driver as an information processor (includes perception and reaction times), human factors on highway crashs, and the pedestrian (identifying vulnerability, causes and prevention of crashs).Shinar, D. (1978). Psychology on the road: The human factor in traffic safety. (1st ed.). Berkshire, United Kingdom: Transport Research Laboratory. =Human factors= Examination of the operator plays a large role in transportation psychology. While many external factors influence traffic safety, internal factors are also significant. Some factors include: * Decision-making * Demographics * Distraction * Detection Thresholds * Drugs and alcohol * Driving training and experience * Familiarity with vehicle and environment * Fatigue * Inattention * Perception-reaction time * Response to the unexpected * Risky behaviors * Stress and panic  Psychological research  = Neuropsychology= Linking brain regions, networks, and circuits with behaviors involved in operating a vehicle is one of the more salient topics of research within traffic psychology. Seven separate brain networks have been identified in driving simulations as being of importance to the neurophysiological processes involved in driving. The networks each have a unique function as outlined by Porter: The parietoccipital sulcus is involved in visual monitoring, motor cortex and cerebellar areas‚Äîfor gross motor control and motor planning; orbitofrontal and cingulate ‚Äî for error monitoring and inhibition, including motivation, risk assessment, and internal space; and medial frontal, parietal, and posterior cingulate for vigilance, including spatial attention, visual stream, monitoring, and external space.Porter, B. E. (Ed.). (2011). Handbook of traffic psychology. Academic Press. By linking neuropsychological processes and driving, the ability to understand errors, development, and safety is enhanced. The involvement of motor and cerebellar networks in driving was confirmed by Calhoun, Pekar, and Pearlson (2004). Research into in alcohol dosage and its related effect on neuropsychological processes found that greater quantities of alcohol created a larger likelihood to engage in high speed driving and an increase in the number of times the speed limit was exceeded.Translating cognitive neuroscience to the driver's operational environment: A neuroergonomic approach.

Psychological assessment, counseling, and rehabilitation Rehabilitation counseling is a process because of the many steps involved for an individual to become self-reliant. A driver rehabilitation specialist (DRS) is one who ‚Äúplans, develops, coordinates and implements driving service for individuals with disabilities‚Äù Association of Driver Rehabilitation Specialists: Driver Rehabilitation Specialist Certification Exam fact sheet (www.driver- ed.org/public/articles/index.cfm?Cat=10) DSR's may come from backgrounds such as physical therapy, psychology, and driver education. Evaluating a driver requires many aspects. A clinical assessment includes a review of the medical history, driving history, and driving needs. Visual and perceptual assessment along range of motion, motor strength, coordination, sensation, reaction time and cognitive assessment is a crucial aspect and the focus of the medical history evaluation. ‚ÄúAn initial driver evaluation can last one to four hours, depending on the client‚Äôs presenting disabilities and driving needs. Following the clinical assessment, clients undergo an on-road assessment if they meet the minimum state standards for health and vision, and the client holds a valid driver‚Äôs license or permit. The on-road assessment is performed in a driver rehabilitation vehicle equipped with dual brakes, rear-view mirror and eye-check mirror for the DRS, and any necessary adaptive equipment‚Äù Assessing and Counseling Older Drivers http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/olddrive/olderdriversbook/pages/Chapter5.html#Anchor-4%20T-22329 The goal in the rehabilitation process is to have the individual realize their condition and attempt to reinstate them into a driving environment in which they will pose no threat to others. Approach Transportation psychology has emerged rapidly since the 1980s and, from its inception, has followed an interdisciplinary approach and has shared common topics with other fields, in particular medicine (e.g. driving aptitude), engineering (e.g. ergonomics and human factors), and economics (e.g. travel demand management). Mobility, including its positive and negative repercussions, originates in people's decisions and behavior ‚Äì and these could be influenced. The main causes of traffic crashs are errors due to maladaptive behavior in interaction with roadways or other vehicles.

The castle was originally built as a country summerhouse in 1606 and is an example of Christian IV's many architectural projects. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style, typical of Danish buildings during this period, and has been expanded several times, finally evolving into its present condition by the year 1624. Architects Bertel Lange and Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger are associated with the structural planning of the castle. History Rosenborg Castle seen from Gothersgade in 1749 The castle was used by Danish regents as a royal residence until around 1710. After the reign of Frederik IV, Rosenborg was used as a royal residence only twice, and both these times were during emergencies. The first time was after Christiansborg Palace burned down in 1794, and the second time was during the British attack on Copenhagen in 1801. Architecture =Long Hall= The Coat of arms of Denmark is located on the ceiling of the Long Hall Located on the third floor, the Long Hall was completed in 1624. It was originally intended as a ballroom. Around 1700 it was used as Royal Reception Room and for banquets. It was not until the second half of the 19th century that it became known as the \\"Knight's Hall\\". Christian V had the hall partly modernised with twelve tapestries depicting the King's victories in the Scanian War (1675‚Äì1679). The stucco ceiling seen today is from the beginning of the 18th century. It shows the Danish Coat of Arms surrounded by the Orders of the Elephant and of Dannebrog. Side reliefs depict historical events from the first years of the reign of Frederik IV, including the liberation of the serfs, the founding of the dragoons and of the land militia among them. The frescos in the ceiling by Hendrick Krock, represent the Regalia. Among the main attractions of Rosenborg are the coronation chair of the absolutist kings and the throne of the queens with the three silver lions standing in front. The Long Hall also contains a large collection of silver furniture, of which most is from the 17th century. Rosenborg Collections The castle is open to the public for tours and houses a museum exhibiting the Royal Collections, artifacts spanning a breadth of royal Danish culture, from the late 16th century of Christian IV to the 19th century. Some of these articles once belonged to the nobility and the aristocracy. The castle, now state property, was opened to the public in 1838. Of special interest to tourists is a treasury displaying the Crown Jewels and the Danish Crown Regalia located in the castle. A Coronation Carpet is also stored there. The Throne Chair of Denmark is located in the castle. In the summer time, flowers bloom in front of the castle in the castle garden. Gardens The castle is situated in Kongens Have (\\"The King's Garden\\"), also known as \\"Rosenborg Castle Garden\\". The Rosenborg Castle Garden is the country's oldest royal garden and was embellished in the Renaissance style by Christian IV shortly before the construction of the main castle. Today, the gardens are a popular retreat for the people of Copenhagen, and attract an estimated 2.5 million visitors every year. Next to the castle are barracks where the Royal Life Guards is garrisoned. The Life Guard guards the castle.

She was the first leader of the Internet Party, and stood for Parliament in the 2014 general election through the Helensville electorate. From 1996 to 2002, she was a Member of Parliament for the Alliance party, briefly leading that party after the group experienced a schism in 2002. Early life Harr√©'s father was a social anthropologist, and the family spent a part of her childhood (including some years of primary school) living in Fiji while he studied urbanisation there. Her mother was an actress. After returning to New Zealand, she attended secondary school in Auckland at Auckland Girls' Grammar, before gaining Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees at the University of Auckland. At university she won the senior prizes for political studies and law and became an anti-nuclear activist. Professional life After finishing her degree she spent 10 weeks on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border with the \\"Harry Holland Coffee Picking Brigade\\" before spending a year working at the United Nations on disarmament issues and as a representative of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She then worked for some time as a lawyer specialising in industrial relations and employment law, and developing close links to the trade-union movement. =1982-1996 - Labour, NewLabour, and the Alliance= Harr√© joined the Labour Party in 1982, representing the youth wing on the party's New Zealand Council. She worked in the Beehive as an advisor to disarmament minister Fran Wilde. Throughout her seven-year membership of the party she was a critic of the policies advanced by Roger Douglas, who became Minister of Finance when Labour won the 1984 election. Douglas, an advocate of free-market economics, introduced a programme of radical reforms (Rogernomics) which alienated many of Labour's traditional supporters, including Harr√©. In 1989, Harr√© resigned from the Labour Party. She became a founding member of the NewLabour Party, an organisation started by dissident Labour MP Jim Anderton. NewLabour later joined with several other parties to form the Alliance. She stood for the Alliance nomination to contest the Tamaki by-election in 1992, but was unsuccessful. Harr√© then stood as the Alliance candidate for the Te Atat≈´ electorate in the 1993 election, but was unsuccessful, coming runner-up to Labour's Chris Carter. =1996-2002 - Member of Parliament= In the 1996 election, which took place under the new MMP electoral system, the Alliance ranked Harr√© in eighth place on its party list. The Alliance gained a sufficient number of votes for Harr√© to enter parliament. After the 1999 election, the Alliance formed a coalition government with Labour (which had by then backed away from many of the policies introduced by Douglas). Harr√© became Minister for Women and Minister of Youth Affairs and Associate Minister of Labour and Commerce. She later gained additional responsibilities as Minister of Statistics. She led the parliamentary campaign for the introduction of paid parental leave from Opposition and as a Minister sponsored the legislation to introduce 12 weeks paid parental leave in 2002. Other causes championed by Harr√© included legislation protecting the interests of building industry sub-contractors, significant minimum-wage increases and the reduction of age discrimination in the minimum wage. She re-launched the pay-equity debate as Minister of Women's Affairs, and a campaign to increase annual leave from three weeks to four weeks. In late 2001, however, the Alliance began to show signs of internal strain. In particular, some members of the party felt that it was losing its independent political identity and failing to differentiate itself from the Labour Party on issues such as free trade, tertiary-education funding and other core areas. The decision of Jim Anderton and a majority of Alliance MPs to back New Zealand's involvement in the US-led invasion of Afghanistan brought these tensions to a head, dividing the caucus and separating the parliamentary leadership from the majority in the non-parliamentary party organisation (led by Matt McCarten). Harr√©, however, aligned herself with the grass-roots party view, and became its de facto leader in parliament. The collapse of the Alliance soon became inevitable, with Anderton and his supporters deciding to contest the 2002 election as a new party (the Progressives). Harr√©, considered to be the foremost of the MPs who remained behind, was chosen to lead what remained of the Alliance into its election campaign, aiming to at least retain a presence in parliament. Harr√© herself was seen as the party's best chance of keeping a parliamentary seat, having a relatively strong chance of winning the seat of Waitakere. In the election itself, however, Harr√© placed second, being defeated by Labour's Lynne Pillay. The following year, Harr√© stepped down as leader of the Alliance, being replaced by Matt McCarten. Harr√© was still active in the Alliance afterwards and was elected to the party executive at its annual conference in 2003. At the 2004 party conference she chose not to re-contest a position within the Alliance stating that from then on the most pragmatic approach for the Alliance would be to instead support the Greens and Maori Party. She was not aligned to any other political party from 2004‚Äì2011, but in 2012 accepted a role as issues director of the Green Party. =2002-2014 - Intermission from parliamentary politics= Harr√© speaking outside parliament buildings in 2006 From 2002 to 2005, Harr√© led the industrial work of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation, including its successful pay-equity campaign for public-sector nurses. She served as General Secretary of the National Distribution Union from 2005 to 2009, after which she joined the Auckland Transition Agency. Harr√© speaking at the New Zealand Council of Trade Union's biennial women's conference in 2009 Between 2010 and 2012 Harr√© worked for the International Labour Organization in Fiji. Subsequently, in 2012 she started work as the inaugural issues director of the Green Party, a position she resigned from in 2013. Harr√© quit the Green Party in protest to the way that the Greens had handled a rebuffed proposition by the Labour Party for conducting a joint electoral campaign. Harr√© co-owns an Auckland restaurant, Ika, which pays a living wage to its staff. =2014 - Return to parliamentary politics= On 29 May 2014, Harr√© was named as the first leader of New Zealand's Internet Party. The party allied with the Mana Party to contest the 2014 election as the Internet MANA Party. Harr√© had second place on the combined party's list. Vikram Kumar (secretary of the Internet Party) initially approached her about becoming a candidate; she declined, but later reconsidered after a meeting with Kim Dotcom. She stated at the time that she got involved again in politics because she wanted to encourage young people to vote, and to re-connect disenfranchised people with the political system. Following the failure of Internet MANA to enter Parliament, Harr√© stood back from media view for several weeks before formally announcing she was stepping down as leader of the Internet Party, effective December 2014. Since the election, Harr√© has been occasionally writing on New Zealand left-wing blog site The Daily Blog, and undertook a \\"pilgrimage\\" across New Zealand called Rethinking the System. In December 2016, Harr√© announced she had rejoined the Labour Party 27 years after she left to join NewLabour. Personal life Harr√© lives in Te Atat≈´ and is married to Barry Gribben. They met through the Labour Party and share an interest in an organic vineyard, a restaurant, and several properties. She also has two children. Harr√© was diagnosed with breast cancer, and, because she has a family history of the disease, opted for a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction. She made a full recovery. Harr√© has run several marathons, including the 2013 Boston Marathon, where she was only a few hundred metres away from the terrorist bombing that occurred near the finish line. Harr√© is the niece of late philosopher and psychologist Rom Harr√© and the sister of psychologist and environmentalist Prof Niki Harr√©.

In classical antiquity, two locations were called Paphos: Old Paphos, today known as Kouklia,Old Paphos, in Ancient Greek: , Ptol. v. 14. ¬ß 1; or, in one word, , Strabo xiv. p. 683; Palaepafos, Plin. v. 31. s. 35) and New Paphos.New Paphos in Ancient Greek (, Ptol. l. c.; Nea Pafos, Plin. l. c.. The name of Paphos, without any adjunct, is used by poets and writers of prose to denote both Old and New Paphos, but with this distinction, to ancient prose writers it commonly means New Paphos, whilst for the ancient poets it generally signifies Old Paphos, the seat of the cult of the Greek goddess Aphrodite. In inscriptions, also, both towns are called . This indiscriminate use sometimes produces ambiguity, especially in the Latin prose authors. The current city of Paphos lies on the Mediterranean coast, about west of Limassol (the biggest port on the island), both of which are connected by the A6 highway. Paphos International Airport is the country's second-largest airport. The city has a subtropical-Mediterranean climate, with the mildest temperatures on the island. Paphos is included in the official UNESCO list of cultural and natural treasures of the world's heritage for its ancient ruins and was selected as a European Capital of Culture for 2017 along with Aarhus. Foundation myth In the founding myth, the town's name is linked to the goddess Aphrodite, as the eponymous Paphos was the son (or, in Ovid, daughter) of PygmalionPygmalion's father was Belus, simply \\"lord\\". whose ivory cult image of Aphrodite was brought to life by the goddess as \\"milk- white\\" Galatea. The author of Bibliotheke gives the genealogy.Bibliotheke, iii.14.3. Pygmalion was so devoted to the cult of Aphrodite that he took the statue to his palace and kept it on his couch. The daimon of the goddess entered into the statue, and the living Galatea bore Pygmalion a son, Paphos, and a daughter, Metharme. Cinyras, debated as to if he is the son of PaphosAccording to the Roman Hyginus, Fabula 142, Cinyras was a son of Paphus, thus legitimate in the patrilineal manner, but Bibliotheke makes Cinyras an interloper, arriving with some of his people from Cilicia on the nearest coast of Asia Minor, and thus a suitor from outside, in the matrilineal manner. The conflict is instructive. or Metharme's suitor, founded the city under Aphrodite's patronage and built the great temple to the goddess there. According to another legend preserved by Strabo (xi. p. 505), it was founded by the Amazons. Old Paphos Old Paphos (Palaepaphos), now known as Kouklia (; or ; ) (Engel, Kypros, vol. i. p. 125), is on a hillThe hill is celsa Paphos in Aeneid x. 51 that had a road which spanned a few miles to the sea. It was not far from the Zephyrium promontory (Strabo xiv. p. 683) and the mouth of the Bocarus stream.Hesychius, under Archaeology shows that Old Paphos has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. It was a centre for Aphrodite's cult. Aphrodite's mythical birthplace was on the island. The founding myth is interwoven with the goddess such that Old Paphos became the most famous and important place for worshipping Aphrodite in the ancient world. The Greek names of two ancient kings, Etevandros and Akestor, are attested in Cypriot syllabary on objects of seventh century BC found in Kourion. = Aphrodite and Paphos = The Greeks agreed that Aphrodite had landed at the site of Paphos when she rose from the sea.Tac. Hist. ii. 3; Mela, ii. 7; Lucan viii.456 According to Pausanias (i. 14), although her worship was introduced to Paphos from Syria, it was much more likely that it was of Phoenician origin. Before being proven by archaeology it was thought that Aphrodite's cult had been established before the time of Homer (c. 700 BC), as the grove and altar of Aphrodite at Paphos are mentioned in the Odyssey (viii. 362). Archaeology established that Cypriots venerated a fertility goddess in a cult that combined Aegean and eastern mainland aspects before the arrival of the Greeks. Female figurines and charms found in the immediate vicinity date back to the early third millennium. The temenos was well established before the first structures were erected in the Late Bronze Age: Old Paphos was the centre of worshipping Aphrodite for the whole Aegean world. The Cinyradae, or descendants of Cinyras, were the chief priests; Greek by name but of Phoenician origin. Their power and authority were great, but it may be inferred from certain inscriptions that they were controlled by a senate and an assembly of the people. There was also an oracle here.Engel, i.p. 483. Few cities have ever been so much sung and glorified by the poets.For example, Aeschylus Suppliants 525; Virgil Aeneid i. 415; Horace Odes i. 19, 30, iii. 26; Status Silvius i. 2. 101; Aristophanes Lysistrata 833, etc. The ruins of Aphrodite's vast sanctuary are still discernible, its circumference marked by huge foundation walls. After its destruction by an earthquake it was rebuilt by Vespasian, on whose coins it is represented, as well as on earlier and later ones, and in the style on those of Septimius Severus.Engel, vol. i. p. 130. From these representations and the existing ruins, Gustav Friedrich Hetsch, an architect of Copenhagen, has attempted to restore the building.M√ºller's Arch√§ol. ¬ß 239, p. 261; Eckhel, vol. iii. p. 86. =New Paphos= Mosaic from the House of Dionysos, god of wine, 3rd c. AD New Paphos (Nea Paphos) was founded on the sea near a natural harbour. It lay about 60 stadia or 12 km northwest of the old city.Strabo xiv. p. 683. It also had a founding myth: it was said to have been founded by Agapenor, chief of the Arcadians at the siege of Troy,Iliad. ii.609 who, after the capture of the city, was driven out by the storm that separated the Greek fleet onto the coast of Cyprus. (Pausanias viii. 5. ¬ß 2.) An Agapenor was mentioned as king of the Paphians in a Greek distich preserved in the Analecta;p. 181, Brunk and Herodotus (vii. 90) alludes to an Arcadian \\"colony\\" in Cyprus. In reality, it was probably founded by Nicocles, the last king of Palaepaphos, based on an inscription recording his founding of the temple of Artemis Agrotera at Nea Paphos. The inhabitants of Marion were probably also transferred to this new city after its destruction in 312 BC by Ptolemy. A hoard of unused silver coins (in the Cyprus museum) found under the Hellenistic House dating back to the end of the 4th century BC are the earliest find at the site and indicates its founding date. Old Paphos always retained the pre-eminence in worship of Aphrodite, and Strabo states that the road leading to it from New Paphos was annually crowded with male and female votaries travelling to the ancient shrine, and coming not only from the New Paphos, but also from other towns of Cyprus. When Seneca said (N. Q. vi. 26, Epistle 91) that Paphos was nearly destroyed by an earthquake, it is difficult to say to which of the towns he refers. Dio Cassius (liv. 23) relates that it was restored by Augustus, and called \\"Augusta\\" in his honor; but though this name has been preserved in inscriptions, it never supplanted the ancient one in popular use. St Paul's Pillar in Paphos According to the biblical Acts of the Apostles, after landing at Salamis and proclaiming the Word of God in the synagogues,Acts 13:5 the prophets and teachers, Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus, traveled along the entire southern coast of the island of Cyprus until they reached Paphos.Acts 13:4-6 There, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted after Saul rebuked the Sorcerer Elymas.Acts 13:6‚Äì12 In Paphos, Acts first identifies Saul as Paul.Acts 13:9 Tacitus (Hist. ii. 2, 3) records a visit of the youthful Titus to Paphos before he acceded to the empire, who inquired with much curiosity into its history and antiquities. (Cf. Suetonius Titus c. 5.) Under this name the historian included the ancient as well as the more modern city: and among other traits of the worship of the temple he records that the only image of the goddess was a pyramidal stone. The sanctuary was closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. =Archaeology= Paphos Archaeological Park covers most of the ancient Greek and Roman City and is a UNESCO World Heritage site for its ancient ruins. The most significant remains so far discovered are four large and elaborate Roman villas: the House of Dionysos, the House of Orpheus, the House of Aion and the House of Theseus, all with preserved mosaic floors. In addition, excavations have uncovered an Agora, Asklepion, the Basilica of Panagia Limeniotissa, an Odeon cinema, a theatre, and a necropolis known as the Tombs of the Kings. =Post-Classical history= Paphos gradually lost much of its attraction as an administrative centre, particularly after the founding of Nicosia. The city and its port continued to decline throughout the Middle Ages and Ottoman rule, as Nicosia, and the port city of Larnaca became more important. The city and district continued to lose population throughout the British colonial period and many of its inhabitants moved to Limassol, Nicosia and overseas. The city and district of Paphos remained the most underdeveloped part of the island until 1974. =Modern Paphos= Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, there was rapid economic activity in all fields, especially tourism in the Kato Paphos area. The government invested heavily in irrigation dams and water distribution works, road infrastructure and the building of Paphos International Airport, the second international airport in Cyprus. In the 1980s, Kato Paphos received most of the investment. In the 1990s, Coral Bay Resort was further developed and in the 2000s, the Aphrodite Hills resort was developed. Today Paphos, with a population of about 35,961 (), is a popular tourist resort and is home to a fishing harbour. Ktima is the main residential district while Kato Paphos, by the sea, is built around the medieval port and contains most of the luxury hotels and the entertainment infrastructure of the city. Apostolou Pavlou Avenue (St. Paul's Avenue), the busiest road in Paphos, connects two quarters of the city. It begins near the city centre at Kennedy Square and ends outside the medieval fort at the harbour. Economy The economy of Paphos heavily depends on tourism and there are four resorts in the district: Kato Paphos, Coral Bay, Latchi, and Aphrodite Hills. The largest is Kato Paphos which employs over half of Paphos' population. Farming, especially banana, grape and tobacco cultivation, contributes significantly to Paphos' economy. Landmarks Paphos pedestrian boulevard The Saracen Rock (foreground) and the Rock of the Greek (background) Paphos Lighthouse Agios Neophytos Monastery M/V EDRO III resting off the rocks near the Sea Caves northwest of Paphos Paphos Castle stands by the harbor, and was originally a Byzantine fort built to protect the harbour. It was rebuilt by the Lusignans in the 13th century before being dismantled in 1570 by the Venetians, who were unable to defend it against the Ottomans who restored and strengthened it after capturing the island. Saranta Kolones, Kato Paphos, near the harbor, is a castle built in the first years of Lusignan rule (beginning of the 12th century) maybe on the site of a previous Byzantine castle. It was destroyed in the earthquake of 1222. UNESCO added the entire town to its World Cultural Heritage List. Among the treasures unearthed are the mosaics in the Houses of Dionysos, Theseus and Aion, preserved after 16 centuries underground; vaults and caves; the Tombs of the Kings; and the pillar to which Saint Paul was said to have been tied and whipped and the ancient Odeon Theatre. Other places of interest include the Byzantine Museum and the District Archaeological Museum, with its collection of Cypriot antiquities from the Paphos area dating back from the Neolithic Age up to 1700 AD. Near the Odeon are the ruins of the ancient city walls, the Roman Agora, and a building dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine. The mosaic floors of these elite villas dating from the 3rd to the 5th century are among the finest in the Eastern Mediterranean. They mainly depict scenes from Greek mythology. The city contains many catacomb sites dating back to the early Christian period. The most famous is Saint Solomoni Church, originally a Christian catacomb retaining some of its 12th century frescoes. A sacred tree at the entrance is believed to cure the ailments of those who hang a personal offering on its branches. A few miles outside the city, the rock of Aphrodite (lit. \\"Stone of the Greek\\") emerges from the sea. According to legend, Aphrodite rose from the waves at this spot. The Greek name, Petra tou Romiou is associated with the legendary frontier- guard of Byzantine times, Digenis Acritas, who kept the marauding Saracens at bay. It is said that to repel one attack he heaved a large rock at his enemy. The site recently had the Aphrodite Hills resort built on it. The resort features a five-star intercontinental resort hotel, an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, fitness facilities, holiday villas, apartments, townhouses and the Retreat Spa. Near Petra tou Romiou is Palaepaphos, Old Paphos, one of the most celebrated places of pilgrimage in the ancient Greek world, and once an ancient city-kingdom of Cyprus. The ruins of the Temple of Aphrodite stand here, dating back as early as 12th century BC. The temple was one of the most important places of Aphrodite's cult and pilgrimage of the ancient world until the 3rd‚Äì4th centuries AD. The museum, housed in the Lusignan Manor, houses artifacts from the area. Yeroskipou is a town in Paphos' metropolitan area known for many years for its delight 'loukoumi'. North-east of Paphos lies Ayios Neophytos (St. Neophytos) Monastery, known for its \\"Encleistra\\" (Enclosure) carved out of the mountain by the hermit himself, which features some Byzantine frescoes from the 12th and 15th centuries. The painted village church of Emba (Empa) is nearby. Four kilometres () north of Paphos is the village of Lemba (Lempa), home to numerous artists, many of whom have open studio shops. It is home to the sculpture known as the Great Wall of Lempa by the Cypriot artist Stass Paraskos and the Cyprus College of Art. Off the coast of Paphos is the wreck of M/V Demetrios II which ran aground on 23 March 1998 in heavy seas during a voyage from Greece to Syria with a cargo of timber. Similarly, on 8 December 2011, the EDRO III ran aground off the coast of Cyprus. It is located near the Sea Caves of Paphos on the western shore of the island close to the Akamas Peninsula. Built in the 1960s, registered in Freetown, Sierra Leone, the Edro III is owed by an Albanian shipping company. It was traveling from Limassol, Cyprus to Rhodes when it ran aground. It is still shipwrecked to this day, although its cargo and fuel oil were removed. Local authorities are hesitant to remove the ship from the rocks due to the fact that the coastline is a protected natural park where turtles nest and endemic plant and animal species thrive. Climate \\"Tzielefos\\" Venetian bridge, Diarizos river, Paphos forest Mavrokolympos Dam Paphos enjoys a subtropical semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen: BSh), with the greatest amounts of precipitation mainly occurring from mid-November to March. It almost never rains in the summer, (with an average of 0.1). In July and August, humidity measurements can go up to 85%. Snowfall occurs rarelyapproximately every 10 yearsand does not normally lead to any significant disruption. It occurs almost annually in the hills of Tsada, north. The last significant snowfall in the city centre occurred in the winter of 2001. Heatwaves in July and August are relatively common, when hot air masses from the Sahara desert drift over to Cyprus causing temperatures to rise. Cyprus has experienced drought-like conditions and the current trend of global warming may increase the severity of these conditions. In the summer of 2008, Cyprus had to ship water by tanker from Greece to meet demand on the island. Since then, water conditions have eased due to good winter rains. Another source with different averages classifies its climate as hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa), for the more average precipitation. Transport Paphos International Airport check-in desks Paphos was once the only traffic-free town in Cyprus; things changed after the urbanization and rise of the population in less than ten years. The roads in the town centre remain unchanged and are unable to accommodate the new level of traffic. The problems exist because some planned road links remain on paper, including: * 2nd part of the northern ring road * Western ring road * Airport road * Paphos ‚Äì Coral Bay road upgrade =Public transport= Public transport in Paphos is currently only served by buses under the company OSYPA LTD. For intercity transportation the main operator is Intercity Buses which offers daily connections across all cities in the Greek Cypriot territory. The main bus station is Karavella station. It is the nexus for all intercity routes and many of the local routes. The other major bus station in Paphos is the Kato Paphos Harbor station, located close to Paphos Harbor and the Paphos Archaeological Park. =Motorways= Chalk layers in A6 motorway (Cyprus) Paphos did not have a motorway link until 2001. It is now accessed through the A6 which connects Paphos with Limassol. The A7 motorway from Paphos to Polis was to have been completed by 2013, though work has not started yet due to the financial crisis in Cyprus. It is not known when or if this road will be built. =Airport= Since 1982, air traffic of Paphos is served by Paphos International Airport located southeast of the city, near Timi. It serves approximately 1.75 million people every year. A new terminal opened in late 2008 adjacent to the old one. =Port= The port is able to hold 300 boats and serves as a small marina and a fisherman shelter. The castle's square hosts Aphrodite's festival every September since 1998. Several other yearly events are hosted in the square, including the Paphos beer festival. Cargo and cruise ships use the Limassol Port away. A marina is planned to be constructed north, next to Coral Bay in Kissonerga. The new marina will serve up to 1,000 boats. Hospitals and medical centres Paphos has only one general hospital located at Anavargos, northeast of the city centre. It was built to replace the old hospital, which was demolished shortly after being abandoned; now, it is a modern medical centre. There was consideration that it might be turned into a university hospital when Neapolis University was opened; as of July 2017, this has not transpired. There are two hospices in the area: The Friends HospiceThe Friends' Hospice Paphos and the Archangel Michael Hospice, which is funded by the Catholic Church in Cyprus.Archangel Michael Hospice There are also several private clinics spread throughout the area, such as St George's Private Hospital, built in 1991. Education Neapolis University The Paphos municipality has 38 primary state schools, 8 secondary state schools (known as gymnasiums and lyceums), 4 privately run English schools and one privately run Russian school. =Higher education= The town of Paphos has one higher education institute that began accepting students in June 2010. The university offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and consists of 4 schools. Arts Paphos is known for its cultural and historical interests, including the Tomb of the Kings, Mosaics, castle and numerous churches, though it is also popular for its festivals and annual events. During September, Paphos holds an annual opera at the Paphos' Aphrodite Festival at the harbor. The castle serves as a backdrop and stage for the performance. Another annual event is Open Studios Cyprus which takes place during selected weekends in October. Selected artists open their studio doors to the general public and provide an informal environment to view and discuss the work with the artist. There are a number of privately owned galleries and exhibition spaces. Details and dates for the regular events can be found in the local English newspapers, such as Cyprus Weekly and Cyprus Monthly. Palia Ilektriki is an exhibition and conference space maintained by the Paphos Municipality. In the centre of the town, this converted plays host to both conferences and exhibitions throughout the year. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, Open Studios Cyprus used this location to launch the event with an Opening Art Exhibition. In 2012, Paphos won the title as European Capital of Culture 2017, under the Executive Direction of Ektor Tsatsoulis and the Artistic Director Spyros Pisinos. The 2014 British independent film Decline of an Empire, starring Peter O'Toole, was partially shot in and around Paphos and Akamas. Sports Paphos has a long history in sports with several football, basketball, volleyball teams. The Pafian gymnastic club is called Korivos, and it owns (via the Cyprus Athletic Organisation) the local Pafiako Stadium and the Aphroditi Sports hall. Stylianos Kyriakides (; 1910‚Äì1987), a marathon runner from Statos, won the 1946 Boston Marathon. According to a newspaper report, he was running with John Kelley near the end, when an old man shouted from the crowd, \\"For Greece, for your children!\\", inspiring him to pull away and win the race.

It is endemic to the Indian Subcontinent and was once thought to be conspecific with the blossom-headed parakeet (Psittacula roseata) but was later elevated to a full species. Plum-headed parakeets are found in flocks, the males having a pinkish purple head and the females, a grey head. They fly swiftly with twists and turns accompanied by their distinctive calls. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the plum-headed parakeet in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in India. He used the French name Le perruche a teste bleu and the Latin name Psittaca cyanocephalos. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the plum-headed parakeet. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name Psittacus cyanocephalus and cited Brisson's work. The specific name cyanocephalus/cyanocephala combines the Ancient Greek words kuanos \\"dark-blue\\" and -kephalos \\"-headed\\". This species is now placed in the genus Psittacula which was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800.Female foraging  Description  The plum-headed parakeet is a mainly green parrot, 33 cm long with a tail up to 22 cm. The male has a red head which shades to purple-blue on the back of the crown, nape and cheeks while the female has blueish-gray head. There is a narrow black neck collar with verdigris below on the nape and a black chin stripe that extends from the lower mandible. There is a red shoulder patch and the rump and tail are bluish-green, the latter tipped white. The upper mandible is orangish-yellow, and the lower mandible is dark. The female has a dull bluish grey head and lacks the black and verdigris collar which is replaced by yellow. The upper-mandible is corn-yellow and there is no black chin stripe or red shoulder patch. Immature birds have a green head and both mandibles are yellowish. The dark head is acquired after a year. The delicate bluish red appearance resembling the bloom of a peach is produced by a combination of blue from the optical effects produced by the rami of the feather and a red pigment in the barbules. Some authors have considered the species to have two subspecies, the nominate from peninsular India (type locality restricted to Gingee) and the population from the foothills of the Himalayas as bengalensis on the basis of the colour of the head in the male which is more red and less blue. Newer works consider the species to be monotypic. The different head colour and the white tip to the tail distinguish this species from the similar blossom-headed parakeet (Psittacula roseata). The shoulder patch is maroon coloured and the shorter tail is tipped yellow in P. roseata. A supposed species of parakeet, the so- called intermediate parakeet Psittacula intermedia is thought to be a hybrid of this and the slaty-headed parakeet (Psittacula himalayana).alt=  Habitat and distribution  The plum-headed parakeet is a bird of forest and open woodland, even in city gardens. They are found from the foothills of the Himalayas south to Sri Lanka. They are not found in the dry regions of western India. They are sometimes kept as pets and escaped birds have been noted in New York, Florida and in some places in the Middle East.  Behaviour and ecology  The plum-headed parakeet is a gregarious and noisy species with range of raucous calls. The usual flight and contact call is tuink? repeated now and then. The flight is swift and the bird often twists and turns rapidly. It makes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit and blossoms which make up its diet. They feed on grains, fruits, the fleshy petals of flowers (Salmalia, Butea) and sometimes raid agricultural fields and orchards. The breeding season in India is mainly from December to April and July to August in Sri Lanka. Courtship includes bill rubbing and courtship feeding. It nests in holes, chiselled out by the pair, in tree trunks, and lays 4‚Äì6 white eggs. The female appears to be solely responsible for incubation and feeding. They roost communally. In captivity it can learn to mimic beeps and short whistling tunes, and can talk very well. Neoaulobia psittaculae, a quill mite, has been described from the species. A species of Haemoproteus, H. handai, has been described from blood samples from the plum- headed parakeet.  History  alt=Ctesias of Cnidus, a 5th-century BC Greek physician to the emperor Artaxerxes II, who ruled the Achaemenid Empire, accompanied Artaxerxes on his 401 BC campaign against his brother Cyrus the Younger. He was author of the lost Indica, a description of India which he wrote based on his experience in Persia and information he gathered from Persian accounts. Fragments of the Indica were preserved by Photius of Constantinople in his Bibliotheca in the 9th century AD; one of these has been identified as describing Psittacula cyanocephala and its abilities as a talking bird. It is likely Ctesias saw the bird himself, with an Indian handler; though his description could also apply to Psittacula roseata, that species is native to areas far further east and is much less likely candidate in Greater Iran. In his summary of Ctesias, Photius wrote:  References  External links * Stamps of Sri Lankan birds plum-headed parakeet Birds of South Asia Least concern biota of Asia plum-headed parakeet plum-headed parakeet ","title":"Plum-headed parakeet"},{"id":"597883","text":"Popstars Live was an Australian music talent show television program similar to Australian Idol that aired on the Seven Network in early 2004. It was an evolution of the original Popstars TV show which aired between 2000 and 2002 on Seven. The show spawned a single and album that made the ARIA charts in April that year. Popstars Live premiered on the Seven Network in February 2004. It was scheduled to run for 16 weeks and was originally slated to air on Sunday and Wednesday nights. During its short run Popstars Live had a troubled history, with two key personnel, Christine Anu and John Paul Young, leaving the program in April 2004 while others have publicly expressed their own concerns about the show. The show was also a ratings failure. Origins Popstars Live was based on the original Popstars, a reality television program that was broadcast on the Seven Network between 2000 and 2002. The aim of that program was to select members for a group or a solo singer and follow the process of recording a single and/or album and the subsequent promotion of the record made by the artists. The Australian TV show saw the creation of three acts which enjoyed initial success: * Bardot (2000) a girl group number one single and album; * Scandal'us (2001) a mixed pop group, number one single, number two album; * Scott Cain (2002) a male singer, number one single. While the first season of Popstars was one of the most popular programs on Australian television in 2000, its popularity steadily declined in later seasons. In 2003, the Seven Network rested the concept. However, the success of Australian Idol, a show that became the most popular program on Australian television that year, soon led to the Seven Network revisiting the Popstars format. Record sales for Idol contestants also played a role in the resurrection of Popstars with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian releasing an album Just as I Am that went six times platinum in Australia and runner up Shannon Noll's That's What I'm Talking About striking up sales of five times platinum. Hoping to emulate the success of BMG Records, which had signed on Sebastian and Noll, Universal Music quickly signed up for the new series. Format The first five episodes featured the selection of the finalists by the judges. The finalists would then sing live in front of an audience with one finalist being eliminated each week until the final winner is selected. The program aimed to attract a large proportion of voters under 25, a similar as Australian Idol. Cast The Popstars Team consisted of: * Luke Jacobz host; * Ian \\"Molly\\" Meldrum judge; * Christine Anu judge; * Shauna Jensen judge; * Tania Doko artist mentor; * John Paul Young artist mentor; The judges initially said that they would offer constructive criticism to the contestants unlike the strong and sometimes personal criticism offered by Mark Holden and Ian \\"Dicko\\" Dickson of rival series Australian Idol. Finalists The finalists were (in order of elimination): * Tarryn Wall * Renee Simone * Kiki Courtidis * Don Pancho * Daniel Hamill * Arrnott Olssen * Eleven (Luke and Nick) * Sarah Gardner - who made it into the top 63 in Australian Idol 2007 - see image 10 of the top 63 at http://www.australianidol.com.au/photos.html?xmlFile=830.xml * Miranda Murphy, from Perth, Western Australia. On 12 July 2004, her debut single debuted at number 19 on the Australian singles charts on 22 July 2004. After an unusually lengthy hiatus from the music scene, and a general lack of activity, it is widely suspected she has been dropped by her record company, due to poor single sales, and a national declining interest in 'bubblegum pop' products of talent quest programs. She now works at \\"Jaanz school of singing\\". * Kayne Taylor, from Melbourne, Victoria who won the 2004 Australian season. Contestants Bunny and Xy were axed from the program in controversial circumstances. Kayne Taylor ended up winning altogether, defeating Miranda Murphy in the final. Reception and controversies The first live performance attracted disappointing ratings when broadcast, attracting only 850,000 in Australian mainland capitals, finishing behind American Idol on Network Ten and shows on the Nine Network. David Leckie, the managing director of the Seven Network, blamed the disappointing ratings on what he considered to be the bland comments of the judges and pressured the producers to ensure that the judges made stronger comments. Christine Anu refused to offer harsh criticism of the contestants resigning in April 2004. In a statement issued on her departure, she said: \\"I chose to play a positive role model and wanted to encourage these young people in their endeavours, rather than criticise them. Although leaving Popstars Live was a difficult decision for me to make, I do feel somewhat relieved that I can now focus on my music.\\" John Paul Young was sacked although the producers claimed that his contract had finished. Ian \\"Molly\\" Meldrum and Tania Doko were also criticising elements of the program in the media in early April. Trevor Steel, a UK record producer and the former lead singer of eighties pop group The Escape Club, was brought in by Universal Music as a replacement judge to offer stronger criticism of contestants. Ratings for Popstars Live continued to decline for the next episode. With 2003 Australian ratings blockbuster The Block due to commence its 2004 season on the Nine Network and American Idol performing well on Network Ten, the Seven Network executives shifted the program from Sunday night to Saturday night and scheduled wildlife documentaries to fill the slot. As Saturday night is the night of the week when the fewest people watch television in Australia and when members of the target audience for Popstars Live are most likely to go out, this shift was widely perceived as an admission of defeat by network executives. The Saturday night program was dropped altogether a few episodes later, leaving only the Wednesday program. Album Universal Music released an album Popstars Live: The Finalists featuring the finalists singing versions of well-known songs. The first single \\"Stand Up Next to Me\\" features the finalists singing on the track. =Sales Performance= In their first week of sales from 5 April 2004, the single barely made the Australian Top 50 and the album could only debut at number 61. Although Universal Music shipped enough copies of both the single and the album to stores to achieve gold status in Australia (35,000 copies), the single and the album only sold one thousand copies. The single eventually reached #29 on the charts and the album reached the ARIA Top 50. Kayne Taylor's debut single Heartbreaker debuted in the top 10 of the Australian charts at the end of June 2004. Runner-up Miranda Murphy also had a debut single That Girl released, and it debuted in the top 20 a few weeks after. However, this didn't seem to boost the success of Popstars Live nor its contestants, with no others releasing singles, nor have Kayne or Miranda released a second single as of November 2004. This contrasts with the sales success of artists appearing on Australian Idol and to a lesser extent the original Popstars. With the television program being moved to a different timeslot less likely to catch the eyes of potential record buyers and the single failing to attract support of radio, it seems as though the album will disappoint the hopes of Universal Music who would have been hoping to match the success of BMG Records from Australian Idol contestants. =Track listing= The track listing for the album is: # \\"Stand Up Next To Me\\" (all finalists) # \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\" - Kiki (hit for Crowded House) # \\"Jealous Guy\\" - Kayne Taylor (hit for John Lennon and later Roxy Music) # \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\" - Miranda Murphy (hit for Roberta Flack and later the Fugees) # \\"Tainted Love\\" - Don Pancho (hit for Gloria Jones and later Soft Cell) # \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" - Tarryn (originally a hit for Savage Garden) # \\"Beautiful\\" - Arrnott Olssen (hit for Christina Aguilera) # \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" - Renee Simone (originally by Prince, hit for Sin√©ad O'Connor) # \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" - Daniel Hamill (originally a hit for The Hollies) # \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" - Luke Parry and Nick de Silwa (originally a hit for Tears for Fears) # \\"Everlasting Love\\" - Sarah Gardner (originally a hit for a variety of artists including U2 and Gloria Estefan) # \\"You Will Always Shine\\" - Bunny and Xy written by Willie Allen See also * List of Australian music television shows External links * Popstar Live webpage * Australian music television series Australian reality television series Seven Network original programming 2004 Australian television series debuts 2004 Australian television series endings Popstars ","title":"Popstars Live"},{"id":"597884","text":"The blossom-headed parakeet (Psittacula roseata) is a parrot which is a resident breeder in Eastern Bangladesh, Bhutan, Northeast India and Nepal, eastwards into South-east Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam) and also China.

He is a former radio host and political analyst for KIRO and Air America Radio, where he hosted his own daily three- hour show. His liberal views contrast with those of his late father and conservative icon, President Ronald Reagan. Early life Reagan was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, the son of Ronald Reagan and his second wife, Nancy Davis Reagan. The family lived in Sacramento while his father was governor, from 1967 His sister, Patti Davis, is five and a half years older. His elder brother Michael Reagan, adopted as an infant by Ronald Reagan and his first wife Jane Wyman, is 13 years older. He also had two half-sisters born to Reagan and Wyman, Maureen Reagan (1941‚Äì2001) and Christine Reagan, who was born prematurely, on June 26, 1947, and died the same day. At an early age, his father, Ronald Reagan, often joked that they were related to every royal family with the name O'Regan in Europe. Burke's Peerage provided the Reagans with their family tree, which lacked any direct connection to European royalty. Ron Reagan undertook a different philosophical and political path from his father at an early age. At 12, he told his parents that he would not be going to church anymore because he was an atheist.\\"20 Questions: Ron Reagan\\", by Betsy Rothstein, The Hill, September 24, 2008. Reagan attended and was expelled from The Webb School of California. He commented: > They [the school administration] thought I was a bad influence on the other > kids. As I recall, the immediate reason was I went to a dance at a > neighboring girl's school in a classmate's car. This was an infraction. They > had been looking for an excuse. I didn't get caught at anything. Reagan dropped out of Yale University in 1976 after one semester to become a ballet dancer. He joined the Joffrey Ballet in pursuit of his lifelong dream and participated in the Joffrey II Dancers, a troupe for beginning dancers, where he was mentored by Sally Brayley. Time wrote in 1980: \\"It is widely known that Ron's parents have not managed to see a single ballet performance of their son, who is clearly very good, having been selected to the Joffrey second company, and is their son nonetheless. Ron talks of his parents with much affection. But these absences are strange and go back a ways.\\" Reagan and Nancy went to see Ron perform at the Lisner Auditorium on Monday, May 18, 1981. The elder Reagan commented in his White House diary on this day that Ron's performance was reminiscent of Fred Astaire. Careers Reagan became more politically active after his father left the White House in 1989. In contrast to his father, the younger Reagan's views were unabashedly liberal. In a 2009 Vanity Fair interview, Ron said that he did not speak out politically during his father's term because the press \\"never cared about my opinions as such, only as they related to him\\", adding that he did not want to create the impression that he and his father were on bad terms because of political differences. In 1991, Reagan hosted The Ron Reagan Show, a syndicated late-night talk show addressing political issues of the day, which was canceled after a brief run since it was unable to compete with the higher ratings of The Arsenio Hall Show, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and Nightline. Reagan has worked in recent years as a magazine journalist, and has hosted talk shows on cable TV networks such as the Animal Planet network. In Britain, he is best known for having co-presented Record Breakers (based on The Guinness Book of Records) for the BBC. Reagan presented a report from the United States each week.Profile, screenonline.org.uk; accessed September 2, 2014. He has served on the board of the Creative Coalition, an organization founded in 1989 by a group that included Susan Sarandon and Christopher Reeve, to politically mobilize entertainers and artists, generally for First Amendment rights, and causes such as arts advocacy and public education. From February to December 2005, Reagan co-hosted the talk show Connected: Coast to Coast with Monica Crowley on MSNBC. Until its demise in 2010, Air America Media aired The Ron Reagan Show. The program made its debut on September 8, 2008. In 2011, he published My Father at 100: A Memoir. In interviews promoting the book, Reagan described noticing his father was having certain mental lapses which, in hindsight, caused the younger Reagan to speculate subsequently that his father may have already been in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease while still in office. This assertion was attacked by critics, including his brother, Michael Reagan. Ron Reagan subsequently clarified that he did not feel the lapses were evidence of \\"dementia.\\"The Colbert Report, January 18, 2011 In February 1986, Reagan hosted Saturday Night Live. Political activities In July 2004, Reagan spoke at the Democratic National Convention about his support for lifting Bush's restrictions on federally funded embryonic stem cell research, from which he expected a cure or new treatments for Alzheimer's disease, of which his father had recently died. \\"There are those who would stand in the way of this remarkable future, who would deny the federal funding so crucial to basic research. A few of these folks, needless to say, are just grinding a political axe and they should be ashamed of themselves,\\" Ron Reagan said of the restrictions. \\"We can choose between the future and the past, between reason and ignorance, between true compassion and mere ideology.\\" Reagan's mother Nancy also supported this position.Nancy Reagan plea on stem cells. BBC News. May 10, 2004. In September 2004, he told the Sunday Herald newspaper that the George W. Bush Administration had \\"cheated to get into the White House. It's not something Americans ever want to think about their government. My sense of these people is that they don't have any respect for the public at large. They have a revolutionary mindset. I think they feel that anything they can do to prevail -- lie, cheat, whatever -- is justified by their revolutionary aims\\" and that he feared Bush was \\"hijacking\\" his father's reputation.Johnston, Jenifer. Reagan Junior Warns Bush: \\"Stop Hijacking My Father's Reputation\\". Sunday Herald. September 26, 2004. Reagan later wrote the essay \\"The Case Against George W. Bush by Ron Reagan\\" for Esquire. He voted for Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. Reagan endorsed then- senator Barack Obama of Illinois for president in the 2008 presidential election.Reagan, Ron. Making It Official: I Endorse Barack Obama. The Huffington Post. October 31, 2008. In November 2015, Reagan endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 Democratic Party primaries. In early 2020, Reagan stated that his father would've opposed Donald Trump, remarking to The Daily Beast that his \\"father would have been ashamed of this Republican Party\\" as well as \\"been embarrassed and ashamed that a president of the United States was as incompetent and traitorous as the man occupying the White House now.\\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ron-reagan-says-his-father-ronald-reagan- would-not-want-republicans-to-vote-for-traitor-trump-in-2020 Personal life Ron Reagan lives in Seattle. He married Doria Palmieri, a clinical psychologist, in 1980. She died in 2014 from neuromuscular disease. They had no children. He married Federica Basagni in July 2018. Reagan stated, in a 2004 New York Times interview, that he did not claim any religion, but that his sympathies were with Buddhism and his wife was a Buddhist. In a June 23, 2004, interview on CNN show Larry King Live, while discussing reasons why he would not run for political office, Ron Reagan stated \\"I'm an atheist. ... I can't be elected to anything because polls all say that people won't elect an atheist.\\" In February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. In May 2014, Reagan appeared in an advertisement for broadcast on Comedy Central for the Freedom From Religion Foundation in which he declared himself \\"an unabashed atheist,\\" and one who is not afraid of \\"burning\\" in Hell. The ad received renewed attention in October 2019 when it aired on CNN during the fourth 2020 Democratic Presidential Debate.

As envisaged, the SR.53 would have been used as an interceptor aircraft, using its rocket propulsion to rapidly climb and approach incoming hostile bombers at high speeds; following its attack run, the aircraft would be able to return to its base by making use of the secondary jet propulsion instead. Although the SR.53 proved to have promising performance during test flights, the requirement for such an aircraft had been overtaken by rapid advances in surface-to-air missile technology, leading to reconsideration of the aircraft's purpose. In July 1960, the development programme was formally cancelled, by which time a total of 56 test flights had been performed. A pair of prototype SR.53 aircraft had been completed and used during flight tests. One of these was destroyed during one such test flight in June 1958. The other, the first prototype, survived and was preserved; it is currently on public display at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. Design and development =Background= The Second World War had demonstrated the importance of strategic bombing to modern warfare, and as the emerging Cold War developed, the development of new and more effective air defences against large waves of hostile bomber aircraft armed with nuclear weapons became a priority for many nations. During the war, Nazi Germany had extensively developed its own rocket-powered aircraft to augment its interception capabilities, in the final two years of the war, it had been able to deploy aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 163 and Bachem Ba 349 which, via rocket propulsion, had been capable of unparalleled rates-of-climb, enabling them to (at least in theory) rapidly sortie to intercept enemy bombers before they reached their targets. As the performance of these aircraft had become increasingly well known to the Allies, RAF experts were eager to explore and understand the underlying technology.Wood 1975, p. 53. In the aftermath of the war, German rocket technology was studied extensively by various members of the former Allied nations. Britain had quickly opted to commence a programme to develop liquid-propellant rockets with the aim of boosting aircraft during the take-off phase, known within the RAF as rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG), and during the climb-to-altitude phase of flight. In 1946, work began on a pair of new British-built rocket motors, the de Havilland Sprite with a maximum thrust of and the Armstrong Siddeley Snarler with of thrust; these rocket motors made use of different propellants, the Sprite used a high-test peroxide (HTP) monopropellant while the Snarler harnessed a methanol/water/liquid oxygen mix. During the early 1950s, both engines proceeded to the flight testing phase; however, some of the demand for their role to provide fighters with increased performance was soon being met by the increasing prevalence of conventional jet engines being equipped with reheat instead. In May 1951, faced with reports on the increasingly potential capability of, and thus the threat posed by, the growing Soviet strategic bomber fleet and that nation's newly developed atomic weapons, the British Air Ministry proceeded to draft an Operational Requirement, OR 301, which sought a rocket-powered interceptor that could attain an altitude of in just 2 minutes 30 seconds. Many of the performance requirement laid out by OR 301 was due to the anticipation of rapid increases in performance by the opposing Soviet aircraft; by the early 1960s, it was suspected that these bombers might well be capable of supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2 with a potential operational altitude as high as .Wood 1975, pp. 53‚Äì54. Accordingly, a capable defence interceptor that could form part of the nation's measures to counter this threat would need to be capable of similar speeds and an exceptionally high rate of climb in order to reach high altitude bombers in time.Wood 1975, pp. 54‚Äì55. The development of the Sprite and the Snarler had led to the possibility of a more powerful rocket engine being developed as the planned powerplant for a viable \\"point defence\\" interceptor.London 2010, p. 29. The requirements of O.R. 301 were considered onerous, including a ramp launch and landing on a skid, and with the compliance of the companies which had approached to tender, the amended Specification F124T allowed for a mixed powerplant configuration along with the adoption of a conventional undercarriage. On 21 February 1951, the revised Specification F124T was circulated to half a dozen of Britain's various aircraft manufacturers to solicit their submissions.Wood 1975, p. 54. =Submissions and selection= Saunders-Roe had not been one of the companies who received the Specification; this is likely due to the Ministry of Supply not considering them to be relevant, as the firm had typically been involved in the production of flying boats. However, Saunders-Roe was in fact interested in the new requirement, having been already independently conducting studies into high-altitude and high-speed flight. Maurice Brennan, the company's chief designer, had already directed members of the design team to study the prospects of rocket-propelled aircraft capable of flying at altitudes of up to and had published a report entitled 'Investigation of Problems of Pure Rocket Fighter Aircraft' at the same time that the Ministry had issued Specification F124T.Dancey, Peter. British Aircraft Manufacturers Since 1909 Fonthill Media, 2014. . Saunders-Roe approached the Ministry on its failure to follow conventional policy in not dispatching the specification nor an invitation to tender to the firm; as a result, on 24 March 1951, the Ministry asked the company to submit its designs alongside the other competitors.Wood 1975, p. 55. By the end of April 1951, Saunders-Roe submitted their detailed proposal. The proposed single-seat aircraft, designated as the SR.53, was capable of very high speeds, being projected as being capable of a top speed of when at an altitude of , and a rate of climb of per minute around an altitude of . An auxiliary disposable undercarriage could be used for takeoffs, along with cordite-based booster rockets. In the event of an emergency, the entire cabin would have originally been jettisoned as a means of providing the pilot with a means of escape; due to the work involved in developing this, it was instead replaced by a more standard ejection seat arrangement. The firm had quickly identified that that original unpowered 'glide home' approach to be dangerous and expensive; they approached the Air Ministry with their concept of a secondary jet engine for the purposes of powering the aircraft's journey home. The Ministry was enthusiastic on this concept; in May 1951, all interested companies were asked to examine this arrangement. The SR.53 was a sleek aircraft with a sharply- pointed nose, delta-like wing, and a T-tail. It was powered by a combination of a single Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine and de Havilland Spectre rocket engine, the exhausts of which were mounted one atop the other on the rear fuselage beneath the tail.Winchester 2005, p. 223.Wood 1975, pp. 55‚Äì56. Saunders-Roe had originally proposed to develop their own rocket motor to power the SR.53, having not been initially pleased with the performance of either the Spectre nor the Screamer; however, it was recognised that this would take substantial development work. By October 1952, the basic outline of the aircraft had been finalised, replacing the combined flap and ailerons of earlier proposed with slotted flaps, the Viper engine was relocated upwards and was to be fitted with a straight jet pipe rather than a bifurcated one, the tailplane was also moved to a higher position at the top of the fin. On 30 October 1952, the company received an Instruction to Proceed from the Ministry for the completion of three prototypes. On 12 December 1952, further refinement of the concept led to the release of the defined Specification OR 337.London 2010, p. 31. The changes of the defined specification mainly revolved around armament changes, adopting the Blue Jay infrared-guided air- to-air missile, which replaced the originally-envisaged retractable battery of rockets.\\"The History of the Saunders Roe S.R.53 and S.R.177\\"Wood 1975, p. 56. During the first four months of 1953, Saunders-Roe had to perform a structural redesign of the SR.53's fuselage, wing, and undercarriage due to a determination by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) that the wing required a greater anhedral angle than had originally been designed for. On 5 May 1953, an advisory design conference was hosted at the Ministry of Supply focusing on the SR.53; three days later, a formal contract for the production of the three prototypes was received. Due to doubts within the RAF and the Ministry over the correct fuel/motor to select for the aircraft in order to meet the Specification, it was decided to issue a modified specification, and later a development contract, to A.V. Roe, who commenced work on their own rocket- powered interceptor, designated as the Avro 720. Of the six companies that tendered proposals, two were selected for development contracts: A.V. Roe with their Avro 720 and Saunders-Roe with the SR.53.Wood 1975, pp. 56‚Äì57. =Issues and proposals= Saunders-Roe, recognising that it would need to outdo the competing Avro 720 if the SR.53 was to be likely to survive, upon having been issued with the contract to build the three prototypes, set a schedule that called for a first flight to be conducted in July 1954, along with a projected service introduction date of 1957.London 2010, p. 30.Wood 1975, p. 57. However, Wood observes that this was far too ambitious as it did not leave time to address the complexity of the aircraft, nor did it accommodate room for delays in the supply of the separately-produced Spectre engine. Unresolved issues with elements of the design caused a series of setbacks, including one notable incident in the form of an explosion occurring during ground tests of the Spectre rocket engine. Construction of the first SR.53 prototype took longer than anticipated, in part due to de Havilland having problems delivering the Spectre engine on time, installing auxiliary equipment was also time-consuming.Wood 1975, pp. 60‚Äì62. Accordingly, the maiden flight of the SR.53 began to fall further and further behind schedule. The date of the first flight was first set back to March 1955, and then into 1957. Unique challenges were posed by the HTP fuel, including the development of suitable storage bags and the fuel flow proportioner.Wood 1975, p. 60. In January 1954, the Ministry reduced its order from three SR.53 prototypes to two, which were constructed side by side at Saunders-Roe's Cowes facility. Development with the competing Avro 720 proceeded more smoothly; by 1956, its prototype was virtually complete and was viewed as being capable of flying up to a year ahead of the lagging SR.53.Wood 1975, pp. 60‚Äì61. By September 1953, the programme to develop these aircraft came under scrutiny due to a need to implement cost cuts; as a result, the contract for the Avro 720 was eventually cancelled. One of the reasons for preferring the SR.53 was although the aircraft was developmentally behind, its use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidiser was viewed as less problematic than the Avro 720's use of liquid oxygen, which posed a fire hazard. According to Wood, there was a preference for the HTP approach, as used by the SR.53, alongside an unwillingness to continue to support the operation of two different fuel programmes.Wood 1975, p. 61. However, the validity of this reason is undermined somewhat by the fact that Avro had been proposing to switch to using HTP and the Spectre, the same engine that was used by the SR.53.Wood 1975, p. 59. Another factor that had influenced the cancellation was the hesitancy of the RAF to back either project, the service had apparently wanted to wait until after flight evaluations had been conducted before it was to make any determination on its preference. During late 1953, Saunders-Roe commenced work upon a derivative design, which was designated as the SR.177. Brennan considered the lack of an onboard radar on the SR.53 and the Avro 720 to have been a vital flaw despite it not being a requirement of the specification, leaving the pilot dependent on his own vision and direction being provided by ground-based radar control. Brennan had also been dissatisfied with the use of the turbojet engine; he believed that a larger jet engine should match the steady supersonic cruising speed of the aircraft, and that the rocket motor should be mainly used for high performance climbs, turns, and rapid acceleration instead. Accordingly, the SR.177 was a much larger and sophisticated aircraft that would provide for more range and overall superior performance to the SR.53.Wood 1975, pp. 57‚Äì58. It was sized to be able to carry a useful airborne radar, which Brennan had deemed to be essential for interception at the high altitudes in where the new fighter was meant to operate. The new, larger aircraft was also to be developed into separate versions for maritime use by the Royal Navy and for West Germany as well as for the RAF.Jones 1994, pp. 35, 38. Saunders-Roe worked on both the SR.53 and SR.177, the latter being worked on by a newly formed High Speed Development Section.Wood 1975, p. 58. Operational history Colour drawing of the first SR.53 In October 1951, Saunders-Roe obtained facilities at RAF Hurn, Dorset, to support the site's use as a base for test flights of the SR.53.Wood 1975, p. 62. This measure had been necessitated by a lack of suitable airfields on the Isle of Wight, where the company was based and typically conducted development from. To this end, the firm constructed a HTP storage faculty at the Hurn site; specialised radio aids were also installed and initially tested using a specially-modified Gloster Meteor which had been lent by the Ministry of Supply.Wood 1975, pp. 62‚Äì63. This setup would ultimately remain unused as flying trials were centered at RAF Boscombe Down instead. On 28 June 1956, the completed first prototype, XD145, was dispatched for assembly by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Boscombe Down.Wood 1975, p. 63. On 16 January 1957, the first installed ground run of its Spectre engine was performed; on 16 April 1957, this was followed by the first installed ground run of its Viper engine. On 9 May 1957, XD145 conducted the type's first ground taxiing trial. On 16 May 1957, Squadron Leader John Booth DFC was at the controls of XD145 for the first test flight, following up with the maiden flight of the second prototype XD151, on 6 December 1957. Test results indicated \\"...an extremely docile and exceedingly pleasant aircraft to fly, with very well harmonized controls\\". Both prototypes flew a total of 56 test flights, with Mach 1.33 speeds being obtained.London 2010, p. 34. While testing at RAE Boscombe Down, XD151 crashed on 5 June 1958 during an aborted takeoff on its 12th flight. Running off the runway, the aircraft struck a concrete approach light, exploding on impact and killing its pilot, Squadron Leader Booth.Winchester 2005, p. 222. The remaining prototype continued to fly with Lt Cdr Peter Lamb taking over the flight test programme. Cancellation It was 1957 before the first SR.53 took to the air, just over a month after the infamous 1957 Defence White Paper had been published outlining the British government's policy to largely abandon piloted aircraft in favour of concentrating on missile development. At the same time, jet engine development had progressed a long way in the six years since the SR.53's initial design. Combined with the fact that improvements in radar had meant that any incoming bomber threat could be detected much earlier, the need for an aircraft like the SR.53 had disappeared, and the project was cancelled on 29 July 1960, with the third prototype (XD153) never built.

It was an enlarged derivative of the Saunders-Roe SR.53, which was itself an experimental combined jet-and-rocket interceptor aircraft. The SR.177 principally differed from the smaller SR.53 in its adoption of a nose- mounted airborne interception radar unit, which allowed it to scan for and lock onto its own targets; a more powerful turbojet engine was also incorporated. In addition to British interests in the aircraft, the German Navy had also expressed their interest in the project and closely evaluated its progress with an eye towards its potential procurement. However, the SR.177 was ultimately cancelled as a result of changes in Britain's military policies in 1957. A much larger derivative of the SR.177 had been studied, which was designated as the SR.187, and was being developed with the intention of meeting the requirements of Operational Requirement F.155. However, this work was also cancelled in 1957. By the time of termination, approximately 90 per cent of the first prototype had been completed, while several other prototypes were in various states of completion.London 2010, p. 34. The prototypes were stored for several years while attempts were made to revive the project; while interest was present, including from Japan, nothing more came of the project and the remaining assets were broken up. Design and development =Background= In 1952, Saunders-Roe had been awarded a contract to develop a combined rocket-and-jet-propelled interceptor aircraft, which was designated as the Saunders-Roe SR.53.Wood 1975, p. 57. However, as development work on the project progressed, the shortcomings of the design became increasingly evident. Most particularly, as with the German rocket- powered interceptors of the Second World War, the range and endurance of such an aircraft were limited by the high rate of fuel consumption by the rocket engine. However, as turbojet engines developed and became increasingly powerful and efficient, new powerplants were quickly becoming available that would make such aircraft more practical.Winchester 2005, p. 223. Maurice Brennan, the chief designer of the SR.53, had also become convinced of the necessity for an airborne radar unit to be carried by the aircraft, as the SR.53 was reliant upon on ground-based radar guidance and the pilot's own vision to intercept aircraft. In particular, it was feared that pilots would be unable to focus their eyes properly at the altitude that the SR.53 was capable of. Out of a combined desire to equip the aircraft with a radar unit and to make greater use of turbojet power, a more ambitious design began to be drawn up.Wood 1975, pp. 57-58. While it had begun as an advanced design concept for the SR.53, upon the issuing of a development contract by the Ministry of Defence in May 1955 (to meet specification F.155), the project was given its own designation as the SR.177.Wood 1986, p. 61. As work continued on the SR.53, a separate High Speed Development Section was formed by Saunders- Roe to work on the SR.177.Wood 1975, p. 58. Initially, the SR.177 was a straightforward development of the SR.53, sharing much of the same configuration and equipment, and it was envisioned that the first test flight would take place during the first half of 1957. However, in February 1955, an extensive redesign of the SR.177, with the aim of making the type suitable for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy, was commenced. Of the changes made to the aircraft, major differences included the repositioning of the jet engine to the lower fuselage lobe, which was now fed with air via a large, chin- mounted intake; the wing was also enlarged and blown flaps were adopted. The turbojet engine selected was the de Havilland Gyron Junior, capable of generating of thrust.Wood 1975, p. 59. =Project launch= In September 1955, Saunders-Roe received instructions to proceed on the SR.177 from the British Ministry of Supply. The Ministry also gave instruction for the production of mock-ups, windtunnel tests, and the development of construction jigs for the manufacture of an initial batch of aircraft.Wood 1975, pp. 63-64. From the onset, the SR.177 faced competition in the form of an enlarged derivative of the Avro 720, which had itself been devised as a competitor against the smaller SR.53. Avro promoted the 720 to the Royal Navy, hoping to win favour away from the SR.177, which was by this point had reached the detail design phase.Wood 1975, pp. 59-60. The Ministry ultimately opted to cancel all work on the Avro 720, primarily as a cost-saving measure, as well as to concentrate development work on HTP-based rocket motors, such as those powering the SR.53 and SR.177.Wood 1975, p. 61. The most significant difference between the SR.53 and SR.177 was the latter's use of a jet engine with nearly five times the thrust of the one adopted for the former. While the SR.53 had relied mostly on its rocket engine for climbing, the SR.177 would be able to add considerable endurance by conserving use of its rocket for the dash towards a target only. It was expected that the added endurance would allow the SR.177 to perform roles other than pure interception; these roles were expected to include strike and reconnaissance missions. The SR.53 design had been considerably enlarged to accommodate the new engine, and the original sleek lines were forfeited for the chin-mounted air intake.Wood 1986, p. 62. Following the maiden flight of the SR.53 in May 1957, the development of the SR.177 became the main focus of activity at Saunders-Roe.Wood 1975, p. 63. At this point, the project was viewed as having considerable large scale potential, as both the RAF and Royal Navy appeared to be set to be customers for the SR.177. The RAF sought to operate it alongside the incoming English Electric Lightning interceptors while, according to aviation author Derek Wood, the Royal Navy also had considerable interest in the programme. When the development contract had been issued in May 1955, it reflected this dual interest. The Navy's requirements were defined in NA.47 while the RAF's requirements were specified in OR.337, which had been issued by the Ministry of Supply as Operational Requirement F.155. There was optimism that a joint aircraft for the two services could be developed, saving considerable expense, time, and effort.Wood 1975, p. 64. Negotiations on the exact number of aircraft sought by either service were protracted; but it had been established that there was demand for an initial batch of 27 SR.177 aircraft, and that sufficient tooling should be produced to enable the programme to transition rapidly to full-rate production. By April 1956, a consensus had emerged that, in order for the first five SR.177s to be completed by January 1958, these aircraft would be produced without any A.I. radar or the ability to support armaments. In July 1956, funding was secured for 27 aircraft to be produced, the first of which being expected to fly by April (later postponed to October) 1958. On 4 September 1956, a formal contract for the 27 aircraft was issued, which was sub-divided into four batches of five, four, four, and fourteen respectively, although the final eighteen were subject to evaluation and were thus pending confirmation.Wood 1975, p. 64. During 1957, a development contract for the SR.177 was announced for its use with the Royal Navy.\\"From All Quarters: SR.177 Development Contract.\\" Flight, 18 October 1957, p. 602. By January 1957, the design of the main component jigs was 70 per cent complete while the component assembly jigs were almost 50 per cent complete; the manufacture of a quantity production batch was nearing, which would have likely been subcontracted to another aviation company due to the high level of workload at Saunders-Roe's Cowes facility.Wood 1975, p. 66. Armstrong Whitworth, who had already taken over work on the basic wing design of the SR.177, had been selected as the second production outlet for the type. The selection of a production center for the SR.177 was complicated by a favourable event; interest in the programme from the West German government. Since 1955, the revived German Air Force had sought a suitable high performance aircraft to equip itself with, and there were hopes that the SR.177 could become the foundation of a collaborative European fighter programme. The German Defence Ministry had first expressed interest in the SR.177 in October 1955; in February 1956, the British Government Committee on Security consented to discussions being held on the SR.177.Wood 1975, pp. 66-67. The prospects of a large German order for as many as 200 aircraft, and for the SR.177 to be manufactured under licence in Germany by the recovering German aircraft industry, were soon being aired, of which the British government declared its openness towards.Wood 1975, p. 67. In January 1957, the Anglo-German Standing Committee on Arms Supply reported that General Kammhuber, the Commander-in- Chief of the German Air Force, was concerned that, due to a lack of available financing until April 1958, the delivery timetable may not be satisfactory. According to Wood, Germany was keen to issue an order as soon as possible by this point.Wood 1975, pp. 67-68. =Decline and cancellation= During 1957, the fate of the SR.177 was to be subject to a massive re-thinking of air defence philosophy in Britain, being principally outlined in the 1957 Defence White Paper, which called for manned combat aircraft to be replaced by missiles. Very shortly afterwards, OR.337 was cancelled and the prospects of an order from the RAF had evaporated.Wood 1975, pp. 68-69. This was a serious blow, while it the Royal Navy and Germany remained potential customers for the SR.177, the confidence of both parties was shaken by the move.Wood 1975, p. 69. Work on the SR.177 continued for a little longer, however, in the anticipation of continued interest from Germany. In September 1957, Aubrey Jones, the Minister of Supply, was keen to support the programme and had agreed to continue funding development of five of the six prototypes. However, according to Wood, the SR.177 was subject to political in-fighting between Aubrey Jones and Duncan Sandys, the minister who had been the prime advocate of the Defence White Paper. While Jones assured German officials that the SR.177 project was continuing, Sandys contacted them to inform them that the aircraft was effectively dead. These mixed messages led to considerable confusion and apprehension within the German Defence Ministry. Further difficulty was added when, in response to lobbying by Rolls-Royce Limited, the German government insisted that the Rolls-Royce RB.153 engine be used in place of the Gyron Junior, causing Saunders-Roe to work on a further hasty redesign of SR.177. The German government also decided to change its priorities from seeking an interceptor aircraft to acquiring a strike fighter instead, leading Saunders-Roe to redesign the aircraft for this role. However, even with Heinkel preparing to manufacture the SR.177 locally under licence, Germany chose to withdraw support from the venture in December 1957. The Minister had visited the German government in November 1957 as the Germans wanted the arrangements to be between governments instead of between their government and Saunders-Roe.\\"West German Defence Policy.\\" Flight, 14 February 1958, p. 195. Of the remaining aircraft under consideration, the West German Government chose to purchase a development of the American Lockheed F-104 Starfighter interceptor instead to meet the role of \\"high-altitude reconnaissance machine, a tactical fighter-bomber, and an all-weather fighter\\", along with the majority of European governments. This Lockheed coup, known as the \\"Deal of the Century\\", caused major political controversy in Europe and the West German Minister of Defence Franz Josef Strauss was almost forced to resign over the issue. During later investigation into Lockheed's business practices, it was discovered that Lockheed had paid out millions of dollars in \\"sales incentives\\" in each of these countries in order to secure the deal. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands confessed to taking more than one million dollars in bribes from Lockheed to buy the F-104.Wood 1986, pp. 67‚Äì69. Following the withdrawal of German interest and there being no requirement for the SR.177 by the RAF, the existing Royal Navy requirement was considered not worthwhile to proceed with. Accordingly, the Ministry of Supply soon chose to cancel the project. On 24 December 1957, a letter from the Ministry was received by Saunders-Roe, announcing the decision to terminate.Wood 1975, p. 70. Saunders- Roe announced that it expected to make 1,000 workers redundant as a result of the termination. As the jigs and near-complete aircraft was disassembled during the New Year, it was decided that the aircraft assemblies themselves should be stored in the event of the project being revived. In 1958, the SR.177 received one last burst of interest when Japan, which was interested in developing a rocket-jet fighter itself, approached Britain with a request for quotations for the purchase of the two prototype SR.53s along with the completion of two SR.177s. However, due to a lack of backing from the British government, this initiative did not come to anything; the Japanese ultimately turned to the F-104 as well. Woods summarises the cancellation of the SR.177 as: \\"...it could ultimately have been built in hundreds or thousands. Due to ridiculous defence policies and a complete lack of Whitehall inter- departmental collaboration in the technology field, one of the most promising projects in a decade was destroyed\\".

Tributaries of this river include the: *Wanapitei River *Pillow River *Murdock River *Wolseley River *Little French River *Pickerel River *Restoule River *Hall River History The steamship Kawigamog carried cargo and passengers on the Pickerel River, a tributary of the French River system from 1913 to 1928. It was used as a transportation corridor by the Algonquian peoples of this region. The Ojibwa named it Wemitigoj-Sibi.Bill Steer, \\"Past and future collide at the French River\\". North Bay Nugget, August 29, 2019. It became known to Europeans as the \\"French River\\" because it became associated with French explorers of the 17th century, including √âtienne Br√ªl√©, Samuel de Champlain and Pierre-Esprit Radisson, and missionaries. Other explorers who later followed this route included Simon Fraser, Alexander Mackenzie and David Thompson. Together with the Ottawa and Mattawa Rivers, the French River formed part of the water highway from Montreal to Lake Superior in the days of the fur trade. It remained a major canoe route until about 1820. Around 1855, the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada provided newfound access to the area and the Georgian Bay. This led to increased exploration and interest for fishing and logging during the era of the Industrial Revolution. After the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, there was a boom in logging along with the creation of Lumber barons in the Great Lakes. The French River was \\"ripe for the picking with its seemingly inexhaustible supply of timber and proximity to the American markets\\". Near the end of the 19th century, logging became the primary activity in the area. It was later settled as a summer tourist and recreation area. For this reason, the French River was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 1985. Because of the rugged nature of the Canadian Shield country surrounding this river, large parts of this river remain relatively untouched and it is now a popular location for recreational canoeing, kayaking, photography, camping, fishing and boating. Following bouts of overfishing, in the 1994 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources placed a slot limit on fishing to protect prime breeding year classes and increase the trophy fish population in the French River. French River Waterway Provincial Park Most of the river's shores from Lake Nipissing to the Georgian Bay, except for the land occupied by the Dokis First Nation between the Upper and Lower French River, have been protected and designated as a provincial waterway park. There are 230 undeveloped back-country campsites available in the park along the river. French River continues to attract vacationers and cottage owners who enjoy the clear water, rocky shores and pine growth forests.

He later sat as MP for Westminster. Family He was the youngest son of Michael Warren and Catherine Plunkett, n√©e Aylmer (his mother was the first wife of Sir Nicholas Plunkett). A brother of his mother was Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (died 1720), admiral and commander-in-chief, had entered the navy under the protection of the Duke of Buckingham, as a lieutenant, in 1678, and helped secure positions for first Oliver Warren, Peter's older brother, and later, Peter. Career In 1716, when he was 13 years old, Warren signed on as an ordinary seaman in Dublin, Ireland and he and his brother initially served together. He rapidly rose in the ranks, becoming a captain in 1727. His ship patrolled American colonial waters to provide protection from French forces. He became involved in colonial politics and land speculation. In 1744, he was made commodore and commanded a 16-ship squadron off the Leeward Islands, capturing 24 ships in four months. The Capture of the Marquise d'Antin and Louis Erasme by the English Privateers Duke and Prince Frederick, 10 July 1745 In 1745, Warren commanded a group of ships, the so called 'Royal Family squadron',https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Walker,_George_(d.1777)_(DNB00) that supported the Massachusetts forces in the capture of Louisbourg. The prize system of the time allowed naval officers to profit from the capture of enemy ships, and this expedition earned Warren a fortune, a promotion to the rank of Rear-Admiral of the Blue, and a knighthood. From July 1747 to 3 August 1747 he was appointed to the command of the Western Squadron. He was second in command of the British fleet on the Devonshire at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. His conduct in the battle won him further fame, a promotion to Vice-Admiral of the Red,Warren Monument, Westminster Abbey and much prize-money. While on a visit to Ireland in 1752, he died suddenly in Dublin \\"of a most Violent fever.\\"Donald I. Stoetzel, Encyclopedia of the French & Indian War in North America, 1754‚Äì1763 Warren's lands included several thousand acres on the south side of the Mohawk River west of Schenectady, New York, now known as Florida, Montgomery County, New York, roughly across from present day Amsterdam. He brought two nephews, William Johnson, eventually Sir William Johnson, and Michael Tyrrell to clear and manage the land. Tyrrell soon left, asking his uncle for support with a naval appointment. Tyrrell had a very distinguished naval career, rising to admiral. He became sick while headed to London from the West Indies, and was buried at sea. In 1741, Warren built Warren House, a mansion overlooking the Hudson River on his 300-acre (120-hectare) estate in Greenwich Village.Letter of William L. Stone, The American Historical Register, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 1895 He also owned property on Long Island (Warren's Wharf), the van Cortland Estate (Westchester County, New York), and South Carolina. Eighteen months before his death, Warren purchased 151 acres along the Delaware River in what is today the Tacony neighborhood of Philadelphia. The land became the Magnolia Grove estate of wealthy Philadelphia merchant, Thomas Gordon, about 1764, and later, of Gordon's son in-law, John Saltar, of the Monmouth County, New Jersey, Saltar's. Fanny Saltar's \\"Reminiscences of Colonial Days in Philadelphia\\" were written at her home on the property, Magnolia Cottage. Personal life In 1731, he married Susannah Delancey (1707‚Äì1771), a daughter of Stephen Delancey, and sister of James Delancey, chief justice and lieutenant governor of the province of New York. She was also a descendant of the Schuyler family and the Van Cortlandt family. Together, Warren and his wife had six children, two of whom, a daughter and his only son died in 1744 during the smallpox epidemic in New York. He moved his wife and three surviving daughters to England in 1747. Catherine, his youngest daughter, was a few months old at the time of his death, and died at age three or four. Warren's daughter Susanna married Colonel William Skinner (not to be confused with Lt. General William Skinner, who became chief engineer of Great Britain), who was a brother of American Revolution General Cortlandt Skinner, and both brothers were grandsons of Stephanus Van Cortlandt, and thus cousins of Susannah DeLancey. This meant that William Skinner and Susannah Warren were cousins, once removed. Warren's granddaughter, Susanna Maria Skinner, was married to Henry Gage, 3rd Viscount Gage, son of General Thomas Gage. As Thomas Gage's wife, Margaret Kemble, was the daughter of Susannah Delancey's cousin, Gertrude Bayard, this made Susannah Skinner and Henry Gage both second cousins, once removed (via William Skinner) and third cousins (via Susanna Warren). (Cortlandt Skinner's daughter Catherine was married to Sir William Henry Robinson, a son of Beverley Robinson. Beverley Robinson was a first cousin once removed of Judith Robinson, first wife of the rebel Carter Braxton). =Legacy= The towns of Warren, Rhode Island and Warren, New Hampshire are named after him.

The shehnai is a musical instrument, originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is made out of wood, with a double reed at one end and a metal or wooden flared bell at the other end.Shehnai Britannica.com.Ranade. p. 307.Hoiberg, p. 1 Its sound is thought to create and maintain a sense of auspiciousness and sanctity and, as a result, is widely used during marriages, processions and in temples although it is also played in concerts. It was a part of the naubat or traditional ensemble of nine instruments found in the royal court. The shehnai is similar to South India's nadaswaram and the indian Bansuri.  Characteristics  This tubular instrument gradually broadens towards the lower end. It usually has between six and nine holes. It employs one set of quadruple reeds, making it a quadruple reed woodwind. To master the instrument, the musician must employ various and intricate embouchure and fingering techniques. The shehnai has a range of two octaves, from the A below middle C to the A one line above the treble clef (A3 to A5 in scientific pitch notation). A shehnai is often but not always made with a body of wood or bamboo and a flared metal end.  Origin of the shehnai  The shehnai is thought to have been developed by improving upon the pungi (a woodwind folk instrument used primarily for snake charming). Another theory of the origin of the shehnai is that the name is a modification of the word \\"sur-nal\\". The word nal/nali/nad is used in many Indian languages to mean pipe or reed. The word \\"sur\\" means tone or tune‚Äîmusical note or simply music‚Äîand is used as a prefix to the names of many Indian instruments. The \\"sur-nal\\" is said to have given its name to the \\"surna/zurna\\" of the old Persian Empire, which is the name by which the reed- pipe is known throughout the Middle East and eastern Europe. Shehnai is usually played at traditional North Indian weddings and is associated with the bride leaving her parental house for her husband's house.Dileep Karanth, The Indian Oboe Reexamined, E-ASPAC 2005, retrieved 5 May 2008 Sometimes, two shehnais can be tied together, making it a double shawm similar to the ancient Greek aulos.Chalumeau double (picture from the book \\"Illustrated encyclopedia of Musical Instruments\\".there are also reeds that are blown through to make it vibrate to make the sound come out The counterparts to the shehnai played in West India and Coastal Karnataka are indigenous to the territory.

This verdict was however overturned in May 2013, after a US federal appeals court found that the American trial judge, Jed Rakoff, had incorrectly instructed the jury on a point of English law. A new, judge-led trial was heard by Mr Justice Burton in London in June 2016.

Once at Oxford it became known as ‚ÄòArtsake‚Äô and employed a large number of Hands‚Äô fellow students. While at university, he became friends with William Hague, who was later best man at his wedding, in 1984, to Julia Caroline Ablethorpe. The couple have two sons and two daughters. His wife's house in Kent, just outside Sevenoaks, was once presented to Winston Churchill, while his family's estate in Tuscany, Villa Saletta, produces wine and olive oil. The estate's wines have won several awards.Wine Details: Borgo Saletta - IGT Rosso Toscana 2006 . International Wine and Spirit Competition 2006Saletta wine description . Villa Saletta website Hands and his wife own the Hand Picked Hotels chain of 20 English country house properties, which is run by Julia Hands. In April 2009, in protest at the UK tax system, Hands moved to the Bailiwick of Guernsey. Since then, he has not been to the UK and his family travel to Guernsey to see him. The writer Malcolm Gladwell called the move to Guernsey an ‚Äúincredibly interesting pathology‚Äù, seeing exile from the UK as a significant reverse in the benefits of being immensely wealthy.Foley, Stephen (19 September 2014) Running with the FT: Malcolm Gladwell FT.com In 2017 Guy and Julia Hands agreed to a deal to acquire McDonald's Nordic operations. The Nordic countries consist of approximately 435 restaurants, 95% of which are franchised. The deal will see Hands become the developmental licensee and master franchiser for McDonald's in the region. In May 2019 he admitted to The Times that he had an addiction to roast potatoes and gravy and that he had sought treatment from hypnosis to combat it.  Philanthropy  The Hands family support a number of charities including the Prince's Trust, King's College, Cambridge, Duke of Edinburgh Awards,DofE Supporters . The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Kids Company, The Eve Appeal, Hospice in the Weald, ICAN, and Outward Bound. They have also been significant supporters of Mansfield College, Oxford. In recognition of their significant contributions, Mansfield hosts an annual Hands Lecture series, whose speakers have included Lord Mandelson, David Boies and Bob Geldof. Since 2014, the Hands family has donated ¬£2.2 million towards Mansfield's Love Lane building, which will house the University's new Institute of Human Rights. Hands first donated money to Mansfield College in 1995, and has since been active in its development. One of the areas of change Hands has been vocal on was the decision to focus on providing educational access to ‚Äònon-typical students‚Äô. The College now claims a UK state school intake of 91.4% compared with just under 60% for the rest of the University - a statistic which Hands stated ‚Äòputs Mansfield in a different league‚Äô. Through Terra Firma London, Hands donates 10% of pre-tax profits to the Terra Firma Charitable Trust and Impetus - The Private Equity Foundation, with these donations going to local communities in Southwark in South London where the company has offices.

Some scholars exclude pre-sectarian Buddhism when using the term. The term Theravada refers to Buddhist practices based on these early teachings, as preserved in the PƒÅli Canon.  In Indian Buddhism  = Overview = Early Buddhism in India is generally divided into various monastic fraternities, or nikƒÅyas. Conventionally numbering eighteen, the actual count varied over time. The doctrinal orientation of each school differed somewhat, as did the number of pi·π≠akas in their canon. An example of this is the Dharmaguptaka, which included a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka and a DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ Pi·π≠aka. = In the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch = The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika nikƒÅyas generally advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats. Therefore, for the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, the bodhisattva ideal and buddhahood was advocated over the ideal of becoming an arhat. Avalokitavrata wrote of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas as using a \\"Great ƒÄgama Pi·π≠aka\\", which is then associated with MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras such as the Praj√±ƒÅparamitƒÅ and the Ten Stages Sutra. In the Caitika group of nikƒÅyas, the P≈´rva≈õailas and the Apara≈õailas each were known to have the ' in Prakrit. BhƒÅvaviveka also wrote of the SiddhƒÅrthikas using a VidyƒÅdhƒÅra Pi·π≠aka, and the P≈´rva≈õailas and Apara≈õailas both using a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, implying organized collections of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts within these MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika nikƒÅyas. =In the SthaviravƒÅda branch= In the Sthavira nikƒÅya, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins were a major nikƒÅya. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin ' is known to employ the outlook of Buddhist practice as consisting of three vehicles: ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna, PratyekabuddhayƒÅna, and BodhisattvayƒÅna. References to the BodhisattvayƒÅna and the practice of the Six pƒÅramitƒÅs are commonly found in SarvƒÅstivƒÅda works as well. The Theravada sect from Sri Lanka generally accepts the three vehicles, but categorizes these as three different types of bodhi, or enlightenment. The Theravada nikaya only uses the PƒÅli Canon, which has three pi·π≠akas, and does not contain separate literature for bodhisattvas. Walpola Rahula writes of this, \\"At the end of a religious ceremony or an act of piety, the bhikkhu who gives benedictions, usually admonishes the congregation to make a resolution to attain Nirvana by realising one of the three Bodhis - Sravakabodhi, Pratyekabodhi or Samyaksambodhi - as they wish according to their capacity.\\"  Relationship to MahƒÅyƒÅna  Jan Nattier writes that there is also no evidence that MahƒÅyƒÅna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Paul Williams has similarly noted that the MahƒÅyƒÅna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate vinaya or ordination lineage from the Indian nikƒÅyas, and therefore each bhik·π£u or bhik·π£u·πáƒ´ adhering to the MahƒÅyƒÅna formally belonged to one of these nikƒÅyas. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka nikƒÅya in East Asia, and the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda nikƒÅya in Tibetan Buddhism. \\"Hinayana\\" and Nikaya Buddhism Many commentors on Buddhism have used the term Hƒ´nayƒÅna to refer to NikƒÅya Buddhism. However, that term is now generally seen as flawed: * Hƒ´nayƒÅna, (literally \\"inferior vehicle\\"), is often regarded as an offensive or pejorative term. * Hƒ´nayƒÅna was coined by the MahƒÅyƒÅna, and has never been used by NikƒÅya Buddhists to refer to themselves. * Hƒ´nayƒÅna as a technical term, indicated the vehicles of both the SƒÅvakabuddha and the pratyekabuddha, whereas as a division of Buddhism, it refers solely to the individuals who follow the former vehicle, towards the achievement of Savakabuddhahood, while the MahƒÅyƒÅna in the sense of the bodhisattva path existed within the early schools already. * It is sensible to use a terms for a division of population which is ideally used by themselves, and failing that, at least not offensive to them. According to Robert Thurman, the term \\"NikƒÅya Buddhism\\" was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University, as a way to avoid the usage of the term Hinayana. \\"Nikaya Buddhism\\" is thus an attempt to find a more neutral way of referring to Buddhists who follow one of the early Buddhist schools, and their practice. The term ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna (literally, \\"hearer vehicle\\" or \\"disciples' vehicle\\") is also sometimes used for the same purpose. Other terms that have been used in similar senses include sectarian Buddhism or conservative Buddhism. Note that nikƒÅya is also a term used in TheravƒÅda Buddhism to refer to a subschool or subsect within Theravada. Like the term Hinayana Buddhism, the term NikƒÅya Buddhism focuses on the presumed commonality between the schools, and not on the actual schools themselves. This commonality is thought to be found in a certain attitude. The term \\"NikƒÅya Buddhism\\" tries to shift the attention to the more neutral issue of attitude concerning the authenticity of scriptures.

Emerging from Harlem in New York City in the early to mid-1990s, Coleman became well known amongst underground hip-hop fans for his freestyling ability. He was eventually signed to Columbia Records, where, in 1995, he released his debut album, Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous. On February 15, 1999, Coleman was shot nine times by an unknown assailant in East Harlem, New York, his hometown. He died from his injuries. Noted for his use of wordplay, multiple writers at AllMusic, HipHopDX and The Source have praised Coleman for his lyrical ability, and he has also been described as \\"one of the most auspicious storytellers in hip-hop history.\\" Regarding Coleman's legacy in an interview with Funkmaster Flex, Nas claimed \\"[Coleman] scared me to death. When I heard [his performance at the Apollo Theater] on tape, I was scared to death. I said, 'Yo, it's no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.'\\" Early life Lamont Coleman was born in Harlem, New York City, on May 30, 1974, the third and youngest child of Gilda Terry (d. 2008) and Charles Davis. Davis left the family while Coleman was a child. His two older siblings, Donald Coleman and Leroy Phinazee (d. 2002), were the children of Gilda and a man named Mr. Phinazee. Coleman received the nicknames \\"Little L\\" and \\"'mont 'mont\\" as a child. At the age of 12, Coleman became a big hip hop fan and started freestyling with other people in his neighborhood. He founded a group known as Three the Hard Way in 1990, but it was quickly broken up due to a lack of enthusiasm amongst the members. It consisted of Coleman, Doc Reem, and Rodney. No projects were released, and after Rodney left, the group was renamed Two Hard Motherfuckers. Around this time, people started to refer to Coleman as \\"Big L\\". In the summer of 1990, Coleman met Lord Finesse at an autograph session in a record shop on 125th Street. After he did a freestyle, Finesse and Coleman exchanged numbers. Coleman attended Julia Richman High School. While in high school, Coleman freestyle battled in his hometown; in his last interview, he stated, \\"in the beginning, all I ever saw me doing was battling everybody on the street corners, rhyming in the hallways, beating on the wall, rhyming to my friends. Every now and then, a house party, grab the mic, a block party, grab the mic.\\" He graduated in 1992. Coleman began writing rhymes in 1990. Career =1992‚Äì1995: First recordings and record deal= In 1992, Coleman recorded various demos, some of which were featured on his debut album Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous, he also founded the Harlem rap group Children of the Corn (COC) with Killa Cam (Cam'ron), Murda Mase (Ma$e), Bloodshed and McGruff in 1993.Hess (2010), p. 40 On February 11, Coleman appeared on Yo!

In that same year, he won an amateur freestyle battle, which consisted of about 2,000 contestants and held by Nubian Productions. In 1992, Coleman signed to Columbia Records. Around this time, L joined Lord Finesse's Bronx-based hip hop collective Diggin' in the Crates Crew (DITC) which consisted of Lord Finesse, Diamond D, O.C., Fat Joe, Buckwild, Showbiz and A.G. In 1993, Coleman released his first promotional single, \\"Devil's Son\\", and later said it was one of the first horrorcore singles, influencing others. He said he wrote the song because \\"I've always been a fan of horror flicks. Plus the things I see in Harlem are very scary. So I just put it all together in a rhyme.\\" However, he said he preferred other styles over horrorcore. On February 18, 1993, Coleman performed live at the Uptown Lord Finesse Birthday Bash at the 2,000 Club, which included other performances from Fat Joe, Nas, and Diamond D. In 1994, he released his second promotional single \\"Clinic\\". On July 11, 1994, Coleman released the radio edit of \\"Put It On\\", and three months later the video was released.

Gerard Woodley, one of Big L's childhood friends, was arrested three months later for the crime. \\"It's a good possibility it was retaliation for something Big L's brother did, or Woodley believed he had done,\\" said a spokesperson for the New York City Police Department. However, there are people like rapper Cam'ron who said that Big L had tried help his brother put a hit on Woodley. Woodley was later released due to lack of evidence, and the murder case remains officially unsolved. On June 24, 2016, Woodley was shot in the head and later died at Harlem Hospital.

XXL did a tribute to Lamont in March 2003. On February 16, 2005, at SOB's restaurant and nightclub in Manhattan, held a commemoration for him. It included special guests such as DITC, Herb McGruff, and Kid Capri. All the money earned went to his estate. In 2004, Eminem made a tribute to him in his music video for his single \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\". Jay Z stated in an interview with MTV, \\"We were about to sign him right before he passed away. We were about to sign him to Roc-a-Fella. It was a done deal‚Ä¶I think he was very talented‚Ä¶I think he had the ability to write big, and big choruses.\\" Rapper Nas also said on MTV, \\"He scared me to death. When I heard that on tape, I was scared to death. I said, 'Yo, it's no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.'\\" =Style= Coleman is often credited in helping to create the horrorcore genre of hip hop with his 1992 song \\"Devil's Son.\\" However, not all his songs fall into this genre. For example, in the song \\"Street Struck,\\" Coleman discusses the difficulties of growing up in the ghetto and describes the consequences of living a life of crime. Idris Goodwin of The Boston Globe wrote that \\"[Big L had an] impressive command of the English language\\", with his song \\"Ebonics\\" being the best example of this. He was notable for using a rap style called \\"compounding\\". Coleman also used metaphors in his rhymes. M.F. DiBella of Allmusic stated Coleman was \\"a master of the lyrical stickup undressing his competition with kinetic metaphors and a brash comedic repertoire\\". On the review of The Big Picture, she adds \\"the Harlem MC as a master of the punch line and a vicious storyteller with a razor blade-under-the-tongue flow.\\" Trent Fitzgerald of Allmusic said \\"a lyrically ferocious MC with raps deadlier than a snakebite and mannerisms cooler than the uptown pimp he claimed to be on records.\\" =Documentary= A documentary Street Struck: The Big L Story was set to be released in 2017. It is directed by a childhood friend and independent film director, Jewlz. Approximately nine hours of footage was brought in, and the film is planned to be 90 to 120 minutes long. The first trailer was released on August 29, 2009. Street Struck contains interviews from his mother Gilda Terry; his brother Donald; childhood friends E-Cash, D.O.C., McGruff, and Stan Spit; artists Mysonne and Doug E. Fresh; producers Showbiz and Premier; and recording DJs Cipha Sounds and Peter Rosenberg. A soundtrack will be made for the documentary, and it will be put together by Lamont's brother Donald.

The instrument consists of a reservoir into which air is blown and then channelled into two reed pipes. It is played with no pauses, as the player employs circular breathing. In street performances, the pungi is used for snake charming. History The pungi is an Indian folk music instrument that is mostly played by cobra charmers in Sindh, Pakistan, and Rajasthan, India. The instrument is made from a gourd. It is also a double-reed instrument. The pungi is played by Jogi in the Thar desert. It was theorized that it was made not just for snake charming, but to make people enter a half- conscious state as part of a religious practice. It is in particular played by snake charmers, mostly in the Terai and Nepal, to arouse snakes to dance. The instrument has a high, thin tone and continuous low humming. It has been an important instrument in Indian folk culture and is known by various names in different parts of India. In northern India, it is known as the been, tumbi, and bansi; in the south, it is known as the magudi, mahudi, pungi, and pambaattikuzhal. http://www.schoolchalao.com/basic-education/show- results/indian-musical-instruments/pungi-or-been Construction The pungi is constructed from a solid coconut cover, to which pieces of bamboo are joined, and has two components: a hollow vessel constructed from a gourd, and double- reed pipes (jivala) with eight to nine holes. The player blows air through the top tube-like portion of the instrument. One pipe makes drone-like sounds. and the other produces the melody. The pipe that produces the melody has seven holes and a range of one octave. The drone pipe only has one hole. Traditionally, both sounds are played simultaneously using circular breathing to create a hypnotic effect. The pungi is usually played solo, as it is difficult to play it with other instruments.https://www.india- instruments.com/windinstrument-details/pungi-snake-charmer-been-shapure- bansi.html = Ban on snake charming = The instrument was often used to entertain the public with snake charming.

The other two specimens are in the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Tierkunde in Dresden. Hendel rated the species as \\"an isolated group of acalyptrate muscids\\". His judgement has been sustained, and they are now recognised as belonging to a distinct family Eurychoromyiidae. No other specimens have ever been identified as belonging to this family. Classification has proved difficult, the absence of any male specimens adding to the difficulties. Following Hennig (1958) they are here tentatively included in the superfamily Lauxanioidea. In 2010 Gaimari & Silva placed then as a subfamily within Lauxaniidae and added further genera, 5 of them new to science. E. mallea is a shiny, peach-brown insect, in length, with a head wide. The immature stages and male specimens have not been seen.

Designed as a medium bomber, the Albemarle was used for general and special transport duties, paratroop transport and glider towing. Albemarle squadrons participated in Normandy and the assault on Arnhem during Operation Market Garden. Background Air Ministry Specification B.9/38 required a twin- engine medium bomber of wood and metal construction, that could be built by manufacturers outside the aircraft industry and without using light alloys. The Air Ministry was concerned that if there was a war, the restricted supply of materials might affect construction of bombers. Armstrong Whitworth, Bristol and de Havilland were approached for designs. Bristol proposed two designs - a conventional undercarriage and an wingspan capable of 300 mph and a tricycle undercarriage design with span with a maximum speed of . Both designs, known as the Type 155, used two Bristol Hercules engines. The Armstrong Whitworth AW.41 design used a tricycle undercarriage and was built up of sub-sections to ease manufacture by firms without aircraft construction experience. The AW.41 was designed with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in mind but with Bristol Hercules as an alternative (\\"shadow\\") engine. In June 1938, mock- ups of both the AW.41 and Bristol 155 were examined and new specifications B.17/38 and B.18/38 were drawn up for the respective designs. De Havilland did not submit a design. The specification stipulated at economical cruise while carrying of bombs. Bristol was already busy with other aircraft production and development and stopped work on the 155. Changes in policy made the Air Staff reconsider the Albemarle as principally a reconnaissance aircraft capable of carrying out bombing. Among other effects, this meant more fuel to give a range. An upper dorsal turret and a (retractable) ventral turret for downward firing were added. In October 1938, 200 aircraft were ordered \\"off the drawing board\\" (i.e. without producing a prototype). The aircraft was always expected to be of use as a contingency and to be less than ideal. Design and development The Albemarle was a mid-wing, cantilever monoplane with twin fins and rudders. The fuselage was built in three sections; the structure being unstressed plywood over a steel tube frame.Flight 27 January 1944, p. 89 The forward section used stainless steel tubing to reduce interference with magnetic compasses.Flight 27 January 1944, p. 90. It had a Lockheed hydraulically operated, retractable tricycle undercarriage, the main wheels retracting back into the engine nacelles and the nose wheel retracting backwards into the front fuselage. The two pilots sat side by side with the radio operator behind the pilots and the navigator in the nose forward of the cockpit. The bomb aimer's sighting panel was incorporated into the crew hatch in the underside of the nose. In the rear fuselage were glazed panels for a \\"fire controller\\" to coordinate the turrets against attackers. The dorsal turret was a Boulton-Paul design with four Browning machine guns. A fairing forward of the turret automatically retracted as the turret rotated to fire forwards.Flight 27 January 1944, p. 88. Fuel was in four tanks and additional tanks could be carried in the bomb bay. A notable design feature of the Albemarle was its undercarriage, which included a retractable nose-wheel (in addition to a semi-concealed \\"bumper\\" tail-wheel). It was the first British- built aircraft with this configuration to enter service with the Royal Air Force. The original bomber design required a crew of six including two gunners; one in the four-gun dorsal turret and one in a twin-gun ventral turret but only the first 32 aircraft, the Mk I Series I, were produced like this and they were only used as bombers on two occasions.Williams 1989, p. 37. The Albemarle was considered inferior to other aircraft already in service, such as the Vickers Wellington.Williams 1989, p. 36. Later aircraft were built as transports, called either \\"General Transport\\" (GT) or \\"Special Transport\\" (ST). When used as a paratroop transport, ten fully armed troops could be carried. The paratroopers were provided with a dropping hatch in the rear fuselage and a large loading door in the fuselage side.Bridgman, Leonard. Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II. New York: Crescent Books, 1988. . The production run of 600 Albemarles was assembled by A.W. Hawksley Ltd of Gloucester, a subsidiary of the Gloster Aircraft Company formed to build the Albemarle. Gloster was a part of the Hawker Siddeley group which included Armstrong Whitworth. Individual parts and sub-assemblies for the Albemarle were produced by about 1,000 subcontractors.Tapper 1988, p. 277.\\"British Aircraft of WWII.\\" jaapteeuwen.com. Retrieved: 15 March 2007. Operational History The first Albemarle (P1360) first flew on 20 March 1940 at Hamble Aerodrome, where it was assembled by Air Service Training and was the first of two prototypes built by Armstrong Whitworth.Mason 1994, pp. 335‚Äì337. To improve take-off, a wider span wing was fitted after the eighth aircraft. Plans for using it as a bomber were dropped due to delays in reaching service, it was not an improvement over current medium bombers (such as the Vickers Wellington) and it had obvious shortcomings compared to the four-engined heavy bombers about to enter service but it was considered suitable for general reconnaissance. The Soviet Air Force placed a contract for delivery of 200 Albemarles in October 1942. An RAF unit - No. 305 FTU, at RAF Errol near Dundee - was set up to train Soviet ferry crews.Williams 1989, p. 41. During training, one aircraft was lost with no survivors. The first RAF squadron to operate the Albemarle was No. 295 at RAF Harwell in January 1943. Other squadrons to be equipped with the Albemarle included No. 296, No. 297 and No. 570. The first operational flight was on 9 February 1943, by a 296 Squadron Albemarle which dropped leaflets over Lisieux in Normandy. A Soviet-crewed Albemarle flew from Scotland to Vnukovo airfield, near Moscow, on 3 March 1943, and was followed soon afterwards by eleven more aircraft. Two Albemarles were lost over the North Sea, one to German fighters and the other to unknown causes. Tests of the surviving Albemarles revealed their weaknesses as transports (notably the cramped interior) and numerous technical flaws; in May 1943, the Soviet government suspended deliveries and eventually cancelled them in favour of abundant American Douglas C-47 Skytrains. (The Soviet camp at Errol Field continued until April 1944: apparently the Soviet government hoped to secure de Havilland Mosquitos.) At least two of the Albemarles that reached the USSR were lost in accidents and the surviving aircraft were retired two years later. Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle of No. 296 or 297 Squadron RAF, taking off from Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, with an Airspeed Horsa Mark I in tow. From mid-1943, RAF Albemarles took part in many British airborne operations, beginning with the invasion of Sicily. The pinnacle of the aircraft's career was a series of operations for D-Day, on the night of 5/6 June 1944. 295 and 296 Squadrons sent aircraft to Normandy with the pathfinder force, and 295 Squadron claimed to be the first squadron to drop Allied airborne troops over Normandy. On 6 June 1944, four Albemarle squadrons and the operational training unit sent aircraft during Operation Tonga; 296 Squadron used 19 aircraft to tow Airspeed Horsas; 295 Squadron towed 21 Horsas, although it lost six in transit; 570 Squadron sent 22 aircraft with ten towing gliders; and 42 OTU used four aircraft. For Operation Mallard on 7 June 1944, the squadrons towed 220 Horsas and 30 Hamilcars to Normandy. On 17 September 1944, during Operation Market Garden at Arnhem, 54 Horsas and two Waco Hadrian gliders were towed to the Netherlands by 28 Albemarles of 296 and 297 squadrons; 45 aircraft were sent the following day towing gliders. Of the 602 aircraft delivered, 17 were lost on operations and 81 lost in accidents. The last Royal Air Force unit to operate the type was the Heavy Glider Conversion Unit, which replaced the Albemarles with Handley Page Halifaxes in February 1946 and the type was retired from operational units. Variants Over the course of its production life, a number of variants of the Albemarle were built: * ST Mk I ‚Äì 99 aircraft * GT Mk I ‚Äì 69 * ST Mk II ‚Äì 99 * Mk III ‚Äì One prototype only. * Mk IV ‚Äì One prototype only. * ST Mk V ‚Äì 49 * ST Mk VI ‚Äì 133 * GT Mk VI ‚Äì 117 Most Marks were divided into \\"Series\\" to distinguish differences in equipment. The ST Mk I Series 1 (eight aircraft) had the four gun turret replaced with hand-operated twin-guns under a sliding hood. As a special transport, a loading door was fitted on the starboard side and the rear fuel tank was removed. The 14 ST Mk I Series 2 aircraft were equipped with gear for towing gliders. The Mk II could carry 10 paratroops and the Mk V was the same but for a fuel jettison system. All production Albemarles were powered by a pair of Bristol Hercules XI radial engines. The Mk III and Mk IV Albemarles were development projects for testing different powerplants; the former used the Rolls-Royce Merlin III and the latter used the Wright Double Cyclone.

Born into an illustrious Bengali Muslim family in Midnapore, Suhrawardy was educated at the University of Calcutta and was trained as a barrister in Oxford where he practised at the Gray's Inn in Great Britain. Upon returning to India in 1921, his legislative career started with his election to the Bengal Legislative Assembly on Muslim League's platform but joined the Swaraj Party when he was invited to be elected as the Deputy Mayor of Calcutta under Chittaranjan Das. After Chittaranjan Das's death in 1925, Suhrawardy promoted the Muslim unity on a Muslim League platform, and began advocating for the two-nation theory. After the general elections held in 1934, Suhrawardy pushed for strengthening the Muslim League's political programme and asserted his role as becoming one of the Founding Fathers of Pakistan. After joining the Bengal government in 1937, Suhrawardy assumed the only Muslim League-led government after the general elections held in 1945, and faced criticism from the press for his alleged role in the massive riots that took place in Calcutta in 1946. As the Partition of India loomed in 1947, Suhrawardy championed an alternative to the Partition of Bengal, the idea of an independent united Bengal not federated with either India or Pakistan. This proposal enjoyed some support from Muhammad Ali Jinnah, but ultimately was not adopted. Nonetheless, Suhrawardy worked towards integration of East Bengal into the Federation of Pakistan but parted ways with the Muslim League when he joined hands to establish the Awami League in 1949. During the legislative elections held in 1954, Suhrawardy provided his crucial political support to the United Front that defeated the Muslim League. In 1953, Suhrawardy joined the Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra's Ministry of Talents as a Minister of Law and Justice and served his position until 1955. After supporting the vote of no-confidence motion at the National Assembly that removed Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, the three-party coalition government of Muslim League, Awami League, and the Republican Party, appointed Suhrawardy to the office of Prime Minister, promising to address the issue of economic disparities between the Western Pakistan and the Eastern Pakistan, resolving the energy conservation crises and reforming the nation's military. His foreign policy resulted in increase dependency towards the US foreign aid to the country and pioneering a strategic partnership with the United States against the Soviet Union, and recognised the China by supporting the One-China policy. On the home front, he faced pressure from the business and stock community over his economic policy to distribute the taxation and federal revenues between East Pakistan and West Pakistan, where the controversial issue of national integration had been brought to fruition by the nationalists. After defections from his coalition, and under pressure from President Iskander Mirza, Suhrawardy resigned rather than be dismissed. Early years =Family background and education= Huseyn Suhrawardy was born on 8 September 1892 in Midnapore, Bengal in India into an illustrious Bengali Muslim family known for their wealth, education, and gentry background, who claimed to be the direct descendants of the First Caliph. His father, Justice Sir Zahid Suhrawardy, was a jurist at the Calcutta High Court; and his mother, Khujastha Akhtar Banu, was the daughter of Maulana Ubaidullah Suhrawardy, who was a prolific Urdu language writer and was the first Indian women to have passed the Senior Cambridge examinations. His elder brother, Hasan, a linguist, found a great successful career as a diplomat with Pakistan's Foreign ministry. Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah was his niece. His uncles, Hassan Suhrawardy served in the British Indian Army as a military physician while Sir Abdullah Suhrwardy was a barrister. After his matriculation from the Calcutta Madrassa, Suhrawardy attended St. Xavier's College, where he earned a BSc. In 1913, Suhrawardy attained his MA in Arabic Language and earned a scholarship to attend the Oxford University for his higher studies. His gentry background allowed him to settle in England comfortably while attending the St. Catherine's College of Oxford University, where he attained an MA in political science and graduated with the BCL degree in 1920. After leaving Oxford, Suhrwardy was called to bar at the Gray's Inn where he was trained as barrister-at-Law in 1922‚Äì23. Political career in India =Deputy mayorship of Calcutta and legislation (1922‚Äì1944)= After his training as a Barrister-at-Law in England, Suhrawardy returned to India where he begin his practice at the Calcutta High Court in 1922‚Äì23, building his reputation as a competent lawyer. During this time, he joined the Muslim League and secured his elections as a Member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly. His legislative career took prominence during the times of the Khilafat Movement, a conservative Islamic movement in India, and had remained associate with it for several years. In 1924‚Äì25, Suhrawardy was appointed as deputy mayor of the Calcutta Corporation when he joined the Swaraj Party led by the Mayor of Kolkata Chittaranjan Das. In 1926, he broke with the Swaraj Party after the Hindu-Muslim riots took place in Calcutta, and represented the accused Muslims at the Calcutta High Court, and begin encouraging the trade strikes to maintain pressure on the Congress Party. In 1930s, he strengthened the political programme of the Muslim League, supporting the concept of Pakistan, and begin mobilising his support in favour of the Pakistan Movement. In 1936, he became the Secretary-General of the Muslim League's Bengal chapter and successfully defended his constituency in general elections held in 1934‚Äì37. He was appointed to head the Ministry of Commerce and Labour in 1937 under the provincial administration of Premier of Bengal A. K. Fazlul Huq. He served as Minister of Civil Supplies under Bengal's chief minister, Khawaja Nazimuddin. According to author Thomas Keneally, Suhrawardy blamed black marketers and the central government in New Delhi for the Bengal famine of 1943, and claimed he worked tirelessly on relief. Viceroy Archibald Wavell, however, believed that Suhrawardy was corrupt, that he \\"siphoned money from every project that was undertaken to ease the famine, and awarded to his associates contracts for warehousing, the sale of grain to governments, and transportation.\\" On the other hand, Indian author, Madhushree Mukherjee, laid major responsibility of this famine to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who wanted the ration for war efforts only and had refrained the U.S. aid to Bengal. Suhrwardy was further accused of practising the Scorched- Earth policy to counter the Japanese Army's advances in East and supervised to burn thousand fishing boats to block any potential movement of invading Japanese Army troops. These measures aggravated starvation and famine and the relief was only ordered when Lord Wavell became the Viceroy, using the Indian Army to organise relief. However, by that time, the winter crop had arrived and famine conditions had already eased, after millions had earlier perished. The Indian press, notably the Hindu press, had become very critical of his role and the Bengali Hindus held him directly responsible for the famine. =Premiership and United Bengal (1946‚Äì47)= Bengal in 1940s: Suhrawardy's proposal of United Bengal eventually failed due to riots in 1946. During the general elections held in 1945 in India, Suhrawardy campaigned against K. Nazimuddin for the Premiership of Bengal, and secured enough political endorsement from the Muslim League that allowed him to form the provincial government as its Prime Minister‚Äì the only Muslim League-led government in India in 1946. The Congress Party had been very critical of his role and the government and limited the number of cabinets departments by dismissing the Hindu members of his cabinet. By 1946‚Äì47, the support for the Pakistan Movement among the Indian Muslims had become very popular and it became inevitable for the creation of the nation-state through the partition of India by 1947. The issue of communalism based on the religious beliefs prevented the inclusion of Hindu-majority districts of Punjab and Bengal in the Federation of Pakistan as the Congress Party and their allies the Hindu Mahasabha sought the division of these provinces on communal lines. To prevent the violence, riots, and long-term border disputes, Suhrawardy joined hands with the demands of preventing the second partition of Bengal by endorsing the idea of independent United Bengal, along with Sarat Chandra Bose, K. Shanker Roy, Abul Hashim, Satya Ranjan Bakshi and F. Q. Choudhri. Suhrawardy reached a compromise with Bose when he sought to form the coalition government between the Congress Party's Bengal section with the Muslim League's Bengal Division. Proponents of the plan urged the Indian public in Bengal to reject the communal divisions and uphold the vision of an independent but united Bengal. In a press conference held in New Delhi on 27 April 1947 Suhrawardy presented his plan for a united and independent Bengal and Abul Hashim issued a similar statement in Calcutta on 29 April. The issue of United Bengal was met with favourable views and backing of Muhammad Ali Jinnah who saw it for the benefits for Bengali Muslims. Jinnah viewed this plan in a long term geostrategic point in believing that independent Bengal led by Muslim premier would forged a closer alliance with Pakistan than it would with India. Despite Jinnah's backing, the plan was fiercely opposed by K. Nazimuddin and Mohammad Akram Khan, who wanted integration with Pakistan. It also was opposed by most Bengali Hindus, who feared being a minority in a United Bengal, and therefore supported the partition of Bengal to keep West Bengal in India. =Direct Action Day (16 August 1946)= Suhrawardy and other Muslim League leaders reportedly delivered provocative speeches reminding the Bengali Muslims of the historical Islamic victory and urged them to follow the same way on 16 August. The historian Devendra Panigrahi, in his book India's Partition: The Story of Imperialism in Retreat, quotes from 13 August 1946 issue of Muslim League mouthpiece The Star of India, \\"Muslims must remember that ... it was in Ramazan that the permission for jehad was granted by Allah. It was in Ramazan that the Battle of Badr, the first open conflict between Islam and Heathenism, was fought and won by 313 Muslims and again it was in Ramazan that 10,000 Muslims under the Holy Prophet conquered Mecca and established the kingdom of Heaven and the commonwealth of Islam in Arabia. The Muslim League is fortunate that it is starting its action in this holy month\\". On 16 August 1946, the massive bloody riots erupted in Calcutta, killings scores of Hindus at the hands of rioters. However, there is no other claim or evidence have been found. Suhrawardy attempted to control the situation by unsuccessfully calling for peace and deployment of the Indian Army in Calcutta with no success. The riots ended with thousand deaths and the Indian press blaming Suhrawardy of obstructing the police work, which is well documented by several authors and eyewitnesses.L/I/1/425. The British Library Archives, London. According to authorities, the riots were instigated by members of the Muslim League and its affiliate Volunteer Corps after listening to the speeches made by Nazimuddin and Suhrawardy, in the city in order to enforce the declaration by the Muslim League that Muslims were to 'suspend all business' to support their demand for an independent Pakistan. However, supporters of the Muslim League believed that the Congress Party was behind the violence in an effort to weaken the fragile Muslim League government in Bengal, further generating the controversy about the real culprits. Historian Joya Chatterji allocates much of the responsibility to Suhrawardy, for setting up the confrontation and failing to stop the rioting, but points out that Hindu leaders were also culpable. A senior intelligence operative wrote to a senior British officer based at Fort William after the 'Great Calcutta Killings' after the Calcutta riots revealing Suhrawardy's villainous nature. He wrote, \\"There is hardly a person in Calcutta who has a good word for Suhrawardy, respectable Muslims included. For years he has been known as \\"The king of the goondas\\" and my own private opinion is that he fully anticipated what was going to happen, and allowed it to work itself up, and probably organised the disturbance with his goonda gangs as this type of individual has to receive compensation every now and again.\\" According to Tathagata Roy, the Governor of Tripura, Suhrawardy had pre-planned the riot long back, evident from the fact that demographic changes were being made in the Calcutta Police constabulary. Even the Bangladeshi historian Harun-or-Rashid, in his book The Foreshadowing of Bangladesh: Bengal Muslim League & Muslim Politics: 1906‚Äì1947, also disclosed the diabolic role of Suhrawardy in orchestrating riots against the Hindus in a pre-planned manner and safeguarding the Muslim goons from the police. Eventually, the United Bengal plan eventually failed which had earlier been facing the opposition of the Muslim League led by K. Nazimuddin, Congress Party, the Hindu Mahasabha and the Communist Party of India. Eventually, the Bengali Hindus voted for the partition that created the West Bengal joining the Union of India, and East Bengal was left with no choice but to join the Federation of Pakistan on 14 August 1947. Public service in Pakistan =Law and health ministries in coalition government (1953‚Äì55)= Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (left) with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 1949. On 14 August 1947, Suhrawardy lost the control of the Bengal Division of the Muslim League and lost the election when K. Nazimuddin was elected for the Chief Minister of East Bengal. After the partition of India, Suhrawardy remained in Calcutta and made calls for peace with Mahatma Gandhi; he returned on 5 March 1949 to Pakistan. After Jinnah's death and K. Nazimuddin becoming the Governor-General in 1948, Suhrawardy was forced out from the Muslim League but the latter co- founded the Awami Muslim League, alongside with the conservative cleric, Maulana Bhasani and others in 1949. He shifted from Muslim unity to greatly espousing the Bengali nationalism, becoming critical of the Government of East Pakistan. In 1950, he begin opposing the conservative agenda of Prime Minister K. Nazimuddin, and forged an alliance with the Communist Party and other left- oriented parties, which was known as the United Front. After the dismissal of Prime Minister K. Nazimuddin in 1953, Suhrawardy joined the Ministry of Talents as a Minister of Law and Justice under Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra, taking responsibility of drafting the Constitution of Pakistan. He also oversaw the implementation of the unification of the West Pakistan as a counterbalance to the East, in a prospect for providing the better governance. During the legislative elections in held in 1954 in East, Suhrawardy led the United Front against the Muslim League led by Nurul Amin, which saw the landslide victory of the United Front. The Awami League forged a three-party alliance with the Muslim League and the Republican Party to form the coalition government in the National Assembly. During this time, he was appointed as Health Minister in the three-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Muhammad Ali. During this time, he also acted as Leader of the Opposition, alongside with the I.I. Chudrigar of the Pakistan Muslim League. After Prime Minister Muhammad Ali refused to support the motion to investigation the Muslim League's allegations on Republican Party led by its President Feroze Khan in 1956, Suhrawardy went onto support the vote of no confidence movement by Muslim League against its own Prime Minister. After supporting the successful vote of no confidence movement at the National Assembly, the Awami League successfully held negotiations with the Muslim League and the Republican Party to appoint Suhrawardy as the new Prime Minister. Prime Minister of Pakistan (1956‚Äì57) =Suhrawardy administration: Internal affairs and constitutional reforms= On 12 September 1956, Chief Justice M. Munir, administrated the oath of Prime Minister Huseyn Suhrawardy in Governor's House in Karachi, then-Federal capital of the country. Initially promising to review the policy of One Unit status to the nationalists at the National Assembly, Prime Minister Suhrwardy backed out to overturn this scheme. At the National Assembly, Prime Minister Suhrawardy faced politics over two issues pressed by the nationalists: the One Unit and the Electoral College. The issue of One Unit was revived by the nationalists who called for the restoration of the status of the four provinces, beginning to hold massive rallies all around the West. Prime Minister Suhrawardy, however, showed less concern over this issue which came at the interests of the East as he had earlier reached the compromise in favour of being appointed as the Prime Minister. Though, the East had not objected the implementation of the One Unit as they were not above the factional battles motivated by personal interests, the West's multi-ethnic diversity background had effectively raised this issue which had won public support and sympathy. Nonetheless, there were no concrete steps taken by Suhrwardy government to address this issue and it was not until the Yahya administration when it was repealed in 1970. At the National Assembly, the Awami League initiated the constitutional work on reviving the joint electorate system but faced strong pressure and opposition from the Muslim League to implement this issue. The Muslim League had called for the separate electoral system which had subsequent public support over this issue; the East had favoured the joint electorate system. In 1956, Prime Minister Suhrwardy approved to request the three-year extension of army commander General Ayub Khan while approving the appointment of V-Adm. HMS Choudhry as the first native naval commander‚Äì both men served to command their services until 1959. To address the issue of energy conservation in West, Suhrawardy established the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) inviting its chair to Dr.Nazir Ahmad, a physicist. The nuclear power programme was intended to be for peaceful usages when he affirmed his obiligations towards the clauses of the Atoms for Peace initiative. When his Science Advisor, Dr. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, presented the plan to acquire the NRX reactor from Canada, Suhrawardy reportedly vetoed instead releasing funds for the U.S.-based swimming pool reactor from the United States in 1956. =U.S. aid and the economic policy= In 1956, Prime Minister Suhrawardy halted the National Finance Commission (NFC) programme to allocate taxed revenue equally between East and West Pakistan. Suhrawardy relied heavily upon U.S. aid to the country to meet food shortages, and asked the U.S. President to ship wheat flour and rice on a regular basis to Pakistan. In East Pakistan, there were reports of another widespread famine, in which, wheat, potatoes, and rice were being sent from the U.S. and West Pakistan's Fauji Foundation to East Pakistan on a regular basis. The central government led by Suhrawardy focused on the implementation of the planned economy. His relations with the stock exchange and the business community deteriorated when he announced distribution of the US$10 million ICA aid between West and East, and establishing the shipping corporation at the expense of West Pakistan's revenues. Massive labour strikes broke out in West Pakistan against his economic policy in major cities of Pakistan. Eventually leaders of the stock exchange met with President Mirza to address their concerns and issues. =Foreign policy= 10 July 1957: Prime Minister Suhrawardy meeting with the U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower in Washington D.C. when paying a state visit to the United States. Prime Minister Suhrwardy directed the foreign policy towards aligning with the United States against the Soviet Union, and was seen as a pro-American political figure in the country. Suhrawardy harboured strong anti-Soviet views and advocated for strong pro-Western and pro-American policy at the public circles, putting himself at odds with the policy of his own party, the Awami League. He is considered to be one the pioneers of Pakistan's foreign policy aimed, directed, and set towards excessively supporting the United States and their cause, a policy that was pursued by the successive administrations. On 10 July 1957, Prime Minister Suhrawardy paid a state visit to the United States where he met with President Dwight Eisenhower and accepted his request to lease out an air force base to the United States Air Force that would be in use for the signals intelligence purposes against the Soviet Union. The 1960 U-2 incident severely compromised the national security of Pakistan when Soviet Union eventually discovered the base through interrogating its pilot. In return, the United States distributed ~US$ 2.142 billion in shape of giving the supersonic F-104 Starfighter and M48 Patton tanks and dispatching the assistance group to the Pakistan's military. Suhrawardy's party, the Awami League, split over his signing of the US-Pakistan military pact, with Maulana Bhasani leaving to form the National Awami Party (NAP). Prime Minister Suhrawardy was invited by the Soviet Union for an informal visit but he declined. 1956 in China: Prime Minister Suhrawardy signed the alliance pact with Chinese premier Chou-en Lai in Beijing. In 1956, Prime Minister Suhrawardy became the Pakistan's first Prime Minister to paid a state visit to China when he went to meet with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing, taking with him the entire diplomatic mission including the Pakistan Ambassador to China, Dr. Ahmed Ali, who had established the Pakistan embassy in Beijing and formed Pak-China friendship and strengthened the official diplomatic friendship between Pakistan and China. In 1957, he well received the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in Karachi when he reciprocated the visit in Karachi. In 1956‚Äì57, Prime Minister Suhrawardy accused India of supporting insurgency in different parts of the country, and levelled accusations against his counterpart, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of undoing the partition of India. =Decline and resignation= His policy inclination towards the United States brought great ire and opposition from within the Awami League, which had been favouring the cleric Maulana Bhasani, who had been suspicious of American motives. Suhrawardy had strongly advocated for Pakistan's membership in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which was aimed towards containing communism; he was in direct conflict with Bhasani on this issue. To the dismay of his party, Suhrawardy became closer to President Iskander Mirza on many issues. There were massive protests carried out in the East against Prime Minister Suhrawardy by the Awami League when the United States dispatched a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to the Pakistani military. Eventually, Bhashani and Yar Mohammad challenged him for the party's presidency, as both men had managed to consolidate the Awami League, but they failed to carry the party mass with them. Intending to break President Mirza's control over Parliament, Suhrawardy asked President Mirza to call a session of the National Assembly and seek a vote of confidence from the Parliament, where Prime Minister Suhrawardy's allies had the majority. His alignment with the United States at the expense of the Soviet Union caused Prime Minister Suhrawardy to eventually lose control over the presidency of the party to the junior leadership under Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish. Threatened with President Mirza's retaliation after the failed parliamentary resolution and facing to have lost the majority in the National Assembly, Prime Minister Suhrawardy faced the similar circumstances as his predecessor and surprisingly tendered his resignation on 17 October 1957. In 1960, he retired from politics, departing for Beirut. Public and personal life In 1920, Suhrawardy was arranged to marry, Begum Niaz Fatimah (d. 1922), the daughter of Justice Sir Abdur Rahim who was also a politician. The marriage produced two children, Ahmed Shahab Suhrawardy and Jahan Suhrawardy‚Äî Ahmed died of pneumonia while studying in London whilst his daughter, Jahan was arranged to marry Shah Ahmed Sulaiman, son of Justice Sir Shah Sulaiman. Begum Niaz Fatima died in 1922. After his passing in 1963, the Suhrawardy family remained active in national politics, and his granddaughter Shahida Jamil subsequently is a politician with the PML(N) and briefly served as the Law Minister in 1999 and 2007. In 1940, Suhrawardy married Vera Alexandrovna Tiscenko, a Russian theatre actress and dancer whom he knew through his older brother, Hasan Shaheed Suhrawardy's work in Russia. Vera converted to Islam by taking the name of Begum Noor Jehan, and took Pakistani citizenship in 1947. She was a Russian actress of Polish descent from the Moscow Art Theatre and protege of Olga Knipper.New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Stanislavski Revisited, Broadcast on WNYC AM NYC, 18 July 1976, LT-10 3099 Suhrawardy and Vera Tiscenko filed for a divorce in Sindh High Court, which was said to be bitter when the Sindh High Court ordered for distribution of Surawardy's wealth with Vera; the divorce was finalised in 1951. Following the divorce, Vera moved to the United States with their only son, Rashid Suhrawardy, (known as Robert Ashby), who is a British actor living in London and briefly portrayed Jawaharlal Nehru in film Jinnah in 1998. =Death= Suhrawardy is buried with other Bengali leaders at a mausoleum in Shahbag, Dhaka.

He led the DA from its inception in 2000, until his retirement from leadership in 2007. Before that, he led the Democratic Party from 1994. He is the longest serving leader of the official opposition in parliament since the advent of democracy in 1994. Although still a member of the DA, he served as the South African Ambassador to Argentina under the ANC government from 2009 to 2012. Since 2012, Leon has been serving as Executive Chairman of Resolve Communications (Pty) Ltd - a South African-based advocacy for reputation management and strategic communications consultancy, and a Senior Advisor to K2 Intelligence, a London-NY based international investigative and risk analytics consultancy founded by Jules and Jeremy Kroll in 2009. Leon is also a contracted columnist to Times Media Group Ltd, with his columns appearing weekly or monthly in Business Day, Sunday Times, and the Times. Early life Leon was born and raised in Durban during the apartheid era. He was educated at Clifton Preparatory School and Kearsney College near Durban. His father Ramon Leon was a High Court Judge.Canvassing with a Nat out of Tatler and an assertive DP yuppie Sunday Times. 23 July 1989 Both his parents were active in the liberal, anti-apartheid Progressive Party (which later became the Democratic Party). He is Jewish.http://www.haaretz.com/us- news/jewish-insider-s-daily-kickoff-december-15-2017-1.5628773 Political career In 1974 at the age of 18 he became an organiser for the Progressive Party, one of the two opposition parties represented in parliament at the time. After this, he qualified as an attorney at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was President of the Law Students' Council and Vice- President of the Students' Representative Council, and became a lecturer in the Law Department in 1986. He has accredited Harry Schwarz and Helen Suzman as his biggest inspirations. In the same year he was elected to the Johannesburg City Council for Yeoville. When the results for the election were released, it was announced that the NP candidate Sam Bloomberg had won. However Harry Schwarz, his political mentor, uncovered that this was untrue, and Leon was declared the winner. He became leader of the opposition in the city council. In 1989 he was elected to Parliament for the Houghton constituency, representing the Progressive Party's successor, the Democratic Party. From 1990 to 1994 he chaired the DP's Bill of Rights Commission, and as such was an advisor to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) and a delegate to the multi-party negotiations that led to the end of apartheid and the establishment of a non-racial democracy in 1994. At the 1994 general elections, Leon was again elected to Parliament in the first democratic National Assembly, as well as leader of the Democratic Party. At the time, the Democratic Party was perceived as merely a minor party of white liberals, an oddity in the first non-racial democratic government of South Africa. Yet between 1994 and 1999 its seven members managed to become the most vocal, active and involved legislators. In 1998, Leon published his first book on the eve of the second democratic election, entitled 'Hope & Fear: Reflections of a Democrat' (Jonathan Ball, 1998). With the second democratic elections in 1999 and the New National Party only retaining 28 seats (down from 82 in 1994), he became Leader of the Opposition as the DP took 38 seats, showing a growth of over five-fold. After the 2004 general elections, the DA under Leon had a vote increased by 2.8%, as did the ANC with an increase of 3.3%. These gains came at a cost to three of the five minor opposition parties, with only the Independent Democrats -- a newcomer in the elections -- also attracting support. Leon built a high media profile as opposition leader by criticising the ANC government under Nelson Mandela but more so under his successor, President Thabo Mbeki. Retirement On 26 November 2006, Leon announced that he would step down from the leadership of the DA in 2007, and would not accept nomination for the leadership of the party at the party's congress in May 2007. Leon, nevertheless, kept his seat in Parliament until 2009, when its term expired. Leon retired as leader of the DA on 5 May 2007. He was succeeded by Helen Zille who was elected as the new party leader on 6 May 2007. One of South Africa's leading political commentator, Justice Malala wrote about him: \\"Every South African should wake up today and say a little thank you to Tony Leon ... he was fearless when many were fearful, vocal when many had lost their voices, openly critical when many would only speak in whispers ... the man has done a remarkable job.\\" ~ Justice Malala, (7 May 2007) Leon was voted 16th in the TV channel SABC3's Top 100 Great South Africans.Great South African list-topper no surprise IOL. 27 September 2004 From September to December 2007, Leon was a Fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's John F.

Provisional governments are generally appointed, and frequently arise, either during or after civil or foreign wars. Provisional governments maintain power until a new government can be appointed by a regular political process, which is generally an election. They may be involved with defining the legal structure of subsequent regimes, guidelines related to human rights and political freedoms, the structure of the economy, government institutions, and international alignment. Provisional governments differ from caretaker governments, which are responsible for governing within an established parliamentary system and serve as placeholders following a motion of no confidence, or following the dissolution of the ruling coalition. In opinion of Yossi Shain and Juan J. Linz, provisional governments can be classified to four groups:Yossi Shain, Juan J. Linz, \\"Between States: Interim Governments in Democratic Transitions\\", 1995, , p. 5 # Revolutionary provisional governments (when the former regime is overthrown and the power belongs to the ones who have overthrown it). # Power sharing provisional governments (when the power is shared between former regime and the ones who are trying to change it). # Incumbent provisional governments (when the power during transitional period belongs to the former regime). # International provisional governments (when the power during the transitional period belongs to the international community). The establishment of provisional governments is frequently tied to the implementation of transitional justice. Decisions related to transitional justice can determine who is allowed to participate in a provisional government. The early provisional governments were created to prepare for the return of royal rule. Irregularly convened assemblies during the English Revolution, such as Confederate Ireland (1641‚Äì49), were described as \\"provisional\\". The Continental Congress, a convention of delegates from 13 British colonies on the east coast of North America became the provisional government of the United States in 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. The government shed its provisional status in 1781, following ratification of the Articles of Confederation, and continued until it was supplanted by the United States Congress in 1789. The practice of using \\"provisional government\\" as part of a formal name can be traced to Talleyrand's government in France in 1814. In 1843, American pioneers in the Oregon Country, in the Pacific Northwest region of North America established the Provisional Government of Oregon‚Äîas the U.S. federal government had not yet extended its jurisdiction over the region‚Äîwhich existed until March 1849. The numerous provisional governments during the Revolutions of 1848 gave the word its modern meaning: A liberal government established to prepare for elections.

An Atlantis theme haunts the story, as do numerous references to Arthurian mythology, particularly to the mythical country of Lyonesse. Some place names and concepts, such as references to sandestins as magical creatures that do the actual work of carrying out a magician's spells, are shared between Lyonesse and Vance's Dying Earth series, suggesting that the two worlds may be linked. Vance makes no pretence of historical accuracy. The society depicted is in general of the later Middle Ages, with trading cogs plying the seas, knights engaged in jousting and following the fully developed Code of Chivalry, and royal courts dancing the pavane and cotillon ‚Äì all of which would be gross anachronisms when assumed to take place in the 5th century. In this Vance, in fact, followed the conventions of the original Arthurian tales, which depicted the society of their own time rather than that of the historical King Arthur.  Books  The three volumes were published in order of their fictional chronology: *Lyonesse (1983) (subtitled Book I: Suldrun's Garden on the title page) *The Green Pearl (1985) *Madouc (1989)  Plot summary  = Lyonesse (also known as Suldrun's Garden) = The story is told in several interlocking threads which are not always chronological. = The Green Pearl = In a fishing village in South Ulfland, a fisherman catches a flounder and discovers the green pearl inside. The pearl changes hands a number of times, impelling each new owner to strange excesses of conduct, until the final owner offends a minor magician, who takes him deep into the forest and casts a spell of paralysis on him. His body decomposes and merges with the forest floor; in the Spring, beautiful flowers with strangely evocative odors sprout at the site. Aillas and Dhrun divide their time between Watershade, Aillas' placid castle on the island of Troicinet, and his new capital Doun Darric in South Ulfland. Glyneth has been installed at court with the anomalous title \\"Princess\\" and Shimrod is a frequent guest. Aillas journeys to South Ulfland where he attempts to convince the fiercely independent barons to accept his rule as king. He bans private justice and torture and orders the barons to forget their old feuds and unite against the Ska. Aillas' program gains credibility when he sends a force to destroy the mountain keep of the first baron to openly defy him. In Lyonesse, King Casmir plots to destabilize South Ulfland by sending two agents, Sir Shalles and Torqual. Casmir sends Shalles into the Ulfish uplands to sow dissent among the barons through rumor and intrigue. Torqual, a renegade Ska, is ordered to assemble a band of cutthroats to attack those nobles who support Aillas' rule. Torqual has his own plans, to conquer all of the Elder Isles for himself, and Casmir soon grows exasperated with Torqual's demands for ever increasing amounts of gold. Casmir is also troubled by a prophecy made at Suldrun's birth that her son would rule the Elder Isles; Casmir believes Suldrun gave birth to a girl, the princess Madouc. He applies to Tamurello for assistance, who sends to him Visbhume, a low magician of peculiar personal habits. Visbhume makes inquiries and informs Casmir that Suldrun's child was, in fact, a boy and that Madouc is a fairy changeling. Visbhume learns that the boy, known to the fairies as \\"Tippet\\", was travelling with a girl named Glyneth, and that Suldrun's former nursemaid, who had tried to hide Dhrun from Casmir, had left Lyonesse with her entire family and were now landed gentry on Troicinet. The next line of inquiry is obvious. In South Ulfland, Aillas ponders how to test his new army, composed of Troice knights and Troice- trained Ulfish soldiers. The Ska are fearsome in battle but their weakness is their small numbers. Aillas plans a series of hit-and-run raids designed to inflict casualties while avoiding a pitched battle he would almost certainly lose. Aillas sends a force against the lightly defended Castle Sank and succeeds in destroying the garrison and the outer buildings but not the inner citadel. Watching from a distance, Aillas sees a party of Ska approaching Sank on horseback, including the Lady Tatzel. Aillas pursues and captures her, declaring she is now his slave. Since the route back to Doun Darric was likely to be swarming with Ska troops responding to the attack on Castle Sank, Aillas decides to travel north along the high moors into North Ulfland, to arrive at Xounges where he can take a ship home. Along the way they pass Torqual's fortress hideout; Torqual challenges Aillas who defeats him in a duel and leaves him for dead. Tatzel is proud and haughty; her worldview will not accept that she has been made a slave by an \\"otherling\\", as the Ska refer to outsiders. However, she gradually comes to recognize Aillas' intelligence and competence. Aillas, for his part, discovers that the Tatzel of reality is nothing like the Tatzel of his daydreams, and the infatuation is broken. They eventually develop a wary mutual respect. After a series of further adventures, Aillas and Tatzel arrive at Xounges, to find the dying King Gax beset by a Ska delegation headed by Tatzel's father, Duke Luhalcx. The Ska wish King Gax to appoint a Ska successor to his throne, in return for which the Ska promise amnesty for the inhabitants of Xounges. Gax would prefer that his successor drive the Ska out, but the legal heir, Sir Kreim, has already indicated to the Ska that he could be bribed to abdicate, and Gax expects to die a bitter death. Aillas returns his unsatisfactory slave to her father, and in a private audience with King Gax, reveals his identity. In a public ceremony, Gax transfers the crown to Aillas, much to the surprise and consternation of the Ska. Glyneth, at Watershade, ponders her future. She has been playing flirtatious games with Aillas, testing him, but decides that the time for games and testing is over. Before she can act on her decision, she is kidnapped by Visbhume and taken to the alternate world Tanjecterly. Visbhume promises to return her to Earth if she tells him the circumstances of Dhrun's birth, but his obvious designs on her person inform her that she will be killed once he has the information. Glyneth feigns intimacy long enough to strike Visbhume with his own dagger, then runs away into the wilds of Tanjecterly. Aillas and Shimrod are prevented from following Glyneth through the portal into Tanjecterly by Murgen, who understands that this is part of a plot by Casmir and Tamurello to get rid of them, thus weakening Murgen and advancing Casmir's political goals. Murgen instead sends an agent, synthesized from the physical pattern of a fierce beast from Tanjecterly and the guile and cunning of a barbarian pirate named Kul. To give Kul a human soul with love and loyalty for Glyneth, Murgen infuses it with Aillas' blood. In Tanjecterly, Kul catches up with Glyneth and rescues her from Visbhume. Under duress, Visbhume explains that passages to Earth can only be opened at certain times and places, and the next opportunity is many leagues distant. After many adventures they arrive at the portal and Visbhume opens the way, but causes the animal they have been riding to attack Kul, injuring him. Glyneth, though frightened of Kul at first, has grown to love the human spirit within him, and refuses to leave him. Glyneth tells Visbhume the truth about Dhrun's birth, and Visbhume vanishes through the gate. At the Goblin Fair in the forest of Tantrevalles, Melancthe is entranced by four beautiful flowers she has bought, which evoke emotions she can't quite identify. Both Shimrod and Tamurello arrive, prompted by the opening of the interworld portal. Tamurello accosts Visbhume, learns Dhrun's secret, and then turns Visbhume into a snake so that he can not reveal the truth to anyone else. Shimrod and Melancthe peruse the booths at the fair. The flower seller, in search of more, has dug up the green pearl, causing the flowers to die, to Melancthe's great disappointment. He offers her the pearl, but Shimrod dissuades her. Tamurello also sees it and is captivated, but before he can take it, a snake darts out from the forest and swallows it. Tamurello instantly chants a spell and turns into a weasel, pursues the snake into its hole and returns triumphantly with the pearl in his teeth. Murgen, disguised as a peasant, quickly seals the weasel and pearl in a glass jar. The weasel dissolves into a green transparency, like a skeleton in aspic. With no word from Tanjecterly, Aillas resumes his campaign against the Ska. His hit-and-run strategy finally prompts a tactical mistake by the Ska, who divide their forces into two smaller armies. Aillas' Ulfish army attacks and destroys one of these armies. Aillas offers a peace agreement whereby the Ska return to the original limits of their territory; in return Aillas will demand no reparations or hostages. The Ska agree. In Tanjecterly Kul follows the orders implanted in him to return Glyneth to their original starting point, which is the location of the other portal. On the way they are attacked several times so that he loses a great deal of blood, and the beast and pirate aspects of Kul begin to assert themselves. They reach the portal and are besieged by enemies, but Shimrod appears to rescue her. Glyneth will not leave Kul, but Shimrod explains that while Kul is dying, his love for her came from someone else. Shimrod and Glyneth return to Earth where she is reunited with Aillas, now the undisputed King of Troicinet, Dascinet and Ulfland, who reveals his deep love for her (manifested through Kul) and asks her to be his Queen, which she gladly accepts. Aillas, Dhrun, Glyneth and Shimrod journey to Watershade for a banquet, while in Lyonesse, Casmir awaits news from Visbhume that will never come, and ponders the mystery of Suldrun's son. = Madouc = Princess Madouc, unaware of her true parentage, suffers an unhappy childhood comparable to Suldrun's, but has more spunk and actively resists the regimen imposed upon her as a royal princess. On an unauthorized outing into the forest, she is separated from her bodyguard (the stable-hand Pimfet) and discovers her mother, the fairy Twisk, and learns the truth, including the fact that her father's identity is unknown. She meets Prince Dhrun at a reception and shares her knowledge with him, incidentally establishing a mutual but low-key attraction. Meanwhile, Casmir continues to plot against Aillas by funding the exploits of the Ska renegade Torqual, which however have little effect against Aillas's precautions. Allias defeats the Ska residing in a fort on the border with Dahaut and claims the fort itself by law of conquest, causing tensions between the two nations. King Audry is distraught to find his army, though still strong, is slowly growing fat and complacent from mismanagement, and begins trying to re-assert himself as a military power. Shimrod the wizard, at Murgen's request, investigates mysterious demonic attentions in Ys, which appear to involve Melancthe. Murgen is too busy watching over Joald, a trapped being of apocalyptic power, to do so himself. Melancthe continues to fascinate and frustrate Shimrod, and he is unable to learn what her plans are. Later, as part of his service to Murgen, Shimrod disguises himself as a Scythian bravo to infiltrate Torqual's band. He is unable to make progress in his investigation of Melancthe, but disrupts a plot to assassinate King Aillas and kidnap Dhrun. The corpses of the dead assassins are re-animated and march to Casmirs court before expiring in order to send a message. Torqual sets off with Melancthe. Madouc having angered Casmir by refusing to be part of a marriage alliance he's devised, the king punishes her and humors Queen Solace by making Madouc the prize in a quest for the Holy Grail (a relic which would draw pilgrims to the cathedral being built under the instigation of the treacherous Brother Umphred, who has revealed to Casmir that Dhrun is Suldrun's son). Madouc's response is to seek the Grail herself, since that seems the best method of preserving herself. Casmir, distracted by other matters, accidentally gives the royal blessing to the journey. Together with Pimfet, Madouc sets off on a journey for the Grail and for the identity of her father. While she fails to find out who her father truly is even with the help of the Faries and Twisk (as he used a pseudonym while courting Twisk), she does discover what seems to be the Grail. She and Pimfet travel to the castle where the Grail is, and through cunning manage to kill the Ogre Throop and retrieve the Grail, a task that hundreds of knights had tried and failed. Unfortunately, Casmir reneges on his promise. Though his life is spared, Pimfet is still punished harshly despite retrieving the Grail, and Madouc begins to truly hate Casmir with all her being. Madouc then discovers Casmir's plan to frustrate the magic mirror's prophecy that Dhrun would rule the Elder Isles, by having him sit momentarily at the magic table in the capital city of Dahaut and then having Dhrun killed. To this end, Casmir arranges for a colloquy despite having no desire for peace. On the way there, Madouc manages to earn a sliver of respect from Queen Solace when the latter learns of the deeds involved in retrieving the Grail, though the two are still on poor terms. In revenge for his treatment of Pimfet and herself, Madouc foils Casmir's plan by publicly warning Dhrun and the assembled worthies (humiliating Casmir) in the middle of the colloquy. She is stripped of her rank and forbidden from finishing what she had to say, but her message does not fall on deaf ears. Any doubt the worthies had in her statements evaporates when Allias, who had been running late, dramatically arrives and corroborates her story. After King Audry and King Dartweg publicly feud over Celtic bandits, the colloquy is called off. Madouc is then kidnapped by Casmir's agents but rescued by Aillas and Dhrun. Meanwhile, Torqual and Melancthe arrive at Murgen's manse. Desmei manifests out of Melancthe, possesses Torqual, and the Melancthe is left to be brutally killed by Murgen's sentries. Inside, Murgen himself is bound by demonic hands. Desmei orders Torqual to free the Green Pearl so she can be whole, but by accident the Ska instead releases Tamurello. Desmei's physical form is destroyed, and an insane Tamurello tries to free Joald with the help of Torqual simply to spite Murgen, fully aware that it will mean the end of the Elder Isles. Joald manages to partially wrench free, and his presence in the Atlantic causes a massive tsunami that wipes out Ys instantly and the majority of Vale Evander shortly after. Before they can cause the downfall of the entire island however, Tamurello is defeated and Torqual is beheaded. Desmei and Tamurello, unable to be destroyed by normal means since the Green has rendered them partially demonic, are instead sent to an alternate dimension where one of Murgen's associates annihilates them utterly in supernatural fire. The Green is revealed to be a corrupting magical force and an element of a much larger inter dimensional war, which Murgen has been trying to keep from reaching Earth. The deed done, Murgan collapses into a chair, crestfallen. Murgen explains to Shimrod that some of the dead gods of Lyonesse favor Joald, that to kill him would incur their wrath, and thus all that Murgan can do is keep Joald imprisoned for as long as he lives. Casmir, emboldened by the news of the destruction of Vale Evander, throws the dice on a war against Dahaut. He finds that Dahaut puts up much more of a fight than expected. The Ulfs counterattack by raiding the coasts of Lyonesse, and Godelia enters the war on Casmir's side in response. After several battles, the Dahaut army is routed. Prince Cassander is wounded trying to kill the fleeing king Audry. Ignoring the advice of his more experienced advisors and overeager to prove himself, the wounded Cassander orders his scouts to embark on a pointless search that gives the Dahaut army time to regroup and escape. Though King Audry later puts up a valiant fight that allows the majority of his remaining army to escape across the border into the Ulflands, he and his son are killed. Dahaut is conquered, but this triggers an attack on Casmir by Aillas. Cassander is killed during a retreat. The Troice army routs Casmir's army, and Casmir enters the battle only to shortly after flee back towards Lyonesse Town. Casmir discovers to his dismay that Lyonesse Town was captured in his absence. Queen Solace, still in possession of the Grail, was exiled to Europe after the castle fell, and the reader is told she would spend the rest of her days crying over the Holy Grail and her dashed dreams of sainthood. After her death, the Grail is lost again, to be searched for later by King Arthur. After this aside, Casmir is arrested and spends the rest of his days in a cell ruminating over his defeat. Aillas declares himself king of the Elder Isles (with Dhrun as his heir) and brings peace to the realm, also taking the opportunity to have Umphred drowned for his betrayal of Suldrun. Glyneth, now Queen, gives birth to her and Aillas' daughter, Princess Serle. Madouc and Dhrun are in love, and when Twisk is summoned to partake in the celebrations she recognizes Shimrod as \\"Sir Pellinore\\", Madouc's father. All ends happily.  Commentary  One view is that the characterisations of the various kingdoms are decidedly Euro-centric. The Celts of Godelia are fickle and eccentric, the ambitious and aggressive King Casmir is a Germanic despot in all but name, the court of King Audry of Dahaut is a caricature of the decadent excesses of a French monarch and the Ska are transparently cruel Viking raiders. The picture is complete with the Arthurian figure of Prince Aillas hailing from the plucky island race of Troicinet whose sea power is crucial to the story. Aillas' policies are based on the balance of power doctrine, whereby Troicinet seeks to make sure no mainland power would become too strong by supporting the weaker party in any conflict ‚Äì which is clearly reminiscent of the traditional British policy with regard to continental Europe. Also Aillas' later policy, after having become ruler of the entire central island of Hybras ‚Äì to maintain only a limited land army and rely on a strong navy for protection against outside invasion ‚Äì has a distinct British flavor. Indeed, it can be argued that the entire background to the work is a re-working of the Arthurian myths, complete with a great mage (Merlin/Murgen), a Round Table (Cairbra an Meadhan), chivalric codes and a search for the Holy Grail.Review by Nick Gevers, Ph.D., Cape Town, South Africa. However, unlike the awe in which the original Arthurian characters hold the Grail, Vance's attitude is quite cynical. While many objects described in the Trilogy have considerable magical powers, the Grail does not seem to have such; the only use contemplated for the Grail was King Casmir's idea of increasing pilgrimage to his capital and thus the Royal revenues. This did not come true, and in the end the Grail gets taken out of Lyonesse without having made much impression on anybody. The Arthurian hypothesis can perhaps be countered by strong indications that the author has delivered a very conscious melding of various other medieval folkloric and more formal story telling themes, characters and plot devices. The proto Arthurian characters are rather a \\"pre-working\\" of the later romance and still distinct from that tale. Similarly, the Ska, who are equated with the Nemedians of Irish mythology, are repeatedly described as pre-Viking, and indeed having encountered Neanderthals, giving them a far richer presence than \\"cruel Viking raiders\\". Vance builds the history of his world using layers of facts, names and religions taken from various European cultures ‚Äì Greeks, Romans, Celts, pre-Carolingian French and Spanish \\"kingdoms\\" etc., and adding in places and peoples imagined by those same cultures ‚Äì Atlantis, Ys, Avalon, Fomor and so on. This fantastical/factual mix is used to ground his tale in \\"history\\". It also seems to give some of the same depth that a longer series of books might develop where place, relationships and plot are built up over time (as in Thomas Hardy's \\"Wessex\\" or Trollope's \\"Barsetshire\\"). It seems to provide the believability that develops where a story is set in a well-known, well-defined historical setting as if the reader holds merely a hitherto untold story. The combination of a tale that is apparently set in medieval Europe, but which contains significant elements of fantasy and magic, lends itself to use as setting for role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. =Lands doomed to sink= At the very first paragraph of the first book, Vance informs the reader that the Elder Isles sank under the sea at some later time (which, indeed, readers can know for themselves by glancing at the map of Western Europe and finding no such islands off its shore). The Elder Islands are clearly not Atlantis, which was an ancient myth already in the time of Plato ‚Äì still, the overtones of a land doomed to eventually sink beneath the waves influence the story. All the more so as to the city of Ys, the site of several important events, which has its own Breton myth ending with its being eventually engulfed by the waves. Throughout the series, the characters move though their lives, loves and conflicts, blithely unaware of this total doom hanging over their land ‚Äì all but the wise magician Murgen who, as eventually turns out, is all too well aware of it, and has devoted his life to the effort of averting it. The name \\"Joald\\" is mentioned already in the first part as that of a mysterious being inspiring hush and fear. But only in the end of Madouc is Joald revealed to be a giant underwater being ‚Äì \\"a strange gray creature, human in general configuration, with glistening gray skin, short hairy neck, heavy head with smeared features and the filmy eyes of a dead fish\\" ‚Äì who seeks to destroy the Elder Isles by breaking down the submarine pillars on which they rest. Murgen keeps a simulacrum of Joald tightly bound, and he also devotes much of his time and effort to \\"guard Joald and soothe his monstrous hulk, and ward away whatever might disturb his long wet rest\\". Tamurello, Murgen's rival, in a frenzy of blind hatred and revenge seeks to free Joald, and manages to get the monster's head and right arm free before being stopped by Shimrod ‚Äì enough for Joald to cause a huge tidal wave which destroys Ys, bringing upon this city its foredoomed destruction (though in a manner quite different from that recounted in the original Breton myth). The rest of the Elder Isles are spared, for the time being. However, Joald can only be bound again, not destroyed, as he is under the protection of certain elder gods ‚Äì and thus the Isles' doom is only put off. Commentator David Williams, remarking on a \\"sense of loss\\" evident in much of Jack Vance's writings, notes that \\"Vance exercised this sense of loss in high ironic form in the Lyonesse sequence: all the adventures, all the triumphs and tragedies are futile in an ultimate sense, because the reader knows that, regardless of Murgen's striving, the Elder Isles are doomed to sink into the Atlantic Ocean. All the loves and hates, all the magic will be lost, to be recalled only faintly in myth.\\"David B. Williams, \\"Jack Vance's Lost Worlds and Ancient Futures\\" in Extant 19, March 2007. There is no clear indication of how long it would be after the last book's happy end. Aillas is still a vigorous young king, and by the prophecy which figures so large in the plot he would clearly live out his reign, and his son Dhrun would become king in turn, presumably with Madouc as his queen. It is also mentioned that in later times, fishermen sailing over drowned Ys \\"sometimes glimpsed the wonderful structures of marble, where nothing moved but schools of fish\\"; but there is no clear indication of how many generations of fishermen would have this experience before Joald finally broke loose and the whole land shared Ys' fate.

This is done by assuming that the subcomponents are non-Gaussian signals and that they are statistically independent from each other. ICA is a special case of blind source separation. A common example application is the \\"cocktail party problem\\" of listening in on one person's speech in a noisy room.  Introduction  ICA on four randomly mixed videos Independent component analysis attempts to decompose a multivariate signal into independent non- Gaussian signals. As an example, sound is usually a signal that is composed of the numerical addition, at each time t, of signals from several sources. The question then is whether it is possible to separate these contributing sources from the observed total signal. When the statistical independence assumption is correct, blind ICA separation of a mixed signal gives very good results. It is also used for signals that are not supposed to be generated by mixing for analysis purposes. A simple application of ICA is the \\"cocktail party problem\\", where the underlying speech signals are separated from a sample data consisting of people talking simultaneously in a room. Usually the problem is simplified by assuming no time delays or echoes. Note that a filtered and delayed signal is a copy of a dependent component, and thus the statistical independence assumption is not violated. Mixing weights for constructing the M observed signals from the N components can be placed in an M \\\\times N matrix. An important thing to consider is that if N sources are present, at least N observations (e.g. microphones if the observed signal is audio) are needed to recover the original signals. When there are an equal number of observations and source signals, the mixing matrix is square (M = N). Other cases of underdetermined (M < N) and overdetermined (M > N) have been investigated. That the ICA separation of mixed signals gives very good results is based on two assumptions and three effects of mixing source signals. Two assumptions: #The source signals are independent of each other. #The values in each source signal have non-Gaussian distributions. Three effects of mixing source signals: #Independence: As per assumption 1, the source signals are independent; however, their signal mixtures are not. This is because the signal mixtures share the same source signals. #Normality: According to the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of a sum of independent random variables with finite variance tends towards a Gaussian distribution. Loosely speaking, a sum of two independent random variables usually has a distribution that is closer to Gaussian than any of the two original variables. Here we consider the value of each signal as the random variable. #Complexity: The temporal complexity of any signal mixture is greater than that of its simplest constituent source signal. Those principles contribute to the basic establishment of ICA. If the signals we happen to extract from a set of mixtures are independent like sources signals, and have non-Gaussian histograms or have low complexity like source signals, then they must be source signals.  Defining component independence  ICA finds the independent components (also called factors, latent variables or sources) by maximizing the statistical independence of the estimated components. We may choose one of many ways to define a proxy for independence, and this choice governs the form of the ICA algorithm. The two broadest definitions of independence for ICA are # Minimization of mutual information # Maximization of non-Gaussianity The Minimization-of-Mutual information (MMI) family of ICA algorithms uses measures like Kullback-Leibler Divergence and maximum entropy. The non-Gaussianity family of ICA algorithms, motivated by the central limit theorem, uses kurtosis and negentropy. Typical algorithms for ICA use centering (subtract the mean to create a zero mean signal), whitening (usually with the eigenvalue decomposition), and dimensionality reduction as preprocessing steps in order to simplify and reduce the complexity of the problem for the actual iterative algorithm. Whitening and dimension reduction can be achieved with principal component analysis or singular value decomposition. Whitening ensures that all dimensions are treated equally a priori before the algorithm is run. Well-known algorithms for ICA include infomax, FastICA, JADE, and kernel-independent component analysis, among others. In general, ICA cannot identify the actual number of source signals, a uniquely correct ordering of the source signals, nor the proper scaling (including sign) of the source signals. ICA is important to blind signal separation and has many practical applications. It is closely related to (or even a special case of) the search for a factorial code of the data, i.e., a new vector-valued representation of each data vector such that it gets uniquely encoded by the resulting code vector (loss-free coding), but the code components are statistically independent.  Mathematical definitions  Linear independent component analysis can be divided into noiseless and noisy cases, where noiseless ICA is a special case of noisy ICA. Nonlinear ICA should be considered as a separate case. = General definition = The data are represented by the observed random vector \\\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m)^T and the hidden components as the random vector \\\\boldsymbol{s}=(s_1,\\\\ldots,s_n)^T. The task is to transform the observed data \\\\boldsymbol{x}, using a linear static transformation \\\\boldsymbol{W} as \\\\boldsymbol{s} = \\\\boldsymbol{W} \\\\boldsymbol{x}, into a vector of maximally independent components \\\\boldsymbol{s} measured by some function F(s_1,\\\\ldots,s_n) of independence. = Generative model =  Linear noiseless ICA  The components x_i of the observed random vector \\\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m)^T are generated as a sum of the independent components s_k, k=1,\\\\ldots,n: x_i = a_{i,1} s_1 + \\\\cdots + a_{i,k} s_k + \\\\cdots + a_{i,n} s_n weighted by the mixing weights a_{i,k}. The same generative model can be written in vector form as \\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} s_k \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k, where the observed random vector \\\\boldsymbol{x} is represented by the basis vectors \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k=(\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{1,k},\\\\ldots,\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{m,k})^T. The basis vectors \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k form the columns of the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{A}=(\\\\boldsymbol{a}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\boldsymbol{a}_n) and the generative formula can be written as \\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\boldsymbol{s}, where \\\\boldsymbol{s}=(s_1,\\\\ldots,s_n)^T. Given the model and realizations (samples) \\\\boldsymbol{x}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\boldsymbol{x}_N of the random vector \\\\boldsymbol{x}, the task is to estimate both the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{A} and the sources \\\\boldsymbol{s}. This is done by adaptively calculating the \\\\boldsymbol{w} vectors and setting up a cost function which either maximizes the non- gaussianity of the calculated s_k = \\\\boldsymbol{w}^T \\\\boldsymbol{x} or minimizes the mutual information. In some cases, a priori knowledge of the probability distributions of the sources can be used in the cost function. The original sources \\\\boldsymbol{s} can be recovered by multiplying the observed signals \\\\boldsymbol{x} with the inverse of the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{W}=\\\\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}, also known as the unmixing matrix. Here it is assumed that the mixing matrix is square (n=m). If the number of basis vectors is greater than the dimensionality of the observed vectors, n>m, the task is overcomplete but is still solvable with the pseudo inverse.  Linear noisy ICA  With the added assumption of zero-mean and uncorrelated Gaussian noise n\\\\sim N(0,\\\\operatorname{diag}(\\\\Sigma)), the ICA model takes the form \\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\boldsymbol{s}+n.  Nonlinear ICA  The mixing of the sources does not need to be linear. Using a nonlinear mixing function f(\\\\cdot\\\\theta) with parameters \\\\theta the nonlinear ICA model is x=f(s\\\\theta)+n. = Identifiability = The independent components are identifiable up to a permutation and scaling of the sources. This identifiability requires that: * At most one of the sources s_k is Gaussian, * The number of observed mixtures, m, must be at least as large as the number of estimated components n: m \\\\ge n. It is equivalent to say that the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{A} must be of full rank for its inverse to exist.  Binary ICA  A special variant of ICA is binary ICA in which both signal sources and monitors are in binary form and observations from monitors are disjunctive mixtures of binary independent sources. The problem was shown to have applications in many domains including medical diagnosis, multi-cluster assignment, network tomography and internet resource management. Let {x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_m} be the set of binary variables from m monitors and {y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n} be the set of binary variables from n sources. Source- monitor connections are represented by the (unknown) mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{G}, where g_{ij} = 1 indicates that signal from the i-th source can be observed by the j-th monitor. The system works as follows: at any time, if a source i is active (y_i=1) and it is connected to the monitor j (g_{ij}=1) then the monitor j will observe some activity (x_j=1). Formally we have: : x_i = \\\\bigvee_{j=1}^n (g_{ij}\\\\wedge y_j), i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, m, where \\\\wedge is Boolean AND and \\\\vee is Boolean OR. Note that noise is not explicitly modelled, rather, can be treated as independent sources. The above problem can be heuristically solved Johan Himbergand Aapo Hyv√§rinen, Independent Component Analysis For Binary Data: An Experimental Study, Proc. Int. Workshop on Independent Component Analysis and Blind Signal Separation (ICA2001), San Diego, California, 2001. by assuming variables are continuous and running FastICA on binary observation data to get the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{G} (real values), then apply round number techniques on \\\\boldsymbol{G} to obtain the binary values. This approach has been shown to produce a highly inaccurate result. Another method is to use dynamic programming: recursively breaking the observation matrix \\\\boldsymbol{X} into its sub-matrices and run the inference algorithm on these sub-matrices. The key observation which leads to this algorithm is the sub-matrix \\\\boldsymbol{X}^0 of \\\\boldsymbol{X} where x_{ij} = 0, \\\\forall j corresponds to the unbiased observation matrix of hidden components that do not have connection to the i-th monitor. Experimental results from Huy Nguyen and Rong Zheng, Binary Independent Component Analysis With or Mixtures, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol. 59, Issue 7. (July 2011), pp. 3168-3181. show that this approach is accurate under moderate noise levels. The Generalized Binary ICA framework introduces a broader problem formulation which does not necessitate any knowledge on the generative model. In other words, this method attempts to decompose a source into its independent components (as much as possible, and without losing any information) with no prior assumption on the way it was generated. Although this problem appears quite complex, it can be accurately solved with a branch and bound search tree algorithm or tightly upper bounded with a single multiplication of a matrix with a vector.  Methods for blind source separation  = Projection pursuit = Signal mixtures tend to have Gaussian probability density functions, and source signals tend to have non-Gaussian probability density functions. Each source signal can be extracted from a set of signal mixtures by taking the inner product of a weight vector and those signal mixtures where this inner product provides an orthogonal projection of the signal mixtures. The remaining challenge is finding such a weight vector. One type of method for doing so is projection pursuit.James V. Stone(2004); \\"Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial Introduction\\", The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England; Kruskal, JB. 1969; \\"Toward a practical method which helps uncover the structure of a set of observations by finding the line transformation which optimizes a new \\"index of condensation\\", Pages 427‚Äì440 of: Milton, RC, & Nelder, JA (eds), Statistical computation; New York, Academic Press Projection pursuit seeks one projection at a time such that the extracted signal is as non-Gaussian as possible. This contrasts with ICA, which typically extracts M signals simultaneously from M signal mixtures, which requires estimating a M √ó M unmixing matrix. One practical advantage of projection pursuit over ICA is that fewer than M signals can be extracted if required, where each source signal is extracted from M signal mixtures using an M-element weight vector. We can use kurtosis to recover the multiple source signal by finding the correct weight vectors with the use of projection pursuit. The kurtosis of the probability density function of a signal, for a finite sample, is computed as : K=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{y}})^4]}{(\\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{y}})^2])^2}-3 where \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{y}} is the sample mean of \\\\mathbf{y}, the extracted signals. The constant 3 ensures that Gaussian signals have zero kurtosis, Super-Gaussian signals have positive kurtosis, and Sub-Gaussian signals have negative kurtosis. The denominator is the variance of \\\\mathbf{y}, and ensures that the measured kurtosis takes account of signal variance. The goal of projection pursuit is to maximize the kurtosis, and make the extracted signal as non-normal as possible. Using kurtosis as a measure of non-normality, we can now examine how the kurtosis of a signal \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{w}^T \\\\mathbf{x} extracted from a set of M mixtures \\\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_M)^T varies as the weight vector \\\\mathbf{w} is rotated around the origin. Given our assumption that each source signal \\\\mathbf{s} is super-gaussian we would expect: #the kurtosis of the extracted signal \\\\mathbf{y} to be maximal precisely when \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{s}. #the kurtosis of the extracted signal \\\\mathbf{y} to be maximal when \\\\mathbf{w} is orthogonal to the projected axes S_1 or S_2, because we know the optimal weight vector should be orthogonal to a transformed axis S_1 or S_2. For multiple source mixture signals, we can use kurtosis and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO) to recover the signals. Given M signal mixtures in an M-dimensional space, GSO project these data points onto an (M-1)-dimensional space by using the weight vector. We can guarantee the independence of the extracted signals with the use of GSO. In order to find the correct value of \\\\mathbf{w}, we can use gradient descent method. We first of all whiten the data, and transform \\\\mathbf{x} into a new mixture \\\\mathbf{z}, which has unit variance, and \\\\mathbf{z}=(z_1,z_2,\\\\ldots,z_M)^T. This process can be achieved by applying Singular value decomposition to \\\\mathbf{x}, : \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{U} \\\\mathbf{D} \\\\mathbf{V}^T Rescaling each vector U_i=U_i/\\\\operatorname{E}(U_i^2), and let \\\\mathbf{z} = \\\\mathbf{U}. The signal extracted by a weighted vector \\\\mathbf{w} is \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{w}^T \\\\mathbf{z}. If the weight vector w has unit length, that is \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{w}^T \\\\mathbf{z})^2]=1, then the kurtosis can be written as: : K=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{y}^4]}{(\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{y}^2])^2}-3=\\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{w}^T \\\\mathbf{z})^4]-3. The updating process for \\\\mathbf{w} is: :\\\\mathbf{w}_{new}=\\\\mathbf{w}_{old}-\\\\eta\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{z}(\\\\mathbf{w}_{old}^T \\\\mathbf{z})^3 ]. where \\\\eta is a small constant to guarantee that \\\\mathbf{w} converges to the optimal solution. After each update, we normalize \\\\mathbf{w}_{new}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{w}_{new}}{\\\\mathbf{w}_{new}}, and set \\\\mathbf{w}_{old}=\\\\mathbf{w}_{new}, and repeat the updating process until convergence. We can also use another algorithm to update the weight vector \\\\mathbf{w}. Another approach is using negentropy instead of kurtosis. Using negentropy is a more robust method than kurtosis, as kurtosis is very sensitive to outliers. The negentropy methods are based on an important property of Gaussian distribution: a Gaussian variable has the largest entropy among all continuous random variables of equal variance. This is also the reason why we want to find the most nongaussian variables. A simple proof can be found in Differential entropy. :J(x) = S(y) - S(x)\\\\, y is a Gaussian random variable of the same covariance matrix as x :S(x) = - \\\\int p_x(u) \\\\log p_x(u) du An approximation for negentropy is :J(x)=\\\\frac{1}{12}(E(x^3))^2 + \\\\frac{1}{48}(kurt(x))^2 A proof can be found in the original papers of Comon; it has been reproduced in the book Independent Component Analysis by Aapo Hyv√§rinen, Juha Karhunen, and Erkki Oja This approximation also suffers from the same problem as kurtosis (sensitivity to outliers).

(1995). \\"An Information-Maximization Approach to Blind Separation and Blind Deconvolution\\", Neural Computation, 7, 1129-1159 is essentially a multivariate, parallel version of projection pursuit. Whereas projection pursuit extracts a series of signals one at a time from a set of M signal mixtures, ICA extracts M signals in parallel. This tends to make ICA more robust than projection pursuit.James V. Stone (2004). \\"Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial Introduction\\", The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England; The projection pursuit method uses Gram- Schmidt orthogonalization to ensure the independence of the extracted signal, while ICA use infomax and maximum likelihood estimate to ensure the independence of the extracted signal. The Non-Normality of the extracted signal is achieved by assigning an appropriate model, or prior, for the signal. The process of ICA based on infomax in short is: given a set of signal mixtures \\\\mathbf{x} and a set of identical independent model cumulative distribution functions(cdfs) g, we seek the unmixing matrix \\\\mathbf{W} which maximizes the joint entropy of the signals \\\\mathbf{Y}=g(\\\\mathbf{y}), where \\\\mathbf{y}=\\\\mathbf{Wx} are the signals extracted by \\\\mathbf{W}. Given the optimal \\\\mathbf{W}, the signals \\\\mathbf{Y} have maximum entropy and are therefore independent, which ensures that the extracted signals \\\\mathbf{y}=g^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{Y}) are also independent. g is an invertible function, and is the signal model. Note that if the source signal model probability density function p_s matches the probability density function of the extracted signal p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}, then maximizing the joint entropy of Y also maximizes the amount of mutual information between \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\mathbf{Y}. For this reason, using entropy to extract independent signals is known as infomax. Consider the entropy of the vector variable \\\\mathbf{Y}=g(\\\\mathbf{y}), where \\\\mathbf{y}=\\\\mathbf{Wx} is the set of signals extracted by the unmixing matrix \\\\mathbf{W}. For a finite set of values sampled from a distribution with pdf p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}, the entropy of \\\\mathbf{Y} can be estimated as: : H(\\\\mathbf{Y})=-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}}(\\\\mathbf{Y}^t) The joint pdf p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}} can be shown to be related to the joint pdf p_{\\\\mathbf{y}} of the extracted signals by the multivariate form: : p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}}(Y)=\\\\frac{p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}(\\\\mathbf{y})}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{Y}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{y}}} where \\\\mathbf{J}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{Y}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{y}} is the Jacobian matrix. We have \\\\mathbf{J}=g'(\\\\mathbf{y}), and g' is the pdf assumed for source signals g'=p_s, therefore, : p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}}(Y)=\\\\frac{p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}(\\\\mathbf{y})}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{Y}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{y}}}=\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{y}(\\\\mathbf{y})}{p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y})} therefore, : H(\\\\mathbf{Y})=-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{y}(\\\\mathbf{y})}{p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y})} We know that when p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}=p_s, p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}} is of uniform distribution, and H({\\\\mathbf{Y}}) is maximized. Since : p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}(\\\\mathbf{y})=\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{x})}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{y}}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}}=\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{x})}{\\\\mathbf{W}} where \\\\mathbf{W} is the absolute value of the determinant of the unmixing matix \\\\mathbf{W}. Therefore, : H(\\\\mathbf{Y})=-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{x}^t)}{\\\\mathbf{W}p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y}^t)} so, : H(\\\\mathbf{Y})=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y}^t)+\\\\ln\\\\mathbf{W}+H(\\\\mathbf{x}) since H(\\\\mathbf{x})=-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N\\\\ln p_\\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{x}^t), and maximizing \\\\mathbf{W} does not affect H_{\\\\mathbf{x}}, so we can maximize the function : h(\\\\mathbf{Y})=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y}^t)+\\\\ln\\\\mathbf{W} to achieve the independence of extracted signal. If there are M marginal pdfs of the model joint pdf p_{\\\\mathbf{s}} are independent and use the commonly super-gaussian model pdf for the source signals p_{\\\\mathbf{s}}=(1-\\\\tanh(\\\\mathbf{s})^2), then we have : h(\\\\mathbf{Y})=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^M\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln (1-\\\\tanh(\\\\mathbf{w_i^T x^t})^2)+\\\\ln\\\\mathbf{W} In the sum, given an observed signal mixture \\\\mathbf{x}, the corresponding set of extracted signals \\\\mathbf{y} and source signal model p_{\\\\mathbf{s}}=g', we can find the optimal unmixing matrix \\\\mathbf{W}, and make the extracted signals independent and non-gaussian. Like the projection pursuit situation, we can use gradient descent method to find the optimal solution of the unmixing matrix. = Based on maximum likelihood estimation = Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a standard statistical tool for finding parameter values (e.g. the unmixing matrix \\\\mathbf{W}) that provide the best fit of some data (e.g., the extracted signals y) to a given a model (e.g., the assumed joint probability density function (pdf) p_s of source signals). The ML \\"model\\" includes a specification of a pdf, which in this case is the pdf p_s of the unknown source signals s. Using ML ICA, the objective is to find an unmixing matrix that yields extracted signals y = \\\\mathbf{W}x with a joint pdf as similar as possible to the joint pdf p_s of the unknown source signals s. MLE is thus based on the assumption that if the model pdf p_s and the model parameters \\\\mathbf{A} are correct then a high probability should be obtained for the data x that were actually observed. Conversely, if \\\\mathbf{A} is far from the correct parameter values then a low probability of the observed data would be expected. Using MLE, we call the probability of the observed data for a given set of model parameter values (e.g., a pdf p_s and a matrix \\\\mathbf{A}) the likelihood of the model parameter values given the observed data. We define a likelihood function \\\\mathbf{L(W)} of \\\\mathbf{W}: \\\\mathbf{ L(W)} = p_s (\\\\mathbf{W}x)\\\\det \\\\mathbf{W}. This equals to the probability density at x, since s = \\\\mathbf{W}x. Thus, if we wish to find a \\\\mathbf{W} that is most likely to have generated the observed mixtures x from the unknown source signals s with pdf p_s then we need only find that \\\\mathbf{W} which maximizes the likelihood \\\\mathbf{L(W)}. The unmixing matrix that maximizes equation is known as the MLE of the optimal unmixing matrix. It is common practice to use the log likelihood, because this is easier to evaluate. As the logarithm is a monotonic function, the \\\\mathbf{W} that maximizes the function \\\\mathbf{L(W)} also maximizes its logarithm \\\\ln \\\\mathbf{L(W)}. This allows us to take the logarithm of equation above, which yields the log likelihood function \\\\ln \\\\mathbf{L(W)} =\\\\sum_{i}\\\\sum_{t} \\\\ln p_s(w^T_ix_t) + N\\\\ln\\\\det \\\\mathbf{W} If we substitute a commonly used high-Kurtosis model pdf for the source signals p_s = (1-\\\\tanh(s)^2) then we have \\\\ln \\\\mathbf{L(W)} ={1 \\\\over N}\\\\sum_{i}^{M} \\\\sum_{t}^{N}\\\\ln(1-\\\\tanh(w^T_i x_t )^2) + \\\\ln \\\\det \\\\mathbf{W} This matrix \\\\mathbf{W} that maximizes this function is the maximum likelihood estimation.  History and background  The early general framework for independent component analysis was introduced by Jeanny H√©rault and Bernard Ans from 1984, further developed by Christian Jutten in 1985 and 1986,Ans, B., H√©rault, J., & Jutten, C.

There are many algorithms available in the literature which do ICA. A largely used one, including in industrial applications, is the FastICA algorithm, developed by Hyv√§rinen and Oja, which uses the kurtosis as cost function. Other examples are rather related to blind source separation where a more general approach is used. For example, one can drop the independence assumption and separate mutually correlated signals, thus, statistically \\"dependent\\" signals. Sepp Hochreiter and J√ºrgen Schmidhuber showed how to obtain non-linear ICA or source separation as a by-product of regularization (1999). Their method does not require a priori knowledge about the number of independent sources.  Applications  ICA can be extended to analyze non- physical signals. For instance, ICA has been applied to discover discussion topics on a bag of news list archives.

Though it is often marketed as Volksmusik, it differs from traditional folk music in that it is commercially performed by celebrity singers and concentrates on newly created sentimental and cheerful feel-good compositions. Volkst√ºmliche Musik is sometimes instrumental, but usually presented by one or especially two singers and is most popular amongst an adult audience in (Germany), Austria, Switzerland, and also in South Tyrol (Italy), Alsace-Moselle (France), Netherlands, Flanders (Belgium), Slovenia, Silesia (Poland) and northern Croatia. Characteristics Closely related to the German schlager genre, many titles stress a Heimat affect, being presented in regional dialects (e.g. Bavarian, Upper Saxon, Low German or Rhinelandic) or colloquial language and invoke local and regional lifestyles and traditions, particularly dances. Brass and Alpine musical instruments, such as Alphorns, Zithers, acoustic guitars, violas, and harmonicas are frequently featured, although most commercial productions nowadays employ drum machines and synthesizers. Yodeling is also common. History From the early 1960s onwards, Volkst√ºmliche Musik was conceived for commercial reasons as a counterweight to youth-oriented rock and pop music. The adjective volkst√ºmlich refers to the borrowing of German folklore elements, connecting them to virtually all kinds of light dance and popular music of the 19th and early 20th centuries, from waltz to swing music. The large popularity of this music genre led to the development of volkst√ºmliche record charts and various radio and television broadcasts with popular presenters like Carolin Reiber or Maria Hellwig. Volkst√ºmliche Musik was influenced by Flower Power songs as well as by popular classical pieces during the 1970s and has been increasingly mingled with schlager music, promoted by successful singers like Heino serving as a model for performers like Die Flippers, Andy Borg or Kristina Bach. Its diffusion was further boosted by comprehensive TV broadcasting with some of the most popular programmes including Musikantenstadl (since 1981), Grand Prix der Volksmusik (1986‚Äì2010) and Lustige Musikanten with Marianne & Michael. Beside Volkst√ºmliche Musik, these telecasts also feature big bands, country and even samba music. Reception Modelled on immensely popular Musikantenstadl, since the early 1990s Volkst√ºmliche Musik features strongly in numerous peak-time television broadcasts on German, Austrian and Swiss public TV networks including ARD, ZDF, ORF and Schweizer Fernsehen as well as several regional TV networks and local radio stations. Commercial broadcasters nowadays tend to stay clear of it because it is not very popular with the commercially desirable younger target groups up to 49 years of age, however, there are several cable and satellite television stations focusing on the genre. Not unlike schlager, Volkst√ºmliche Musik is often belittled by younger or more sophisticated audiences as a massively commercialized product created for the lower strata of society, conveying idyllic, reactionary, irrational ideas. Those holding these views sometimes sarcastically deride the expression \\"volkst√ºmliche Musik\\" (folksy/folk-like music) by replacing the \\"-t√ºmlich\\"(-like)-suffix by \\"-d√ºmmlich\\", meaning roughly \\"featherbrained\\", turning it into \\"folk-featherbrained Music\\", e.g. dim-witted, daft or dopey. Sociological surveys confirm a predominant conservative attitude among the target population, who often feel that Volkst√ºmliche Musik performances provide a means of stress alleviation and escapism. In this perception, Volkst√ºmliche Musik differs somewhat from its ancestor, the traditional folk (Volksmusik), which continues to be performed by many local groups and orchestras in different areas. The Volkst√ºmliche Musik market is the largest section of the music business in German-speaking areas. Due to the advanced age of the main target group, copyright infringement has not been prevalent so far. =United Kingdom= Though the term is mainly unknown in the United Kingdom, volkst√ºmliche Musik has attracted a fanbase there including BBC Radio Manchester commentator, Ian Cheeseman. A number of British singers have also been attracted to this style of music, even featuring on Musikantenstadl, such as Ross Antony,http://chicagoschlager.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/ross-antony- shropshire-lad-gives-german.html Tony Christiehttp://chicagoschlager.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/tony-christie-from-uk- big-voice-to.html and Roger Whittaker.http://chicagoschlager.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/roger-whittaker- schlager-star-from-uk.html See also *Music of Germany *Austrian folk dancing  References  External links *Radio Heimatmelodie ‚Äì a radio format specialized on German Volksmusik and \\"volkst√ºmlicher Schlager\\" *Radio VHR ‚Äì one major source of German Volksmusik and Schlager (online-stream) *Radio Herz: Radio station from Toronto playing Volksmusik 24 hours a day via the internet * Schlager/Volksmusik ‚Äì various online-streams *Volksmusik.TV: Schlager, volkstuemliche,- and Volksmusik available via Cable, Satellite and IPTV German folk music German words and phrases ","title":"Volkst√ºmliche Musik"},{"id":"598058","text":"GCSE is the initialism of General Certificate of Secondary Education.

The Crown was bound to the Lands of the Hungarian Crown (sometimes the Sacra Corona meant the Land, the Carpathian Basin, but it also meant the coronation body, too). No king of Hungary was regarded as having been truly legitimate without being crowned with it. In the history of Hungary, more than fifty kings were crowned with it, up to the last, Charles IV, in 1916. The only kings who were not so crowned were Wladyslaw I, John Z√°polya, John Sigismund Z√°polya and Joseph II. The enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in Constantinople in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas to King G√©za I of Hungary; both are depicted and named in Greek on enamel plaques in the lower crown. It is one of the two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the other being the slightly earlier Monomachus Crown, which is also in Budapest, in the Hungarian National Museum.Beckwith, 214B√†r√†ny-Oberschall (1949) However, the Monomachus Crown may have had another function, and the Holy Crown has probably been remodelled, and uses elements of different origins. The date assigned to the present configuration of the Holy Crown varies, but is most commonly put around the late 12th century.L√°szl√≥, 425 The Hungarian coronation insignia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. The orb has the coat-of-arms of Charles I of Hungary (1310‚Äì1342). In popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older, dating to the time of the first King Stephen I of Hungary, crowned in 1000/1001. It was first called the Holy Crown in 1256. During the 14th century, royal power came to be represented not simply by a crown, but by just one specific object: the Holy Crown. This also meant that the Kingdom of Hungary was a special state: they were not looking for a crown to inaugurate a king, but rather, they were looking for a king for the crown; as written by Crown Guard P√©ter R√©vay. He also depicts that \\"the Holy Crown is for the Hungarians what the Lost Ark is for the Jewish people\\".\\"De sacra corona regni Hungariae ortu, virtuti, victoria, fortuna... brevis commentarius, 1613. Since 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the Hungarian Parliament Building.  Specifications  * The Crown's shape is elliptic (the width is 203.9 mm, the length is 215.9 mm) and is larger than a (healthy) human head. During coronations, the king had to wear a leather 'kapa' liner, made to fit, inside the crown. * The weight of the Crown is 2056 g. (4 lb 8.52 oz) * The gold-silver alloys in the upper and the lower parts of the Crown differ in alloy ratio. * The lower part of the Crown is asymmetric.N√©meth Zsolt: A magyar Szent Korona, BKL Kiad√≥, 2007.  Holiness doctrine  As is the case with all European Christian crowns, it symbolizes a halo and thus signifies that the wearer rules by Divine Right. According to popular tradition, St Stephen I held up the crown before his death (in the year 1038) to offer it to the Virgin Mary to seal a divine contract between her and the divine crown. After this, Mary was depicted not only as patrona (patron saint) for the Kingdom of Hungary but also as regina (i.e. \\"queen\\"). This contract was supposed to empower the crown with divine force to help the future kings of Hungary and did help reinforce the political system based on the so-called \\"Doctrine of the Holy Crown\\" (). P√©ter R√©vay, a Crown Guard, expounded this doctrine in his works Commentarius De Sacra Regni Hungariae Corona (Explanation of the Holy Crown of the Kingdom of Hungary, published in Augsburg, 1613) and De monarchia et Sacra Corona Regni Hungariae (About the Monarchy and the Holy Crown of Hungary, Frankfurt, 1659). At the core of this doctrine was the notion that the crown itself had personhood and as a legal entity is identical to the state of Hungary. It is superior to the ruling monarch, who rules \\"in the name of the crown\\". Origin The crown depicted in the 15th-century Fugger Chronicle. All images of the crown before the mid-17th century show the cross in its original upright position. Holy Crown of Hungary, 1857 Engraving from 1613 Matthias II of Hungary on a coin with the Holy Crown According to the most accepted theory, which is represented in the publications of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and also of the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference,Zombori, I, Cs√©falvay, P., Maria Antonietta De Angelis: A Thousand Years of Christianity in Hungary ‚Äì Hungariae Christianae Millennium ‚Äì Published by the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference, Budapest, 2001, for the exhibition in the Musea of Vatican, Vatican City, 10 October 2001 ‚Äì 12 January 2002 ‚Äì under the auspices of Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n the Holy Crown of Hungary consists of two main parts: \\"abroncs\\" (rim, hoop) the corona graeca, and \\"keresztp√°ntok\\" (cross straps) the corona latina. It was created during the reign of B√©la III under Byzantine influence. (The Hungarian king B√©la III was brought up in the Byzantine court and was for a period the official heir to the throne there.) The crowning of Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, who was later canonized Saint Stephen, marks the beginning of Hungarian statehood. The date is variously given as Christmas 1000 or 1 January 1001. One version of the origin of the crown is written by bishop Hartvik (between 1095‚Äì1116), in which the \\"Pope\\" has sent King Stephen I \\"his blessings and a crown\\". The basis for this belief is a biography by bishop Hartvik written around 1100‚Äì1110 at the request of King K√∂nyves K√°lm√°n. According to \\"Hartvik‚Äôs legend\\", St Stephen sent Archbishop Astrik of Esztergom to Rome to ask for or require (both are possible from original Latin script) a crown from the \\"Pope\\", but it does not tell the name of the Pope. No matter how much Astrik hurried, the Polish prince, Mieszko I's envoy was quicker, and the crown was prepared for the future Polish king. The Pope had seen a dream during the night, seeing the angel of the Lord telling him there will be another envoy from another nation, asking for a crown for their own king. The angel told the Pope: \\"There will be another envoy from an unknown folk, who will ask for [or require] a crown, too, please give the crown to them, as they deserve it\\". The next day Astrik approached the Pope so he gave the crown to him. \\"Hartvik‚Äôs legend\\" appeared in the liturgical books and breviaries in Hungary around 1200, recalling the then-existing Pope, Pope Sylvester II. Consequently, the story of how the crown had been sent by Pope Sylvester II spread throughout the Christian world, so in 1613, crown guard P√©ter R√©vay states that the entire crown was given to St Stephen by Pope Sylvester II. However, this legend can be considered a myth, as Mieszko I was not living at the same time as either St. Stephen I or Pope Sylvester II. Also, in the \\"Greater Legend\\" of St Stephen, written around the time he was canonised (1083), we learn only that \\"in the fifth year after the death of his father (...) they brought a Papal letter of blessings (...) and the Lord‚Äôs favoured one, Stephen, was chosen to be king, and was anointed with oil and fortunately crowned with the diadem of royal honour\\". This legend clearly lacks the information that the crown was from Rome. Moreover, there are no documents found in Vatican City on the granting of the crown, even though the Vatican has a clear interest in handing over the crown from Rome, as it is representing dominance over the Kingdom of Hungary. There is another version on the origin of Holy Crown, which is a popular fallacy: Thietmar von Merseburg (died in 1018) reports that Otto III of the Holy Roman Empire has consented to the coronation of St. Stephen, and the Pope is sending his blessings; so many historians argued he has also sent a crown, however, does not report on any crown, so it cannot follow any fact. Beside the two main theories ‚Äì donation by the pope and creation in the time of B√©la III ‚Äì there exist a number of different theories of the more romantic kind, putting the origin of the crown into the far past and into Asia. The question to what extent the upper part of the Holy Crown indeed belonged to the crown of King Stephen I remained open until 1978, when the coronation insignia was returned to Hungary and a thorough examination could be carried out. The differing styles and techniques used in making the enamel pictures and the fact that the inscriptions on the diadem are in Greek and on the bands in Latin suggest that the two parts were probably made in two different periods. However, we have to note that there are no known representations of any kind in which the crown is separated: the Holy Crown is always shown as one. Type The Crown is a coronation crown, which should be worn only on the occasion of a coronation, and for the rest of the time two crown guards (korona≈ër) guard it. Apart from this, there are only two other people who can touch it, the n√°dorisp√°n (the highest secular title), who puts it onto a pillow during the coronation, and the Archbishop of Esztergom (primate of Hungary, the highest ecclesiastical title), who places it on the head of the king. Structure of the crown and its icons Sketch of the enamel icons of the Saints on the Holy Crown (top view, the crown's front side is on the bottom of the image) The Holy Crown was made of gold and decorated with nineteen enamel \\"pantokrator\\" picture (pantokrator is a Greek word meaning \\"the master of the universe\\") as well as semi-precious stones, genuine pearls, and almandine. It has three parts: \\"abroncs\\" (rim, hoop) (corona graeca), \\"keresztp√°ntok\\" (cross straps) (corona latina), and the cross on the top, which is today crooked. There are four hanging pendants (pendilia) dangling from chains on each side of the diadem and one in the back. There is no monde. =Corona graeca= The \\"abroncs\\" (rim, hoop) corona graeca (\\"Greek Crown\\") is 5.2 cm wide with a diameter of 20.5 cm. The two aquamarine stones with cut surfaces on the back of the diadem were added as replacements by King Matthias II (1608‚Äì1619). The enamel picture on the front depicts Christ Pantokrator. On the rim to the right and left of Jesus are pictures of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, followed by half-length images of the Saints George and Demetrius, and Cosmas and Damian. Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas on the corona graeca of the Holy Crown of Hungary G√©za I on the corona graeca of the Holy Crown of Hungary In the arched frame on the back of the diadem Emperor Michael VII Doukas (1071‚Äì1078) is depicted. Below it to the left is the half- length picture of \\"Kon. Porphyrogennetos\\", this probably being either Emperor Michael's brother and co-emperor Konstantios Doukas or of his son and heir Constantine Doukas, both having been born in the purple. To the right there is a picture of the Hungarian King G√©za I (1074‚Äì1077), with the Greek inscription: \\"ŒìŒïŒ©ŒíŒôŒ§ŒñŒëœπ Œ†ŒôŒ£Œ§Œüœπ ŒöŒ°ŒëŒõŒóœπ Œ§ŒüŒ•Œ°ŒöŒôŒëœπ\\" (Ge≈çbitzas pist√≥s kr√°lƒìs Tourk√≠as, meaning \\"G√©za I, faithful kralj of the land of the Turks\\"). According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, writing in his De Administrando Imperio (ca. 950 AD) \\"Patzinakia, the Pecheneg realm, stretches west as far as the Siret River (or even the Eastern Carpathian Mountains), and is four days distant from Tourkia (i.e. Hungary).\\" The contemporary Byzantine name for the Hungarians was \\"Turks\\", while the Hungarian branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, under Constantinople's jurisdiction, was named the \\"Metropolitanate of Tourkia\\" (Hungary), and the head of this church was the \\"Metropolitan of Tourkia\\" (Hungary). As was customary in the hierarchy of the Byzantine state, clear differentiation is made between style of the emperors and that of the Hungarian king by using a hellenized form of the common South Slavic word for \\"king\\" (Kralj) for G√©za. The saints and the Greek rulers have halos while G√©za does not. The inscriptions of the emperors‚Äô names are in red, while the Hungarian king's is in dark blue or black. The enamel plaques on the circular band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and the picture of Emperor Michael were all affixed to the crown using different techniques. The picture of the emperor could not be attached to the rim in the same way as the Pantokrator picture on the front. The frame was folded upwards and the picture of the emperor was nailed to the edge. We can thus conclude that the picture of Michael VII was not originally designed for this crown, but was probably used first somewhere else. The corona graeca with its pointed and arched plaques is identical to the form of the crowns of the Byzantine empresses ‚Äì in other words it was a woman's crown. It was given by Emperor Michael Dukas VII to King G√©za's wife, known only as Synadene, around 1075. The gift was not a new crown, but rather an old crown designed for a woman that had to be selected from the Emperor's treasury and remodelled. The enamel pictures that become outdated were removed, since either represented earlier historical figures or were not appropriate for the Hungarian queen according to court protocol. It was in this form that the crown was sent to Hungary. There is another view that the G√©za depicted on the corona graeca is not King G√©za I but St Stephen's father.A. Gallus, \\"The structural aspect: towards a plural society\\", Quest for a new Central Europe, ed. J. Vars√°nyi, 1976, pp. 130-176, at p. 147 This view is confirmed by the fact that Grand Prince G√©za is depicted on the corona gracea without a crown, although carrying a royal sceptre. Anthony Endrey, The Holy Crown of Hungary, Hungarian Institute, 1978, pp. 13-115 =Corona Latina= The \\"keresztp√°ntok\\" (cross straps) corona latina (\\"Latin Crown\\") is made of four 5.2-cm-wide gold strips welded to the edge of a square central panel (7.2*7.2 cm); the strips are usually assumed to have been originally made for some other object, and adapted for the crown. It is not an independent object, as it has no function alone. It was designed to be attached to the top rim of the Corona Gr√¶ca and provide a dome-shaped top. The inscription on the pictures of the saints and the style of their lettering suggest the date when they were made. Amidst the antique-style capital letter, the T in Thomas and the second U in Paulus are formed in the style characteristic of the Latin letters used on Byzantine coins, a practice abandoned in the middle of the eleventh century. They may have decorated a reliquary box or a portable altar given to Istv√°n I by the pope, or possibly the treasure binding of a book. It is also possible, although it cannot be verified, that Istv√°n I received a crown as a gift from one of the popes, reciprocating his ‚Äì historically documented - gifts. The picture of the apostles, however, based on their style, cannot be dated to around 1000. The intersecting bands are edged with beaded gold wire that close off the lower end of the bands and finish off the system of decoration. There are twelve pearls on the central panel and a total of seventy-two altogether on the Corona Latina, symbolising the number of Christ's disciples, (Acts 10.1). The central panel is decorated with a square cloisonn√© enamel picture depicting Christ Pantokrator. Each band has two (altogether eight) pictures of standing apostles identical to the first eight listed in Acts 1.13. √âva Kov√°cs and Zsuzsa LovagMagyar koronazasi jelvenyek, Eva Kovacs and Zsuzsa Lovag Budapest: Corvina Kiado, 1980; The Hungarian crown and other regalia translated by Peter Balban; translated and revised by Mary and Andras Boros-Kazai, pp. 79-80 suggest that the corona latina was originally a large Byzantine liturgical asterisk from a Greek monastery in Hungary. In order to get it to fit into it new role the apostles at the bottom of each of the four arms of this asterisk were cut off before it was very crudely attached to the inside of the corona graeca to transform this Byzantine open crown into a closed crown (i.e., the type of crown proper to the Autocrat, the senior emperor or monarch in Byzantine imperial protocol) and to provide a base for the reliquary cross at its summit (see Cross). =Cross= Matthias II of Hungary, showing the cross in vertical position The cross is attached to the crown in a rough manner, rising from the midriff of Christ in the central enamel plaque at the top of the crown. This addition might have been made during the 16th century. The cross was knocked crooked during the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it properly. The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such. √âva Kov√°cs suggests that the present plain cross on the top of the crown is a replacement of an original double-barred reliquary cross containing three pieces of the True Cross and that it was the presence of the True Cross in the Holy Crown which made it holy. She states that ‚ÄúSzabolcs Vajay, called to my attention a strange incident in the crown‚Äôs history which had completely escaped everybody‚Äôs attention. Before Queen Isabella handed over the regalia to Ferdinand in 1551, she broke the cross off the crown‚Äôs peak for her son, John Sigismund. According to a contemporary Polish chronicler, John Sigismund wore this cross on his chest till the end of his life, ‚Äú ... because he who possess this cross will again come into possession of the missing parts which, subjected to the power of the cross, had belonged to it\\". Later, the cross became the property of Sigismund Bathory who, persuaded by his confessor, bestowed it on Emperor Rudolf II. This was reported by an Italian envoy in Prague who also told the Isabella-John Sigismund story.‚Äù She also notes that ‚ÄúSeveral small fragments of the True Cross were in possession of the Arpad dynasty. As a point of interest, it is precisely the smallest ones, those set into the cross on the chest, that are attributed to St. Stephen. About a tiny fragment of the True Cross, a Russian chronicler recording King Geza II‚Äôs campaigns wrote that it had been the holy king‚Äôs property and, despite its small size, it was a relic of great force. We are, perhaps, not off the track when surmising that the Hungarian crown was holy because it had once been reinforced with a fragment of the victory-bringing relic. . . . we know quite few reliquary crowns. To mention but the most obvious example, let us cite Charles IV‚Äôs crown provided with a cross containing a thorn relic.‚Äù Later, it was the Crown itself, rather than the St. Stephen's cross reliquary that came to be regarded as holy through its traditional association with St. Stephen. √âva Kov√°cs further notes in this regard the early use of the patriarchal or double-barred cross and crown in the ancient Hungarian royal coat of arms. Since reliquary crosses frequently take such a double-barred form, the use of a patriarchal cross in the royal arms would be a direct reference to and representation of this royal relic. This association between the crown and this royal relic would also help to substantiate the theory that the Holy Crown was always intended to serve its historical role of legitimatizing the position of its wearer as the true divinely appointed king of Hungary. =The crown as a whole= Francis Joseph I crowned with the Holy Crown as Hungarian king The form of the Holy Crown is identical to that of the kamelaukion-type crowns with closed tops, as introduced in the Byzantine Empire. The presence of multiple pictures is also typical of Byzantine crowns. When the intersecting bands were added to the corona graeca during the rule of B√©la III, who had been brought up in Constantinople, the bands were decorated just as the corona graeca was, perhaps with the intention of imitating the Byzantine pattern. =Links to the first Hungarian king, Saint Stephen= Beside the using of the intersecting bands of the corona latina, which probably came from the treasury of St. Istv√°n, at the time of the creation of the crown there existed further expectation that the coronation insignia would eventually include additional gold works that could be linked to the first, beatified Hungarian king, Istv√°n. The inscription embroidered onto the coronation mantle indicates with all certainty that Istv√°n I and Queen Gizella had it made in 1031. The coronation sceptre with the orb at the end can also be dated to the time of St Istv√°n. On the seals of Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, and Rudolph III of Burgundy, the rulers are holding identically shaped sceptres. Such short-staffed sceptres ending in orbs were not in use as insignia earlier or later. The regalia in modern times Munk√°cs Castle commemorating the guarding of the Crown there in 1805‚Äì1806 After the fall of Communism, the crown was reincorporated into the national coat of arms in 1990, the National Assembly choosing the pre-war coat of arms in preference to the crown-less Kossuth arms of 1849. King Charles IV, taking his coronation oath at Holy Trinity Column outside Matthias Church (1916). To date, he is the last monarch to be crowned with St. Stephen's Crown. Notice the size difference between the crown and the king's head. The coat of arms of Hungary with the Holy Crown on top The Holy Crown has had a varied history; having been stolen, hidden, lost, recovered, and taken abroad several times. During the √Årp√°d dynasty (1000‚Äì1301), the coronation insignia was kept in the coronation city of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Later, the crown was housed in one of three locations: Visegr√°d (in Pest county); Pozsony (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia); or Buda. In 1805‚Äì1806 the Crown was kept for about three months in the Palanok Castle at Munk√°cs (now Mukachevo, Ukraine). Lajos Kossuth took the crown and the coronation jewels with him after the collapse of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and buried them in a wooden box in a willow forest, near Orsova in Transylvania (today Or≈üova, Romania). They were subsequently dug up and returned to the royal castle in Buda in 1853. At the end of the Second World War the crown jewels were recovered in Mattsee, Austria, on 4 May 1945 by the U.S. 86th Infantry Division. The crown jewels were transported to Western Europe and eventually given to the United States Army by the Hungarian Crown Guard for safekeeping from the Soviet Union. For much of the Cold War the crown was held at the United States Bullion Depository (Fort Knox, Kentucky) alongside the bulk of America's gold reserves and other priceless historical items. After undergoing extensive historical research to verify the crown as genuine, it was returned to Hungary by order of U.S. President Jimmy Carter on 6 January 1978. Most current academic knowledge about Hungarian royal garments originates from this modern research. Following substantial U.S. political debate, the agreement to return the jewels contained many conditions to ensure the people of Hungary, rather than its Communist government, took possession of the jewels. The majority of the Hungarian- American population opposed the decision to return the crown. On January 6, 1978, US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance returned the Crown to Hungary in Budapest.

On 1 January 2000, the Holy Crown of Hungary was moved to the Hungarian Parliament Building from the Hungarian National Museum. The sceptre, orb and the coronation sword were also moved to the Parliament. The very large coronation mantle remains in a glass inert gas vault at the National Museum due to its delicate, faint condition. Unlike the crown and accompanying insignia, the originally red coloured mantle is considered to date back to Stephen I, and was made circa 1030. Old records describe the robe as handiwork of the queen and her sisters and the mantle's middle back bears the king's only known portrait (which shows his crown was not the currently existing one). A circular inscription sewn in Latin identifies the coat as a bishop's chasuble. The sceptre is considered the artistically most valuable piece of the Hungarian royal inventory. It contains a solid rock crystal ball decorated with engraved lions, a rare product of the 10th-century Fatimid caliphate. Its handle contains a wooden rod surrounded by very fine wrought silver ornaments. The orb is unusual in having a patriarchal cross instead of a simple cross, as on the crown. The ceremonial straight sword kept in the Holy Crown collection is a 14th-century Italian product. However, what is said to be an original coronation sword of Stephen I has been in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral since 1368.The sword has a walrus-tooth hilt decorated in the Mammen style, dated to the 10th century.

History Saint Ignatius statue Saint Louis University traces its origins to the Saint Louis Academy, founded on November 16, 1818, by the Most Reverend Louis Guillaume Valentin Dubourg, Bishop of Louisiana and the Floridas, and placed under the charge of the Reverend Fran√ßois Niel and others of the secular clergy attached to the Saint Louis Cathedral. Its first location was in a private residence near the Mississippi River in an area now occupied by the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial within the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Already having a two-story building for the 65 students using Bishop Dubourg's personal library of 8,000 volumes for its printed materials, the name Saint Louis Academy was changed in 1820 to Saint Louis College (while the secondary school division remained Saint Louis Academy, now known as St. Louis University High School). In 1827 Bishop Dubourg placed Saint Louis College in the care of the Society of Jesus. Not long after that, it received its charter as a university by act of the Missouri Legislature. In 1829 it moved to Washington Avenue and Ninth at the site of today's America's Center by The Dome at America's Center. In 1852 the university and its teaching priests were the subject of a viciously anti-Catholic novel, The Mysteries of St. Louis, written by newspaper editor Henry Boernstein whose popular paper, the Anzeiger des Westens was also a foe of the university.Catholicism and American Freedom,, John McGreevy Norton and Co., New York 2003, p. 22-23. In 1867 after the American Civil War the University purchased \\"Lindell's Grove\\" to be the site of its current campus.The University's main campus is named \\"Frost Campus\\" in honor of General Daniel M. Frost, commander of the Missouri Militia during the Camp Jackson Incident. After being exchanged for a captured Federal officer, General Frost \\"went south\\" and was commissioned as a General in the Confederate Army. The University named the campus after General Frost at the request of his daughter Mrs. Harriet Frost Fordyce, who contributed $1,000,000 to the University, allowing a major expansion in 1962. Frost Campus Ironically, part of the Frost Campus covers the former \\"Camp Jackson\\" militia encampment site. Lindell's Grove was the site of the Civil War \\"Camp Jackson Affair\\". On May 10, 1861 U.S. Regulars and Federally enrolled Missouri Volunteers arrested the Missouri Volunteer Militia after the militia received a secret shipment of siege artillery, infantry weapons and ammunition from the Confederate Government. While the Militia was arrested without violence, angry local citizens rushed to the site, and rioting broke out, in which 28 people were killed. The Camp Jackson Affair lead to open conflict within the state, culminating with a successful Federal offensive in mid-June 1861 which expelled the state's pro-secession governor Claiborne Fox Jackson from the state capitol (Jefferson City). Jackson later led a Missouri Confederate government-in-exile, dying of cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1862. The first (and most iconic) building on campus, DuBourg Hall, began construction in 1888, and the college moved to its new location in 1889. St. Francis Xavier College Church moved to its current location with the completion of the lower church in 1884. It was completed in 1898. NE quarter of Frost Campus with Parks College of Engineering, Aviation, and TechnologyDuring the early 1940s, many local priests, especially the Jesuits, began to challenge the segregationist policies at the city's Catholic colleges and parochial schools.Donald J.

Samuel Cupples House =Shift to majority lay board of trustees= In 1967, Saint Louis University became one of the first Catholic universities to increase give laypeople more power. Board chairman Fr. Paul Reinert, SJ, stepped aside to be replaced by layman Daniel Schlafly, and the board shifted to an 18 to 10 majority of laypeople. This was largely because of Horace Mann vs. the Board of Public Works of Maryland, a landmark case heard by the Maryland Court of Appeals, which declared unconstitutional grants to \\"largely sectarian\\" colleges. The Second Vatican Council has also been mentioned as a major influence on this decision for its increased focus on the laity, as well as the decreased recruitment of nuns and priests since the council. From 1985 to 1992 the Chairman of the Board of Trustees was William H. T. Bush (younger brother of former President George H. W. Bush). The younger Bush also taught classes at the school.William H.T. (Bucky) Bush ‚Äì bushodonnell.com ‚Äì Retrieved January 28, 2008 Since the move to lay oversight, debate has erupted many times over how much influence the Roman Catholic Church should have on the affairs of the university. The decision by the University to sell its hospital to Tenet Healthcare Corp. in 1997 met much resistance by both local and national Church leaders, but went ahead as planned. In 2015, the Catholic SSM Health system assumed operation of Saint Louis University hospital. A $500 million rebuilding of the hospital and construction of a new ambulatory care center was completed in 2020. =Timeline= Richard A.

Clock Tower Plaza Named for Prominent SLU Alumnus. Retrieved November 17, 2014, from =Housing= Saint Louis has residence halls and student apartment space on campus. As part of the First Year Experience (FYE) program, students are required to live on campus for their first two years at SLU, unless they are a commuter from the St. Louis metropolitan area. The sophomore residency requirement caused controversy when first enacted during in the 2009-2010 school year, as the University lacked enough housing for all sophomores and upperclassmen who requested it. In the 2010-11 school year, the school announced the transfer of the Student Housing Scholarship (of $1,000 to $2,000) to Tuition Scholarship, which made off-campus housing more affordable and pursued by upperclassmen. Spring Hall and Grand Hall, built in 2016 and 2017 respectively, added nearly 1,000 beds for freshmen and sophomores in addition to a dining hall, more classrooms, and further office space for administrators. Freshman Year Experience options Student village on- campus apartments SLU has several Learning Communities (LCs), intended to allow freshmen and sophomores living on campus to surround themselves with like-minded or like-majored peers. As of 2020, over half of all SLU first- years choose to participate in a Learning Community. The Griesedieck Complex (also known as \\"Gries\\", pronounced \\"greez\\") has 16 stories of living space in its main building, as well as 9 additional floors of space attached on its west and east sides as Clemens Hall and Walsh Hall, respectively.Both halls were renovated and repainted (Walsh in 2019 and Clemens in 2020) to accommodate future larger freshman classes, and to house sophomores as needed. Upperclassmen options Flats, junior and senior apartments Sophomores participating in Greek Life can live in DeMattias Hall, the de facto community House. Next door is Marguerite Hall, with eight floors of suite-style two- occupancy dorm rooms. Grand Forest, the Village, and the Marchetti Towers are on-campus apartments for upperclassmen. The Marchetti Towers, just west of Grand Forest, are two 12-story towers that got a $3.8 million renovation in the summer of 2008. Major building and renovation projects During the past 20 years, the University has seen the modernization and construction of campus buildings as well as the revitalization of surrounding Midtown St. Louis. Some of the highlights of three decades at SLU include the investment of more than $840 million in improvements and expansions including the expansion of the Richard A. Chaifetz School of Business; construction of McDonnell Douglas Hall, home to Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology; the Center for Advanced Dental Education; the Doisy College of Health Sciences Building and the expansion and renovation of the Busch Student Center. Part of this expansion was the closing of two blocks of West Pine Boulevard (the section between N. Vandeventer Ave. and N. Grand Blvd.) and two blocks of N. Spring Ave. (between Lindell Blvd. and Laclede Ave.), both public streets which the campus had previously expanded across, converting them into a pedestrian mall. Furthermore, the University completed construction of the $82 million Edward A. Doisy Research Center in 2007 and the on-campus Chaifetz Arena in 2008. =Edward A. Doisy Research Center= Doisy research center IN 2007, SLU completed a $67 million, 10-story research center connected to its Medical Campus Building, a green building named for Edward Adelbert Doisy, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate of 1943 and a long-time faculty member at SLU's medical school.SLU Press Release: SLU Research Building Named in Honor of Nobel Laureate Following $30 Million Gift The total cost was forecast to be around $80 million. It was dedicated on December 7, 2007. In July 2010, the Edward A.

The label of transgender man is not always interchangeable with that of transsexual man, although the two labels are often used in this way. Transgender is an umbrella term that includes different types of gender variant people (including transsexual people). Many trans men choose to undergo surgical or hormonal transition, or both (see sex reassignment therapy), to alter their appearance in a way that aligns with their gender identity or alleviates gender dysphoria. Although the literature indicates that most trans men identify as heterosexual (meaning they are sexually attracted to women), trans men, like cisgender men, can have any sexual orientation or sexual identity, such as homosexual, gay, bisexual, pansexual, or asexual, and some trans men might consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them, in which case they may elect to use labels like queer.  Terminology  Thomas Beatie at Stockholm Pride 2011, known in the media as the Pregnant Man, is a trans man who gave birth to three children. Lucas Silveira, lead singer and guitarist of The Cliks. The term trans man is used as a short form for either identity (transsexual man and transgender man). This commonly referred to as female-to-male (FTM or F2M). Transgender man is an umbrella term that may include anybody who was assigned female at birth (AFAB), but identifies as male. For instance, some androgynous, bigender, and genderqueer people might identify as transgender. Because transgender is an umbrella term, it can be imprecise and does not always describe specific identities and experiences. Transmasculine is a general, broader term for individuals who were AFAB but identify closer to the masculine (or male) side of the gender spectrum. The term transsexual originated in the medical and psychological communities. However, unlike the term transgender, transsexual is not an umbrella term, and many transgender people do not identify as such. Transsexual is a term for AFAB and assigned male at birth (AMAB) people alike who feel their sex organs do not reflect their gender and have chosen to change some aspect of their body; it is an older term, with GLAAD stating that it is \\"still preferred by some people who have permanently changed ‚Äì or seek to change ‚Äì their bodies through medical interventions (including but not limited to hormones and/or surgeries).\\" The transgender community sometimes uses the term passing to describe a transgender person's ability to appear as the gender they identify with. The opposite meaning is conveyed by the terms \\"to be read\\" or \\"to be clocked\\", and means not passing.  Transitioning  Buck Angel, a trans man and adult film producer. Ian Harvie, an American comedian and openly transgender man. Chaz Bono, American author and transgender activist. Originally, the term trans men referred specifically to female-to-male transsexual people who underwent hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or sex reassignment surgery (SRS), or both. The definition of transition has broadened to include theories of psychological development or complementary methods of self-acceptance. Many of those who identify as transgender may face gender dysphoria. Transsexual and transgender men may seek medical interventions such as hormones and surgery to make their bodies as congruent as possible with their gender presentation. However, many transgender and transsexual men cannot afford or choose not to undergo surgery or hormone replacement therapy. Many who have not undergone top surgery choose to bind their breasts. There are a few different methods of binding, including using sports bras and specially made binders (which can be vest-type, or wrap-around style). Tape or bandages, although often depicted in popular culture, should never be used for binding as they tighten with wear and compress the ribcage, and could result in injury. Some trans men might also decide to pack, to create a phallic bulge in the crotch of clothing. However, this is not universal. Trans men who decide to pack may use anything from rolled up socks to specially made packers, which resemble a penis. Some packers are also created for trans men to be able to urinate through them (stand-to-pee, or STP, devices), or for sexual penetration or other sexual activity (known as \\"pack-and-play\\"). Transitioning might involve some or all of the following steps:Ftmaustralia.org * Social transition: using a preferred name and pronouns, wearing clothing seen as gender appropriate, disclosure to family, friends and usually at the workplace/school. * Sex reassignment therapy: hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and/or surgery (SRS) * Legal affirmation: name and (sometimes) sex marker correction in legal identification documents. Being socially accepted as male (sometimes known as passing) may be challenging for trans men who have not undergone HRT and/or surgery. Some trans men may choose to present as female in certain social situations (e.g. at work). After physical transition, trans men usually live full-time as male. However, some transmasculine individuals might choose to use and engage their bodies to be pregnant, birth a baby, and chestfeed.  Prevalence, identity and relationships In the United States, the ratio of trans men within the general population is unclear, but estimates range between 1:2,000 and 1:100,000.Msu.edu A U.S. Census Bureau study in 2015 suggests that there were around 58,000 name changes in census records consistent with female to male transitions although only 7,500 of these changed their sex coding as well.Likely Transgender Individuals in U.S. Federal Administrative Records and the 2010 Census Census.gov In a study by Kara Devaney, entitled Transgender Research Literature Review, it is addressed that the term transgender encompasses a myriad of different and unique identities that do not follow the \\"normal\\" rules of gender. Miriam J. Abelson writes, \\"There is no question that trans men's experiences are men's experiences and give insight about men, masculinity, and gender inequality.\\" A trans man may be gay, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, asexual, demisexual, etc., and some trans men consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them. The literature commonly indicates that sexual attraction to those of their same gender (e.g., trans men liking men and trans women liking women) is considerably less common among trans men than among trans women; the vast majority of trans men are reported as heterosexual. Surveys from the National Center for Transgender Equality show more variation in sexual orientation or sexual identity among trans men. In NCTE's 2015 Transgender Survey of respondents who identified as trans men, 23% identified as heterosexual or straight. The vast majority (65%) identified their sexual orientation or sexual identity as queer (24%), pansexual (17%), bisexual (12%), or gay/same-gender loving (12%). Some trans men date heterosexual women, while other trans men date queer-identified women; the latter might be because queer-identified women are less invested in the gender and sexual anatomy of a person when it comes to selecting an intimate partner. It is also common for trans men to have histories with the lesbian community or to feel that they identify better with that community because of its wide acceptance of gender variance, with a number of trans men having identified as lesbian (often as a \\"butch lesbian\\") before realizing that they are instead transgender. Trans men have less success integrating socially within cisgender gay men's communities, which tend to be more body-focused, especially in terms of being phallocentric. Yitzchak et al. state that, as a result, they more commonly see gay trans men partnering with each other than with cisgender gay men. There are, however, cases of women being likelier than men to thoroughly question trans men about their motivations for modifying their bodies. Some scholars argue against assumptions that trans men are predominantly heterosexual and usually have lesbian histories. In scholars Ian Irving and Rupert Raj's book Trans Activism in Canada, researchers state, \\"There is still a common misperception that trans men are largely heterosexual amongst those who conflate gender identity and sexual orientation. It is frequently assumed that trans men are exclusively attracted to women and have lesbian histories prior to transition.\\" They add, \\"Recent data from the Trans PULSE project (Bauer, Redman, Bradley, & Scheim, 2013) challenge this assumption, with 63 percent of female-to-male spectrum trans people in Ontario reporting non- heterosexual identities and/or past-year sex with trans or non-trans men.\\" They also argue that, based on some research, \\"many non-trans gay men have welcomed trans men into gay communities and have increasingly recognized trans men as potential sexual and romantic partners.\\"  Sexual violence  Trans men can be victims of sex crimes, and there are cases where rape has occurred, including with the intention of changing the sexual expressions and/or the sexuality of trans men; this is known as corrective rape. In a 2016 Bangkok Post article, a researcher stated, \\"Unlike in South Africa, where homophobic rape is rampant, with increasing trends as a large number of men still want to use violence to force trans people to abandon their sexual identity, there are no official surveys or studies about this problem in Thailand. [...] Recently some video clips emerged showing the rape of trans people.\\" Furthermore, the article told about two cases of rape of trans men in Thailand, and a claim that \\"it seems that quite a few people [in Thailand] would say they have heard of, or known about, such cases in their communities\\".  Health  Accessing health care services for trans men can be difficult. HIV infection between trans men and others is still increasing.
