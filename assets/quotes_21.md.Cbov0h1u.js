This map is a simplified one, as in the case of some counties the area of land colonised did not cover the whole of the area coloured. A more detailed map of the areas subjected to plantations Plantations in 16th- and 17th-century Ireland involved the confiscation of Irish-owned land by the English Crown and the colonisation of this land with settlers from Great Britain. The Crown saw the plantations as a means of controlling, anglicising and 'civilising' parts of Ireland. The main plantations took place from the 1550s to the 1620s, the biggest of which was the plantation of Ulster. The plantations led to the founding of many towns, demographic and economic changes, changes in land ownership and the landscape, and also to ethnic and sectarian conflict. They took place before and during the earliest English colonisation of the Americas. There had been small-scale immigration from Britain since the 12th century, after the Norman invasion, creating an English-Irish community in Ireland. By the 15th century, English control had shrunk to an area called the Pale. In the 1540s the English began re-asserting control, beginning the Tudor conquest of Ireland. The first plantations were in the 1550s, during the reign of Queen Mary I, in Laois ('Queen's County') and Offaly ('King's County'). These plantations were based around existing frontier forts, but they were largely unsuccessful due to attacks from the local Irish clans. The next plantations were during the reign of Elizabeth I. A privately-funded plantation of east Ulster was attempted in the 1570s, but it also sparked conflict with the Irish and ended in failure. The Munster plantation of the 1580s followed the Desmond Rebellions. English colonists were settled on land confiscated from the defeated rebel lords. However, the settlements were scattered and attracted far fewer settlers than was hoped for. When the Nine Years' War broke out in the 1590s, most of these settlements were abandoned, although English settlers began to return following the war. The plantation of Ulster began in the 1610s, during the reign of James I. Following their defeat in the Nine Years' War, many rebel Ulster lords fled Ireland and their lands were confiscated. This was the biggest and most successful of the plantations and comprised most of the province of Ulster. While the province was mainly Irish-speaking and Catholic, the new settlers were required to be English-speaking and Protestant, with most coming from England and Scotland. This created a distinct Ulster Protestant community. The Ulster plantation was one of the causes of the 1641 Irish Rebellion, during which thousands of settlers were killed, expelled or fled. After the Irish Catholics were defeated in the Cromwellian conquest of 1652, most remaining Irish Catholic-owned land was confiscated and thousands of English soldiers settled in Ireland. Scottish settlement in Ulster resumed and intensified during the Scottish famine of the 1690s. By the 1720s, British Protestants were the majority in Ulster. The plantations changed the demography of Ireland by creating large communities with a British and Protestant identity. The ruling classes of these communities replaced the older Catholic ruling class, which had shared with the general population a common Irish identity and set of political attitudes.Padraig Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, pp. 5‚Äì6: \\"The Gaelic Irish and Old English were increasingly seen by outsiders and defined themselves, as undifferentiatedly Irish. ... By the 1630s, members of the Catholic elite, whatever their paternal ancestry, shared a common identity and set of political attitudes. ... Conversely, it is possible to speak of a contending Protestant/New English/British group. The term 'British' has validity because of its contemporary usage (in referring to grantees in the Ulster Plantation for example) and, especially, because it embraces, as it was designed to, both English and Scottish interests in Ireland...the consciousness of being a privileged minority in a hostile environment.\\" The new ruling class represented English and Scottish interests in Ireland. The physical and economic nature of Irish society also changed, as new concepts of ownership, trade, and credit were introduced. These changes led to the creation of a Protestant Ascendancy. Early plantations (1556‚Äì1576) Political boundaries in Ireland in 1450, before the plantations The early Plantations of Ireland occurred during the Tudor conquest of Ireland. The Crown government at Dublin intended to pacify and Anglicise the country under English rule and incorporate the native ruling classes into the English aristocracy. The government intended to develop Ireland as a peaceful and reliable possession, without risk of rebellion or foreign invasion. Wherever the policy of surrender and regrant failed, land was confiscated and English plantations were established. To this end, two forms of plantation were adopted in the second half of the 16th century. The first was the \\"exemplary plantation\\", in which small colonies of English would provide model farming communities that the Irish could emulate. One such colony was planted in the late 1560s, at Kerrycurrihy near Cork city, on land leased from the Earl of Desmond.Colm Lennon, Sixteenth Century Ireland, the Incomplete Conquest, pp. 211‚Äì213 =Laois and Offaly= The second form set the trend for future English policy in Ireland. It was punitive in nature, as it provided for the plantation of English settlers on lands confiscated following the suppression of rebellions. The first such scheme was the Plantation of King's County (now Offaly) and Queen's County (now Laois) in 1556, naming them after the new Catholic monarchs Philip and Mary I respectively. The new county towns were named Philipstown (now Daingean) and Maryborough (now Port Laoise). An Act was passed \\"whereby the King and Queen's Majesties, and the Heires and Successors of the Queen, be entituled to the Counties of Leix, Slewmarge, Irry, Glinmaliry, and Offaily, and for making the same Countries Shire Grounds.\\"3 & 4 Phil & Mar, c.2 (1556). The Act was repealed in 1962 . The O'Moore and O'Connor clans, which occupied the area, had traditionally raided the English- ruled Pale around Dublin. The Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Earl of Sussex, ordered that they be dispossessed and replaced with an English settlement. However, the plantation was not a great success. The O'Moores and O'Connors retreated to the hills and bogs and fought a local insurgency against the settlement for much of the following 40 years. In 1578, the English finally subdued the displaced O'Moore clan by massacring most of their fine (or ruling families) at Mullaghmast in Laois, having invited them there for peace talks. Rory Oge O'More, the leader of rebellion in the area, was hunted down and killed later that year. The ongoing violence meant that the authorities had difficulty in attracting people to settle in their new plantation. Settlement ended up clustered around a series of military fortifications.Lennon pp. 169‚Äì170Nicholas Canny, Making Ireland British 1580‚Äì1650, pp. 128‚Äì129 Irish Gaelic chieftain receives the priest's blessing before departing to fight the English, who are shown in full armour. =East Ulster= Another failed plantation occurred in eastern Ulster in the 1570s. The east of the province (occupied by the MacDonnells and Clandeboye O'Neills) was intended to be colonised with English planters, to establish a barrier between the Gaels of Ireland and Scotland, and to stop the flow of Scottish mercenaries into Ireland. The conquest of east Ulster was contracted out to the Earl of Essex and Sir Thomas Smith. The O'Neill chieftain, Turlough Luineach O'Neill, fearing an English bridgehead in Ulster, helped his O'Neill kinsmen of in Clandeboye. The MacDonnells in Antrim, led by Sorley Boy MacDonnell, also called in reinforcements from their kinsmen in the Western Isles and Highlands of Scotland.Lennon, pp. 276‚Äì282 The plantation eventually degenerated, as atrocities were committed against the local civilian population before it was abandoned. Brian MacPhelim O'Neill of Clandeboye, his wife and 200 clansmen were murdered at a feast organised by the Earl of Essex in 1574. In 1575, Francis Drake (later victor over the Spanish Armada, then in the pay of the Earl of Essex) participated in a naval expedition that culminated in the massacre of 500 MacDonnell clans-people in a surprise raid on Rathlin Island. But, according to Harry Kelsey, Drake's role in the massacre is unclear.Harry Kelsey, ‚ÄòDrake, Sir Francis (1540‚Äì1596)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2007. Retrieved 8 November 2007. The following year, Elizabeth I, disturbed by the killing of civilians, called a halt to trying to establish this plantation.Lennon p. 279 Munster Plantation (1586 onwards) The Munster Plantation of the 1580s was the first mass plantation in Ireland. It was instituted as punishment for the Desmond Rebellions, when the Geraldine Earl of Desmond had rebelled against English interference in Munster. The Desmond dynasty was annihilated in the aftermath of the Second Desmond Rebellion (1579‚Äì83) and their estates were confiscated by the Crown. The English authorities took the opportunity to settle the province with colonists from England and Wales, who, it was hoped, would be a bulwark against further rebellions. In 1584, the Surveyor General of Ireland, Sir Valentine Browne and a commission surveyed Munster, to allocate confiscated lands to English Undertakers (wealthy colonists who \\"undertook\\" to import tenants from England to work their new lands). The English Undertakers were obligated to develop new towns and provide for the defence of planted districts from attack.Lennon pp. 229‚Äì230 As well as the former Geraldine estates (spread through the modern counties of Limerick, Cork, Kerry and Tipperary), the survey took in the lands belonging to other families and clans that had supported the rebellions in Kerry and southwest Cork. However, the settlement here was rather piecemeal because the ruling clan ‚Äì the MacCarthy M√≥r line ‚Äì argued that the rebel landowners were their subordinates and that the lords actually owned the land. In this area, lands once granted to some English Undertakers was taken away again when native lords, such as the MacCarthys, appealed the dispossession of their dependants.Lennon p. 234 Other sectors of the plantation were equally chaotic. John Popham imported 70 tenants from Somerset, only to find that the land had already been settled by another undertaker, and he was obliged to send them home.Daniel Macarthy, The Letter Book of Florence MacCarthy, p. 16 Nevertheless, were planted with English colonists. The Crown hoped that the settlement would attract in the region of 15,000 colonists, but a report from 1589 showed that the English Undertakers had imported only about 700 English tenants between them. Historians have noted that each tenant was the head of a household, and that he therefore likely represented at least 4‚Äì5 other people. This would put the English population in Munster at nearer to three or four thousand persons, but it was still substantially below the projected figure.Canny, Making Ireland British, p. 146 The Munster Plantation was supposed to develop compact defensible settlements, but the English settlers were spread in pockets across the province, wherever land had been confiscated. Initially the English Undertakers were given detachments of English soldiers to protect them, but these were abolished in the 1590s. As a result, when the Nine Years War ‚Äî an Irish rebellion against English rule ‚Äì reached Munster in 1598, most of the settlers were chased off their lands without a fight. They took refuge in the province's walled towns or fled back to England. However, when the rebellion was put down in 1601‚Äì03, the Plantation was re-constituted by the Governor of Munster, George Carew.Canny pp. 162‚Äì164 Ulster Plantation (1606 onwards) Hugh O'Neill, who led Gaelic resistance to the English conquest of Ulster Prior to its conquest in the Nine Years War of the 1590s, Ulster was the most Gaelic part of Ireland and the only province that was completely outside English control. The war, of 1594‚Äì1603, ended with the surrender of the O'Neill and O'Donnell lords to the English crown, but it was also a hugely costly and humiliating episode for the English government in Ireland. In the short term the war failed, and generous surrender terms given to the rebels re-granted them much of their former land, but under English law.Lennon p. 302, \\"Within Tyrone, his [O'Neill's] power was made absolute over the inhabitants of all ranks...Thus O'Neill was accorded virtual palatinate powers in his territory with the backing of English law, the outcome he had more or less sought at the beginning of the campaign in 1599\\". But when Hugh O'Neill and the other rebel earls left Ireland in the so- called 1607 Flight of the Earls to seek help from the Spanish Crown for a new rebellion, the Lord Deputy Arthur Chichester seized the opportunity to colonise the province and declared the lands of O'Neill, O'Donnell and their followers forfeit. Initially, Chichester planned a fairly modest plantation, including large grants to Irish-born lords who had sided with the English during the war. However, in 1608 Cahir O'Doherty's rebellion in Donegal interrupted implementation of this plan. O'Doherty was a former ally of the English who felt he had not been fairly rewarded for his role in the war. The rebellion was swiftly put down and O'Doherty killed, but these events gave Chichester a justification for expropriating all of the original landowners in the province.Canny p. 184-198 In 1603 James VI of Scotland also became James I of England, uniting these two crowns and also gaining possession of the Kingdom of Ireland, at that time an English Crown possession. The Plantation of Ulster was promoted to him as a joint \\"British\\", i.e. English and Scottish, venture to pacify and civilise Ulster. It was agreed that at least half of the settlers would be Scots. Six counties made up his official plantation of Ulster: The plan was determined by two factors: first, the Crown wanted to protect the settlement from being destroyed by rebels like the Munster plantation. So rather than settling the planters in isolated pockets of land confiscated from convicted rebels, they confiscated all of the land and redistributed it, creating concentrations of British settlers around new towns and garrisons. The new landowners were explicitly banned from taking on Irish tenants, and had to import their tenant farmers from England and Scotland. The remaining Irish landowners were granted one quarter of the land in Ulster. The common Irish residents were to be relocated to live near garrisons and Protestant churches, the more ready for Protestant control. The Planters were barred from selling their lands to any Irishman.Padraig Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, Ireland 1603‚Äì1727, p. 48 A portion of the city walls of Derry, originally built in 1613‚Äì1619 to defend the plantation settlement there. The second major influence on the plantation of Ulster was the political negotiation among the interest groups on the British side. The principal landowners were to be English Undertakers, wealthy men from England and Scotland who undertook to import tenants from their own estates. The planters were granted around each, on condition that they settle there a minimum of 48 adult males (including at least 20 families), who had to be English-speaking Protestants. However, veterans of the war in Ireland (known as Servitors) led by Arthur Chichester, successfully lobbied for land grants of their own. Since these former officers did not have enough private capital to fund the colonisation, their involvement was subsidised by the City of London (the financial sector in London). The City was granted their own town, and lands. The final major recipient of lands was the Protestant Church of Ireland, which was granted all churches and lands previously owned by the Roman Catholic church. The Crown intended that clerics from England and the Pale convert the population to Protestantism.Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, pp. 44‚Äì47 The Plantation of Ulster was a mixed success for the English. By the 1630s, there were 20,000 adult male English and Scottish settlers in Ulster, which meant that the total settler population could have been as high as 80,000 to 150,000. They formed local majorities of the population in the Finn and Foyle valleys (around modern Derry and east Donegal), north Armagh and east Tyrone. Planters had achieved substantial settlement on unofficially planted lands in north Down, led by James Hamilton and Hugh Montgomery,A. T. Q. Stewart: The Narrow Ground: The Roots of Conflict in Ulster. London, Faber and Faber Ltd. New Edition, 1989. p. 38. Cyril Falls: The Birth of Ulster. London, Constable and Company Ltd. 1996. pp. 156‚Äì157. M. Perceval-Maxwell: The Scottish Migration to Ulster in the Reign of James 1. Belfast: Ulster Historical Foundation. 1999. p. 55. and in south Antrim under Sir Randall MacDonnell.Marianne Elliott: The Catholics of Ulster: A History. New York: Basic Books. 2001. p. 88. The settler population increased rapidly, as just under half of the migrants were women ‚Äì a very high ratio compared, for instance, to contemporary Spanish settlement in Latin America or English settlement in Virginia. New England attracted more families, but still was predominately male in its early years.Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, p. 54Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, p. 7 But the Irish population was neither removed nor Anglicised. In practise, the settlers did not stay on poorer lands, but clustered around towns and the best land. This meant that many English and Scottish landowners had to take Irish tenants, contrary to the terms of the Plantation of Ulster. In 1609, Chichester deported 1300 former Irish soldiers from Ulster to serve in the Swedish Army,E. Bourke, \\"Irish Levies for the Army of Sweden (1609‚Äì1610),\\" The Irish Monthly, Vol. 46, No. 541 (Jul. 1918), pp. 396‚Äì404 but the province remained plagued with Irish bandits, known as \\"wood-kerne,\\" who attacked vulnerable settlers. It was said that English settlers were not safe a mile outside walled towns; the natives plagued the forests and wolves roamed the countryside. The attempted conversion of the Irish to Protestantism also had few successes; at first the clerics sent to Ireland were all English speakers, whereas the native population were usually monoglot speakers of Irish Gaelic. Later, the Catholic Church made a determined effort to retain its followers among the native population.Canny, pp. 429‚Äì431 and 435‚Äì436. For instance, in one Ulster parish in 1622, that of Lord Grandison, 13 Irish male heads of households were attending Protestant services, but over 200 were refusing to do so. Later plantations (1610‚Äì1641) Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, who amassed huge quantities of land in southern Ireland in the early 17th century In addition to the Ulster plantation, several other small plantations occurred under the reign of the Stuart Kings‚ÄîJames I and Charles I‚Äîin the early 17th century. The first of these took place in north county Wexford in 1610, where lands were confiscated from the MacMurrough-Kavanagh clan. Lismore Castle, County Waterford, acquired by Boyle and turned from a fortress into a stately home Since most land-owning families in Ireland had taken their estates by force in the previous four hundred years, very few of them, with the exception of the New English planters, had proper legal titles for them. As a result, in order to obtain such titles, they were required to forfeit a quarter of their lands. This policy was used against the Kavanaghs in Wexford and subsequently elsewhere, to break up Catholic Irish estates (especially the Gaelic ones) around the country. Following the precedent set in Wexford, small plantations were established in Laois and Offaly, Longford, Leitrim and north Tipperary.Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, pp. 56‚Äì57 To take one example of this policy: in 1621 King James I established his claims to the whole of Upper Ossory in County Laois, including the manor of Offerlane. James claimed royal inheritance (from the de Clare family) at an inquisition held at Port Laoise, and instituted a plantation of the area in 1626. John FitzPatrick, Baron Upper Ossory, refused to submit the manor of Castletown to the plantation. In 1537 his ancestor, Brian MacGiollaPadraig, had agreed to surrender Upper Ossory to King Henry VIII and was regranted the lordship under English law; in 1541 he was made Baron of Upper Ossory. After John FitzPatrick's death in 1626, his son Florence continued this opposition to the plantation on his estates. However, the Fitzpatricks were eventually forced to concede a portion of their lands. In Laois and Offally, the Tudor plantation had consisted of a chain of military garrisons. In the new, more peaceful climate of the 17th century, it attracted large numbers of landowners, tenants and labourers. Prominent planters in Leinster in this period include Charles Coote, Adam Loftus, and William Parsons.Canny pp. 371‚Äì372 In Munster, during the peaceful early years of the 17th century, thousands more English and Welsh settlers arrived in the province. There were many small plantations in Munster in this period, as Irish lords were required to forfeit up to one third of their estates to get their deeds to the remainder recognised by the English authorities. The settlers became concentrated in towns along the south coast ‚Äì especially Youghal, Bandon, Kinsale and Cork city. Notable English Undertakers of the Munster Plantation include Walter Raleigh, Edmund Spenser, and Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. The latter especially made huge fortunes out of amassing Irish lands and developing them for industry and agriculture.Canny p. 211 Thomas Wentworth, who planned a major seizure of Catholic-owned land in the late 1630s The Irish Catholic upper classes were unable to stop the continued plantations in Ireland because they had been barred from public office on religious grounds. By 1615 they comprised a minority in the Irish Parliament, as a result of the creation of \\"pocket boroughs\\" (where Protestants were in the majority) in planted areas. In 1625, they gained a temporary halt to land confiscations by agreeing to pay for England's war with France and Spain.Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, pp. 10‚Äì11 In addition to the plantations, thousands of independent settlers arrived in Ireland in the early 17th century, from the Netherlands and France as well as Britain. Many of them became chief tenants of Irish land-owners; others set up in the towns (especially Dublin) ‚Äî notably as bankers and financiers. By 1641, there were calculated to be up to 125,000 Protestant settlers in Ireland, though they were still outnumbered by native Catholics by around 15 to 1.Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, p. 46 Not all of the early 17th century English Planters were Protestants. A considerable number of English Catholics settled in Ireland between 1603‚Äì1641, in part for economic reasons but also to escape persecution in England. In the time of Elizabeth and James I, the Catholics of England suffered a greater degree of persecution than English Catholics in Ireland. In England, Catholics were greatly outnumbered by Protestants and lived under constant fear of betrayal by their fellows. In Ireland they could blend in with the local majority-Catholic population in a way that was not possible in England. English Catholic planters were most common in County Kilkenny, where they may have made up half of all the English and Scottish planters to arrive in this region.David Edwards, The Origins of Sectarianism in Early Modern Ireland, p. 116 The sons and grandsons of these English planters played a major part in the politics of the Confederation of Kilkenny in the 1640s, most notably James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven. Plantations stayed off the political agenda until the appointment of Thomas Wentworth, a Privy Councilor of Charles I, to the position of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632. Wentworth's job was to raise revenue for Charles and to cement Royal control over Ireland ‚Äì which meant, among other things, more plantations, both to raise money and to break the political power of the Irish Catholic gentry. Wentworth confiscated land in Wicklow and planned a full-scale Plantation of Connacht ‚Äî where all Catholic landowners would lose between a half and a quarter of their estates. The local juries were intimidated into accepting Wentworth's settlement; when a group of Connacht landowners complained to Charles I, Wentworth had them imprisoned. However, settlement proceeded only in County Sligo and County Roscommon. Next, Wentworth surveyed the major Catholic landowners in Leinster for similar treatment, including members of the powerful Butler dynasty. Wentworth's plans were interrupted by the outbreak of the Bishops Wars in Scotland, which eventually resulted in Wentworth's execution by the English Parliament and civil war in England and Ireland. Wentworth's constant questioning of Catholic land titles was one of the major causes of the 1641 Rebellion, and the principal reason why it was joined by Ireland's wealthiest and most powerful Catholic families.Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, pp. 77‚Äì81 The 1641 Rebellion In October 1641, after a bad harvest and in a threatening political climate, Phelim O'Neill launched a rebellion, hoping to rectify various grievances of Irish Catholic landowners. However, once the rebellion was underway, the resentment of the native Irish in Ulster boiled over into indiscriminate attacks on the settler population in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Irish Catholics attacked the plantations all around the country, but especially in Ulster. English writers at the time put the Protestant victims at over 100,000. William Petty, in his survey of the 1650s, estimated the death toll at around 30,000. More recent research, however, based on close examination of the depositions of the Protestant refugees collected in 1642, suggests a figure of 4,000 settlers were killed directly; and up to 12,000 may have died of causes also related to disease (always a cause of high fatalities during wartime) or privation after being expelled from their homes.John Marshall (2006). John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture, Cambridge University Press, , p. 58, footnote 10, \\"Modern historians estimate the number massacred in Ireland in 1641 at between 2,000 and 12,000.\\" The Irish Catholics formed their own government, Confederate Ireland, to fight the subsequent wars. They negotiated with Charles I, for, among other things, an end to the plantations and a partial reversal of the existing ones. During the following ten years, murderous fighting took place between the rival ethnic and religious blocks throughout Ireland until the Irish Catholics were finally crushed and the country occupied by the New Model Army in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649 to 1653. Ulster was worst hit by the wars, with massive loss of civilian life and mass displacement of people. The atrocities committed by both sides further poisoned the relationship between the settler and native communities in the province. Although peace was eventually restored to Ulster, the wounds opened in the plantation and civil war years were very slow to heal and arguably still fester in Northern Ireland in the early 21st century.Canny pp. 568‚Äì571 In the 1641 Rebellion, the Munster Plantation was temporarily destroyed, just as it had been during the Nine Years' War. Ten years of warfare took place in Munster between the planters and their descendants and the native Irish Catholics. But the ethnic/religious divisions were less stark in Munster than in Ulster. Some of the earlier English Planters in Munster had been Roman Catholics and their descendants largely sided with the Irish in the 1640s. Conversely, some Irish noblemen who had converted to Protestantism ‚Äì notably Earl Inchiquin ‚Äì sided with the settler community.Canny, pp. 570, 572 Cromwellian land confiscation (1652) The Irish Confederates had pinned their hopes on Royalist victory in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, so that they could cite their loyalty to Charles I and force him into accepting their demands ‚Äì including toleration for Catholicism, Irish self-government, and an end to the Plantation policy. But, Charles' Royalists were defeated in the English Civil War by the Parliamentarians, who committed themselves to re- conquering Ireland and punishing those responsible for the rebellion of 1641. In 1649, Cromwell landed in Ireland with his New Model Army and by 1652, he had all but completed the conquest. The English Parliament published punitive terms of surrender for Catholics and Royalists in Ireland, which included the mass confiscation of almost all Catholic-owned land. Oliver Cromwell, under whose Commonwealth regime most Catholic land in Ireland was confiscated Cromwell held all Irish Catholics responsible for the rebellion of 1641 and said he would deal with them according to their \\"respective de-merits\\" ‚Äì meaning sanctions varying from execution in worst cases, to partial land confiscation even for those who had taken no part in the wars. The Long Parliament had been committed to mass confiscation of land in Ireland since 1642, when it passed the Adventurers Act, which raised loans secured with the lands of Irish rebels' that it anticipated confiscating. The Act of Settlement (1652) stated that anyone who had held arms against Parliament was to forfeit their lands. Those who did not would lose only three-quarters of their lands ‚Äì and were compensated with other land, in Connacht. The policy was to confine the remaining Catholic landowners into the peripheral province of Connacht, where they would no longer be a military threat. The confiscated lands throughout Ireland were awarded to the Parliament's creditors, Parliamentarian supporters in Ireland and military colonists. In practice, those Protestants who had fought for the Royalists avoided confiscation by paying fines to the Commonwealth regime, but the Irish Catholic land-owning class was utterly destroyed. In some respects, what Cromwell had achieved was the logical conclusion of the plantation process. The work was aided by the compilation of the Irish Civil Survey of 1654‚Äì5. The purpose of the survey was to secure information on the location, type, value and ownership of lands in the year 1641, before the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Twenty-seven counties were surveyed and a survey produced for each. The Down Survey of 1655‚Äì6 was a measured map survey, organised by Sir William Petty, of the lands confiscated. Over 12,000 veterans of the New Model Army were awarded land in Ireland in place of their wages due, which the Commonwealth was unable to pay. Many of these soldiers sold their land grants to other Protestants rather than settle in war-ravaged Ireland, but 7,500 soldiers did settle in Ireland. They were required to keep their weapons to act as a reserve militia in case of future rebellions. Taken together with the Merchant Adventurers, probably over 10,000 Parliamentarians settled in Ireland after the civil wars. Most of these were single men, however, and many of them married Irish women (although banned by law from doing so). Some of the Cromwellian soldiers thus began to be integrated into Irish Catholic society. In addition to the Parliamentarians, thousands of Scottish Covenanter soldiers, who had been stationed in Ulster during the war, settled there permanently after its end.Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, pp. 134‚Äì139 Some Parliamentarians had argued that all the Irish should be deported to west of the Shannon and replaced with English settlers. However, this would have required hundreds of thousands of English settlers willing to come to Ireland, and such numbers of aspirant settlers were never recruited. Rather, a land-owning class of British Protestants was created in Ireland, and they ruled over mostly Irish Catholic tenants. A minority of the \\"Cromwellian\\" landowners were Parliamentarian soldiers or creditors. Most were pre-war Protestant settlers, who took the opportunity to obtain confiscated lands. Before the wars, Catholics had owned 60% of the land in Ireland. During the Commonwealth period, Catholic landownership fell to 8‚Äì9%. After some restitution in the Restoration Act of Settlement 1662, it rose to 20% again.Lenihan, Confederate Catholics at War, p. 111 In Ulster, the Cromwellian period eliminated those native landowners who had survived the Ulster plantation. In Munster and Leinster, the mass confiscation of Catholic-owned land after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, meant that English Protestants acquired almost all of the land holdings for the first time in these territories. In addition, under the Commonwealth regime, some 12,000 Irish people were sold into indentured servitude to the Caribbean and North American colonies. Another 34,000 Irish Catholics went into exile on the Continent, mostly in the Catholic countries of France or Spain.Kenyon, Ohlmeyer, p. 314 Recent research has shown that although the native Irish land-owning class was subordinated in this period, it never totally disappeared. Many of its members found niches in trade or as chief tenants on their families' ancestral lands.Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, pp. 140‚Äì142 Subsequent settlement For the remainder of the 17th century, Irish Catholics tried to get the Cromwellian Act of Settlement reversed. They briefly achieved this under James II during the Williamite war in Ireland, but the Jacobite defeat there led to another round of land confiscations. During the 1680s and 90s, another major wave of settlement took place in Ireland (though not another plantation in terms of land confiscation). At this time, the new settlers were principally Scots, tens of thousands of whom fled a famine in the lowlands and border regions of Scotland to come to Ulster. At this point Protestants and people of Scottish descent (who were mainly Presbyterians) became an absolute majority of the population in Ulster.Lenihan, Consolidating Conquest, pp. 200‚Äì201 French Huguenots, who were Protestant, were also encouraged to settle in Ireland; they had been expelled from France after the Crown's revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Many of the Frenchmen were former soldiers, who had fought on the Williamite side in the Williamite war in Ireland. This community settled mainly in Dublin, as some had already been established as merchants in London. Their communal graveyard can still be seen off St Stephen's Green. The total population of this community may have reached 10,000.Huguenot History, Huguenot Society of Great Britain & Ireland Long-term results The Plantations had profound effects on Ireland. They resulted in the removal and/or execution of Catholic ruling classes and their replacement with what became known as the Protestant Ascendancy ‚Äî Anglican landowners mostly originating from Great Britain. Their position was reinforced by the Penal Laws. These denied political and most land-owning rights to Catholics and non-Anglican Protestant denominations, they also brought in harsh punishments for use of the Irish language and limited Catholics ability to practice their religion. The forced dominance of the Protestant class in Irish life persisted until the late 18th century, when they reluctantly voted for the Act of Union with Britain in 1800. It abolished their parliament, making their government part of Britain's.Concentration of Irish Protestants in eastern and central Ulster. The present-day partition of Ireland into the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland can be seen to have descended directly from the settlement patterns of the Plantations of the 17th century and colonisation. These led to various uprising and rebellions by the Irish people to reclaim their land and rights. The large Protestant population in Ulster preferred to remain as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as opposed to the rest of the country, where the Catholic majority favoured independence. In 1922, Unionists held the majority in four of the nine counties of Ulster. Consequently, following Civil War and a War of Independence, the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, these four counties ‚Äì and two others in which they formed a sizeable minority of nearly half the population ‚Äì remained in the United Kingdom to form Northern Ireland. This new state, born under threat of war from the British government, contained a sizeable Catholic minority, many of whom identified as descendants of those dispossessed in the Plantations. The Troubles in Northern Ireland in many respects are a continuation of the conflict arising from the land confiscations and other injustices during the colonisation and plantations period. The Plantations also had a major cultural influence. Gaelic Irish culture was decimated by the introduction of harsh measures for its use and English forcibly replaced Irish as the official language of power and business. Although by 1700 Irish was still the majority language in Ireland, English was the dominant language for use in Parliament, the courts, and trade. In the next two centuries, the use of English advanced westwards across the country. After the horrors of the Great Famine in the 1840s, when plantations and settler owned estates produced vast amounts of food that was shipped out of the country under armed guard while people starved, the deaths and emigration of nearly two million people caused the use of Irish to collapse in much of the country. Finally, the plantations and their related agricultural development radically altered Ireland's ecology and physical appearance. In 1600, most of Ireland was heavily wooded, apart from the bogs. Most of the population lived in small townlands, many migrating seasonally to fresh pastures for their cattle. By 1700, Ireland's native woodland had been decimated; it was intensively exploited and sold for profit by the new settlers for commercial ventures such as shipbuilding, as much of the English forests had been destroyed and the navy was becoming a great power. Several native species, such as the wolf, were hunted to extinction during this period. Most of the settler population was urbanized, living in permanent towns or villages. Some of the Irish people continued their traditional practices and culture under the shadow of heavy control and punishments. By the end of the plantation period, almost all of Ireland had become integrated into a market economy. But many of the poorer classes had no access to money, still paying rent (for land that was once owned by Irish people) in kind or in service.

Dominica is home to a wide range of people. Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes, the Ta√≠no and Island Caribs (Kalinago) tribes remained by the time European settlers reached the island. \\"Massacre\\" is a name of a river dedicated to the murders of the native villagers by French and British settlers, because the river ran red with blood for days. Each (French and British) claimed the island and imported slaves from Africa. The remaining Caribs now live on a Carib Territory on the east coast of the island. They elect their own chief. Dominica is often seen as a society that is migrating from collectivism to that of individualism. The economy is a developing one that previously depended on agriculture. Signs of collectivism are evident in the small towns and villages that are spread across the island. Dominican cuisine is similar to that of other Caribbean countries. Common main courses comprise meat (usually chicken, but can be goat, lamb, or beef) covered in sauce. The sauces are either spicy pepper sauces, or concoctions made from local fruit. A huge variety of local fruit, from tamarind to passion fruit, are served on the island, usually in juice or sauce form. Soursop is peeled and eaten raw. Sorrel, a red flower that only blooms around Christmas, is boiled into a bright red drink. The national psyche Dominica draws on a mix of cultures. Names of French places appear as often as English. African language, foods and customs often mingle with European traditions as part of the island's Creole culture. The Caribs still carve dugouts (canoes), build houses on stilts, and weave distinctive basketwork. Rastafarian and Black pride influences are also common. The Bah√°'√≠ Faith in Dominica is practiced by about 1% of the population. However, the core of Dominican culture is deeply embedded in the European culture, specifically that of the British. This is reflected in the etiquette, courtesies, mannerisms, bureaucracies and so on observed throughout the island. With an almost 80% Roman Catholic population, conservative and traditional values are strong. Family holds an important place in Dominican society. To a great enough extent that a government poster warning Dominicans of the dangers of transporting illegal drugs lists separation from family (followed by imprisonment and loss of life) as the number one deterrent to the crime. Amerindians The first settlers on the island arrived to the Commonwealth of Dominica about 400 BC. The Arawak, a group of peaceful hunter- gatherers established villages after island-hopping across the Eastern- Caribbean. The more aggressive hunter-gatherers, the Caribs, annihilated the Arawaks and took hold of the island. The majority of native Caribbean people on other Caribbean islands were killed by European colonists. The local Dominican Caribbean natives were able to hide in areas that were hard for European soldiers to find. The English Queen granted a territory in east coast of Dominica for the native Caribbeans in 1903. Today, there are only 3000 Caribs remaining after years of brutal treatment by the Spanish, French and English. They live in eight villages, and they elect their own chief. On the east side of the island, the descendants of the Caribs continued to practise their time-honoured culture and crafts of canoe building and basket weaving. Their society, however, has developed and modernised. The Amerindians' influence remains on the island through their artifacts and the sounds of modern language. For example, the word hurricane originated from the Amerindian word huracan. Other settlers When Christopher Columbus passed by the island he did give Dominica its name, but left no other settlers on the island. It would be years before English and French settlers came to the island. These two European superpowers fought relentlessly for the island, and their cultures each took hold. However, African slaves have also left an indelible mark on the island. French influences include the island's native language, Creole, food, and many location names. The British government won the island, and the influences of government as well as the official language are distinctly theirs. Africans also influenced the Creole and food, as well as the distinctive local style of dress. Carnival Good Hope Black Devils jumping up in Roseau Carnival 2006 A Dominican Carnival costume band Chant√© mas (masquerade song) and Lapo kabwit is a form of Carnival music of Dominica. It is performed by masquerading partygoers in a two-day parade, in a call-and- response format call \\"lavw√©\\", with a lead female singer or \\"chantw√®l\\" dancing backwards in front of the drummer on a tambou l√©l√©. The Carnival has African and French roots and is otherwise known as Mas Dominik, the most original Carnival in the Caribbean. Dominica's carnival is known to be the most original and least commercialized giving the carnival its name the original mas The chant√© mas tradition started to become dominated by imported calypso and steel pan music in the early 1960s. After a fire in 1963, the traditional carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Calypso appealed to Carnival partygoers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of chant√© mas, despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation that contrast sharply with traditional Dominican Mas Domnik music. Though the traditional Chant√© mas and Lapo kabrit declined in popularity due to imported calypso and steel pan music, several villages on Dominica, such as Grand Bay, has preserved the unique Dominican tradition. On modern Dominica, Chant√© mas and lapo kabrit has become a part of bouyon music. Each year, Dominicans celebrate the Catholic Carnival, a festival held for three days before Ash Wednesday. Due to the country's French heritage, a majority of citizens are Catholic, but many non-Catholics also celebrate Carnival. Activities include the Calypso Monarch Competition, Carnival Queen Pageant, and Carnival parades and parties. Music Music and dance are important facets of Dominica's culture. The annual independence celebrations show an outburst of traditional song and dance preceded since 1997 by weeks of Creole expressions such as \\"Creole in the Park\\" and the \\"World Creole Music Festival\\". Dominica gained prominence on the international music stage when in 1973, Gordon Henderson founded the group Exile One and an original musical genre that he coined \\"Cadence-lypso\\", which paved the way (for example BTS paved the way for k-pop )for modern Creole music. The 11th annual World Creole Music Festival was the first activity held there since its completion on 27 October 2007, part of the island's celebration of independence from Great Britain on 3 November. A year-long reunion celebration began in January 2008 marking 30 years of independence. Cuisine Dominica's cuisine is similar to that of other Caribbean islands, particularly Trinidad and St Lucia. Like other Commonwealth Caribbean islands, Dominicans have developed a distinct twist to their cuisine. Breakfast is an important daily meal, typically including saltfish, dried and salted codfish, and \\"bakes,\\" fried dough. Saltfish and bakes are combined for a fast food snack that can be eaten throughout the day; vendors on Dominica's streets sell these snacks to passersby, together with fried chicken, fish and fruit and yogurt \\"smoothies\\". Other breakfast meals include cornmeal porridge, which is made with fine cornmeal or polenta, milk and condensed milk and sugar to sweeten. Traditional British-influenced dishes, such as eggs, bacon and toast, are also popular, as are fried fish and plantains. Common vegetables include Plantain, Tania (a root vegetable), Yam, Potato, rice and peas. Meat and poultry typically eaten include chicken (which is very popular), beef, and fish. These are often prepared in stews with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs like thyme. The vegetables and meat are browned to create a rich dark sauce. Popular meals include rice and peas, brown stew chicken, stew beef, fried and stewed fish, and many different types of hearty fish broths and soups. These are filled with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions. Religion in Dominica Churches in Roseau, Dominica According to the 2001 population and housing census, approximately 61 percent of Dominica's population is Roman Catholic.International Religious Freedom Report 2008: Dominica. U.S. Department of State (2008). Followers of evangelical churches represent 18 percent of the population, Seventh-day Adventists 6 percent, and Methodists 3.7 percent. Minority religious groups and denominations, whose members range from 1.6 percent to 0.2 percent of the population, include Rastafarians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Anglicans, and Muslims. According to the census, 1.4 percent of the population belongs to \\"other\\" religious groups, including Baptist, Nazarene, Church of Christ, Brethren Christian, and the Baha'i Faith; 6 percent of the population claims no religious affiliation. The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and other laws and policies contributes to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The Government generally respects religious freedom in practice. In 2008, the U.S. government received no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice. The music and culture of Dominica and the French Antilles Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc was a French trader and adventurer in the Caribbean, who established the first permanent French colony, Saint-Pierre, on the island of Martinique in 1635. Belain sailed to the Caribbean in 1625, hoping to establish a French settlement on the island of St. Christopher (St. Kitts). In 1626 he returned to France, where he won the support of Cardinal Richelieu to establish French colonies in the region. Richelieu became a shareholder in the Compagnie de Saint- Christophe, created to accomplish this with d'Esnambuc at its head. The company was not particularly successful and Richelieu had it reorganized as the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique. In 1635 d'Esnambuc sailed to Martinique with one hundred French settlers to clear land for sugarcane plantations. After six months on Martinique, d'Esnambuc returned to St. Christopher, where he soon died prematurely in 1636, leaving the company and Martinique in the hands of his nephew, Du Parquet. His nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, inherited d'Esnambuc's authority over the French settlements in the Caribbean. In 1637, His nephew Jacques Dyel du Parquet became governor of the island. He remained in Martinique and did not concern himself with the other islands. The French permanently settled on Martinique and Guadeloupe after being driven off Saint Kitts and Nevis (Saint-Christophe in French) by the British. Fort Royal (Fort-de-France) on Martinique was a major port for French battleships in the region from which the French were able to explore the region. In 1638, Jacques Dyel du Parquet (1606-1658), nephew of Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc and first governor of Martinique, decided to have Fort Saint Louis built to protect the city against enemy attacks. From Fort Royal, Martinique, Du Parquet proceeded south in search for new territories and established the first settlement in St. Lucia in 1643, and headed an expedition that established a French settlement in Grenada in 1649. Despite the long history of British rule, Grenada's French heritage is still evidenced by the number of French loanwords in Grenadian Creole, French-style buildings, cuisine and places name (For ex. Petit Martinique, Martinique Channel, etc.) In 1642 the Compagnie des √éles de l'Am√©rique company received a twenty-year extension of its charter. The King would name the Governor General of the company, and the company the Governors of the various islands. However, by the late 1640s, in France Mazarin had little interest in colonial affairs and the company languished. In 1651 it dissolved itself, selling its exploitation rights to various parties. The du Paquet family bought Martinique, Grenada, and Saint Lucia for 60,000 livres. The sieur d'Houel bought Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, La Desirade and the Saintes. The Knights of Malta bought Saint Barth√©lemy and Saint Martin. In 1665, the Knights sold the islands they had acquired to the newly formed (1664) Compagnie des Indes occidentales. Dominica is a former French and British colony in the Eastern Caribbean, located about halfway between the French islands of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique (to the south). Christopher Columbus named the island after the day of the week on which he spotted it, a Sunday (domingo in Latin), 3 November 1493. In the hundred years after Columbus's landing, Dominica remained isolated. At the time it was inhabited by the Island Caribs, or Kalinago people, and over time more settled there after being driven from surrounding islands, as European powers entered the region. In 1690, French woodcutters from Martinique and Guadeloupe begin to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood and gradually become permanent settlers. France had a colony for several years, they imported slaves from West Africa, Martinique and Guadeloupe to work on its plantations. In this period, the Antillean Creole language developed. France formally ceded possession of Dominica to Great Britain in 1763. Great Britain established a small colony on the island in 1805. As a result, Dominica speak English as an official language while Antillean creole is spoken as a secondary language and is well maintained due to its location between the French-speaking departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique. In Trinidad, the Spanish who were in possession of the island, contributed little towards advancements, with El Dorado the focus, Trinidad was perfect due to its geographical location. Because Trinidad was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, was able to obtain a C√©dula de Poblaci√≥n from the Spanish king Charles III on 4 November 1783. Following the cedula of population French planters with their slaves, free coloureds and mulattos from the French Antilles of Martinique, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica migrated to the Trinidad. They too added to the ancestry of Trinidadians, creating the creole identity; Spanish, French, and Patois were the languages spoken. The Spanish also gave many incentives to lure settlers to the island, including exemption from taxes for ten years and land grants in accordance to the terms set out in the Cedula. These new immigrants establishing local communities of Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, Paramin, Cascade, Carenage and Laventille. Trinidad's population jumped to over 15,000 by the end of 1789, from just under 1,400 in 1777. In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population. This exodus was encouraged due to the French Revolution. Carnival had arrived with the French, indentured laborers and the slaves, who could not take part in Carnival, formed their own, parallel celebration called canboulay (from the French cannes brul√©es, meaning burnt cane) ‚Äî the precursor for Trinidad's carnival and has played an important role in the development of Trinidad's culture. During the carnival season, the slaves performed songs in tents called Kaiso ‚Äî later Calypso tents. Many early kaiso or calypso were performed in the French creole language and led by a griot or chantwell. As Trinidad became a British colony, the chantwell became known as the calypsonian. The British government tried to ban the celebration of carnival due to its aggressive overtone; this led to canboulay Riots between the Afro-creoles and the police, which banned the use of Stick fighting and African percussion music in 1881. They were replaced by bamboo \\"Bamboo-Tamboo\\" sticks beaten together, which were themselves banned in turn. In 1937 they reappeared, transformed as an orchestra of frying pans, dustbin lids and oil drums. These steelpans or pans are now a major part of the Trinidadian music scene. Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including canboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. The French brought Carnival to Trinidad, and calypso competitions at Carnival grew in popularity, especially after the abolition of slavery in 1834. From Trinidad, the carnival, calypso and steel pan spread to the entire English speaking Caribbean islands. Calypso in the Caribbean includes a range of genres, including: the Benna genre of Antiguan and Barbudan music; Mento, a style of Jamaican folk music that greatly influenced ska and reggae; Ska, the precursor to rocksteady and reggae; Spouge, a style of Barbadian popular music. In Dominica, the chant√© mas and lapo kabwit tradition started to become dominated by imported calypso and steel pan music in the early 1960s. After a fire in 1963, the traditional carnival was banned, though calypso and steelpan continued to grow in popularity. Calypso appealed to Carnival partygoers because the lyrical focus on local news and gossip was similar to that of chant√© mas, despite a rhythmic pattern and instrumentation which contrast sharply with traditional Dominican \\"Mas Domnik\\" music. Many of the traditional chant√© mas (masquerade songs) were performed to the calypso beat and later the new reggae beat coming out of Jamaica. Calypsonians and Calypso Monarch competitions emerged and became extremely popular. Steelbands emerged all around Dominica and the rest of the Caribbean islands. Calypso music has been popular in Dominica since the 1950s; the first Calypso King was crowned in 1959. Bands such as Swinging Stars, The Gaylords, De Boys an Dem, Los Caballeros and Swinging Busters surfaced and began to cut records. The emergence of radio, first WIDBS and later Radio Dominica helped to spread the music. In the 1960s, a number of Haitian musicians to the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) brought with them the kadans (another word named for the genre \\"compas\\"), a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. Webert Sicot, the originator of cadence recorded three LPs albums with French Antilles producers: two with \\"Celini disques\\" in Guadeloupe and one with \\"Balthazar\\" in Martinique. Haitian compas or cadence bands were asked to integrate Antillean musicians. Consequently, the leading \\"Les Guais troubadours\\", with influential singer Louis Lahens, among other bands, played a very important role in the schooling of Antilleans to the m√©ringue compas or kadans music style. Almost all existing Haitian compas bands have toured these islands that have since adopted the music and the dance of the meringue. These were followed by French Antillean mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe. In 1969, Gordon Henderson of Dominica decided that the French Overseas Department of Guadeloupe had everything he needed to begin a career in Creole music. From there, lead singer Gordon Henderson went on to found a kadans fusion band, the Vikings of Guadeloupe ‚Äì of which Kassav's co-founder Pierre-Eduard Decimus was a member. At some point he felt that he should start his own group and asked a former school friend Fitzroy Williams to recruit a few Dominicans to complete those he had already selected. The group was named Exile One. The band added various Caribbean styles to their musical identity such as reggae, calypso and mostly cadence or compas as the band moved to Guadeloupe. In 1973, Exile One (based on the island of Guadeloupe) initiated a fusion of cadence and calypso \\"Cadence-lypso\\" that would later influence the creation of soca music. The Trinidadian Calypso and Haitian kadans or m√©ringue were the two dominants music styles of Dominica so Exile One, that featured calypso, reggae and mostly kadans or compas, called its music Cadence-lypso however, most of the bands repertoire was kadans. Later in 1975, Lord Shorty of Trinidad visited his good friend Maestro in Dominica where he stayed (at Maestro's house) for a month while they visited and worked with local kadans artists. You had Maestro experimenting with calypso and cadence (\\"cadence-lypso\\"). Sadly a year later Maestro would die in an accident in Dominica and his loss was palpably felt by Shorty, who penned \\"Higher World\\" as a tribute. In Dominica, Shorty had attended an Exile One performance of cadence-lypso, and collaborated with Dominica's 1969 Calypso King, Lord Tokyo and two calypso lyricists, Chris Seraphine and Pat Aaron in the early 1970s, who wrote him some kw√©y√≤l lyrics. Soon after Shorty released a song, \\"Ou Petit\\", with words such as \\"Ou dee moin ou petit Shorty\\" (meaning \\"you told me you are small Shorty\\"), a combination of calypso, cadence and kw√©y√≤l. Soca's development includes its fusion of calypso, cadence, and Indian musical instruments‚Äîparticularly the dholak, tabla and dhantal‚Äîas demonstrated in Shorty's classic compositions \\"√èndrani\\" and \\"Shanti Om\\". Due to the popularity of Exile One, There was a virtual explosion of kadans bands from Dominica - Grammacks, Liquid Ice, Midnight Groovers, Black Affairs, Black Machine, Mantra, Belles Combo, Milestone, Wafrikai, Black roots, Black Blood, Naked Feet and Mammouth among others. Leading vocalists of the period include Gordon Henderson, Jeff Joseph, Marcel \\"Chubby\\" Marc, Anthony Gussie, Mike Moreau, Tony Valmond, Linford John, Bill Thomas, SinkyRabess and Janet Azouz among others. Dominican kadans bands became popular in Martinique, Guadeloupe, Haiti and other islands in the Caribbean and Africa. The full-horn section kadans band Exile One led by Gordon Henderson was the first to introduce the newly arrived synthesizers to their music that other young cadence or m√©ringue bands from Haiti (mini-jazz) and the French Antilles emulated in the 1970s. Gordon Henderson's Exile One turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands with a full-horn section and the newly arrived synthesizers, paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks, Experience 7, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup Kassav' invented zouk and popularized it in the 1980s. Kassav' was formed in 1979 by Pierre-Edouard D√©cimus and Paris studio musician Jacob F. Desvarieux. Together and under the influence of well-known Dominican and Guadeloupean kadans-lypso or compas bands like Experience 7, Grammacks, Exile One and Les Aiglons they decided to make Guadeloupean carnival music recording it in a more fully orchestrated yet modern and polished style. Kassav' created its own style \\"zouk\\" by introducing an 11-piece gwo ka unit and two lead singers, tambour b√©l√©, ti bwa, biguine, cadence-lypso: calypso and mostly Cadence rampa or compas with full use of the MIDI technology. Kassav was the first band in the Caribbean to apply the MIDI technology to their music. In the 1980s they took Caribbean music to another level by recording in the new digital format. The style lost ground in the late 1980s due to the strong presence of cadence or compas, the main music of the French Antilles. A special style within the zouk is \\"zouk love\\", characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The inspiration for the zouk love style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso ‚Äî Dominica cadence as popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems. The music kizomba from Angola and cola-zouk or cabo love from Cape Verde are derivatives of this French Antillean compas music style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie of Dominica. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa. In Brazil, the zouk rhythm is used to dance the Brazilian Lambada. Since the addition of many new steps changed the characteristics from Lambada, a new name was given to this dance \\"Zouk- lambada\\", which was originally called \\"zouk Love\\", later just \\"zouk\\". Today, the Brazilian Zouk has changed, and the name \\"Traditional Zouk\\" has been given to the dance that was first taught by Adilio and Renata in the beginning of the '90s, which is now didactically used all over the world. In the late '80s, the WCK or Windward Caribbean Kulture, was formed by a group of highly creative young Dominican musicians. The band heralded in a new and much needed resurgence of live music and created a new wave in Dominicas musical evolution. They began experimenting with a fusion of cadence-lypso, the native lapo kabwit drum rhythms and elements of the music of jing ping bands. This group came together to fill a void left by several of Dominica's most internationally recognized bands such as Exile One and Grammacks. While the Cadence-Lypso sound is based on the creative use of acoustic drums, an aggressive up-tempo guitar beat and strong social commentary in the native Creole language, the new sound created by WCK, focused more on the use of technology with a strong emphasis on keyboard rhythmic patterns. The band played a blend of the local Cadence-lypso and traditional Jing ping, chant√© mas and lapo kabwit rhythms, which would later be labelled \\"bouyon\\", a genre which they are credited with creating. Dominican-born Derick \\"Rah\\" Peters is considered to be one of the most influential figure in the development of the bouyon genre. Bouyon as popularized largely by the WCK band blends in jing ping, cadence-lypso, and traditional dances namely b√®l√®, quadrille, chant√© mas and lapo kabwit, mazurka, zouk and other styles of caribbean music. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Kw√©y√≤l. Bouyon music is popular across the Caribbean, and is known as \\"bouyon gwada\\" or jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. A popular offshoot within the bouyon gwada is call \\"bouyon hardcore\\", a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics. This musical style is characterized by texts \\"slackness\\" sexually explicit. It is a form of radicalized bouyon of Dominica. Some call it bouyon gwada (Guadeloupe bouyon) to mark its difference and its themes are often the same.

Many natural pocket beaches exist throughout the world. Artificial pocket beaches are usually constructed in areas where natural beaches are fairly narrow or absent. Examples of artificial pocket beaches include over 100 such systems on Chesapeake Bay in the United States, each consisting of several individual pocket beaches; the Fisher Key, Florida project constructed on a dredge spoil island originally consisting of cobble dredge material; and the Fred Howard Park Beach that was constructed offshore of a muddy mangrove shoreline.

The original diocese is traditionally thought to have been created in the 3rd century by St. Denis and corresponded with the Civitas Parisiorum; it was elevated to an archdiocese on October 20, 1622. Before that date the bishops were suffragan to the archbishops of Sens. History Its suffragan dioceses, created in 1966 and encompassing the √éle- de-France region, are in Cr√©teil (Val-de-Marne), √âvry-Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), Meaux (Seine-et-Marne), Nanterre (Hauts-de-Seine), Pontoise (Val-d'Oise), Saint-Denis (Seine-Saint-Denis), and Versailles (Yvelines). Its liturgical centre is at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. The archbishop resides on rue Barbet de Jouy in the 6th arrondissement, but there are diocesan offices in rue de la Ville-Eveque, rue St. Bernard and in other areas of the city. The archbishop is ordinary for Eastern Catholics (except Armenians and Ukrainians) in France. The title of Duc de Saint-Cloud was created in 1674 for the archbishops. Prior to 1790 the diocese was divided into three archdeaconries: France, Hurepoix, Brie. Until the creation of new dioceses in 1966 there were two archdeaconries: Madeleine and St. S√©verin. The churches of the current diocese can be divided into several categories: i) Latin Church parishes. These are grouped into deaneries and subject to vicars-general who often coincide with auxiliary bishops. ii) Churches belonging to religious communities. iii) Chapels for various foreign communities using various languages. iv) Eastern-Church parishes and communities throughout France dependent on the Archbishop as Ordinary of the Ordinariate of France, Faithful of Eastern Rites.

He is best known as one of the early popularizers of Neo-Hindu spiritualism in western esotericism, notably via his bestselling A Search in Secret India (1934) which has been translated into over 20 languages. Brunton was a proponent of a doctrine of \\"Mentalism\\", or Oriental Mentalism to distinguish it from subjective idealism of the western tradition. Brunton expounds his doctrine of Mentalism in The Hidden Teaching Beyond Yoga (1941, new ed. 2015 North Atlantic Books), The Wisdom of the Overself (1943, new ed. 2015 North Atlantic Books) and in the posthumous publication of The Notebooks of Paul Brunton in 16 volumes (Larson Publications, 1984‚Äì88). Biography Hurst was born in London in 1898. He served in a tank division during the First World War, and later devoted himself to mysticism and came into contact with Theosophists. He married Karen Augusta Tuttrup in 1921, with whom he had a son, Kenneth Thurston Hurst (b. 1923). After his wife had an affair with his friend Leonard Gill, the marriage ended in divorce in 1926, but Hurst remained on friendly terms with his ex-wife and with Gill. He was a bookseller and journalist, and wrote under various pseudonyms, including Raphael Meriden and Raphael Delmonte. Being partner of an occult bookshop, The Atlantis Bookshop, in Bloomsbury, Hurst came into contact with both the literary and occult British intelligentsia of the 1920s. In 1930, Hurst embarked on a voyage to India, which brought him into contact with Meher Baba, Vishuddhananda Paramahansa, Paramacharya of Kancheepuram and Ramana Maharshi. At the Paramacharya's insistence, he met Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, which led to a turn of events culminating in revealing Ramana to the western world. Hurst's first visit to Sri Ramana's ashram took place in 1931. During this visit, Hurst was accompanied by a Buddhist bhikshu, formerly a military officer but meanwhile known as Swami Prajnananda, the founder of the English ashram in Rangoon. Hurst asked several questions, including \\"What is the way to God-realization?\\" and Maharshi said: \\"Vichara, asking yourself the 'Who am I?' enquiry into the nature of your Self.\\"Description of the visit and reproduction of one of the dialogues with the Maharshi, done from rough notes Paul Brunton was the pseudonym under which A Search in Secret India was published in 1934. The book became a bestseller, and Hurst afterwards stuck to publishing under this name. Brunton has been credited with introducing Ramana Maharshi to the West through his books A Search in Secret India and The Secret Path. One day‚Äîsitting with Ramana Maharshi‚ÄîBrunton had an experience which Steve Taylor names \\"an experience of genuine enlightenment which changed him forever\\". Brunton describes it in the following way: Brunton was in India during World War II, as a guest of the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV.Jeffrey M. Masson (1999), Der Guru meines Vaters, Eine Kindheit mit Paul Brunton, Berlin, Theseus, , p. 25Annie Cahn Fung, Paul Brunton A Bridge Between India and the West, Part I: Genesis of a Quest, Chapter 3: In Mysore He dedicated his book The Quest of the Overself to the Maharaja and when the Maharaja died in 1940, he was present at his funeral.\\"Notebooks of Paul Brunton, Category 15: The Orient\\", Chapter 2, p.453 Brunton was critical of Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement: In the 1940s and 1950s, Brunton occasionally stayed as a guest, for a few weeks at a time, about six months total, with the parents of controversial American author and former psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson. In 1956, Brunton decided that a third world war was imminent and the Massons moved to Montevideo, since this location was considered safe. From Uruguay, Masson went with Brunton's encouragement to study Sanskrit at Harvard. Brunton himself did not move to South America, instead spending some time living in New Zealand. In 1993, Masson wrote a critical account of Brunton titled My Father's Guru: A Journey Through Spirituality and Disillusion.\\"In 1963, after several years of travelling and living in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, Brunton withdrew to the serenity of the Swiss Alps.\\" Adyar online. In the 1950s, Brunton retired from publishing books and devoted himself to writing essays and notes. Upon his death in 1981 in Vevey, Switzerland, it was noted that in the period since the last published book in 1952, he had rendered about 20,000 pages of philosophical writing. A longtime friend of Brunton's, philosopher Anthony Damiani, founded Wisdom's Goldenrod Center for Philosophic Studies in 1972. Swedish publisher Robert Larson helped to start Larson Publications (USA) which completed the publication of the 16-volume set of The Notebooks of Paul Brunton in 1988. Brunton's son Kenneth Hurst helped form the Paul Brunton Philosophic Foundation which continues to publish and archive Paul Brunton's literary legacy.

Segu√≠ was a forkball specialist who was the 1970 American League ERA leader.Baseball Historian Professional baseball career Segu√≠ was born in Holgu√≠n, Cuba. In 1970 with Oakland, Segu√≠ won 10 games as a reliever and starter, while leading the American League pitchers with a 2.56 ERA. On June 7, 1972, he was traded by St. Louis along with Reggie Cleveland and Terry Hughes to the Red Sox in exchange for John Curtis, Lynn McGlothen and Mike Garman. Segu√≠ in 1961 Segu√≠ holds the unique distinction of having pitched for both of Seattle's major league baseball teams, the Pilots and the Mariners, in the first game ever played by each franchise. In these contests, he earned a save for the Pilots in 1969, and absorbed the opening-day loss for the Mariners in 1977. His most productive season came in 1969 for the Pilots, when he posted career-highs in wins (12) and saves (6), against only six losses. At the end of the season, his teammates voted him the Pilots' Most Valuable Player. After he started the Mariners' inaugural game in 1977, he was dubbed \\"the Ancient Mariner,\\" and, although he set a Mariner single-game record with 10 strikeouts early in the season on May 5, he failed to get a win the rest of the way. After compiling a 0‚Äì7 record with a 5.69 ERA, he was released at the end of the season. Segu√≠ continued pitching in the Mexican League for another 10 years, tossing a no-hitter for the Cafeteros de C√≥rdoba during the 1978 season.

It is exclusively heritable, and is found in only a few families all over the world (according to NINDS). It is, however, classified with the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) due to the causative role played by PRNP, the human prion protein. GSS was first reported by the Austrian physicians Josef Gerstmann, Ernst Str√§ussler and Ilya Scheinker in 1936. Familial cases are associated with autosomal-dominant inheritance. Certain symptoms are common to GSS, such as progressive ataxia, pyramidal signs, and even adult-onset dementia; they progress more as the disease progresses. Symptoms Symptoms start with slowly developing dysarthria (difficulty speaking) and cerebellar truncal ataxia (unsteadiness) and then the progressive dementia becomes more evident. Loss of memory can be the first symptom of GSS. Extrapyramidal and pyramidal symptoms and signs may occur and the disease may mimic spinocerebellar ataxias in the beginning stages. Myoclonus (spasmodic muscle contraction) is less frequently seen than in Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease. Many patients also exhibit nystagmus (involuntary movement of the eyes), visual disturbances, and even blindness or deafness. The neuropathological findings of GSS include widespread deposition of amyloid plaques composed of abnormally folded prion protein. Four clinical phenotypes are recognised: typical GSS, GSS with areflexia and paresthesia, pure dementia GSS and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-like GSS.Tesar A, Matej R, Kukal J, Johanidesova S, Rektorova I, Vyhnalek M, Keller J, Eliasova I, Parobkova E, Smetakova M, Musova Z, Rusina R (2019) Clinical variability in P102L Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Scheinker Syndrome. Ann Neurol Causes GSS is one of a small number of diseases that are caused by prions, a class of pathogenic proteins highly resistant to proteases. A change in codon 102 from proline to leucine has been found in the prion protein gene (PRNP, on chromosome 20) of most affected individuals. Therefore, it appears this genetic change is usually required for the development of the disease. Diagnosis GSS can be identified through genetic testing. Testing for GSS involves a blood and DNA examination in order to attempt to detect the mutated gene at certain codons. If the genetic mutation is present, the patient will eventually be afflicted by GSS, and, due to the genetic nature of the disease, the offspring of the patient are predisposed to a higher risk of inheriting the mutation. Treatment There is no cure for GSS, nor is there any known treatment to slow the progression of the disease. However, therapies and medication are aimed at treating or slowing down the effects of the symptoms. Their goal is to try to improve the patient's quality of life as much as possible. The only treatment, which appears to be able to stop the disease, is being tested at the Medical Research Center in London. It is the monoclonal antibody PRN100. https://www.curecjd.org/prion-diseases Prognosis Duration of illness can range from three months to 13 years with an average duration of five or six years. Research GSS is very rare, making its history hard to track exactly where it descended from. In 1989, the first mutation of the prion protein gene was identified in a GSS family (Elsevier Science, 2002). Prion diseases (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) are degenerative diseases of the brain thought to be caused by a protein that converts to an abnormal form called a prion (Gambetti Pierluigi, 2013). GSS was later realized to have many different gene mutation types, with some showing different symptoms first or having other symptoms worse than others. Doctors in different parts of the world are uncovering more generations and families that have the mutation. It is hard to discover GSS for two main reasons: (1) the disease has been reported in only a few countries; and (2) the disease may be underreported due to its clinical similarity to other diseases (Ghetti B, et al., 2003). The Indiana Kindred is the largest, spanning over 8 generations, and includes over 3,000 people with 57 individuals known to be affected (B. Ghetti, et al., 1996).

The first V-twin entry for Crocker had a 61 in¬≥ (1,000 cc) \\"Hemi Head\\" producing 55-60 hp, exceeding the horsepower produced of both the Indian and Harley of the day (38-40 hp). Many Crockers were manufactured to order, with the 91+ cubic inch (about 1,491 cc) being the largest capacity production motorcycle of the time. When production ceased in 1942, approximately 100 of the V-twins had been produced in all. The remaining inventory of parts were sold in 1947 to Elmo Looper. Many of these parts went into restorations of the surviving examples, of which at least 68 exist today, according to a registry started by Charles \\"Chuck\\" Vernon and Johnny Eagles, two members of a group of original Crocker owners in Southern California. Although total production of all models is not known, it is thought by some to be around 200 units (about 40‚Äì50 speedway, 40‚Äì50 \\"Scootabout\\" scooters, and 100+ V-Twins). Al Crocker also produced an overhead valve conversion kit in the late 1920s for the Indian 101 \\"Scout\\". The proprietor and founder of the company, Albert Crocker, ceased motorcycle production in 1942 when the war effort put a shortage on critical materials. Indian and Harley received contracts with the US Army for military motorcycle production and Crocker received a contract with Douglas Aircraft making aircraft parts. That became a more lucrative business for Al Crocker than motorcycle manufacturing, and in 1942 Crocker Motorcycle became Crocker Manufacturing. Crocker later sold out to a company named Borg Warner. Al Crocker died in 1961. Designer of many of the components, Paul Bigsby, went on to fame as a designer of guitars and particularly of the Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. Crockers are among the most expensive motorcycles. At the MidAmerica Auctions motorcycle auction in January 2007 in Las Vegas, a 1941 Crocker big tank motorcycle sold for $230,000.

Its name is often shortened to Superstore. Originating in Western Canada in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the banner expanded into Ontario in the early 2000s as Loblaw attempts to fend off competition from department stores including U.S.-based Walmart. Loblaw has tested alternative banners at some locations in Ontario, with some labelled as \\"Loblaw Superstore\\", and a few others as simply \\"Superstore\\"; for a time this was reflected in the chain's marketing which used a separate logo to advertise all of these banners. The company has since reverted to marketing the entire chain as Real Canadian Superstore, although some locations might retain other signage. Overview 250x250px Logo used until 2005 Logo previously used in advertising in Ontario; generic type for both Loblaw Superstore and Real Canadian Superstore The stores carry a variety of goods, but the vast majority of space is devoted to groceries and about a third of each store is set aside for electronics, housewares, and clothing. Items in the latter two categories are mainly from Loblaw's private labels, such as President's Choice, Life at Home, or Joe Fresh. As with many Loblaw stores, they offer corporate-branded services such as PhotoLab photo finishing and DrugStore pharmacies. Many outlets also boast a GoodLife Fitness club, drive-through pharmacies, Mobil gas bars, photo studios, community rooms, as well as walk-in medical clinics managed by Primacy Medical. Loblaws is working to cut costs and compete effectively with this multi-format store. Each store has a similar layout, useful for both cost efficiency and shopper ease. Also, in an effort to cater to individual customer segments, Superstore buys specific products for different regions. Superstore locations now top . In the west, Superstores are operated by Loblaw subsidiary Westfair Foods Ltd. Ontario stores are operated as part of Loblaw's other banners, including Loblaws and Zehrs, although Superstore is considered a separate chain, and prices at one chain may not apply at the other. Loblaw is centralizing its head office operations, which includes the relocation of the General Merchandise personnel from Calgary, Alberta to Brampton, Ontario to consolidate operations. In Alberta, where private liquor retailing is permitted, a chain of 30 Real Canadian Liquorstores operate, mostly in proximity to Real Canadian Superstore locations in the province. Employees of Loblaws and the Real Canadian Superstore are members of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union. History The first Real Canadian Superstore location opened in March 1979 in a former Loblaws location in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan under the name SuperValu. Numerous other SuperValu locations opened across Western Canada before most gradually expanded into Superstore sites; the SuperValu name is still in use in British Columbia and the Maritimes, the latter branded as Atlantic SuperValu. The similarly named The Real Superstore was used in the United States from the 1970s up until the mid-1990s by the Loblaws-owned National Supermarkets chain until the chain was purchased by competitor Schnucks. Superstore marks the return of Loblaw's superstore format in the Greater Toronto Area after the unsuccessful launch of the SuperCentre format in the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 21st century, Loblaw brought the Superstore banner to Ontario as a response to the introduction of large grocery sections in most Canadian Wal-Mart stores and other department stores, and as a pre-emptive strike against any plans by Wal-Mart to bring its \\"Supercenter\\" format to Canada. Originally, Ontario stores were co-branded with the local Loblaw banner (i.e., \\"Loblaws - The Real Canadian Superstore\\"), but most shortened their name to reduce confusion and allow separate weekly specials for each chain. New Ontario locations began to open under the name Loblaw Superstore in late 2007. Since December 2008, Ontario stores have used common flyers displaying a combined \\"Superstore: Loblaw/Real Canadian\\" logo.Superstore Ontario website, accessed December 8, 2008, However, Loblaw has not yet said whether one banner will eventually replace the other. Relationship with other Loblaw banners There are no Superstore locations as such in Atlantic Canada or Quebec. However, in recent years, and particularly since 2008, Atlantic Superstore in the Maritimes and Dominion in Newfoundland and Labrador, both also owned by Loblaw, have adopted similar store formats and a similar marketing approach to RCSS. In Quebec, Maxi and Co. and some larger Provigo (previously Loblaws) locations fill the void. It is not clear whether Loblaw intends to eventually rebrand these stores to create a national \\"Superstore\\" chain. As well, there are a handful of large- format Loblaws and Zehrs stores in Ontario ‚Äì including certain locations in Markham and Kitchener ‚Äì which closely replicate the selection of food and general merchandise available at Superstores. Most of these locations were built around the same time as the first Ontario Superstores, but nevertheless chose to use older brand names.

Alternatively, businessdictionary.com defines an action plan as a \\"sequence of steps that must be taken, or activities that must be performed well, for a strategy to succeed\\".  Process  = Origin = An action plan is a tool in social planning. It is an organizational strategy to identify necessary steps towards a goal. It considers details, may help limit setting for an organization, and is efficient in that it saves resources over trial and error. A written action plan also serves as a token for an organization's accountability. = Setting goals = A goal is the primary objective of an action plan. Setting goals gives the possibility of your dreams and prospects being brought to life. It creates motivation and provides you with a certainty that the final outcome will be worthwhile, preventing any wasted time and effort. This is achieved by being fully dedicated to the process and using the structured guide to accomplishing it. Although hard work may be produced, without a successful end goal the ideal result you set to achieve, will not prevail. = Creation = When creating action plans there are guided steps that need to be followed to ensure success, however the structure can be altered in the process. Firstly, you will need to outline what you want to achieve from the project, by doing this you set yourself targets. After this the specific roles will need to be allocated ensuring sufficient amount of training, resources and issues have been considered to ensure solving any problems that may occur. The next stage allows members of the group to analyse the progress by outlining milestones, solving any issues and making any necessary changes. Lastly once the project has come to an end the final stage can be examined to ensure future success. = Execution = Mike Desjardins has suggested the following *Ownership: one person must be responsible and accountable for tracing the progress, keeping team informed, ensuring timely action steps are occurring and adjusting the actions. *Action steps should be clear and actionable versus vague ideas or thoughts. *Responsibility: each action step needs to have one person responsible. *Support: For each action step, determine who will support the person responsible. This can be multiple people. The key is that they're not responsible for the action or outcome. *Informed: keeping the right people in the communication loop for each action is critically important. Key people might need to understand the state of progress around your actions to see how they affect other actions and objectives. *Metrics and budget: each action step must have a metric that tells us that the action is complete. For example, if you needed to survey your customers and don't have the internal resources to run the survey or want to protect anonymity, using an outside resource will require money that might not be included in your current operating budget. *Milestone date: date the action step needs to begin *Completion date  Context  = Advantages = Producing an action plan can be beneficial not only for individual basis but also for businesses. For example, it allows project managers or any member of a group to monitor their progress and take each task step-by-step, therefore allowing them to handle the project efficiently. The advantage of doing this is, it allows you to execute a structured plan for the end goal you intend to achieve. Furthermore, it provides the team with appropriate foundations, therefore prioritising the amount of time you spend on each task. This will then prevent any sidetracking that may occur. Lastly, it creates a bond within a team, as each member is aware of their individual role, as well as providing necessary information to ensure success of the project. = Issues = When using action plans limitations will need to be considered. Firstly, each member of the team will need to be allocated individual roles and tasks which will require completion by a set date. This can be demanding for some, due to coping with the stress and distractions that may occur. Another issue is not being guided thoroughly and effectively, leading to the lack of effort and passion a member has for the project. In addition to this, if the communication throughout the team is non-existent, key information will not reach members of the group, causing lack of confidence. Lastly failing to obtain the goal you set to reach can lead to frustration and in turn the planning would have been a waste of time. There can be more addition to this article. = Risk management = To benefit from risk management action plans, you need to examine certain possibilities that could affect the process, such as observing any threats and correcting them. For example, key aspects of risk management are to ensure you allocate members specific roles and monitor the risks throughout, to ensure tasks are completed with efficiency. This being a major factor, as evaluating what happens during and after the project, will allow finding the positive and negative elements of each stage in the planning, providing you the ability to develop on the risks further.  Examples  = European Union = Some European Union directives describe action plans in order to reach a defined target in air quality or noise reduction. If the target cannot be reached by a member state, the member needs to write a report. Sometimes action plans contain deadlines by which the plan must be ready to start the action(s) and the targets are to be reached.

In the northern, deglaciated regions, it can sometimes be quick clay, which is notorious for being involved in landslides. Marine clay is a particle of soil that is dedicated to a particle size class, this is usually associated with USDA's classification with sand at 0.05mm, silt at 0.05-.002mm and clay being less than 0.002 mm in diameter. Paired with the fact this size of particle was deposited within a marine system involving the erosion and transportation of the clay into the ocean. Soil particles become suspended when in a solution with water, with sand being affected by the force of gravity first with suspended silt and clay still floating in solution. This is also known as turbidity, in which floating soil particles create a murky brown color to a water solution. These clay particles are then transferred to the abyssal plain in which they are deposited in high percentages of clay. A soil is only considered a clay if it has above 55% total clay content. This is due to the way in which the clay reacts to things like water, heat and other chemicals. Once the clay is deposited on the ocean floor it can change its structure through a process known as flocculation, process by which fine particulates are caused to clump together or floc. These can be either edge to edge flocculation or edge to face flocculation. Relating to individual clay particles interacting with each other. Clays can also be aggregated or shifted in their structure besides being flocculated. Clay particles can self-assemble into various configurations, each with totally different properties. This change in structure to the clay particles is due to a swap in cations with the basic structure of a clay particle. This basic structure of the clay particle is known as a silica tetrahedral or aluminum octahedral. They are the basic structure of clay particles composing of one cation, usually silica or aluminum surrounded by hydroxide anions, these particles form in sheets forming what we know as clay particles and have very specific properties to them including micro porosity which is the ability of clay to hold water against the force of gravity, shrink swell capacity and absorption capabilities. When clay is deposited in the ocean, the presence of excess ions in seawater causes a loose, open structure of the clay particles to form, a process known as flocculation. Once stranded and dried by ancient changing ocean levels, this open framework means that such clay is open to water infiltration. Construction in marine clays thus presents a geotechnical engineering challenge.\\"Overcoming Problems with Marine Clays\\", Fairfax County, Virginia Where clay overlies peat, a lateral movement of the coastline is indicated and shows a rise in relative sea level Swelling of marine clay has the potential to destroy building foundations in only a few years. Due to the changes in climatic conditions on the construction site, the pavement constructed on the marine clay (as subgrade) will have less durability and requires lot of maintenance cost. Some simple precautions, however, can reduce the hazard significantly . The swapping of this positive cation with another is what makes different types of clays including Kaolinite, montmorillonite, smectite and illite. This happens in marine clays because the ocean's water is high in solution with cations making it very easy to overcome the clays negative net charge and swap the clays cation with a less positive one. These marine clays can be what are known as quick clays, which are notorious for its erosive properties. A great example of these quick clays is in the pacific northwest. They are known as blue goo which is a mix of clay and m√©lange (greenstone, basalt, chert, shale, sandstone, schists. uplifted through the accretionary wedge). These quick clays have a very high-risk factor associated with them if they are built upon, as they are very unstable due to the fact that liquefaction happens when it becomes saturated and literally flows, causing mass wasting events to happen. Other marine clays are used all around the world for many different uses, such as ceramics, building material, including adobe. Clay layers in soils which can be used as an impermeable layer are very important for dumps or chemical spills as they have a very high absorption capacity for heavy metals. For these clays to be available for human use they must have been eroded, deposited on the ocean floor and then uplifted through means of tectonic activity to bring it to land. During the construction of Marina Barrage in Singapore, marine clay was found at the site. Since marine clay was the cause of the Nicoll Highway collapse years previous, the construction team removed all the marine clay to ensure the stability of Marina Barrage. Later on, they found marine clay mixed with seawater even in the deeper underground. Geotechnical problems posed by marine clay can be handled by various ground improvement techniques. Marine clay can be densified by mixing it with cement or similar binding material in specific proportions. Marine clay can be stabilised using wastes of various industries like porcelain industry and tree-cutting industries. This method is usually adopted in highways where marine clay is used as a subgrade soil.

Hull's resolution quickly faded. After deciding not to attack the British at Fort Amherstburg, he learned that Mackinac Island had been captured by the British and feared that many Indians would flock south from there to join the British. On 3 August, he retreated to American territory. Brig Gen William Hull sent a large detachment to escort a supply train back to Fort Detroit, after the initial detachment which was sent was defeated by British and First Nations troops. At the Miami Rapids, Captain Henry Brush's company of Ohio Volunteers were waiting with vital supplies for Hull's garrison, including 300 head of cattle and 70 packhorses each laden with 200 pounds of flour. On 4 August, British troops under Captain (local Major) Adam Muir of the 41st Regiment and Indians under Tecumseh and Roundhead defeated a detachment which Hull had sent to collect these supplies at the Battle of Brownstown. Hull sent a larger detachment under Lieutenant-Colonel James Miller to escort the supply train back to Detroit. The battle At Monguagon, Miller's command, comprising 280 regulars and more than 330 Ohio Volunteer troops, found their path barred by Adam Muir, with 205 British regulars, Canadian militia and Native American. As the Americans advanced into a heavy fire, things started to go wrong for the British. The Canadian author John Richardson was present as a volunteer and later wrote: Lt Col James Miller commanded American forces at Maguaga. Noticing some men creeping through the woods on their right, some of the redcoats thought it was the enemy trying to outflank them and opened fire on them. The \\"enemy\\" turned out to be Potawatomi warriors allied to the British under Chief Main Poc, who immediately thought that the people firing at them must be Americans. Briton and Native American blazed away at each other until the Potawatomi realized that they were fighting their own side and withdrew into the woods to the rear.Gilpin, p.101 Meanwhile, seeing the American advance waver, Muir ordered the bugler of the light company of the 41st Regiment to sound the charge. In the British Army, only the light infantry used the bugle; the rest of the infantry communicated using drumbeats. The officer commanding one of the other companies of the 41st Regiment thought that the bugle was sounding the \\"recall\\" and ordered his men to fall back. Before Muir knew what was happening, his whole force was streaming off to the rear. The Americans, who thought that the British were running from them, took heart and advanced over Muir's vacated position in pursuit of an enemy they thought they had routed. Miller advanced a good distance only to find that Muir had rallied his men and was standing, awaiting another attack. Miller, satisfied with his \\"victory\\", decided not to renew his assault. Miller's force had suffered 18 killed and 64 wounded. Muir recorded 3 killed, 13 wounded and 2 missing from the 41st Regiment; 1 killed and 2 wounded from the Canadian Militia and 2 killed and 6 wounded from the Native American contingent. The 2 men returned as \\"missing\\" were taken prisoner. The Americans later claimed to have taken thirty Indian scalps at the battle. At this point, Colonel Miller's nerve seems to have gone. His men had discarded their knapsacks at the beginning of the battle so that they could fight more effectively. Now, Miller refused to go back into the woods to retrieve the knapsacks in case the enemy were waiting there to ambush him. He camped in a large clearing and the next morning, he refused to continue the advance to the Rapids. Miller may have been shaken by the comparatively heavy casualties that his command had suffered. He clearly did not fancy another encounter with Muir. He was also very ill, and almost in a state of collapse. Unknown to Miller, Muir's detachment had long since retired to their boats and sailed back to Fort Malden, Amherstburg. For two days, Miller stayed bivouacked, ignoring repeated orders from Hull to resume his advance to the Rapids. Finally, Hull realized that Miller was not going to obey him, and ordered him to return to Detroit. Aftermath The Battle of Monguagon was characterized by a series of errors by both sides. The British routed themselves thanks to two misunderstandings, at least one of which could have been avoided through better training. The 41st Regiment had been stated to be \\"very sharp\\", but this probably indicated that their standards of discipline, administration and parade-ground drill were good. Like most British regiments, they were not trained in light infantry tactics or \\"bush warfare\\" (except for the Light company, and possibly the Grenadier company which was not present at Maguaga). Colonel Miller first wasted the tactical advantage that was given to him by the confusion within the British force, and then appears to have completely lost his nerve. James Miller's War of 1812 career ended in success and promotion to brigadier-general, thanks mainly to his capture of the British batteries at the Battle of Lundy's Lane. Nevertheless, in the wake of the Battle of Monguagon, he may have been fortunate to escape being court-martialled and cashiered. Miller's failure might have had dire consequences for the garrison of Detroit in the event of a sustained siege, when the supplies from the Miami Rapids would have been needed. In the event, Detroit surrendered to General Brock after a siege of only a few hours, so the absence of the extra food supplies was irrelevant. The only difference that the failure of Miller's expedition might have made was that Captain Brush's company and their supplies were not in Detroit to be captured. However, the terms of capitulation signed by General Hull included the garrison at the Rapids in the surrender agreement, and the British got the supplies anyway. Monguagon was the first encounter of the War of 1812 that was big enough to be called a \\"battle\\" even by the standards of this small-scale conflict. Three active battalions of the current 3rd Infantry (1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf and 4-3 Inf) perpetuate the lineage of the old 1st Infantry Regiment, which had a detachment at the Battle of Maguaga.

El √Ångel was built in 1910 during the presidency of Porfirio D√≠az by architect Antonio Rivas Mercado, to commemorate the centennial of the beginning of Mexico's War of Independence. In later years it was made into a mausoleum for the most important heroes of that war. It is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Mexico City, and it has become a focal point for both celebration and protest. It resembles the July Column in Paris, the Berlin Victory Column in Berlin and Columbus Circle in New York City. Description Nike on Column top The base of the column is quadrangular with each vertex featuring a bronze sculpture symbolizing law, war, justice and peace. Originally, nine steps led to the base, but due to the sinking of the ground, an ongoing problem in Mexico City, fourteen more steps have been added. On the main face of the base facing downtown Mexico City, an inscription reads La Naci√≥n a los H√©roes de la Independencia (\\"The Nation to the Heroes of Independence\\"). In front of this inscription is a bronze statue of a giant, laureled lion that guides a child, which symbolizes, according to Rivas Mercado, \\"the Mexican people, strong during war and docile during peace.\\" Next to the column is a group of marble statues of some of the heroes of the War of Independence. The column itself is high. The structure is made of steel covered with quarried stone decorated with garlands, palms and rings with the names of Independence figures. Inside the column is a two-hundred step staircase that leads to a viewpoint above the capital. The Corinthian- style capital is adorned by four eagles with extended wings from the Mexican coat of arms used at the time. Crowning the column is a statue by Enrique Alciati of Nike, the Greek goddess of Victory. Like other similar victory columns around the world, it is made of bronze covered with 24k gold (restored in 2006), and weighs seven tons. In her right hand the Angel, as it is commonly known, holds a laurel crown symbolically above both Miguel Hidalgo's head and the nation below, symbolizing Victory, while in her left she holds a broken chain, symbolizing Freedom. History Inauguration of the Independence Monument, 1910 The sculpture of the monument, having fallen after the 1957 Mexico earthquake. Construction of the column of independence topped by a depiction of winged victory was ordered in 1900 by President Porfirio D√≠az. Antonio Rivas Mercado began to design the monument, envisioned as a column with both classical and modern elements, with bronze statues at its base. The foundation stone was laid on January 2, 1902.D√≠az Flores Alatorre, Manuel. Recuerdo del Primer Centenario de la Independencia Nacional: Efem√©rides de las fiestas, recepciones, actos pol√≠ticos, inauguraciones de monumentos, y de edificios, etc.. Mexico City: Rondero y Treppiedi 1910, n.p. Placed in it a gold chest with a record of independence and a series of coins minted in that epoch. But in May 1906, when the foundations were built and 2,400 stones placed to a height of 25 m, the sides of the monument collapsed, so D√≠az created a study commission composed of engineers Guillermo Beltr√°n y Puga, Manuel Marroqu√≠n y Rivera, and Gonzalo Garita. The commission determined that the foundations of the monument were poorly planned, so it was decided to demolish the structure. The work was restarted under the supervision of a steering committee composed of engineers Beltran y Puga, Marroquin y Rivera and the architect Manuel Gorozpe, leaving the artwork in the care of architect Antonio Rivas Mercado. All the sculptures were made by Italian artist Enrique Alciati. One of the faces in the doors is of one of Rivas Mercado's daughter, Antonieta. Located at the roundabout between Paseo de la Reforma, Rio Tiber and Florence Streets. The monument was completed in time for the festivities to commemorate the first hundred years of Mexican Independence in 1910. The inauguration was held on 16 September, the 100th anniversary of the Grito de Dolores, the shout by Father Miguel Hidalgo that was considered the initiation of Mexican independence. The ceremony was attended by President D√≠az and many foreign dignitaries. Some 10,000 Mexican soldiers and contingents of foreign military forces helped mark the occasion.D√≠az Flores Alatorre, Manuel. Recuerdo del Primer Centenario de la Independencia Nacional: Efem√©rides de las fiestas, recepciones, actos pol√≠ticos, inauguraciones de monumentos, y de edificios, etc.. Mexico City: Rondero y Treppiedi 1910. The main speaker at the event was Mexican poet Salvador D√≠az Mir√≥n. An eternal flame (L√°mpara Votiva) honoring these independence heroes was installed in the base of the column at the order of President Emilio Portes Gil in 1929. The monument suffered some damage during an earthquake on July 28, 1957, when the sculpture of the Winged Victory fell to the ground and broke into several pieces. Sculptor Jos√© Fern√°ndez Urbina was in charge of the restoration, which lasted more than a year. The monument was reopened on September 16, 1958. It survived the devastating earthquake of September 19, 1985, with some damage to the staircases and the reliefs, but none to the Angel. On August 16, 2019, following feminist demonstrations against gender-based violence and feminicides, the monument was affected due to acts of vandalism and graffiti. The Government of Mexico City closed access for an indefinite period; but it is estimated that it could be between one and two years. However, the capital government declared justifying that the closure is due to the restoration, within the framework of a work program in Paseo de la Reforma that involves several more monuments. Mausoleum The monument lit at night with color changing LED light. The Independence Angel on the Paseo de la Reforma, at sunset. In 1925, during the administration of Plutarco El√≠as Calles, the remains of the following Heroes of the Mexican Independence were interred in a mausoleum under the base of the monument. At the entry to the mausoleum is a statue of William Lamport, also known as Don Guill√©n de Lampart y Guzm√°n, an Irishman who was tried by the Mexican Inquisition in the mid seventeenth century, following the discovery of his plot to achieve the independence of New Spain. He was released by the inquisition to secular authorities and executed in the auto de fe of 1659, with his remains forbidden burial in sacred ground. The actual remains of insurgents are buried in the mausoleum: *Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla: Chief instigator of independence in 1810 and \\"Father of the Nation\\". *Father Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n: Skilled general and leader of the independence movement after Hidalgo's execution. *Ignacio Allende: Lieutenant general of the insurgent army and later rebel leader. *Juan Aldama: A rebel captain and conspirator. *Jos√© Mariano Jim√©nez: Hidalgo's lieutenant colonel. *Guadalupe Victoria: Commander of the insurgent army and first President of Mexico. *Vicente Guerrero: Insurgent general following the death of Morelos and second President of Mexico. *Nicol√°s Bravo: Commander of the rebel army and later President of Mexico on three occasions. *Mariano Matamoros: A priest who served as Morelos's lieutenant general. *Andr√©s Quintana Roo: A prominent constitutionalist. *Leona Vicario: Active supporter of the rebel movement and wife of Andr√©s Quintana Roo. *Francisco Javier Mina (Xavier Mina): A Spanish officer who joined the rebel cause against the absolute monarchy of Ferdinand VII. *Pedro Moreno: Insurgente *V√≠ctor Rosales: Insurgente Absent from the mausoleum is Agust√≠n de Iturbide, who achieved Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821; his remains are in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City. President Calles excluded Iturbide when other insurgents' remains were transferred to the mausoleum in 1925.Thomas Benjamin, La Revoluci√≥n: Mexico's Great Revolution as Memory, Myth, and History. Austin: University of Texas Press 2000, pp. 184-85, footnote 30. More than 60 years after the mausoleum was erected, on September 16, 1998, it was permanently opened to the public by President Ernesto Zedillo and Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas, Head of Government of the Federal District. On May 30, 2010, as part of the Bicentennial celebrations of the War of Independence, the remains of the National Heroes were exhumed and then escorted by the Armed Forces with full military honors to the National History Museum in Chapultepec Castle, where they were subject of studies by members of the National Institute of Anthropology and History. After these studies, the remains were temporarily exhibited at the National Palace until August 2011, when they were returned to the mausoleum. Visiting Angel of Independence details. The Lion led by the Child Visitors may enter the monument, view the memorial plaques at the base level, and climb to the top of the tower. While entry is free, visitors must obtain a permit at the Cuauht√©moc borough by showing an ID. Groups of no more than six people are permitted inside the monument for about 15 minutes. With about 200 steps, the climb is arduous. The first approximately 15 stairs, located in the monument the base, are wide and comfortable. The stairs in the column itself, approximately 185, are circular, metal, very narrow and without a landing or resting point until the top. Visitors who are not in good physical shape will find the climb exhausting‚Äîit is the equivalent of climbing a 14-story building in one go, and those not comfortable in tight spaces should avoid the climb as it has insufficient room to allow others to bypass. Some staircase areas are very dark, with only a few slits to let in light. The top balcony, though narrow, offers a commanding view of the wide avenues that surround the column. The return trip down is by way of the same circular staircase. More recently El √Ångel has become the traditional gathering place for celebration by Mexico City inhabitants, particularly following Mexico national football team victories and as a focal point for political rallies. As of March 2016, visiting inside is limited to Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM.

By 1922, the name had been simplified to Cooden Halt. With the growing housing development of the 1930s and the electrification of the line a new enlarged station was built adopting its present name of Cooden Beach on 7 July 1935. The station building is at street level and a subway leads to the platforms with their wooden shelters. The shop next to the ticket office (now combined) has been a sporting goods store and a carpet store. In the latter half of 2005 and early 2006, Cooden Beach station underwent a minor refurbishment programme to bring the station in line with Southern's image (the company's dark green colour scheme was implemented). The improvements included new double glazing on the subways leading to the platforms and opening up the waiting rooms, which had been closed for at least a decade. The last major refurbishment, by Connex, opened up the old ticket office and shop and turned it into a Costcutter supermarket but a whole station refurbishment was never completed.

Cacao tree  The cacao tree, also known as Theobroma cacao, is where chocolate is first formed. The chocolate that is harvested from this tree is called the Cacao bean or Cocoa bean. These beans are seeds found inside the fruit of the tree, known as pods. The pods have a hard shell that is brightly colored and grows in clusters on the branches of the tree. Pods start as clusters of non- scented, small white flowers; this is a type of flowering cycle is called cocoa Cauliflory. These flowers are grown on the cushioning of the tree, or aged branches. Image of the cacao tree with multiple cacao pods growing on it. Photographed on 24 April 2016 by Bj√∂rn S.https://www.panoramio.com/photo/129841062 It takes around 4 to 5 months for the cacao pods to fully develop into a 20 cm long pod. After several weeks, they ripen into an orange and red coloring. The cacao seeds themselves are small, brown, pebble like beans that are produced inside the cacao pods. On average 30 to 50 seeds are in each pod, and there are 20 to 30 pods produced a year. This plant grows in lowland tropical rain forest environments where shade, humidity, and regular rainfall occur. Places that fit these conditions are for the most part located between the two tropics and spread around the world (West and East Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands, Indonesia, and Pacific islands such as Fiji and Vanuatu). These trees have a life span around 100 years. Tools used by cacao harvesters. The food of the Gods: A Popular Account of Cocoa (1903)  Harvesting  The harvesting of cacao pods consists of removing ripe pods from the trunk of the cacao tree to extract the beans from inside. The cacao pods are harvested manually once or twice a year. The harvesters will get the pods down by using a blade. Pods high up in the tree however, require a special type of tool. This tool consist of a long pole with a handle on one end, and a hook on the other. They will push, pull, or twist the tool depending on the positioning of the fruit, to cut the pods down without damaging the branches. It is important not to damage the flower cushioning of the tree; this is what produces flowering for future harvests. Harvesters recommend to open the cacao pod with a wooden club, so the beans inside are not damaged. After the extraction, the beans will begin a fermentation process, and set to dry before reaching the market.  Processing  After the fermentation process, described in harvesting, the beans are cleaned and the shells are removed from the nibs, a process known as Winnowing. The nibs then go through an alkalisation process, and are then milled to create cocoa liquor. Mechanically pressing the cocoa liquor, Cocoa butter is extracted which leaves \\"cocoa presscake\\" ; the cocoa butter makes chocolate and the presscake is used to create cocoa powder. The chocolate then undergoes a series of refining processes such as conching and tempering. Finally it is moulded and packaged.  Popularity  Raw chocolate represents a fast-growing segment of the chocolate industry. Raw chocolate has been on the rise in popularity according to the Global Organic Chocolate Market. Starting back in the early 2010s, it is predicted that the global organic chocolate market will rise 2.38%. It is often made in small batches. Some of raw chocolates popularity comes from the health benefits it claims. Raw chocolate may contain vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals like copper, manganese, sulfur, zinc and niacin, similarly to regular chocolate but potentially in slightly higher amounts, although few studies have been conducted to support this. The low-heat or \\"cold\\" production process (which avoids roasting) may help to preserve the antioxidants known to be naturally present in the fruit of the cacao tree (Theobroma Cacao).[2] Many marketers produce chocolate that is certified organic or fairly-traded.

History Poole Pottery was originally \\"Carter's Industrial Tile Manufactory\\" and it was this company that provided the financial foundation for the later \\"Poole Pottery\\". Carter (Jesse) joined forces in the 1920s with designers Harold Stabler and Phoebie Stabler, and potters John Adams and Truda Adams (Truda Carter) to form \\"Carter Stabler Adams\\", who produced Art Deco pottery. Tiling detail, Bethnal Green tube station, platform frieze. The Carter company produced much of the ceramic tiling used on London Underground stations built in the 1930s and, of particular note, made the relief tiles, designed by Stabler, showing symbols of London‚Äìsome of these can still be seen on stations such as Bethnal Green. \\"Carter Stabler Adams\\" eventually became \\"Poole Pottery\\", and during and after World War II produced many lines, including Twintone and Traditional. Much of the traditional range was based on the work of the chief designer in the 1920s, Truda Carter; her original designs were interpreted by \\"paintresses\\" who added their own individuality to the pieces, all of which were handmade. Design by Robert Jefferson Robert Jefferson joined in the 1950s, and alongside such artisans as Leslie Elsden (designer of the \\"Aegean\\" Range), Guy Sydenham, thrower and designer of the \\"Atlantis\\" range, Tony Morris, developer of the early \\"Delphis\\" Studio wares with Jefferson, and paintresses such as Carol Cutler, Diana Davies, Ros Sommerfeld, Ann Godfrey and others, including the three Wills sisters, Laura, Julia and Carolyn, produced two lines which are probably the most famous of all Poole's output: Delphis and Aegean. Delphis is easily recognised: it is psychedelic, with vibrant colours and designs inspired by artists such as Mondrian, Warhol, Matisse and Pollock. Aegean is more subtle, with the sgraffito technique used to create the \\"silhouette\\" patterns that make this range so recognisable. =Twintone= Poole Pottery (Carter, Stabler and Adams) produced two-coloured tableware from the 1930s, but had to stop production during World War Two. When they re-launched the range in the late 1940s, they named it Twintone. Twintone was used on three shapes of tableware, many table accessories and a whole host of decorative ware right up to 1981. =Delphis= Poole Delphis no.49 pin dish Jean Millership The Poole Delphis range, launched in 1963, was initially conceived by Guy Sydenham and Robert Jefferson and later developed by Jefferson and Tony Morris. Every piece is pretty much unique, with designs created by the decorators themselves. =Aegean= Introduced in 1970, Aegean utilises spray- on glazes in a wide range of techniques (sgraffito, silhouette, mosaic, flow line and carved clay) and patterns (from pure 1970's abstraction to more figurative images of fish, leaves, boats and pastoral scenes). Initially thought of as a replacement for Delphis, it was never as successful. =Living Glaze= Poole Pottery giftware is currently created using \\"Living Glaze\\". This involves the application of different glazes which react with one another to achieve unique results on each piece.

The name was altered to Normans Bay on 5 May 1969. According to a text held by a local resident, the station was built in Victorian times due to the arrival of a stranded whale in the nearby marshes, although these are now much further out to sea. On hearing the news of the whale, several Londoners flocked to the south coast and found no railway station, instead having to jump several feet from the train. The local public house; The Star Inn (still in use today) urged the local authorities to place a halt, so several sleepers were hurried in overnight. A level crossing named 'Havensmouth' by Network Rail is in operation at Normans Bay, which was upgraded to automatic full length barriers in February 2015 in co-operation with the upgrading of part of the East Coastway Line.

The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2004. It is written and directed by native Caymanian Frank E. Flowers and filmed entirely in the West Indian dependency. Haven is an ensemble film in which unconnected lives intersect and result in a violent chain of events that turns tranquility into chaos. It was released in limited theaters in the United States on September 15, 2006. The film's tagline was \\"Can love survive the fall of paradise?\\" Plot A corrupt and greedy businessman, Carl Ridley (Bill Paxton), is running from the government, with his 18-year-old daughter Pippa (Agnes Bruckner) in tow. Pippa is not happy to leave her friends and comfortable life in Miami for the Cayman Islands. Arriving in the islands, Ridley is preoccupied. Banks are rapidly closing and he must find a clean place to store his stolen money. Meanwhile, Pippa finds native Caymanian Fritz (Victor Rasuk) sleeping off a late night in her bed. He flees out the window, leaving his wallet behind. She later finds Fritz on the beach to return his wallet and befriends him, in spite of his ridiculous come- on attempts. Fritz is yearning to show her the island, including its wild parties. But he owes money to island gang leader Richie Ritch (Raz Adoti), and when he peeks in on Pippa's father unwrapping a massive amount of cash that he had taped around his torso, Fritz begins scheming. Pippa is completely unaware that she's leading her father into even more trouble than he had in the United States. A parallel storyline involves Shy (Orlando Bloom), a Cayman native. He is in love with Andrea (Zo√´ Salda√±a), the daughter of his boss, Mr. Sterling, a very influential person in the island. But for an unknown reason, Andrea's brother Hammer (Anthony Mackie) despises Shy. To protect their secret affair, whenever Shy would visit Andrea at home his good friend Kimo (Mpho Koaho) would watch the house in case Andrea's father were to arrive. On Andrea's birthday Shy visits her house and has sex with her, but Kimo falls asleep and fails to warn Shy of Sterling's arrival. Shy escapes out the window, but not without being identified by Hammer. Later on, to avenge his sister's lost womanhood, Hammer attacks Shy with acid which leaves a permanent scar on Shy's face. Hammer is sent to jail for four months. Physically and emotionally scarred, Shy becomes a recluse. Andrea is emotionally broken and gives in to drugs and sex. Shy has his friend Patrick, the son of Mr. Allen (Ridley's lawyer), take him to Richie's birthday party to find Andrea. Finding her in the bathroom having sex with a stranger, he runs into the front yard and vomits. She runs after him but he pushes her away knowing that she is high. Hammer sees Shy and begins to beat him up with help from his friends. Shy finally breaks free and runs down the street as Hammer curses at him, telling him to stay away. Meanwhile, at the same party, Fritz gets pulled in to see Richie while Pippa talks to a few other white girls doing drugs. Upset after smoking some pot, she finds Fritz and demands that he take her home. Having just told Richie to go to her home to steal the cash, he instead takes her to Mr. Sterling's yacht. As they sit down inside, they find that the alarm has been set off; the police arrive shortly and arrest both of them. Pippa is taken to the police station, while Fritz is transported to a laundromat where a local cop who knows him delivers a lecture and a beating for acting disobediently throughout his life. After his own beating, Shy obtains a gun and returns to the party to find Hammer. After firing the gun to clear out the party, he corners Hammer and explains what a mess Hammer has made of his own sister's life. He says that he will spare Hammer's life so that he can watch the trouble that he has caused in Andrea's life. Hammer replies that he would rather see Andrea become a whore than be with Shy. Enraged, Shy pulls the trigger. Shocked by what he has done, he apologizes and runs off. Over the next few hours, Andrea asks Patrick to take her to find Shy. He is disgusted with her and kicks her out of his car, but tells her that Shy is at the docks. When she finds him, she expresses her desire to be with him, regardless of others' feelings. When he confesses to killing her brother, however, she leaves him in disgust, forgetting her shoes in her hurry. When Allen and Ridley go to the police station the next morning, Ridley soon realizes that he has been betrayed and is taken into custody by the FBI. When Allen goes home to retrieve the money that he believes he tricked Ridley into leaving in his safe, he discovers that the bag contains only sand and a conch shell. At her own condo, Pippa discovers the million dollars under her mattress. In the final scenes, Andrea prepares for Hammer's funeral with her father, Kimo comforts Shy's mother, and Shy sits on the dock where Andrea left him. He then gets into his boat, cuts the rope and motors away, throwing the gun into the water.

The game was followed by Bomberman Max 2 which was released for the Game Boy Advance on June 4, 2002. There are two versions called Bomberman Max: Blue Champion and Bomberman Max: Red Challenger. In Blue Champion the playable character is Bomberman where in Red Challenger the playable character is Max. A third version of the game, Bomberman Max: Ain Version, was a Japan-exclusive limited edition. Limited to 2,000 copies, it was only available through a lucky draw contest by the Pentel Ain ad campaign.  Story  The story in both versions of the game is the same. An artificial intelligence named Brain has transformed five peaceful, happy planets into cold, dark, mechanical worlds. Both Bomberman and Max hear the distress cry of the Charaboms who live on these planets, and they begin a race to see who can save the Charaboms and defeat Brain first.  Gameplay  Bomberman and Max must conquer 100 different stages, all of which have the classic overhead Bomberman view. While there are various tasks on each level, gameplay mainly consists of bombing, similar to the debut NES title. A new addition to the game is the introduction of the Charaboms. Each game has a unique set of Charaboms obtainable through single player mode. Release Bomberman Max was developed by Vatical Entertainment and published by Hudson Soft. It was originally planned for either a spring or summer 2000 release in the United States. Reception Christian Huey of Allgame suggested that the Charabom mode owes a lot to Pok√©mon, citing both the monster battling aspect as well as the fact that the game has two versions like Pok√©mon Red and Blue did. As far as traditional Bomberman gameplay goes, Huey felt that it was the pinnacle of the series at the time, and that while Bomberman fans will be satisfied, casual gamers may be turned off by the multiple versions. Brett Elston of GamesRadar called it the strangest addition to the Bomberman franchise until Bomberman: Act Zero released, criticizing the developer for \\"missing the point\\" of having multiple versions. Jeremy Parish praised it as a quality multiplayer experience for the Game Boy Color, hoping that it would see a re-release on a hypothetical Game Boy Color Mini. Craig Harris of IGN praised the game, citing the music, visuals, and gameplay for making it a quality experience. He also praised the infra-red functionality of the game. However, Harris felt disappointment that a traditional Bomberman multiplayer experience was absent. Justin Speer of GameSpot praised the gameplay, but similarly expressed disappointment that the game lacks a traditional multiplayer mode for the series, feeling that the multiplayer mode present does not make up for it.

The 132nd episode overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 20, 2005. In the episode, South Park Elementary's talent show is coming up and everyone expects Jimmy to win. Jimmy is elated to perform his stand-up comedy routines, but begins to suffer from unwanted erections and tries to resolve the problem. Plot Jimmy faces a dilemma because he begins to experience random erections. This makes him afraid to perform his stand-up comedy routine at the South Park Elementary Talent Show for fear that he would be embarrassed in front of the entire school. He consults Butters, the only kid in town whom he expects not to make fun of him. Butters explains to him about sexual intercourse; Jimmy concludes that if he does not want to get an erection during his performance, he should have intercourse before he goes up. He attempts to arrange a date with a girl from school, with Cartman's help. When this ultimately fails, he goes to the red-light district of town based on a suggestion from Officer Barbrady, looking for sex. While the talent show begins at the school, Jimmy picks up an obese, STD-ridden prostitute known as Nut-Gobbler. The na√Øve Jimmy attempts to woo her but her pimp comes in and, thinking she is betraying him, grabs her and goes off to kill her. Jimmy summons a taxi, and a car chase ensues. In the end, Jimmy manages to distract the pimp with his comedy routine, while Nut-Gobbler subdues him with a club to the back of the head. Jimmy, presumably after having sex with the hooker, arrives at the talent show and hurries onstage at the last minute. He begins his routine, but then suddenly gets another erection. Cultural references *The scene where Jimmy is carrying Nut-Gobbler is a parody of the closing scene from the 1982 film An Officer and a Gentleman. *Cartman's act in the talent show is a reference to the 1983 film Scarface. *The restaurant that Jimmy and his dates go to is based on Buca di Beppo.Trey Parker and Matt Stone on the DVD commentary for this episode.

One of the oldest neighbourhoods in Inverness, it's situated in the city's north-west flanked by the Caledonian Canal to its west and River Ness to its east. It is a traditionally working-class area. In Merkinch is Grant Street Park, home to Clachnacuddin Football Club,Clachnacuddin: The fire-hit football club longing to return home, BBC Scotland News, 31 January 2020 and Merkinch Primary School, one of the oldest schools in the city. In February 2020, Merkinch was ranked as the number 8th most deprived area in Scotland, in a report by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). Residents immediately leapt to defend their community, while local MP Drew Hendry blamed the \\"roll-out of Universal Credit ... under this Tory Government\\". Notably, Merkinch was one of the last areas in Inverness to retain the city's own dialect of Scottish Gaelic.  Local History  Merkinch first appears in writing during the reign of King Alexander II, when it was granted by royal charter to the burgh of Inverness. This occurred in 1232, with the charter written four years afterwards. As part of this, the area was required to contribute \\"one pound of pepper\\" (or risk a fine of nine shillings) to the city every Michaelmas. Prior to the area's industrialisation, Merkinch was almost entirely farmland sitting on an island in the River Ness (hence its name-meaning in Gaelic). Wher the river flowed past the neighbourhood on its west side, is now the Caledonian Canal today. In 1829 it was the subject of a land dispute between the Frasers of Torbreck and Duffs of Muirtown, as tenants on both properties were unsure to whom they answered. In the Highland Potato Famine of 1846, wide social unrest gripped the city of Inverness. In Merkinch, a march was organised through the area and neighbouring Muirtown (another working-class neighbourhood), led by a 12-year-old drummer boy named John Fraser. The January protests were a direct result of potato prices skyrocketing at the market on Academy Street, it being a staple food both for rural and urban lay- folk. Despite the famine affecting Highlands, potatoes were still being exported in vast quantities to London‚Äîcausing an angry mob to overturn carts at the city's quay, and vandalise the houses of prominent potato merchants. In the end, 70 soldiers were called in to quell further unrest. Fraser's march would inspire similar ones across the Highlands, and over a year later similar protests occurred in response to rising oatmeal prices. Before the Second World War, Merkinch became home to Inverness' shipbuilding industry; across the railway lines to the area's north, the Kessock Ferry would cross the Moray Firth from a pier in South Kessock. Distilling was another important industry, with several distilleries in the area. Today, industrial activity still takes place on the Carse Industrial Estate and Telford Retail Park.

The population in 2011 was 6,587,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 7.06 km¬≤.Eurostat Geography The S√£o Gon√ßalo civil parish consists of the settlements Algarvio, Bica do Pau, Boa Nova, Cancela, Farrobo de Baixo, Fonte, Igreja, Lomba da Quinta, Neves, Palheiro Ferreiro, Piornais, Ribeiro da Qinta, Ribeiro Seco, Sal√µes and S√£o Jo√£o Latr√£o. It is located on the eastern border of Santa Cruz civil parish. S√£o Gon√ßalo is linked by regional roads to Funchal to the west, to Machico, and to Porto da Cruz. History The settlement of the area of S√£o Gon√ßalo, much like the first lands cultivated on the island, progressed after the initial colonization by Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco. Gon√ßalo Aires Ferreira, one of the first settlers in this region, was a member of Zarco's fleet, and acquired land west of the primary settlement (that would become Funchal), encompassing the area between the right margin of Ribeiro Gon√ßalo Aires and Ribeira de Santa Luzia.Ribeiro Gon√ßalo Aires received its name much later, and was used to identify the limits of Ferreira's land acquisition. The area became known as S√£o Gon√ßalo for the fact that it was explored by Gon√ßalo Aires Ferreira, under the direction of Gon√ßalo Zarco, and not specifically for the Saints with the same name. The ravine physically divided the Gon√ßalo Aires Ferreira's lands at the mouth of the Ribeiro Lazareto, cutting it from the ecclesiastical parish of Santa Maria Maior. Jer√≥nimo Dias Leite later identified the first children born on Madeira, as the children of Gon√ßalo Aires, who were named Adam and Eve: a reflection of the regliosity of these first settlers, who saw the newly discovered lands as a new Paradise. Further, the profound religious inclination of the period was characterised by construction of small chapels alongside the homes of many of the first nobility to settle along the coast. As the religious orders divided the newly baptized community of Funchal into two ecclesiastical parishes (S√© and Santa Maria Maior), the region of S√£o Gon√ßalo continued as the enclave within the latter. The faithful concentrated their religious devotion at the Church of Nossa Senhora do Calhau, while new nuclei developing throughout the 15th century. Some services occurred in a small chapel within the enclave, which was located in a peak that became known as Pico do Lopo Machado, and whose landowner lived in the zone: Ermit√©rio das Neves.

Lewsey is a former British Army Officer. Background and early life Lewsey was born in Bromley, London to Welsh parents, but spent most of his childhood in the rural Hertfordshire village of Sarratt and spent his early years at Sarratt Church of England primary school. He subsequently attended Watford Grammar School for Boys and then attended the University of Bristol on a British Army bursary, graduating in 1998, and lived in the same hall of residence as three-time Olympian sailor Iain Percy; he was able to graduate after obtaining special permission to take his final exams in Australia as he had been selected for England's 1998 \\"Tour of Hell\\" in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2009 he was awarded a Doctor of Laws (LL.D) honoris causa by the university. Military Lewsey graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 2001 and was commissioned as a troop commander into the Royal Artillery. However, after two years of combining the Army and a professional rugby career, he found that doing both became impossible, and he resigned his commission. Rugby career While at school he played for the Amersham and Chiltern Rugby Football Club. He first played for Wasps at eighteen in their Colts side, before being selected for their senior team. In that season he made his first appearance for England, in the U19s against Italy. During his time at university, Lewsey combined his studies with playing professionally for Bristol RFC. He then rejoined London Wasps at the age of twenty one after completing his degree. He won his first full England caps in 1998 against New Zealand and then South Africa. In the following years, he was a member of the successful Wasps side that won 12 trophies, starting with the Tetley‚Äôs Bitter Cup in 1999, in the final of which he scored a try. The following year Wasps retained the cup, and in the 2000 final he again scored a try this time against Northampton, having spent the morning at Sandhurst with his platoon on routine room inspection, block cleaning and parade drill. Amongst his 12 trophies at Wasps were four Premiership titles in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008. Lewsey played in all four finals, and scored two tries in the 2003 final and one in the 2008 final. He also played in the victorious 2004 and 2007 Heineken Cup finals. After a good run of form with the national team, he scored 11 tries at the 2007 Middlesex 7s to help Wasps win their first Middlesex 7s title since 1993. He became the tournament's top try and points scorer. On 5 April 2009, Lewsey announced that he would retire from Rugby at the end of the 2008/09 season. That year with Wasps he won Player of the Year, but was not selected for the 2009 British and Irish Lions team for the tour to South Africa. =International= Lewsey appeared for England in all three tests in the 2001 North American tour, and was a member of the England side that won the Hong Kong Sevens in 2002. He also represented England in sevens at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, opting to play in the tournament over touring Argentina with the National team. Lewsey made his England home debut in the Six Nations Championship in 2003 after an injury to Jason Robinson. He scored twice in a 40-5 win over Italy. He followed this with the opening try in his next game against Scotland, and was part of the Grand Slam winning side. He had a key part in the tests against New Zealand and Australia on the June 2003 Southern-hemisphere tour. By then he was first-choice full-back, Jason Robinson having moved to wing. He was a part of the 2003 World Cup winning squad, and scored five tries in the 111‚Äì13 defeat of Uruguay. He was selected for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. He made an ideal start scoring two tries in the first five minutes against Bay of Plenty. Lewsey was widely viewed as a standout player for the Lions, despite the team‚Äôs poor results. Lewsey continued to be an integral part of the England team at the 2006 Six Nations. Lewsey featured heavily in England's campaign to retain the Rugby World Cup in 2007, playing in every game en route to the final. He scored the only try against France in the 14-9 victory which put England into the last two. However, just before half-time in the same match he picked up a hamstring injury which ruled him out of the final. That semi final was to be his last game for England. England's coach Brian Ashton did not select Lewsey for the England squad to compete in the 2008 Six Nations squad. However, he was called up for Martin Johnson's England Squad for 2008/2009, but was not selected to play. On 10 December 2009 Lewsey announced his retirement from international rugby to concentrate on his club career, ending his time in the England set-up, which spanned more than 10 years and claiming 55 caps with 22 tries scored. Due to his parentage Lewsey also qualified to play for Wales but chose to represent England as he had received a call-up from them first. His mother is from the Swansea Valley area while his father is half Welsh. Post playing career Lewsey pursued interests outside rugby. In 2005 he completed his Postgraduate diploma in Law. He also set up a leadership development and business consultancy, which looked to apply organisational performance lessons from sport and the military, into business. Lewsey released his autobiography on 5 February 2009 titled One Chance: My Life and Rugby. In 2009 he joined PwC as a management consultant. In September 2011, Lewsey joined Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. as an equities sales trader. After a year in the role he undertook a review of the division‚Äôs structural trading model, and was subsequently offered the role of Head of Business Advisory Services, EMEA. In 2017, Lewsey joined Ernst Young as People Advisory Services Leader in Asia-Pacific. Rugby administrator In March 2013 having spent several years outside the world of sport, he took up a six-month position as Interim CEO at the Cornish Pirates. During his time there, Lewsey pressed the need for the club to ‚Äúrepresent its community‚Äù and ‚Äúharness the power of the identity of Cornwall‚Äù. On 30 August 2013, Lewsey was appointed Head of Rugby at the Welsh Rugby Union. After a comprehensive review, Lewsey embarked on a new strategy for the organisation of which a key initiative was support for the grassroots game, establishing School-Club Hubs to safeguard the future of rugby in Wales. By September 2014, the WRU had 43 schools participating in the scheme. By the second year it had increased to 93, which equated to most secondary schools in Wales. He resigned in November 2015, citing personal reasons which would prevent him from dedicating himself to the position full-time. Other interests As an avid climber, in 2006 Lewsey was given the summer off from international rugby and spent time climbing in the Himalayas reaching the base camp of K2. He did not inform his club of the expedition as he was sure they would object. In 2010 Lewsey and his friend Keith Reesby were unsuccessful in their attempt to climb to the summit of Mount Everest via the difficult North Col route. Both climbers were within 500 feet of the summit when breathing apparatus failure caused them to abandon the ascent. Lewsey admitted afterwards that he had \\"never felt so scared\\" as the two climbers attempted to descend from over 8500m without supplementary oxygen.

The founders were Rhode Island School of Design graduates Joshua Pearson, Gardner Post, and Brian Kane (author of the Vujak VJ software). Kane left EBN in 1992. The EBN Live Team included DJ Ron O'Donnell; video artist-technologist Greg Deocampo, founder of Company of Science and Art (CoSA); founding CTO of IFilm.com), artist-designer Tracy Brown; and programmer-technologist Mark Marinello.  History  The first EBN video project was a musical remix of the Gulf War, created in 1991 as the war was still ongoing. Pearson cited their interest in how the media turned information about the war into entertainment as an inspiration for the band. The VHS tape of the remix project, which contained the George H. W. Bush \\"We Will Rock You\\" cover, became a viral underground hit, and was distributed widely by fans as bootleg copies. In the summer of 1991, EBN traveled with the first Lollapalooza tour, distributing tapes and showing their videos on a modified station wagon with TVs on the roof. The group also became well known for their media sculptures and stage props which were created by Gardner Post. Bono of U2 took notice of their work and hired them to provide visuals for their Zoo TV Tour. EBN's video work featured prominently into the show, and their \\"We Will Rock You\\" cover was played at the beginning of each show. EBN also produced visuals for The Edge's performance of \\"Numb\\" on the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards. In addition to the visuals, audio from those clips were featured in the live performance to create rhythmic effects. In 1997, EBN collaborated with U2 for an MTV miniseries, ZooTV: The Television Program, which featured satirical videos and remixes. In 1998, EBN returned to the MTV Video Music Awards fold by designing the respective montage videos for the 1998 nominees announced in their signature \\"video scratching\\" style. In 1996, the group contributed to the AIDS benefit album Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 2011, EBN collaborated with Nico for the 10th Year anniversary of the EJ Midi Turntable at First Avenue.  Commercial Entertainment Product  Commercial Entertainment Product was released in 1992 on TVT Records. Spin called it \\"dizzyingly hypnotic, politically subversive sound-and-vision barrage that renders superfluous its repeated exhortation to 'try psychoactive drugs!'\\". Videos included a cover of \\"We Will Rock You\\" by Queen, with a vocal track made up of remixed clips of George H. W. Bush, who made announcements about the Gulf War.  Telecommunication Breakdown  The album Telecommunication Breakdown, released in 1995, was one of the first Enhanced CDs ever produced, and contained contributions from Bill Laswell, Institute of Technology, Grandmaster Melle Mel, Brian Eno, and Jack Dangers. Among the videos released are \\"Get Down\\" and \\"Electronic Behavior Control System\\", which mocks the way television controls our lives. The band used a video/audio sample of R. Budd Dwyer's suicide in \\"Get Down\\". Wired.com described the band's use of samples on \\"Get Down\\" as \\"the video equivalent of Public Enemy's Bomb Squad\\".  Style  Josh Pearson, EBN's charismatic front man and principal performance artist, was also EBN's music composer and main video editor. He says that the band are not musicians but use sampling technology to create multimedia performance art. The EBN modus operandi was to take cable television broadcasts and remix them with a funky beat, often having the lyrics \\"sung\\" not by a singer but by half-second sound clips from TV, spliced together. For example, the lyric \\"electronic behavior control system\\" would be created with a clip of Ross Perot saying \\"electronic\\", followed by a clip of George H. W. Bush saying \\"behavior\\", then Ted Koppel saying \\"control\\", and finally a clip of Bill Clinton saying \\"system\\". This technique has been named video scratching.  Legacy  Though recognizing a long tradition before EBN, author and academic Holly Willis traces modern VJing to them. Following his departure from EBN, Kane co-developed video sampling software Vujak. Kane has since worked a number of times with British AV artists Addictive TV on many of their projects, both live and recorded, including Mixmasters and at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts. Deocampo founded Company of Science and Art, which developed After Effects. He continues his video remixes independently today, using footage from the 2003 invasion of Iraq (which he refers to as Gulf War II). In 2006, Deocampo started working with a trio of London video turntablists, Eclectic Method: Jonny Wilson, Ian Edgar, and Geoff Gamlen. Joshua Pearson is Senior Editor at Outpost Digital / RadicalMedia, and has edited numerous commercials, television shows, and documentary films, including Under African Skies: Paul Simon's Graceland Journey, and Whitey: The United States V James J. Bulger, both of which were Sundance selections. In 2015, he edited What Happened, Miss Simone?, directed by Liz Garbus, which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature and won an Emmy for Outstanding Documentary. Gardner Post has continued to work in sculpture and audiovisual performance, including the band United Content Providers.

It is the second-oldest diocese in the present-day United States, having been elevated to the rank of diocese on April 25, 1793, by Pope Pius VI during Spanish colonial rule. Our Lady of Prompt Succor and St. Louis, King of France are the patron saints of the archdiocese and Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is its mother church as St. Patrick's Church serves as the Pro-Cathedral of the archdiocese. Led by an archbishop, the Archdiocese of New Orleans is the center of a larger ecclesiastical province that encompasses the entire state of Louisiana. The Metropolitan Province of New Orleans include the suffragan Dioceses of Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Houma-Thibodaux, Lafayette, Lake Charles, and Shreveport. On June 12, 2009, Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop Gregory Michael Aymond of the Diocese of Austin to be Archbishop of New Orleans. Archbishop Aymond was installed on August 20, 2009 at Saint Louis Cathedral. Summary The archdiocese encompasses eight civil parishes in the New Orleans metropolitan area: Jefferson (except Grand Isle) Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, St. Tammany, and Washington. There are 137 church parishes in the archdiocese, ministered by 387 priests (including those belonging to religious institutes), 187 permanent deacons, 84 brothers, and 432 sisters. There are 372,037 Catholics on the census of the archdiocese, 36% of the total population of the area. The current head of the archdiocese is Archbishop Gregory Michael Aymond. There is one Archbishop Emeritus: Archbishop Alfred Clifton Hughes. There is also one Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus: Bishop Dominic Carmon, S.V.D. History Detail of 1726 sketch of New Orleans, showing the Parish Church of St. Louis, where the St. Louis Cathedral would later be built. The Catholic Church has had a presence in New Orleans since before the founding of the city by the French in 1718. Missionaries served the French military outposts and worked among the native peoples. The area was then under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Quebec. In 1721 Fr. Francis-Xavier de Charlevoix, S.J., made a tour of New France from the Lakes to the Mississippi, and visiting New Orleans, he describes \\"a little village of about one hundred cabins dotted here and there, a large wooden warehouse in which I said Mass, a chapel in course of construction and two storehouses\\".Points, Marie Louise. \\"New Orleans.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. November 19, 2017 In 1722 the Capuchins were assigned ecclesiastical responsibility for the Lower Mississippi Valley, while the Jesuits maintained a mission, based in New Orleans, to serve the indigenous peoples. The Jesuit vicar-general returned to France to recruit priests and also persuaded the Ursulines of Rouen to assume charge of a hospital and school. The royal patent authorizing the Ursulines to found a convent in Louisiana was issued September 18, 1726. Ten religious from various cities sailed from Hennebont on January 12, 1727, and reached New Orleans on August 6. As the convent was not ready, the governor gave up his residence to them. They opened a hospital for the care of the sick and a school for poor children. New Orleans and the rest of Louisiana west of the Mississippi were surrendered to the Spanish in 1763. From then until 1783 the East and West Florida were under British control, but as part of the Peace of Paris (1783) the two Florida colonies were regained from Great Britain. Thus, the pioneer parishes of New Orleans and Louisiana were incorporated into the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas when it was erected on April 25, 1793. The diocese originally encompassed the entire Louisiana Purchase, from the Gulf of Mexico to British North America, as well as the Florida peninsula and the Gulf Coast. The date of its establishment makes it the second-oldest diocese in the present-day United States: the Diocese of Baltimore was established on November 6, 1789. At the time of its establishment, the territory of the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas was part of the Archdiocese of San Cristobal de la Habana, based in Havana, Cuba. The diocese was divided into smaller dioceses several times, and many modern dioceses in the central United States were originally part of the Diocese of Louisiana. As capital of the Louisiana, the city was sold to the United States in 1803. The diocese was renamed the Diocese of New Orleans in 1826, and encompassed what is now Louisiana and Mississippi. New Orleans was elevated to an archdiocese in 1850. As the population of Louisiana grew, the Archdiocese of New Orleans was further subdivided into several additional dioceses. In its long history, the archdiocese and the city of New Orleans have survived several major disasters, including several citywide fires, a British invasion, the American Civil War, multiple yellow fever epidemics, anti-immigration and anti- Catholicism, the New Orleans Hurricane of 1915, Segregation, Hurricane Betsy, and an occasional financial crisis, not to mention Hurricane Katrina. Each time, the archdiocese rebuilt damaged churches and rendered assistance to the victims of every disaster. More recently, the church has faced an increased demand for churches in the suburbs and a decline in attendance to inner-city parishes. The church has also weathered changes within the Roman Catholic Church, such as the Second Vatican Council, and changing spiritual values throughout the rest of the United States.Nolan, Charles E. \\"A Brief History of the Archdiocese of New Orleans.\\" 2001 May. The archdiocese sustained severe damage from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. Numerous churches and schools were flooded and battered by hurricane-force winds. In the more heavily flooded neighborhoods, such as St. Bernard Parish, many parish structures were wiped out entirely.Finney, Peter. \\"Devastation.\\" The Clarion Herald. 2005 Oct. 1. Vol. 44, No. 9. =Politics= In early 2009, the state of Maine passed a law allowing same-sex civil marriage. In July 2009 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans contributed $2,000 of its money to a referendum campaign to overturn that law. According to Maine's \\"Commission on Governmental Ethics & Election Practices\\", the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland Maine spent over $553,000 to overturn the law. The Archdiocese of New Orleans' $2,000 was part of that $553,000. =Sex abuse= As of 2019, the Archdiocese of New Orleans has listed 81 clergy who were \\"credibly accused\\" of committing acts of sex abuse while they were serving in the archdiocese. Some settled lawsuits filed against them while one, Francis LeBlanc, was convicted in 1996.https://bishop-accountability.org/member/psearch.jsp (password required) Archbishop Alfred Hughes acknowledged that for sex abuse claims during 1950‚Äì2003, the archdiocese and its insurers paid $1,187,066 for settlements, $448,735 for therapy, and $421,372 for legal fees. Additional settlements were reached by 2019 as well. On January 24, 2020, staff of the New Orleans Saints admitted that the football team's Senior Vice President for Communications Greg Bensel \\"offered input on how to work with the media\\" to help the Archdiocese of New Orleans handle the sex abuse scandal. Bensel advised the Archdiocese to \\"Be direct, open and fully transparent, while making sure that all law enforcement agencies were alerted.\\" Bensel was among a number of community and civic leaders consulted by the Archdiocese before releasing the accused clergy names in November 2018. On May 8, 2020, it was revealed that the leader of the board of directors for one of the Archdiocese of New Orleans' various ministries resigned his post recently after claiming in a lawsuit against the church that he was molested by one of its priests decades ago. The plaintiff who spoke on anonymity, claimed he resigned under duress. The Archdiocese, which mediated a settlement in 2019, had previously agreed to pay for expenses which the plaintiff paid for six years of counseling. However, the plaintiff filed his lawsuit on April 7, 2020, after claiming that he discovered that the priest who allegedly molested him, James Collery, had more victims. Collery died in 1987. The lawsuit also claimed that the plaintiff first reported the abuse in 2013. On May 19, 2020, it was revealed that all surviving accused clergy who served in the Archdiocese of New Orleans had their payments suspended as part of the bankruptcy settlement, though some were trying to get their payments reinstated. Among those who tried to restore payment was retired Archdiocese of New Orleans priest Paul Calamari, who tried to get his pension reinstated by admitting to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Meredith Grabill on May 18, 2020 that he had a ‚Äúfailing‚Äù and a ‚Äúsin‚Äù with a 17 year old high school boy in 1973. On August 19, 2020, Fr. Brian Highfill was added to the Archdiocese of New Orleans' list of credibly accused clergy nearly two decades after his alleged actions of sex abuse were first reported against him. A trove of love letters which Highfill wrote to one of his victims, Scot Brander, in the 1980s backed allegations that he committed acts of sex abuse as well. Scot, who Highfill knew since the age of 10, later committed suicide, though his brother Michael Brander still pursued justice and preserved the love letters in a desk drawer. Despite indefinitely suspending Highfill from ministry in 2018, the Archdiocese refused up to this point in time to deem sex abuse allegations against him as credible. It was noted that Highfill was the 64th name added to the original list of credibly accused clergy which had been released in 2018. =Bankruptcy= On May 1, 2020, it was announced that the Archdiocese of New Orleans had filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. The causes of the decision were said to be the mounting cost of litigation from sexual abuse cases and the unforeseen financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Archdiocese, which had a $45 million budget, owed $38 million in bonds to creditors and was also facing more pending sex abuse lawsuits.https://www.fox8live.com/2020/05/01/attorneys- alleged-victims-church-sex-abuse-respond-archdiocese-new-orleans-bankruptcy- filing/ The pending sex abuse lawsuits, which were suspended due to the bankruptcy filing, would likely result in the already financially struggling Archdiocese of New Orleans losing millions of dollars more. On August 20, 2020, victims of sex abuse by clergy who served in the Archdiocese of New Orleans filed a motion in court to dismiss the bankruptcy.  Heritage  From the cathedra, located in the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, the Archbishop of New Orleans presides over the Metropolitan Province. The Archdiocese of New Orleans is a culturally diverse community within the diverse city of New Orleans. As a major port, the city has attracted immigrants from around the world. Since French and Spanish Catholics ruled the city, they encouraged enslaved Africans to adopt Christianity. The city has a large population of African American Catholics with deep heritage in the area. Later European immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, Polish, and German Bavarians have also been a part of the archdiocese throughout its history. In the last quarter of the 20th century, many Vietnamese Catholics from South Vietnam settled in the city. New waves of immigrants from Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba have added to the Catholic congregations. Landmarks The best known church in the New Orleans Archdiocese is the historic St. Louis Cathedral fronting the Spanish Plaza de Armas, now Jackson Square, in the French Quarter. This church was originally built in 1718, shortly after the founding of the city. The modest building was destroyed by fire several times before the current structure was built between 1789 and 1794 during the Spanish domination. During renovations to the cathedral between 1849 and 1851, St. Patrick's Church, the second-oldest parish in the city, served as the pro- cathedral of the archdiocese. Bishops The Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas was erected on April 25, 1793; it encompassed the area claimed by Spain as Luisiana, which was all the land draining into the Mississippi River from the west, as well as Spanish territory to the east of the river in modern-day Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. In April 1803, the United States purchased Louisiana from France, which had in 1800 forced Spain to retrocede the territory in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. The United States took formal possession of New Orleans on December 20, 1803, and of Upper Louisiana on March 10, 1804. The then-Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore served as apostolic administrator of the diocese from 1805 to 1812; during this period, the diocese became a suffragan of Baltimore. Archbishop Carroll's successor as apostolic administrator would eventually be the diocese's first resident bishop of the 19th century. In 1823, Joseph Rosati was appointed coadjutor bishop of the diocese. In 1825, the territory of the diocese in what is now Alabama and Florida was transferred to the new Vicariate Apostolic of Alabama and the Floridas, and in 1826, the diocese was renamed, becoming the Diocese of New Orleans. At the same time, the diocese's territory was further reduced by the creation of the Vicariate Apostolic of Mississippi and the Diocese of St. Louis. Bishop Rosati served as the diocese's apostolic administrator from 1826 to 1829; having been appointed bishop of St. Louis two years previously, he resigned the administration of the New Orleans diocese upon the appointment of Bishop de Neckere. =Bishops of Louisiana and the Two Floridas= # Luis Ignatius Pe√±alver y C√°rdenas (1795-1801), then appointed Archbishop of Guatemala # Francisco Porr√≥ y Reinado (disputed, 1801-1803), then appointed Bishop of Tarazona in Spain # Louis-Guillaume Dubourg (1815-1825), then appointed Bishop of Montauban and later Archbishop of Besan√ßon in France # Leo-Raymond de Neckere (1830-1833), until his death (Auguste Jeanjean was appointed, 1834; did not take effect.) =Archbishops of New Orleans= Archbishop Hughes greets parishioners in front of St. Louis Cathedral after the first services in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina more than a month earlier. # Antoine Blanc (1835-1860); raised from Bishop to Archbishop in 1850 when New Orleans became archdiocese # Jean-Marie Odin (1861-1870) # Napol√©on- Joseph Perch√© (1870-1883) # Francis Xavier Leray (1883-1887) # Francis Janssens (1888-1897) # Placide-Louis Chapelle (1897-1905) # James Blenk, S.M.

Schools There are 5 Roman Catholic colleges and over 20 high schools within the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Many of the churches throughout the archdiocese have primary schools as well. Previously Catholic schools were racially segregated. In 1962 there were 153 Catholic schools; that year the archdiocese began admitting black students into schools that did not admit them; that year about 200 black children attended the archdiocese's Catholic schools previously not reserved for black children. The desegregation occurred two years after public schools had integrated. Bruce Nolan of The Times Picayune stated that because Catholic schools had a later desegregation, white liberal and African-American groups faced disappointment but that the integration had not produced as intense of a backlash. =Seminaries= *Notre Dame Seminary *Saint Joseph Seminary College Ecclesiastical province of New Orleans :See: List of the Catholic bishops of the United States#Province of New Orleans See also *List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of the United States#Ecclesiastical province of New Orleans *:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans Notes References External links * Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans Official Site *Nolan, Charles E.

He also designed the Skylon and the Churchill Gardens housing estate in Pimlico. He founded a practice with Hidalgo Moya, Powell & Moya Architect Practice. Peter Skinner joined the practice in 1948 and later became a partner. They won a competition to build Churchill Gardens, Pimlico, a complex that houses 5,000 people in 1,800 flats. They were aged 24 and 23 respectively. They were then invited by Frederick Gibberd to design a housing project in Harlow New Town. Northbrooks sits imposingly above a valley to the south of the town centre, affording good views from and to the four-storey slab blocks. However, arguments with Harlow Design Corporation over the use of flat roofs led to the pair terminating their involvement prior to completion. They undertook no more work in the town, much to the disappointment of Gibberd, who had lectured them at the Architects' Association School. They designed the Skylon Installation at the 1951 Festival of Britain, which sought to instil a sense of positive feeling at a time of postwar depression. Powell designed Mayfield School for Girls, West Hill, Putney, London, S.W.15.; a number of Oxford and Cambridge University buildings including Wolfson College, Oxford and at Christ Church, the courtyard at the Museum of London and Chichester Festival Theatre. In 1974, Powell and Moya became the first to win the RIBA Gold Medal for architecture as a Practice. Powell was knighted in 1975 after years of dedicated work as a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission. He died in London.

It is one of two auxiliary Interstates in the Milwaukee metropolitan area and serves the lakefront, the Port of Milwaukee and connects downtown with the southeastern suburbs of St. Francis, Cudahy and South Milwaukee. Route description I-794 begins at the Marquette Interchange in downtown Milwaukee, where Interstate 94 and Interstate 43 meet. It continues eastward through downtown and turns southward near Lake Michigan at Lincoln Memorial Drive. The route crosses the Milwaukee River and the Port of Milwaukee as well as the Henry Maier Festival Park via the Hoan Bridge. The entire route is elevated on a viaduct. The interstate designation ends at exit 3 at Carferry Drive, which provides access to the Lake Express ferry to Muskegon, Michigan; the highway continues south as WIS 794, also known as the Lake Parkway, to the intersection of Pennsylvania and Edgerton Avenues on Cudahy's west side, running parallel and adjacent to the east side of Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. Traffic volumes on I-794 range from 40,400 vehicles per day on the Hoan Bridge to 100,000 on the east‚Äìwest Freeway. History The Lake Freeway as seen from the air The original plans for the Lake Freeway called for it to begin north of downtown Milwaukee at a connection to the proposed Park East Freeway, then to travel south from the downtown Milwaukee area to Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. However, the Hoan Bridge was the only segment of the freeway to be built before strong opposition to the freeway resulted in its cancellation. This led to the Hoan Bridge being called the \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\" as it sat unused, with both of its ends unconnected to any other road, for three years. The unfinished bridge was long held as being used as the site of the car chase scene in the movie The Blues Brothers. In a 2016 article for the Shepherd Express, author Michael J. Prigge, pointing out that the bridge had been opened for two years when the film was shot indicated another incomplete segment of I-794 had been used for the scene. An east‚Äìwest freeway was later constructed between the Marquette Interchange and the Hoan Bridge, creating what is now known as I-794. As part of his campaign against freeways in Milwaukee, Mayor John O. Norquist proposed to tear down the I-794 portion of the east‚Äìwest freeway in 1995 in favor of a surface boulevard. He believed that the freeway was cutting off the Historic Third Ward from the rest of downtown Milwaukee. His effort failed when opposition to the removal cited increased traffic volume on the road as well as the new Lake Parkway nearing completion. After opening, the Lake Parkway helped traffic volumes on I-794 to increase to 111,000 vehicles per day by 2004. The Marquette Interchange construction project undertaken between 2004 and 2008 rebuilt the east-west viaduct section of I-794 between the interchange and the Milwaukee River. In February 2010, Milwaukee County Supervisor Patricia Jursik and South Milwaukee Mayor Tom Zepecki proposed a plan to expand I-794/Lake Parkway to Racine County. The expansion would follow an existing railroad corridor and was intended to relieve traffic along I-94.

It is Dorset's second highest point and has panoramic views extending for many miles. It was bequeathed to the National Trust by the Pinney family in 1982. For many years it was thought to be Dorset's highest hill, until modern survey revealed that nearby Lewesdon Hill was 2 metres higher.Muir, Johnny, The UK's County Tops, Milnthorpe: Cicerone, 2011, p. 26. Geology The hill is a lower greensand Cretaceous outcrop situated amongst Jurassic strata of marl and clay, at the border between the chalk of South-East England and the granite of Devon and Cornwall. Archaeology The hill is topped by an Iron Age multivallate Durotrigian hill fort which was excavated in the 1960s by Peter Gelling of the University of Birmingham with his wife Margaret Gelling at the request of Michael Pinney. The remains of 14 roundhouses were uncovered near the centre of the hill fort. Surveys were also carried out by the National Trust in 1982 and by the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England in 1995. There are differing views as to the age of the rectilinear (square) structures in the centre of the fort (best seen in the National Trust report photo ): they may be medieval \\"pillow mounds\\" (man-made mounds for breeding rabbits), or could be earlier in origin. There is no clear evidence to distinguish the other mounds between pillow mounds and burial mounds, and the acid soil causes almost all bone and pottery to be in very poor condition. The National Trust in the 1982 excavations (which restored the mounds to their original profile prior to Gelling's excavation) viewed them as medieval; Gelling thought there was a case they were earlier. Additional rectilinear structures are noted in the 1999 National Trust Resistivity survey. Landscape Other notable high points in the vicinity are Lewesdon Hill (279 m), Dorset's highest point some 4 kilometres to the east, and Blackdown Hill (215 m), about 2 kilometres northwest. Dorothy and William Wordsworth In 1795‚Äì7 Dorothy and William Wordsworth lived at Racedown House‚Äîa property of the Pinney family‚Äîto the west of Pilsdon Pen. They walked in the area for about two hours every day, and the nearby hills‚Äîincluding Pilsdon Pen‚Äîconsoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland.

O'Reilly was born in New York state, raised in the Lower East Side of New York City. She was born into a working- class family and left school at the age of eleven to begin working as a seamstress. Leonora O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs parents were Irish immigrants escaping the Great Famine; her father, John, was a printer and a grocer and died while Leonora was the age of one, forcing her mother, Winifred Rooney O‚ÄôReilly, to work more hours as a garment worker in order to support Leonora and her younger brother. O‚ÄôReilly worked from 1903 to 1915 an organizer and recruiter for the Women‚Äôs Trade Union League (WTUL). On the streets of New York, O‚ÄôReilly spoke in public for labor reform and women‚Äôs suffrage; her skills enabled her to represent women in 1911 at a New York Senate Committee on Suffrage as well as in various public meeting halls.  Personal and family life  = Family life = Leonora O'Reilly was the daughter of John O'Reilly, a printer and member of the Knights of Labor, and Winifred (Rooney) O'Reilly, an Irish-born dressmaker. John O'Reilly died when Leonora was one year old. Upon his death, Winifred O'Reilly supported herself and the child by sewing and taking in boarders. O'Reilly accompanied her mother to meetings at Cooper Union and her father's friend, Victor Drury, helped instill in her an appreciation for the Italian nationalist Mazzini. O'Reilly counted among her influences radical Catholic priest and social justice advocate Fr. Edward McGlynn and anarchist Peter Kropotkin. Leonora and Winifred O'Reilly both made their home in Brooklyn. In 1907, Leonora O'Reilly, who never married, adopted a child, Alice. Alice died in 1911. = Personal life = At age 16, O'Reilly joined the Comte Synthetic Circle, a self-education group in the Lower East Side of New York. Through this group, O'Reilly met her mentor, Victor Drury. Drury was a French-born intellectual, Knights of Labor activist, and anarchist; he had introduced O'Reilly to many books which helped compensate for her lack of formal education. In 1898, Leonora O‚ÄôReilly took art courses at the Pratt Institute in New York graduating in 1900. She was supported in this and other activities by a wealthy Boston philanthropist named who, in 1897, provided O'Reilly with an annual salary, allowing her to leave wage work for full-time labor organizing. In 1909 O'Reilly was deeply involved in the New York Shirtwaist Strike, the Uprising of the 20,000. In part in reaction to what she thought was the betrayal of wealthy women supporters of the shirtwaist workers, in 1910, O'Reilly became a member of the Socialist Party of New York. Nonetheless, she remained a dedicated supporter of women's rights and woman suffrage. In 1912 O‚ÄôReilly founded the Wage Earners Suffrage League, the \\"industrial wing\\" of the Woman Suffrage Party, and had called for more fair wages which many upper-class women were not as likely to support. O‚ÄôReilly had an ‚Äòequal pay for equal work‚Äô plan for the movement after they had made a dent in their efforts. O'Reilly served as the president of the Wage Earner‚Äôs Suffrage League from 1911 to 1912. In this capacity she served as a volunteer investigator to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911. In 1912, O'Reilly was appointed as the Chair of the Industrial Committee of the New York City Women Suffrage Party. Nicknamed as 'the agitator,' O'Reilly worked to empower the voice of women workers, rather than supporting their interests on the public platform alone. When speaking about disenfranchised women workers, she would frequently refer to them as ‚Äòintelligent women‚Äô and ‚Äòthinking women‚Äô because that is how O‚ÄôReilly perceived them, despite the patriarchal social-norms that at the time did not think as highly of the women. This was made evident throughout her speeches, but notably in her 1896 speech titled \\"Organization\\" in which she put heavy emphasis on providing the unprivileged class of workers a sense of class-consciousness against the big industries, which O‚ÄôReilly felt had exploited their hard labor. In 1915, O'Reilly served as the Trade Union Delegate to the International Congress of Women. At this time O'Reilly was 45 years old and she began to suffer from the early stages of heart disease which would slowly trump her ability to be an energetic activist. In 1919, O'Reilly again served as the Trade Union Delegate, this time to the International Congress for Working Women. In 1925 and 1926, O'Reilly taught courses at New York's New School for Social Research; these courses were on topics related to 'the theory of the labor movement'. In 1927, O'Reilly died at the age of 56 due to heart disease.  Irish-American Female Leadership  When Irish nationalism gained prominence in the U.S in the early 1880s, it enabled Irish-American women their first experiences in the public sphere. They advocated for Irish independence when Irish men and women were oppressed back home. Within the nationalism movement in Ireland, radical aspects including a worker-centered agenda was called for in America ‚Äìone that would \\"restore to producers the fruits of their labor\\". This movement attracted Irish American workers and drew women into reform movements beyond the scope of nationalism. Those who sought to reform did so to advocate for the exploited and vulnerable in America. Due to the lack of support from men in the labor movement, women turned to each other and formed alliances with those of middle-class status to seek remedies to aid ‚Äúthe working girl‚Äù. This ultimately brought them beyond their own ethnic and class circles, into broader American reform tradition. The prevalence of Irish women organizers during the late 19th and early 20th century can be attributed to the numerous Irish women in the female labor force during that period. Women accounted for a large proportion of the overall Irish immigration population, and the highest among other immigrant groups. Due to the high occurrence of poverty among immigrants, it was essential for women to find work in addition to men. The occurrence of late marriage, coupled with a less family-centered ethnic tradition enabled Irish American women to gain employment. Notably, it was not considered off-limits for single Irish women to work. Without the need to tend to marriage and household duties, women were allowed to work and thus contributed to the rise of Irish American female activists. It was a source of support for O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs decision to not marry, and a tradition in which that decision would not be considered deviant. Although a career as a labor activist was not a field open to women, the prominence of Irish American men in organizing influenced women to pursue it. It is evident that this cultural pattern enabled women to participate and remain in the labor force. Unlike O‚ÄôReilly, many reformers of the era were well-educated, middle-class Protestant reformers. O‚ÄôReilly left school at an early age to follow her mother‚Äôs trade ‚Äì sewing. She faced poverty, brutal working conditions and unemployment that came with the Gilded Age. Like most Irish-American women activists, knew the injustices of industrial capitalism. The first Irish- American women to embrace social reform did so to advocate for the working- class in industrial America. Hence, ethnicity and class are main factors contributing to their entry into public life.  Leonora O'Reilly's Cause  Leonora O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs experience growing up working-class allowed her to identify with the labor movement, which she saw as crucial for defending people, particularly women of her class. As a third-generation working woman, O‚ÄôReilly justified her right to speak for women in the labor force because of the cumulative experiences of a working mother and grandmother. In addition to focusing on women‚Äôs place in society, O‚ÄôReilly advocated for changes that would allow women from unskilled to more skilled positions. She argued industrial education was crucial for the liberation of working women, and trade schools for girls in the absence of apprenticeships available to boys. She was convinced wage equality would be possible when women became skilled workers. Therefore, O‚ÄôReilly saw women‚Äôs suffrage as a route to equal political rights and ultimately wage equality. It is notable that during the Irish Rebellion, O‚ÄôReilly devoted her attention to support of Irish nationalism to international labor issues.  Career and political activism  O'Reilly began working in a factory at age 11 as the assistant to a seamstress in New York. in 1881, at the age of eleven, Leonora was forced to give up school to work in a New York collar factory, earning $1 per dozen finished collars. When the pay dropped to 50 cents three years later, O‚ÄôReilly joined the knights of labor and participated in her first strike. Leonora O‚ÄôReilly early in her life became engaged with the labor reform and women‚Äôs suffrage movements and at 16 she joined the Knights of Labor with her mother, Winifred O'Reilly, who soon followed her daughter's lead. Leonora belonged to many organizations composed of both working class and elite men and women. Mentors helped further her education. After attending the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, O'Reilly and her mother became residents at the Asacog House, a settlement house in Brooklyn. She also taught at the Manhattan Trade School. After being formally introduced to labor rights efforts, in 1886 O'Reilly formed the cross-class Working Women‚Äôs Society. O‚ÄôReilly assembled a group of fellow collar makers to discuss their injustices and explore possible solutions. Together with other women activists, Leonora solidified the group and held discussions on how to build unionism among the exploited workingwomen in New York City. The group was soon composed of shop women and factory operatives, including Alice L. Woodbridge and Ida Van Etten. Together they helped organize the Working Women‚Äôs Society. Its objectives were ‚Äúto found trades‚Äô organizations in trades where they at present do not exist, and to encourage and assist labor organizations to the end of increasing wages and shortening hours‚Äù. At this time, Louise Perkins, a women‚Äôs activist and philanthropist, had taken interest in O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs work, inviting her to membership in New York‚Äôs Social Reform Club as this group would often speak on the contemporary issues surrounding the political economy. Only with the financial support of elite women such as Louise Perkins was O'Reilly able to give up manual labor and become a full-time labor organizer with the Women's Trade Union League. O‚ÄôReilly organized the local women‚Äôs United Garment Workers of America in 1897. In 1903, O‚ÄôReilly joined the Women‚Äôs Trade Union League (WTUL) which sought to bring women into labor unions. In 1903, she served as the WTUL vice- president. The Women‚Äôs Trade Union League included working class women and also those from middle and upper-class families. WTUL also was open to women of all ethnic backgrounds as their diverse membership included Italian, Eastern European Jewish, and Irish women. The WTUL reported in the year between 1908 and 1909, O'Reilly had officially given 32 speeches credited to her name alone, while between 1909 and 1913, reports suggest she gave speeches nearly every day. O'Reilly advocated to bring women to the vote, where they would gain independence and confidence men often thought they lacked. Suffrage was essential to better working conditions, such as abolishing sweatshops, raising wages, reducing work hours and helping them unionize. ‚ÄúBehind suffrage‚Äù Leonora wrote, ‚Äúis the demand for equal pay for equal work‚Äù and that women workers would cease to be a threat to union men‚Äôs wage scales once they gained the vote. As a WTUL organizer, and the vice president of New York city‚Äôs WTUL she helped organize the 1909 New York city strike nicknamed the uprising of the 20,000, by raising money to support strikers, urging boycotts of firms being struck, and organizing mass protests. She also galvanized protests following the Triangle factory fire of 1911, by using the tragedy to build support for factory safety reforms. Because the WTUL consisted of working-class individuals who lacked education and money, they were unable to organize effectively without the aid of powerful allies. Thus, the league was dominated by affluent middle-class women who were educated, had financial ability and political clout. These progressive reformers attempted to steer workers away from radical influences, particularly the Socialist Party which O‚ÄôReilly and Rose Schneiderman, a fellow WTUL leader and organizer, were members of. This resulted in issues of credibility between classes within the league and Socialists members distrusted the work of these affluent reformers. As such, O‚ÄôReilly and Schneiderman often felt torn by competing loyalties. The league seemed to them ‚Äúto act out patronizing benevolence that had little to do with real coalition building‚Äù,and the two leading organizes were angered by what they saw as attempts of allies to manipulate them. Eventually, O‚ÄôReilly resigned in Jan 1906, claiming an ‚Äúoverdose‚Äù of allies. In 1909, O‚ÄôReilly was a part of the New York Shirtwaist Strike of 1909, also known as the ‚ÄòUprising of 20,000‚Äô. This same year, O‚ÄôReilly joined the recently founded National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), supporting African American rights. She also was supporting peace efforts, speaking critically of World War I. O'Reilly founded the Wage Earner‚Äôs Suffrage League in 1911 and served as its president from 1911 to 1912. O‚ÄôReilly and Schneiderman founded the league on March 22, 1911. O‚ÄôReilly was a senior member and a street corner speaker who because of her excellency, was elected president. The league‚Äôs goal was threefold ‚Äúto urge working women to understand the necessity for the vote, to agitate for the vote, and to study how to use the vote when it has been acquired‚Äù. An ardent socialist, Leonora O'Reilly was a delegate to the 1915 Hague Women's Peace Convention, sailing through mine-laden waters aboard the MS Noordam. She also cooperated with Indian independence organizations. Around 1918, O'Reilly devoted herself to the radical section of American Irish nationalism. In 1919 O‚ÄôReilly spoke at the International Congress for Working Women in Washington D.C. Despite O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs lack of formal education, she was given the opportunity to teach a course at New York‚Äôs New School for Social Research on ‚Äòthe theory of the labor movement‚Äô in 1925 and 1926. = International Women's Day = The first International Women's Day (IWD) was declared and celebrated on February 23, 1909. The American Socialists declared IWD to be on the last Sunday of the month of February. This holiday sought to highlight the 'means by which to unite the popular community around a set of common goals', human rights in the form of equal wages, social status, and voting rights for all women. On February 23, 1909, in New York City's Murray Hill Lyceum at 34th and 3rd Avenue, Leonora O'Reilly spoke to over two- thousand audience members explaining the principles of equal rights and demanding women's equal right to vote. This was the first official celebration of the holiday which led a path towards historical accountability for women's rights all over the world. The holiday was not widely celebrated as many American and European socialists were less interested in the suffragist movement as the idea of promoting full women's rights was seen as subordinate to the economic advancement of male working class citizens. There is some controversy between American and European historians and women's rights activists as to when the International Women's Day was first established. Some believe that the first American IWD was on March 8, 1907, a day marking the 50th anniversary of the New York Strike of Female Textile Workers. The European women's rights activists had declared their International Women's Day on March 18, 1911.  The Irish Rebellion  Leonora O‚ÄôReilly became involved in support of the Irish Rebellion, an uprising against British rule of Ireland founded in opposition to imperialistic policies. During the years between 1916 and 1923, Irish nationalists sought help from Irish labor movement leaders in the US, as a response to the US support of the British in World War I. Labor leaders in Ireland encouraged Irish immigrants in the US to boycott British goods, pass trade-union resolutions in favor of the Irish Revolution and for US diplomatic recognition of the Irish Republic. Irish nationalists reasoned that Irish American labor leaders should support the movement as they were fighting for justice and the equality of all workers. Moreover, it was argued that British imperialism damaged American workers, notably related to the elite Anglo-Protestant groups in the US siding with the British and discriminating against Irish American workers. O‚ÄôReilly responded positively to Irish nationalists later in her career and became a key figure in international networks that supported the Irish Rebellion. O‚ÄôReilly was involved in an array of organizations associated with the Irish Rebellion, including Cumann na mBan (Irish Women‚Äôs Council), the Friends of Irish Freedom, the Irish Progressive League, the Labor Bureau of the American Commission of Irish Independence, the American Women Pickets for the Enforcement of American War Aims, and the Irish Women‚Äôs Purchasing League. O‚ÄôReilly was notable for using her contacts to drive support for boycotts. The first was a boycott by dockworkers who refused to unload British cargoes across major American cities including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, New Orleans and Galveston. This led to O‚ÄôReilly organizing a group from the American Women Pickets for the Enforcement of American War Aims to incite the first group of dockworkers in New York to walk off their jobs and which led to similar actions by groups in other cities. The movement attracted international attention, particularly from Irish republican women leaders who came to the US to attract backing for the Irish Rebellion. Later, O‚ÄôReilly was involved in a consumer boycott of British goods. This campaign was led by Chicago Federation of Labor President John Fitzpatrick and labor lawyer Frank Walsh of the Labor Bureau of the American Commission on Irish Independence. O‚ÄôReilly published a list in conjunction with the Women‚Äôs Purchasing League of goods to be boycotted, and using a rational that women did most of the shopping. Regardless of its financial impact, the boycotting campaign highlighted a division within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) over the question of imperialism. AFL leaders advocated that the labor movement should support government foreign policies. This support might then be conceded during times of national crisis to achieve concessions for American workers. By contrast, O‚ÄôReilly sided with other labor leaders, such as John Fitzpatrick, in a fundamental opposition to imperialism. Even when at odds with government policy, she believed such opposition was an appropriate purpose of the labor movement and a primary focus of labor solidarity.

He attended McGill University, where he initially intended to study law, but became interested in geology after accompanying a friend on a summer field expedition to Labrador. He subsequently earned bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. degrees in geology, completing his studies between 1928 and 1933.\\"Three legends to join the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame,\\" The Northern Miner, V. 96, No. 40, November 22‚Äì28, 2010, 5. Williamson mine After completing his studies, Williamson travelled to South Africa with one of his professors, where he eventually took a job with Loangwa Concessions, a De Beers subsidiary in what was then Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). He then moved on to work at the Mabuki diamond mine, which he purchased from the owners in 1936 when they had decided to shut the mine down. Williamson struggled to support himself with the operations of the Mabuki mine, while using it as a base for diamond prospecting in the region. In 1940, he discovered the diamond-bearing kimberlite pipe at Mwadui that he would develop over the coming years into the Williamson diamond mine. The diamond mine at Mwadui was closely managed by Williamson, who by the 1950s had developed a diamond mining operation renowned for its efficiency and technological innovations. By 1952 the mine was operating at 10,000 tons per day. The mine's production, which Williamson owned in full, made him one of the richest men in the world by the time of his death in 1958 of cancer. The mine, famous for being the first significant diamond mine outside of South Africa, continues to operate today, and the total production from 1941-2008 has been estimated at 20 million carats (4,000 kg) of diamonds. The mine produced many fine gems including the Williamson pink diamond, a pink rough diamond presented to Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip on the occasion of their wedding in 1947. Cut by Cartier to a gem, it became the centerpiece of the Williamson Diamond Cartier brooch made for the Queen in 1952.Royal Collection http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/royalwedding1947/object.asp?grouping=&exhibs;=NONE&object;=200146&row;=48&detail;=about Legacy John Williamson was never married; upon his death the mine was left to his three siblings, who promptly sold the mine for ¬£4 million GBP to a partnership between De Beers and the government of Tanzania (then Tanganyika). The life of John Williamson was adapted into the biographical novel The Diamond Seeker by John Gawaine (a pen name), which was published in 1967. The book depicts Williamson as quiet to the point of secretive, and something of a womanizer. However, it also hails him as the last of the great diamond prospectors, who were able to find meaningful deposits and establish significant, successful mines without outside resources or support. While the book is known to have taken some liberties with the facts, it is one of the few biographical sources available. John Gunther in Inside Africa gives an account of a visit to the mine, describing Williamson as (partly on account of ill health) \\"an almost total recluse\\" whose one hobby was collecting first edition books. In 2011 Williamson was inducted into the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame. References Further reading * Tassell, Arthur. African Mining Magazine. \\"Williamson - A Bright Future Ahead?\\".

Name The original source and meaning of the name is unknown. In Hittite and Hurrian texts, his name was linked with the Akkadian ≈°arri (\\"King\\") and could be written with the Sumerogram for King, LUGAL-ma. In Hieroglyphic Luwian, his name was written with a pair of walking legs, which is transcribed as SARMA.  Description  ≈†arruma is a son of the weather-god Teshub and the goddess ·∏™epat and brother of the goddess Inara. He is often depicted riding a tiger or panther and carrying an axe (cf. labrys). He is depicted behind his father on the Illuyanka's relief found in Malatya (dating 1050-850 BC), on display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara, Turkey.

Her early education in fashion set the foundation for career in the industry creating textile prints. Rhodes designed garments for Diana Princess of Wales and numerous celebrities. In addition to designing garments, she designed textiles for interiors, featuring her prints on furniture and homewares. In 2003 Rhodes founded the Fashion and Textile Museum in London. Over her fifty year career Rhodes has won numerous awards recognizing contribution within the fashion industry, including Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in the Performing Arts - Costume Design 1979, Designer of The Year in 1972 and the Walpole British Luxury Legend Award 2019. Early life and education Rhodes was born 19th September 1940, in Chatham, Kent, England. Her mother was a fitter at the House of Worth in Paris and later became a professor at Medway College of Art, now the University for the Creative Arts. Her father was in the air force in Egypt and later became a lorry driver. Three years after Rhodes was born, her mother gave birth to her sister Beverley Rhodes. Rhodes mother having an occupational background in fashion, the industry was instilled in her as an adolescent. Rhodes first studied at Medway College of Art, her major area of study was printed textile design, in England, Pop artist Roy Lichtenstien, Andy Warhol, and textile designer Emilio Pucci were a few of Zandra Rhodes early influences. Textile design instructor Barbara Brown inspired her interest into textile designs during the course of her studies.. Rhodes later furthered her education under a scholarship at Royal College of Art. She strayed away from the traditional patterns many designers were producing to create furniture Rhodes utilised her skill towards designing patterns to create garments. In 1964, Zandra Rhodes graduated with a degree in home furnishing textile design. Career Rhodes' early textile fashion designs were considered outrageous by the traditional British manufacturers ,which made it hard to find work. In 1968 Rhodes started a business with fashion designer Sylvia Ayton. The two designers opened a boutique called Fulham Road Clothes Shop. The business allowed Rhodes to create her textile designs onto garments designed by Sylvia Ayton. She produced her first collection showing loose, romantic garments. In 1969, Rhodes and Ayton went their separate ways, with Rhodes establishing her own studio in Paddington in West London. As a freelancer she released her first solo collection. The collection of garments received recognition from both the British and American market. Marit Allen, editor of American Vogue at the time featured pieces of Rhode‚Äôs collection an issue. Receiving recognition by Marit Allen persuaded high end retailers like Henri Bendel , Fortnum and Mason, Neiman Marcus, and Saks to purchase her collection. Rhodes' own lifestyle has proved to be as dramatic, glamorous and extrovert as her designs. With her hair a vivid shade of bright green (later changed to a pink and sometimes red or other colours), her face painted with theatrical makeup and audacious art jewellery swinging from her neck, ears and arms, she stamped her identity on the international world of fashion. Rhodes was one of the new wave of British designers who put London at the forefront of the international fashion scene in the 1970s. Her designs are considered clear, creative statements; dramatic but graceful; audacious but feminine. Rhodes' inspiration has been from organic material and nature. Her unconventional and colourful prints were often inspired by travel; chevron stripes from the Ukraine and the symbols of the North American Indian, Japanese flowers, calligraphy and shells. Her approach to the construction of garments can be seen in her use of reversed exposed seams and in her use of jewelled safety pins and tears during the punk era. Within Zandra Rhodes career she created handmade evening wear using her unique feminine textiles. Each garment created incorporates different types of feminine style into place. She made her biggest splash in 1977 with the establishment take on punk which she called Conceptual Chic. She created dresses with holes and beaded safety pins ‚Äì 10 years before Versace ‚Äì to form a sort of embroidery, mixed with loosely drawn figures screen-printed on silk jersey, or on the newly developed Ultra suede fabric. When she creates her garments a lot of thought goes into the construction. Simplistic shapes help mould the foundation of Rhodes garments. The foundation of the shapes, functions as an enhancer that maximizes the effects of her prints. She achieves this look by using techniques like layering, smocking, and shirring. All of Zandra Rhodes garments are constructed around the design of her distinct prints, despite being structured around the formation of the dress. Rhodes designed for Diana, Princess of Wales, and continues to design for royalty and celebrities. She has notably designed costumes for Luke Spiller of The Struts, and Freddie Mercury and Brian May of Queen. She has a strong following in the US, UK, and Australia. = Multidisciplinary design = Rhodes has branched out from fashion, bringing her textiles into other design disciplines. In 1976 Rhodes designed her first interior home d√©cor collection, licensed under Wamsutta. The collection featured household linens, glassware, cushions, throws, and rugs. Zandra Rhodes also used her signature prints to create, ties, lingerie, and her very own fragrance. In 1995 she established a studio in California to develop an interior design business. The San Diego Opera commissioned her to design the costumes for her first opera, The Magic Flute, in 2001. Rhodes continued her association with the San Diego Opera in 2004 when she designed the set and costumes for Bizet's Les p√™cheurs de perles. She designed for Verdi's Aida at the Houston Grand Opera and English National Opera. In 2002 Rhodes designed a poster for Transport for London showing the River Thames as a woman wearing London landmarks as jewelry. Rhodes is the founder of the Fashion and Textile Museum in London, which was opened in May 2003 by Princess Michael of Kent. The four-million-dollar project took approximately seven years for architect Ricardo Legorreta to build. The museum provides exhibitions and educational programs for fashion students. Contained in the museum is a library and lecture room that will help immerse people into the ways fashion has impacted society throughout the years. In the first exhibit titled ‚ÄúMy Favourite Dress‚Äù there are dress from over seventy fashion designer‚Äôs in the industry. Ranging from designers like Oscar de la Renta, Donna Karan, Valentino, and Giorgio Armani. Zandra Rhodes personally asked each designer to choose one of their favourite dress from any of their collections to add to the exhibit. It was important for Rhodes to incorporate other designers into the exhibit so the museum provided a nuance of design besides from her own, although the museum withholds a variety of designers garments. Rhodes also included three thousand of her own original garments within the museum along with her sketch books and silk screens. At the Fashion and Textile Museum they have three shows a year and the exhibits consistently change. On 22 September 2006, she appeared as herself on the long-running BBC Radio 4 soap opera The Archers. Rhodes also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2007. She appeared, as herself, in an episode of Absolutely Fabulous during the BBC show's second season. Rhodes was a Guest Judge for the first episode of the third season of Project Catwalk. In November 2010, Rhodes was appointed Chancellor of the University for the Creative Arts, one of the UK's newest universities, and only the second to focus specifically on art and design. An official installation ceremony took place in June 2010 in the Banquet House, Whitehall, accompanied by a fashion show highlighting the best designs from the BA (Hons) Fashion Design and BA (Hons) Fashion Innovation Management courses at the Rochester campus in Medway, Kent ‚Äì where Rhodes studied, under its former title of the Medway College of Art and BA (Hons) Fashion at Epsom in Surrey. Marks and Spencers introduced the upmarket Zandra Rhodes collection, modelled and made by Rhodes, into the bigger stores by late 2009. She has her own collection of jewelry. The Zandra Rhodes jewelry includes five separate collections, which are Oriental Whisper collection, Punk Chic Collection, Lovely Lilies collection, Signature collection and Manhattan Lady Collection. A more recent jewellery collection created in collaboration with Adele Marie London, called Zandra Rhodes for Adele Marie, launched in August 2011. This collection features iconic pieces of Rhodes' early textiles work remade as jewellery. Rhodes launched a handbag range made under licence by Blueprint in 2010 and has also collaborated to produce a bed linen range and a new improved outdoor clothing range. On 26 March 2013, Rhodes launched a Digital Study Collection of 500 of her iconic garments from her private archive, as well as drawings and behind-the-scenes interviews and tutorials in her studio.Zandra Rhodes' design archive launched online, bbc.co.uk; accessed 24 April 2016.

He played in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles between 2000‚Äì06 and briefly for the Washington Nationals in late 2006. He most recently played for the Piratas de Campeche in the Mexican League. He bats and throws right-handed. Career as a player Matos was considered to be injury prone, as he has had only 3 seasons with over 300 at bats and one with 400 or more. Some in the Orioles organization felt he never reached his potential except for 2003 when he had 13 home runs, 15 stolen bases and had a batting average of .303. Matos is considered to be a good center fielder, but has an average arm. After losing his position as starting center fielder with the Orioles to Corey Patterson, Matos was designated for assignment on July 6, 2006. He signed with the Nationals as a free agent on July 14, 2006. On August 11, 2006, he was unconditionally released by the Nationals. On January 23, 2007, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates, but was released on March 30, 2007. Matos then signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on August 20, 2007. In 14 games with the Mets Triple-A affiliate, the New Orleans Zephyrs, he batted .204 with 1 home run and 4 RBI. In 2008, Matos played in the Mexican League for the Leones de Yucat√°n.

Introduced in 1984, it became a popular model for Yamaha and spawned several follow-up models (such as the Phazer II, Phazer Deluxe, Phazer Mountain Lite, Phazer FX, and Phazer GT); its design features were also incorporated into other models (such as later-model Exciters as well as the Venture Lite). Of particular note on the Phazer is way in which the headlight is directly connected to the handlebars so that the headlight follows the direction of a turn. This feature was certainly new among Yamaha models when it was introduced in 1984, and Yamaha claims that it and other features 'began a new era in snowmobiling'. The Phazer was always known for its sharp handling, free-revving 485cc fan-cooled engine, solid reliability (most notably on Phazer II), light weight, and most importantly, value. Ride quality akin to most of the snowmobiles of that era. Snowmobiles under the original Phazer name appeared until 1989; new models such as the Phazer II, Phazer Deluxe, etc., were sold until 1998, when it was revamped to the more traditional looking snowmobile and was known as the Phazer 500 (1999-2001). For the 2002 model year the Phazer nameplate was axed, where it would take a five year absence. Yamaha released a bold new snowmobile under the Phazer name-plate for the 2007 model year. The snowmobile featured a radical new design which is inspired from the YZ250F motocross bike. The new Phazer is powered by a new 80hp 499cc fuel-injected liquid-cooled four-stroke twin which makes its peak power at 11,000RPM. The engine is based on Yamaha's highly successful and dependable YZ250F dirt bike engine. With a 487 pound estimated dry weight, it is one of the lightest production four-strokes.

The National Security Agency was formally established by president Truman in a memorandum of October 24, 1952, that revised National Security Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID) 9. Since President Truman's memo was a classified document, the existence of the NSA was not known to the public at that time. Due to its ultra-secrecy the U.S. intelligence community referred to the NSA as \\"No Such Agency\\". Camp Mirage is the codename for a former Canadian Forces forward logistics facility located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The facility was established in late December 2001 and, though not officially acknowledged by the Canadian Forces, was considered an open secret. The existence of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) was widely known for several decades before the government's official acknowledgement of the organisation in 1994. Its Australian counterpart, ASIS, was the subject of a newspaper expos√© years before its existence was officially acknowledged. Israel is widely acknowledged to possess nuclear weapons. This can be considered an open secret, because the Israeli government has never explicitly stated whether or not it possesses a nuclear stockpile, officially maintaining a policy of deliberate ambiguity. Completed in 1964, the Post Office Tower was an official secret until it was officially revealed by Kate Hoey under parliamentary privilege in 1993, despite being a tall structure in the middle of central London that was open to the public for about 15 years, and had already become present in popular culture by that point. Its location was, therefore, for a time, apparently prohibited from being indicated on maps (in the UK largely created by a government agency, the Ordnance Survey). =Entertainment= Kayfabe, or the presentation of professional wrestling as \\"real\\" or unscripted, is an open secret, kept displayed as legitimate within the confines of wrestling programs but openly acknowledged as predetermined by wrestlers and promoters in the context of interviews for decades.

Moore, Philadelphia Cecil Bassett Moore (April 2, 1915 - February 13, 1979) was a Philadelphia lawyer, civil rights activist who led the fight to integrate Girard College, president of the local NAACP, and member of Philadelphia's city council. Biography Born in West Virginia, Moore served in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. In 1947, after his discharge at Fort Mifflin, he moved to Philadelphia and studied law at Temple University. Moore attended school at night and financed his studies with a job as a liquor wholesaler. He cultivated ties with the bar owners to whom he sold his wares and they became an important basis for his political constituency later in his career. He earned a reputation as a no- nonsense lawyer who fought on behalf of his mostly poor, African-American clients concentrated in North Philadelphia. From 1963 to 1967, he served as president of the Philadelphia chapter of the NAACP. He also served on the Philadelphia City Council. Moore is best remembered for leading a picket against Girard College, which led to the desegregation of that school. He was also a champion of a wide range of causes central to the Civil Rights Movement, including integration of schools and trade unions, and increased political and economic representation for poor African Americans. He has been credited with helping to restore order after the unsettling vandalism and violence of the racially charged Columbia Avenue riot of 1964. During his tenure, membership in the local NAACP chapter expanded from 7,000 in 1962 to more than 50,000 within a few years. Moore's aggressive manner and confrontational tactics alienated many leaders, black and white, including many within the NAACP who preferred negotiation \\"behind closed doors\\" over direct action. Moore himself acknowledged how his military service shaped his grassroots activism: Moore's military experience influenced him to question other leaders' use of nonviolence. Moore was rumored to have actively discouraged Martin Luther King Jr. from visiting Philadelphia;Sara A. Borden, \\"Cecil B. Moore\\" Civil Rights in a Northern City-Temple University Libraries. but he was one of the first civil rights leaders to have welcomed Malcolm X's growing role in the national movement.Clayborne Carson, Malcolm X: The FBI File (Skyhorse Publishing, 2013), p. 37. Moore's confrontational manner helped him cultivate a working-class constituency which enabled him to run independent black political campaigns outside the white establishment and traditional middle-class black networks. It also brought friction with the national NAACP which attempted to undercut Moore's power by splitting the Philadelphia chapter into three sub-branches. Moore nonetheless maintained massive public support within the black community. In 1975, Moore sought the Fifth District seat on the Philadelphia City Council, after incumbent Councilwoman Ethel D. Allen announced she would vacate the seat, and seek re- election to an at-large seat. Moore would go on to win the election. As Moore was nearing the end of his first term, attorney John Street announced his intention to challenge Moore for his seat in the 1979 election. While Moore was, by that time, in failing health, he initially vowed to see-off the challenge from Street. However, he died before the May primary. Street went on to win the election, and quelled some of the tensions over his original challenge to Moore by sponsoring a bill to rename the former Columbia Avenue in Moore's honor. Over time, appreciation for Moore has grown beyond the working poor with whom he long enjoyed popularity, and he is cited as a pivotal figure in the fields of social justice and race relations.

The network serves multiple purposes, including the provision of operation data for use in space weather prediction, and the study of solar internal structure internal structure and dynamics using helioseismology. Deployed in 1995, GONG is a set of six observing systems geographically distributed around the Earth so that the Sun can be observed as continuously as possible. The six observatories are the Teide Observatory (Canary Islands), the Learmonth Solar Observatory (Western Australia), the Big Bear Solar Observatory (California), the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (Hawaii), the Udaipur Solar Observatory (India) and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (Chile). With these sites, GONG typically can observe the Sun 91% of the time, 24/7. GONG was constructed to provide observations for helioseismology, which aims to understand the solar interior by analyzing the sound waves that are trapped in it. In 2001, the original GONG detectors were upgraded to 1000 x 1000 pixels and continuous magnetograms were implemented, and the new system is known as GONG++. While GONG still provides helioseismology data, it now also provides full-disk solar magnetic field maps (magnetograms) every minute and full-disk images of the Sun in the wavelength of the Hydrogen‚ÄìŒ± (HŒ±) spectral line every 20 seconds. These data products are used for research into the solar magnetic field and chromosphere but are also essential inputs into forecasts of space weather. The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), the US Airforce 557th Weather Wing, and the NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) all use GONG data to predict space weather conditions.

A. L. Diamond, and directed by Wilder. The film offers an affectionate, slightly parodic look at Sherlock Holmes, and draws a distinction between the \\"real\\" Holmes and the character portrayed by Watson in his stories for The Strand magazine. It stars Robert Stephens as Holmes and Colin Blakely as Doctor Watson. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, the creators and writers of the BAFTA and Emmy Award-winning series Sherlock, credited The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes as a source of inspiration for their show. Michael Hardwick and Mollie Hardwick authored a novelization of the film. Plot The film is divided into two separate, unequal stories. In the shorter of the two, Holmes is approached by a famous Russian ballerina, Madame Petrova (Tamara Toumanova), who proposes that they conceive a child together, one who she hopes will inherit her physique and his intellect. Holmes manages to extricate himself by claiming that Watson is his lover, much to the doctor's embarrassment. Back at 221B, Watson confronts Holmes about the reality of the ensuing rumours, and Holmes only states that Watson is \\"being presumptuous\\" by assuming Holmes has had relationships with women. In the main plot, a Belgian woman, Gabrielle Valladon (Genevi√®ve Page), is fished out of the River Thames and brought to Baker Street. She begs Holmes to find her missing engineer husband. The resulting investigation leads to a castle in Scotland. Along the way, they encounter a group of monks and some dwarfs, and Watson apparently sights the Loch Ness monster. It turns out that Sherlock's brother Mycroft (Christopher Lee) is involved in building a pre- World War I submarine for the British Navy, with the assistance of Monsieur Valladon. When taken out for testing, it was disguised as a sea monster. The dwarfs were recruited as crewmen because they took up less space and needed less air. When they meet, Mycroft informs Sherlock that his client is actually a top German spy, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, sent to steal the submersible. The \\"monks\\" are German sailors. Queen Victoria (Mollie Maureen) arrives for an inspection of the new weapon, but objects to its unsportsmanlike nature. She orders the exasperated Mycroft to destroy it, so he conveniently leaves it unguarded for the monks to take (rigging it to sink when it is submerged). Fr√§ulein von Hoffmanstal is arrested, to be exchanged for her British counterpart. In the final scene some months later, Sherlock receives a message from his brother, telling him that von Hoffmanstal had been arrested as a spy in Japan, and subsequently executed by firing squad. Heartbroken, the detective retreats to his room to seek solace in a 7% solution of cocaine. Cast Production =Casting= Billy Wilder, a long time Holmesian had long aspired to create a musical adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories. After two failed attempts in 1955 and 1963, he decided to embark on a non- musical screenplay with collaborator I. A. L. Diamond. Initially, Wilder planned to cast Peter O'Toole as Holmes and Peter Sellers as Watson. Nicol Williamson, who went on to play Holmes in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, was also considered for Holmes. Rex Harrison pursued the role but Wilder wasn't interested. Christopher Lee took the role of Mycroft Holmes after George Sanders' failing health removed him from the role. =Filming= Elaborate sets were built on the backlot at Pinewood Studios, including 150 yards of the Baker Street set, at a cost of ¬£80,000. The reproduction of the Diogenes Club stood until 1973 having been used in other films such as Hands of the Ripper and Carry On at Your Convenience. The sets were designed by art director Alexandre Trauner. The scenes set in Scotland were filmed on location at Urquhart Castle on the banks of Loch Ness; Kilmartin Hall on Loch Meiklie; Nairn railway station. The cemetery scene with Stanley Holloway was filmed at the Church of St Mary, Winkfield in Berkshire. Somerset House in London and the London Coliseum were also used as locations. Castle Stuart and Eilean Donan Castle in Scotland and Broadway Tower in Worcestershire made fleeting appearances. =Cut scenes= The first cut of the film ran approximately three hours and twenty minutes. As a result, large portions were deleted. The following scenes were all filmed, but were cut from the final release at the studio's insistence. What remained of them was recovered and restored for the film's LaserDisc release. None of the scenes survive in their complete form, with both film footage and audio. The deleted scenes include: \\\\- A modern-day prologue in which Dr. Watson's grandson, also Dr. Watson (a Canadian veterinarian), also played by Colin Blakely, visits a London bank to claim his grandfather's belongings. The head of the bank, Havelock-Smith, (John Williams) brings Dr. Watson his grandfather's strongbox, which contains items of Holmes and Watson's, along with a number of unpublished stories. (This scene is entirely lost, only production stills and the script survive) \\\\- The prologue then transitioned into the 1887 portion of the film. We meet Holmes and Watson as they journey back to London by train, having just solved a case in Yorkshire. A disheveled man rushes into their compartment, and promptly falls asleep. Based on numerous clues, Homes deduces that the man is an Italian music teacher who was having an affair with the wife of a nobleman, got caught, jumped out the window, and ran onto the train. This scene transitioned into their arrival at 221B Baker Street, as seen in the finished film. (Only the audio for this scene survives, along with production stills) \\\\- \\"The Curious Case of the Upside Down Room\\" - Inspector Lestrade visits Holmes and Watson and asks for help solving the seemingly impossible case of a corpse found in a room that was discovered entirely upside-down, with furniture on the ceiling. The three of them visit the scene of the crime, where Holmes inspects the clues. Back at home, Holmes deduces that Watson staged the whole thing in an attempt to pique Holmes' interest, drag his friend out of a deep depression and wean him away from cocaine. Watson is furious that his ruse has been discovered and that his friend intends to continue using drugs. He threatens to move out, but Holmes destroys his vials of cocaine. Watson agrees to stay, and we realize that the vials Holmes destroyed were empty, he has hidden the full vials in his violin case. (Only the audio for this sequence survives, along with production stills) \\\\- \\"The Adventure of the Dumbfounded Detective\\" - During the scene in the film where Holmes is traveling by train to Scotland with Gabrielle, there was originally a segue into a flashback, where he told her about his student days at Oxford. Holmes had fallen in love with a beautiful girl from afar. After Holmes's crew team won a race against Cambridge, to celebrate, they pooled their money and held a lottery, with the winner getting time with a prostitute (Jenny Hanley). Holmes won, but was nervous, because he did not want to sully his love for the girl he had seen. Then the prostitute turned around, and he realized that she was that same girl. Holmes tells Gabrielle that this episode taught him emotional involvement was not worth the risk for someone in his position. (This scene is entirely lost, only production stills and the script survive) \\\\- \\"The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners\\" - As Holmes and Watson travel back to England on an ocean liner, having solved a case for the Sultan in Constantinople, Holmes complains that anyone could have solved the case, even Watson. When a murder is discovered onboard, Holmes tells Watson to attempt to solve the case himself. Holmes watches, without saying anything, as Watson proceeds to go to the wrong cabin, where he finds a honeymooning couple passed out drunk, naked, in bed. Mistaking them for the murder victims, Watson begins to deduce an elaborate solution based on the \\"evidence\\" he sees around him, while Holmes listens, amused. When the lovers wake up, Holmes tells Watson he has gone to the wrong cabin, and Watson decides not to try to solve a case again. (Only the film footage for this sequence survives, the audio is lost) \\\\- An epilogue scene, immediately after Holmes retreats into his room to use cocaine on learning of the death of Gabrielle/Ilse, in which Inspector Lestrade arrives at 221B Baker Street and asks Watson for Holmes's help in solving the ongoing Jack the Ripper murders. Watson regretfully says that Holmes is busy and must decline. Lestrade assures Watson that Scotland Yard can solve the case without Holmes. (Only the audio for this scene survives) \\\\- Another deleted scene involved Rogozhin arriving at 221B Baker Street to give Holmes the Stradivarius promised to him by Madame Petrova. Still believing Holmes's story that he and Watson are both gay, Rogozhin offers roses to Watson. Editor Ernest Walter unsuccessfully argued for this to be the final scene of the film, as a nod to the finale of Some Like It Hot, but Billy Wilder refused, preferring to end the film on a more mournful note. (This scene does not survive) =Lost Loch Ness prop= A 30 ft (9m) model of the Loch Ness Monster was built for the film in 1969. The model included a neck and two humps and was taken alongside a pier for filming of portions of the film. Billy Wilder did not want the humps and asked that they be removed, despite warnings that it would affect its buoyancy. As a result, the model sank. The model was rediscovered in April 2016 during a Scottish expedition to find the Loch Ness Monster. =Subtext= Director Billy Wilder has said he originally intended to portray Holmes explicitly as a repressed homosexual, stating, \\"I should have been more daring. I have this theory. I wanted to have Holmes homosexual and not admitting it to anyone, including maybe even himself. The burden of keeping it secret was the reason he took dope.\\" Holmes' personal interests and particularly his feelings for Watson remain ambiguous in the film, including but not limited to Holmes' admission that he is \\"not a whole-hearted admirer of womankind\\", the enjoyment he derives from implying to outsiders that he and Watson are lovers, and his statement that Watson is \\"being presumptuous\\" by assuming there have been women in his life, among others. Mark Gatiss called The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes \\"the film that changed his life\\" for this reason: \\"It's a fantastically melancholy film. The relationship between Sherlock and Watson is treated beautifully; Sherlock effectively falls in love with him in the film, but it's so desperately unspoken.\\" Critical reception Upon its U.S. release, Vincent Canby called it a \\"comparatively mild Billy Wilder and rather daring Sherlock Holmes, not a perfect mix, perhaps, but a fond and entertaining one\\". Kim Newman, reviewing it in Empire magazine, described it as the \\"best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made\\" and \\"sorely underrated in the Wilder canon\\". Roger Ebert was more critical, giving the film two-and-a-half stars out of four. He wrote that it is \\"disappointingly lacking in bite and sophistication\\", that it \\"begins promisingly enough\\" but that \\"before the movie is 20 minutes old, Wilder has settled for simply telling a Sherlock Holmes adventure\\". Gene Siskel gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \\"a conventional and not very well written mystery\\" that seemed as though \\"Wilder had enough of an idea for a television variety show skit but unfortunately saw fit to expand it into a movie\\".Siskel, Gene (February 24, 1971). \\"Sherlock Holmes\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 7. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"the whole effect of the picture is a kind of affable blandness which, given the expectations you have of Billy Wilder, constitutes a disappointment\\".Champlin, Charles (December 23, 1970). \\"'Holmes' Opens Run Today\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 11. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, reviewing the film in 2002, wrote: \\"Billy Wilder's distinctive, irreverent slant on the world's greatest 'consulting detective' holds up reasonably well 32 years on; you wouldn't expect anything directed by Wilder and scripted by his long-time associate I. A. L. Diamond to be anything less than funny and watchable, and this is both\\". Home media In 1994, Image Entertainment released the film on LaserDisc, in what was called Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, The: Special Edition; the release includes \\"The Dreadful Business of the Naked Honeymooners\\"; the sequence was subtitled because no audio was available. The Region 1 DVD release restored portions of cut scenes that consists of soundtracks and a series of stills. A Blu-ray was released 22 July 2014 by Kino Lorber. It includes deleted scenes and bonus material.

History Originally a solo project from Olaf Th√∂rsen (born Carlo Andrea Magnani). Soon, Fabio Lione rejoined him after the first Labyrinth period (\\"No Limits\\"), and then what was supposed to be a solo project quickly turns into a band, taking its new name from Labyrinth's previous name (\\"Vision\\") and from the title that was supposed to be given to Olaf's first solo album (\\"Divine\\"). Completing the line up Mat Stancioiu (drums), Andrew McPauls (keyboards) and Andrea \\"Tower\\" Torricini (bass). In its first three years the band released two albums, and started touring (South American Tour in December 2000), where for the first time an Italian heavy metal band got the chance to play (and sold-out) in countries like Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Panama and Mexico. In 2001, the band started writing and recording the new album, titled \\"Send Me An Angel\\", that was released in January 2002. At the end of the same year, Olaf decided to leave Labyrinth, to focus just on Vision and also deciding to stop any rumours from some magazine, pretending to consider Vision as nothing but a \\"side project\\". For the same reason Andrew and Mat split from the band and were replaced by Oleg Smirnoff at keyboards (ex Eldritch) and Matteo Amoroso at drums (ex Athena). In 2003 the band started the songwriting for the third album, when Fabio started having some problem regarding the co-existence of his career and Vision Divine related duties. After a few months, they mutually agreed to split. They then proceeded to add new singer Michele Luppi, a vocalist with a previous experience in live performances. With this new line- up they completed the final songs for the album that was to be titled \\"Stream of Consciousness\\". The album was released in April 2004. With a brand new line-up and with renewed ambitions the band canceled any previous deal, deciding to join Scarlet Records for the Italian territory, King Records for the Japanese territory and Metal Blade for the rest of the world. In 2005, the band released \\"The Perfect Machine\\", which was recorded at Goldenworks Mixing Suite studio and produced by Stratovarius' leader Timo Tolkki. In 2006, Andrea \\"Tower\\" Torricini left the band for not being able to guarantee full-time dedication to the band, and Cristiano Bertocchi replaced him. By September, \\"The Perfect Machine\\", according to their website \\"was immediately described as one of the best Italian metal releases ever, becoming one of Scarlet's all time best-sellers\\". A new digipack was released containing four bonus tracks. Also, Riccardo \\"Ricky\\" Quaggliatto left the band due to personal problems, replaced by new drummer Alessandro Bissa. In 2007 Vision Divine recorded their album, \\"The 25th Hour\\", along with Timo Tolkki and Alessandro Bissa in New Sin Studios. It was released on June 29, 2007. In April 2008 Vision Divine announced Michele Luppi is no longer singing with Vision Divine, and in May 2008 Olaf Th√∂rsen announced that Fabio Lione rejoined the band as a full-time vocalist.

He attended the University of Hawaii, finished college in Utah in 1930, thereafter medical school in Utah and finished his degree as a medical doctor at Rush Medical School in Chicago in 1934.http://www.westnsurg.org/clowardaward.asp He attended as a resident at the University of Chicago under Dr. Bailey. He thereafter moved to Hawaii, where he became the archipelago's first practising neurosurgeon (until 1944). In connection with the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, he performed 44 craniotomies in 4 days . Dr. Cloward remains renowned for his contribution to spinal neurosurgery. He developed the technique called Posterior Lumbosacral Interbody Fusion (PLIF) and Anterior Cervical Interbody Fusion, the latter also known as Cloward procedure. Ralph Bingham Cloward was a member of the Western Neurosurgical Society for 40 years and served as its President in 1975. To say he and his wife Flossie were fond of the Western would be gross understatement. After his death in 2000 (in which Flossie preceded him), a number of Society members were desirous of creating an award in his name which would include a medal akin to the Cushing medallion awarded by the AANS. It was felt that Ralph's innovative talents and pioneering efforts to establish anterior cervical and posterior lumbar interbody fusion plus the numerous instruments he devised was just cause to honor him in perpetuity by bestowing an award upon neurosurgeons from around the world who also exemplified such capacity for epochal innovation and pioneering application. In 2002, the Society established the award with the gracious assistance of the surviving Cloward family. Ralph Cloward was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1908. He completed his undergraduate studies at the Universities of Hawaii and Utah and his medical education at the University of Utah and then at Rush Medical School in Chicago. He interned at St Luke's Hospital, Chicago, and then trained to become a neurosurgeon under Professor Percival Bailey, at the University of Chicago. He began his practice of neurology and neurosurgery in the Territory of Hawaii in 1938. He was the only American neurosurgeon available in the Pacific theater during WWII and was very busy from December 7, 1941 onward. Ralph Cloward Lecturing His academic accomplishments include visiting professorships at the University of Chicago, University of Oregon, University of Southern California, and Rush Medical School. He was Professor of Neurosurgery at the John A. Burns School of Medicine at the University of Hawaii. He is the author of numerous papers and book chapters and has lectured and operated all over the world. Dr Cloward's pioneering contributions encompass many areas of neurosurgery, but his enduring interest was the spine, where he devised three major operations. He first performed the posterior lumbar interbody fusion in 1943, reporting it in the Hawaiian Territorial Medical Association in 1945 and publishing it in the Journal of Neurosurgery in 1953. His unique approach for treating hyperhydrosis was reported in 1957. Independently, he conceived an anterior approach to the cervical spine, devised instruments for its implementation, and published his classic paper in the Journal of Neurosurgery on anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in 1958. He designed over 100 surgical instruments which continue to be used today by practicing neurosurgeons. Ralph with Lei Throughout his career, he educated the international community of neurosurgeons in the performance of the operations he devised. He contributed his time generously to patients who have been healed by his operations in the US and throughout the world. Hundreds of thousands of patients have benefited both directly and indirectly from his technical genius, insight, and enthusiasm as a teacher. Award recipients are provided travel, accommodation and registration expenses and present a special lecture on a topic of their choice during the meeting at which they receive the Award and medal.

Cambric (, or ),Longman Dictionary of Contemporary EnglishDefinition of \\"cambric\\" at Collins DictionaryDefinition of \\"cambric\\" at Oxford Dictionaries or batiste, one of the finest and densest kinds of cloth, is a lightweight plain-weave cloth, originally from the French commune of Cambrai, woven greige (neither bleached nor dyed), then bleached, piece-dyed and often glazed or calendered. Initially it was made of linen; later, the term came to be applied to cotton fabrics as well. Chambray is the same type of fabric, with a coloured (often blue or grey) warp and white filling; the name \\"chambray\\" replaced \\"cambric\\" in the United States in the early 19th century. Cambric is used as fabric for linens, shirts, handkerchieves, ruffs, lace, and needlework. Description A blue chambray fabric, made of a blend of linen and cotton, with blue warp and white filling Cambric is a finely woven cloth with a plain weave and a smooth surface appearance, the result of the calendering process. It may be made of linen or cotton. The fabric may be dyed any of many colors. Batiste is a kind of cambric; it is \\"of similar texture, but differently finished, and made of cotton as well as of linen\\". Batiste also may be dyed or printed. \\"Batiste\\" is the French word for \\"cambric\\" and some sources consider them to be the same, but in English, they are two distinct fabrics. Chambray, though the same type of fabric as cambric, has a coloured warp and a white weft, though it may be \\"made from any colour as you may wish, in the warp, and also in the filling; only have them differ from each other.\\" Chambray differs from denim in that \\"chambray‚Äôs warp and weft threads will alternate one over the other, while denim‚Äôs warp thread will go over two threads in the weft before going under one.\\" As a result, the color of chambray cloth is similar front and back, while the reverse side of denim is lighter in color. The term \\"cambric cloth\\" also applies to a stiff, usually black, open-weave cloth typically used for a dust cover on the bottom of upholstered furniture. History Cambric was originally a kind of fine, white, plain-weave linen cloth made at or near Cambrai.Oxford English Dictionary The word comes from Kameryk or Kamerijk, the Flemish name of Cambrai, which became part of France in 1677. The word is attested since 1530. It is a synonym of the French word batiste, itself attested since 1590. Batiste itself comes from the Picard batiche, attested since 1401 and derived from the old French battre for bowing wool. The modern form batiste, or baptiste, comes from a popular merge with the surname Baptiste, pronounced Batisse, as indicated by the use of the expressions thoile batiche (1499) and toile de baptiste (1536) for the same fabric. The alleged invention of the fabric, around 1300, by a weaver called Baptiste or Jean-Baptiste Cambray or Chambray, from the village of Castaing in the peerage of Marcoing, near Cambrai, has no historic ground. Cambric was a finer quality and more expensive than lawn (from the French laune, initially a plain-weave linen fabric from the city of Laon in France). Denoting a geographic origin from the city of Cambrai or its surroundings (Cambresis in French), cambric is an exact equivalent of the French cambr√©sine (), a very fine, almost sheer white linen plain-weave fabric, to be distinguished from cambrasine, a fabric comparable to the French lawn despite its foreign origin. Cambric is also close to chambray ( from a French regional variant of \\"Cambrai\\", a name which \\"also comes from Cambrai, the French city, where the material was originally made of linen yarn\\". Chambray (also spelled \\"chambrai\\") appears in North American English in the early 19th century. Though the term generally refers to a cotton plain weave with a colored warp and a white weft, close to gingham, \\"silk chambray\\" seems to have coexisted. Chambray was often produced during this period by the same weavers producing gingham. White linen cambric or batiste from Cambrai, noted for its weight and luster, was \\"preferred for ecclesiastical wear, fine shirts, underwear, shirt frills, cravats, collars and cuffs, handkerchiefs, and infant wear\\". Technical use sometime introduced a difference between cambric and batiste, the latter being of a lighter weight and a finer thread count. In the 18th century, after the prohibition of imports into England of French cambrics, with the development of the import of Indian cotton fabrics, similar cotton fabrics, such as nainsook, from the Hindi nainsukh (\\"eyes' delight\\"), became popular. These fabrics, initially called Scotch cambrics to distinguish them from the original French cambrics, came to be referred to as cotton cambrics or batistes. Some authors increased the confusion with the assumption the word batiste could come from the Indian fabric bastas. In the 19th century, the terms cambric and batiste gradually lost their association with linen, implying only different kind of fine plain- weave fabrics with a glossy finish. In 1907, a fine cotton batiste had 100 ends per inch in the finished fabric, while a cheap-grade, less than 60. At the same time, with development of an interest in coloured shirts, cambric was also woven in colours, such as the pink fabric used by Charvet for a corsage, reducing the difference between cambric and chambray. Moreover, the development and rationalization of mechanical weaving led to the replacement, for chambray, of coloured warp and white weft by the opposite, white warp and coloured weft, which allowed for longer warps. In popular culture The English folk song ballad \\"Scarborough Fair\\" has the lyric in the second verse \\"Tell her to make me a cambric shirt, / Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme / Sewn without seams or fine needlework, / Then she'll be a true love of mine.\\" It also appears in the David Bowie song, \\"Come And Buy My Toys\\" in the lyrics \\"You shall own a cambric shirt, you shall work your father's land.\\" In the Andrzej Sapkowski Witcher novel, The Last Wish, Renfri described her privileged upbringing, referring to \\"...dresses, shoes. Cambric knickers. Jewels and trinkets...\\" as if suggesting that the cambric material was an indication of the fabric's high quality. In Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, a cambric handkerchief with an H monogram is one of the clues in the murder.

Notable examples of container formats include archive files (such as the ZIP format) and formats used for multimedia playback (such as Matroska, MP4, and AVI). Among the earliest cross-platform container formats were Distinguished Encoding Rules and the 1985 Interchange File Format. Design Since the container does not describe how data or metadata is encoded, a program able to identify and open a container file might not be able to decode the contained data. This may be caused by the program lacking the required decoding algorithm. By definition, a container format could wrap any kind of data. Though there are some examples of such file formats (e.g. Microsoft Windows's DLL files), most container formats are specialized for specific data requirements. For example, a popular family of containers is found for use with multimedia file formats. Since audio and video streams can be coded and decoded with many different algorithms, a container format may be used to provide a single file format to the user. =Considerations= The differences between various container formats arise from five main issues: # Popularity; how widely supported a container is. # Overhead. This is the difference in file-size between two files with the same content in a different container. # Support for advanced codec functionality. Older formats such as AVI do not support new codec features like B-frames, VBR audio or VFR video natively. The format may be \\"hacked\\" to add support, but this creates compatibility problems. # Support for advanced content, such as chapters, subtitles, meta-tags, user-data. # Support of streaming media. =Single coding formats= In addition to pure container formats, which specify only the wrapper but not the coding, a number of file formats specify both a storage layer and the coding, as part of modular design and forward compatibility. Examples include JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) for containing JPEG data, and Portable Network Graphics (PNG). In principle, coding can be changed while the storage layer is retained; for example, Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) uses the PNG container format but provides animation, while JPEG Network Graphics (JNG) puts JPEG encoded data in a PNG container; in both cases however, the different formats have different magic numbers ‚Äì the format specifies the coding, though a MNG can contain both PNG-encoded images and JPEG-encoded images. Multimedia container formats The container file is used to identify and interleave different data types. Simpler container formats can contain different types of audio formats, while more advanced container formats can support multiple audio and video streams, subtitles, chapter-information, and meta-data (tags) ‚Äî along with the synchronization information needed to play back the various streams together. In most cases, the file header, most of the metadata and the synchro chunks are specified by the container format. For example, container formats exist for optimized, low-quality, internet video streaming which differs from high-quality Blu-ray streaming requirements. Container format parts have various names: \\"chunks\\" as in RIFF and PNG, \\"atoms\\" in QuickTime/MP4, \\"packets\\" in MPEG-TS (from the communications term), and \\"segments\\" in JPEG. The main content of a chunk is called the \\"data\\" or \\"payload\\". Most container formats have chunks in sequence, each with a header, while TIFF instead stores offsets. Modular chunks make it easy to recover other chunks in case of file corruption or dropped frames or bit slip, while offsets result in framing errors in cases of bit slip. Some containers are exclusive to audio: * AIFF (IFF file format, widely used on Mac OS platform) * WAV (RIFF file format, widely used on Windows platform) * XMF (Extensible Music Format) Other containers are exclusive to still images: * FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) still images, raw data, and associated metadata. * TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) still images and associated metadata. Other flexible containers can hold many types of audio and video, as well as other media. The most popular multi-media containers are: * 3GP (used by many mobile phones; based on the ISO base media file format) * ASF (container for Microsoft WMA and WMV, which today usually do not use a container) * AVI (the standard Microsoft Windows container, also based on RIFF) * DVR-MS (\\"Microsoft Digital Video Recording\\", proprietary video container format developed by Microsoft based on ASF) * Flash Video (FLV, F4V) (container for video and audio from Adobe Systems) * IFF (first platform-independent container format) * Matroska (MKV) (not limited to any coding format, as it can hold virtually anything; it is an open standard container format) * MJ2 - Motion JPEG 2000 file format, based on the ISO base media file format which is defined in MPEG-4 Part 12 and JPEG 2000 Part 12 * QuickTime File Format (standard QuickTime video container from Apple Inc.) * MPEG program stream (standard container for MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 elementary streams on reasonably reliable media such as disks; used also on DVD-Video discs) * MPEG-2 transport stream (a.k.a.

In 1901, the company merged with other companies to form The Imperial Tobacco Company to face competition from US manufacturers. The company also released several series of association football trading cards in the 1930s under the Player's brand. Nowadays the brands \\"Player\\" and \\"John Player Special\\" are owned and commercialised by Imperial Brands. History In March 1820, William Wright set up a small tobacco factory in Craigshill, Livingston, West Lothian. This business expanded and earned Wright a comfortable fortune. John Player bought the business in 1877. He had the Castle Tobacco Factories built in Radford, Nottingham, just west of the city centre. He had three large factory blocks built, but initially only one was used to process and pack tobacco. The other two blocks were loaned out to lace manufacturers until the business had expanded enough to use the additional space. John Player died in December 1884 and for the next nine years, the business was run by a small group of family friends until W G and J D Player were ready to take over the firm in 1893. The business became a private limited company in 1895, with a share capital of ¬£200,000. The business was run later by Player's sons John Dane Player and William Goodacre Player. In 1901, in response to competitive threats from the US, Player's merged with the Imperial Tobacco Group. The largest constituent of Imperial Tobacco was W. D. & H. O. Wills and the new group was run from Wills' head office in Bristol.John Player and Sons Ltd., tobacco manufacturers on The National Archives Player's retained its own identity with cigarette brands such as Navy Cut, No. 9, John Player Special, and Gold Leaf; loose tobacco brands such as No Name; and its distinctive logo of a smoking sailor in a navy-cut cap. Workers and staff of John Player at a Christmas party in the 1920s Player's Medium Navy Cut was the most popular by far of the three Navy Cut brands (there was also Mild and Gold Leaf, mild being today's rich flavour). Two thirds of all the cigarettes sold in Britain were Player's and two thirds of these were branded as Player's Medium Navy Cut. In January 1937, Player's sold nearly 3.5 million cigarettes (which included 1.34 million in London). The popularity of the brand was mostly amongst the middle class and in the South of England. It was smoked in the north but other brands were locally more popular. Production continued to grow until at its peak in the late 1950s, Player's was employing 11,000 workers (compared to 5,000 in 1926) and producing 15 brands of pipe tobacco and 11 brands of cigarettes. In the UK in 1968, in response to an increase in tobacco duty in the budget, Player's launched a new, cheaper brand, \\"Player's No.10\\". Priced at 3 s 2 d (16 p) for 20, it was the cheapest cigarette on the British market. Pack of Player's Extra Lights shown on a billboard in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. ca. 1980 A new factory (the 'Horizon' factory) was opened in the early 1970s on Nottingham's industrial outskirts, with better road access and more effective floor space, next to the headquarters of Boots the Chemists. On 15 April 2014, Imperial Tobacco announced that the Horizon factory would close in early 2016, bringing an end to cigarette and tobacco manufacture in Nottingham after over 130 years. The old factories in Radford, especially the cavernous No. 1 Factory which occupied the whole area between Radford Boulevard and Alfreton Road, bordered by Player Street and Beckenham Road, were gradually run down. The No. 2 Factory, facing onto Radford Boulevard with its distinctive clock (now plinthed in the retail park on the site) and the No. 3 factory (which faced onto Churchfield lane) with its rooftop 'John Player & Sons' sign, were demolished in the late 1980s. The iron railings and gates onto Radford Boulevard from the present retail park are the ones that surrounded No. 2 Factory ‚Äì the large gates (present vehicle access) were the entrance to the factory yard between No. 2 and No. 3 factories and the smaller gates were the pedestrian entrances to No. 2 factory itself.Pevsner, 1979, page 255 Manufacture Player's still trades, but with a much reduced workforce (down to about 700 employees due to increased efficiency). It is no longer one of Nottingham's Big Three employers (the other two being Boots the Chemists and Experian). As of 2020, the Player's Navy Cut, Players and John Player Special (JPS) brands are manufactured by Imperial Brands in the UK, whereas John Player Gold Leaf is manufactured by British American Tobacco (in some countries), and ranks as one of the best selling and most popular tobacco products in Pakistan. It is also present in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Arab States of the Persian Gulf. In South Asia, it is one of the biggest brands in the High category brand list. The JPS brand has also been re- positioned in the last several years and is now a UK mid-price cigarette brand. =United Kingdom= As of 2020, John Player Special (JPS) sell the following cigarettes in the UK: * JPS Black King Size * JPS Real Blue King Size and Superkings * JPS Silver Stream King Size and Superkings * JPS Crushball King Size (discontinued as of May, 20, 2020) * JPS Green Edge King Size and Superkings (discontinued as of May, 20, 2020) * JPS Triple Flow King Size They also sell a lower cost product marketed under the JPS Players Brand: * JPS Players Real Red King Size and Superkings * JPS Players Bright Blue King Size and Superkings * JPS Players Crushball King Size and Superkings (discontinued as of May, 20, 2020) * JPS Players Green Superkings (discontinued as of May, 20, 2020) Also the following rolling tobacco in 30g and 50g pouches: * JPS Hand Rolling Tobacco * JPS Players Tobacco * Gold Leaf JPS Quality Blend Tobacco =Canada= In Canada, Player's is manufactured by Imperial Tobacco Canada and is available in the following varieties, in both regular and king size: * Player's Original Flavour * Player's Rich Flavour * Player's Smooth Flavour * Player's Plain * Player's Black & Red * Player's Black & Gold * Player's Black & Silver * John Player Special * John Player Standard Blue * John Player Standard Silver * John Player Choice (discontinued) * Player's Special Blend Besides cigarettes, John Player & Sons also markets a line of rolling tobacco in Canada, the UK, and several European countries.

Ford introduced the John Player Special limited edition, (known as the JPS) in March 1975. Available only in black or white, the JPS featured yards of gold pinstriping to mimic the Formula 1 livery, gold-coloured wheels, and a bespoke upgraded interior of beige cloth and carpet trimmed with black. =Car racing= John Player's sponsorship of Team Lotus began with the Lotus 49 in Gold Leaf colours in the 1968 Tasman Series. It continued with the Lotus 49 and Lotus 72 in Formula One, changed to the black and gold John Player Special colours in 1972, and ended in 1986 with the Lotus 98T, as the team switched to the Camel-sponsored yellow livery the following season. In Australia, JPS Team BMW competed in the Australian Touring Car Championship between 1981 and 1987, with Jim Richards winning the series in 1985 and 1987. In 1981, BMW released a limited-edition road version of its 323i touring car in JPS colours to the Australian market and another in 1984.

After a blanket tobacco advertising ban was instituted in the Canadian Tobacco Act in 1988, Imperial created a new corporation, Player's Racing Ltd., that was strictly an auto racing promotion company. This took advantage of an exemption in the Act that allowed tobacco companies to sponsor \\"cultural events\\" using the company's proper name instead of a brand name. Player's Ltd. advertising looked nearly identical to Player's cigarette packs, and given that it was one of the few legal outlets for advertising, the company was extensively promoted both during race weekends and at other sporting events. Player's Racing promoted a number of Canadian drivers, including 1995 Indianapolis 500 and IndyCar champion Jacques Villeneuve, whose Forsythe-Green Racing team carried a Player's Ltd livery. The team would later carry on in CART as Player's Forsythe Racing, which after the Tobacco Act was struck down as violating the Charter of Rights, was able to use Player's branding. The team was competitive and featured Canadian drivers Greg Moore, Patrick Carpentier, Alex Tagliani, and in 2003, Paul Tracy. Tracy would win the championship in 2003, just as a new Tobacco Act ban took full effect for auto racing in October of 2003. The team would use a \\"GOOD BYE, CANADA\\" theme for Tracy and Carpentier's final races and not have explicit Player's branding. =Motorcycle racing= John Player began sponsoring Norton motorcycle racing in November 1971.Magrath, 1997, page 135 The racing was successful and Norton produced a version of the Norton Commando in John Player colours to exploit it. However, Norton's NVT parent company commercially declined and John Player withdrew sponsorship in 1974.Magrath, 1997, page 138 In the 1980s, Norton Motorcycles was revived and in 1988 John Player resumed racing sponsorship.Magrath, 1997, page 155 The racing succeeded again and in 1990‚Äì91 Norton produced a road-going version of its RCW588 racer, the Norton F1.Magrath, 1997, page 156 In 1991 Norton again commercially declined and John Player withdrew sponsorship for a second time.

Well over 100 international film stars took the stage to introduce screenings and discuss their career. The series was revived at the end of the 1970s as the Guardian Lectures. In the 1970s Player's operated a steamboat, Hero, for promotional purposes. Player's sponsored the Canadian Open tennis championship in the 1980s. From 1969 to 1987 John Player sponsored the John Player Sunday League for English county cricket clubs. Cigarette cards Player's were one of the first UK tobacco companies to include sets of general interest cards in their packs of cigarettes. One of the first sets, produced in 1893, was Castles and Abbeys. These cards were generally produced in sets of 50 and have since become highly collectable. Other sets produced include Street Cries (cries of street vendors) in 1913 and 1916; Footballers (1926); Civil Aircraft (1935); Motor Cars (1936) and a Coronation Series in 1937. John Player & Sons issued more than 200 sets of cards and some were reprinted in the 1990s. In sports, Player's released several cards series, mostly association football collections. One of them was the \\"Cup Winners\\" series, featuring FA Cup winning teams and the illustrated \\"Hints on association football\\" in 1934, where some football movements (kicks, passes, defensive tactics, etc.) were shown.The History of Football Cigarette Cards by John Simkin, on Spartacus Educational, September 1997 Player's also released a cricket series in 1934.Player's cricket cards on Collectors.com File:BradmanCigCard.jpgDonald Bradman from Australian Cricket Team Tour of England Series, 1934 File:Players football hint kick.jpg\\"Hints on association football\\" Series, 1934 File:Player's cards July 16, 1932.jpgPlayer's cards exhibited in 1932 File:CC09 DH Comet.jpgde Havilland DH.88 Comet, no. 9 of 50 from 'Civil Aircraft,' 1935 File:Player's cigarettes 5 Archbishop of Canterbury.jpgArchbishop of Canterbury from Player's Coronation Series, 1937 File:Player's cigarettes 27 Order of the Indian Empire.jpgOrder of the Indian Empire from Player's Coronation Series, 1937 In popular culture * The cover art for Procol Harum's 1969 album A Salty Dog and Haruomi Hosono's 1973 album Tropical Dandy are pastiches of the Player's Navy Cut sailor logo.

In August 2004, the site was re-written into a searchable database exclusively for the MMORPG World of Warcraft, as well as a plug-in that could be used in the game itself to gather additional data. The website was discontinued on November 30, 2010 when its parent company, ZAM Network (now Fanbyte), merged it with its similar database website Wowhead. Since the launch of World of Warcraft Classic, Thottbot is now redirected to the Classic version of Wowhead, with a \\"Thottbot theme\\" available. History The original Thottbot was a news aggregator created by Bill \\"Aftathott\\" Dyess, founder of the EverQuest guild \\"Afterlife\\", in March 2001. Its purpose was to comb various video game websites for news and information on a number of MMORPGs with a focus on EverQuest, and later grew to include other games such as PlanetSide, Meridian 59, Dark Age of Camelot, and World of Warcraft. In August 2004, Thottbot was re-written to become a searchable database that focused exclusively on World of Warcraft three months prior to the game's retail release. Thottbot would also become affiliated with Cosmos, a popular collection of user-interface modifications. The associated World of Warcraft plug-in, which is programmed in the Lua programming language, collected information while a person is playing the game. Users could then upload the information to the website's database. The information on the website only came from players using the plug-in and who took the time to upload the data. Information contained on Thottbot included descriptions of items, weapons and armor pieces which web users could browse and search. Users could also create a profile, so others could search and view different players. This required the user to run the plug-in, and since not every player had the plug-in, not every player was represented on the database. Thottbot owner ZAM Network acquired the World of Warcraft database Wowhead in June 2007 for $1 million. The website was discontinued on November 30, 2010. The website's URL now simply redirects the reader to Wowhead. For a time, some pages of Thottbot were still able to be accessed through Wowhead, but on November 16, 2016, the Thottbot site was completely discontinued, and all Thottbot URLs began to forward to their equivalent pages on Wowhead.  Popularity and reputation  Simon Carless of Gamasutra described Thottbot as a \\"major item listing site\\". As of March 9, 2008, web traffic company Alexa reported that Thottbot.com was the 250th most visited site on the internet. During the 2006 Austin Game Conference, World of Warcraft lead designer Rob Pardo spoke of the hardcore market and casual market for World of Warcraft, saying \\"The people that don't go to ThottBot are the casual players, and they're the ones you need to hold the hand of.\\" A January 2007 article in the Detroit Free Press named the site as a good place to find jewelcrafting designs discovered during the beta test of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.

It was named Mansh≈´ or Mansy√ª in short. History The Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company was established in late 1938 under the supervision of the Japanese governmentFrancillon, p. 22. as a subsidiary of the Nakajima Aircraft Company of Japan. Its main plant was located in Harbin, Manchukuo. From 1941 to 1945, Mansh≈´ produced a total of 2,196 airframes (eighth among Japanese airframe manufacturers),Francillon, p. 22. of which 798 were combat aircraft. The company also produced 2,168 aircraft engines (sixth among Japanese aircraft engine manufacturers).Francillon, p. 22. In addition, Mansh≈´ provided repair services for a variety of aircraft in the Manchukuo Air Force and for Imperial Japanese Army Air Force units stationed in Manchukuo. The Red Army confiscated the companys factory and equipment in 1945 at the end of World War II, and the Soviets took much of its equipment back to the Soviet Union as war reparations.

According to Hunkin, the show's creator, the programme was developed from his comic strip The Rudiments of Wisdom, which he researched and drew for the Observer newspaper over a period of 14 years. Three separate groupings of the broadcast were produced and originally shown between 1988 and 1993 on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, with the production subsequently airing on The Learning Channel and the Discovery Channel.  Contents  Each of the Secret Life's individual series covers a particular set of machines. The first addresses household appliances, while the second includes devices used outside the home, such as the car. The third series examines the contraptions and gadgets used in a modern office. A typical example of the animation style used throughout the seriesEach episode was given an individual title, such as The Secret Life of the Vacuum Cleaner. Although ostensibly about a specific appliance or piece of technology, the scope of each episode was often widened to cover related technologies as well. For example, the video recorder episode looked at magnetic recording from its origins, and featured Hunkin and Garrod recording their voices on a crude home-made \\"audio tape\\" consisting of rust-coated sticky tape. Another aspect of the programmes was their use of humorous animations based on Hunkin's own drawings. These cartoons were often based around the historical figures involved in the development of a particular technology. Furthermore, the illustrations were an artistic commentary on modern society, including segments on lift fantasies (as shown in the episode \\"The Lift\\") and corporate disregard for individuals' rights (featured in many episodes, including \\"The Radio\\" and \\"The Car\\"). Each programme concluded with an epilogue consisting of an elaborate installation, which resembled an aspect of the machine or technology under discussion. One example was a giant statue resembling a robot, which had been built from scrap computer monitors, printers and other parts, which was blown up using pyrotechnics. Hunkin described the destruction as an allegorical point that computers are just a collection of transistors and lack \\"superhuman intelligence\\".  Production  All the series used animation to help explain various aspect of how the subject devices function. The animation for the series was done by Hunkin himself in a uniquely recognisable format.

The creations, some of which were decorative, others functional, show the potential uses of broken machinery. An extreme example is the giant clock powered by steam.  Availability  The series was released on video tape and DVD. It subsequently became available on online streaming sites on the Internet.

He has written nearly all of Ash's notable works, such as \\"Oh Yeah\\", \\"Shining Light\\", \\"Girl From Mars\\", \\"Kung Fu\\", and \\"Goldfinger\\". In November 2014, he released his debut solo album Lost Domain. Early life Timothy James Arthur Wheeler was born in Downpatrick on 4 January 1977, the son of Rosalind E. M. (n√©e Dickson), the daughter of a Northern Bank manager, and George Bomfforde Wheeler (1932‚Äì2011), a solicitor and later judge. He is a great-great-grandson of Rev. George Bomfforde Wheeler, who was editor of The Irish Times from 1859 to 1877.The Illustrated London News, 10 November 1877, p. 462 He attended Down High School with his fellow band members Mark Hamilton and Rick McMurray. Music career =Ash= Wheeler won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Pop Song in 2001 for \\"Shining Light\\". =Other work= In 1999, Wheeler contributed guitar and backing vocals on The Rentals' album Seven More Minutes. He has also contributed backing vocals Bob Geldof's Band Aid 20 2004 single \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" and on Arthur Baker's song, \\"Glow\\". As part of Channel 4's program The JD Set, Wheeler worked with Emmy The Great, The Crookes, And So I Watch You From Afar, and Ma Mentor, joining each band in covering songs by Pixies, and then performing at London's XOYO on 24 March 2011. Wheeler has also been involved with film and TV soundtrack work, most notably Ashes (2012), Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond (2014) and the Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015). =Emmy the Great= Wheeler has collaborated frequently in recent years with Emma-Lee Moss, AKA Emmy The Great, the duo have performed Ash track \\"Tracers\\" on several occasions, and in 2011 Tim, Emma and Euan Hinshelwood covered Robert Manning's song \\"Washington Parks\\", the cover was released as part of a collection of covers to raise awareness of multiple sclerosis. The pair acoustically performed a set of Ash and Emmy The Great songs, as well as some covers at Willowstone Festival on 1 July 2011. In November 2011 the pair released a Christmas album, entitled This Is Christmas (Infectious, 2011). =Lost Domain= In September 2014, Wheeler announced the release of his first solo album, Lost Domain, a heartfelt and emotional response to the loss of his father George to dementia. Lost Domain was released on Sony Red on 3 November 2014, with a portion of the proceeds being donated to The Alzheimer's Society, a charity Wheeler has worked closely with since his father's death in 2011. Lost Domain is an album in which Wheeler battles to come to terms with his loss, charting his father's rapid decline into illness, his death and the tumultuous effect that it had on his life over the course of 11 songs. As Wheeler explains: ‚ÄúAfter losing my father to dementia, I felt the need to personally do something to fight Alzheimer‚Äôs. My friend Neil Hannon from The Divine Comedy's father also has Alzheimer's so we put on a concert in Belfast in November 2011 with The Divine Comedy, The Undertones and Ash to raise funds and awareness for the Alzheimer's Society. Since then I've had close links with The Alzheimer's Society and this year was involved with the Dementia Friends campaign. I'm proud to continue to support them and raise more awareness with the album Lost Domain.\\" Recorded in Ash's New York studio, Wheeler played almost everything himself, roping in musician friends when he needed a hand: Andy Burrows formerly of Razorlight and Fred Aspelin (Alberta Cross) each played some drums; Ilan Eshkeri and Oliver Kraus helped with the string and brass arrangements performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra; Leanne Macomber from Ejecta and Neon Indian sang; and Moon Hooch's Wenzl McGowen played saxophone. There is even a sample of Wheeler's father's piano playing on the album's epic centerpiece \\"Medicine\\". The album track \\"The First Sign of Spring\\" is available to listen to on YouTube now. Wheeler announced his first solo dates to support the release of the album on 4‚Äì7 November. He played Bush Hall ‚Äì London, Night & Day- Manchester, ABC2 ‚Äì Glasgow and Oh Yeah Centre ‚Äì Belfast. In addition, he supported Andy Burrows in Amsterdam and Brussels. Musical style =Equipment= Wheeler is perhaps most recognised for using a Gibson Flying V, which he has frequently used live since 1998 onwards. His Flying V has a 1950s Zebra Coil PAF pickup, and has also been modified in the past for pyrotechnics; the Flaming Flying V acts as a flamethrower, firing from between the V part of the guitar body. Prior to this, Wheeler mainly used various Gibson Les Paul models. He also plays a Gibson SG and Gretsch Silver Jet, which was frequently used both live and in the studio since Ash's album Twilight of the Innocents. For heavier tracks such as \\"The Dead Disciples\\", Wheeler has used a Fender Telecaster. In 2011, he purchased a Gretsch 1966 Sal Fabrio, for work in the studio and rehearsals. He also uses a Gibson Custom Inspired By Kiefer Sutherland Semi-Hollow KS-336 guitar on a number of tracks live, including songs such as \\"Walking Barefoot\\". He used an Elliot Easton signature model Gibson Firebird on a number of songs during the Kablammo! tour. Wheeler predominately uses a Mesa Boogie Road King Series II amplifier, and also sometimes uses a Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier amplifier. He uses numerous effects pedals which are housed in a rack and controlled via MIDI. His effects pedals include; an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synthesizer, a Dunlop Crybaby 95Q Wah pedal, a Death By Audio Fuzz War, a Carl Martin HeadRoom Reverb, an Electro-Harmonix Poly Chorus, a Morpheus Droptune, a Catalinbread Karma Suture Fuzz, a Mesa Boogie Tone Burst, a Coloursound Tonebender, a Moog Moogerfooger Phaser, an ADA Flanger pedal, and a Nocto Loco octave pedal which replaced a Korg synthesiser in his effects rack. Wheeler controls his pedals in his effects rack using a Voodoo Lab Ground Control Pro MIDI foot controller. The Flying V guitar that Wheeler set on fire on the Ash Meltdown tour is now on display at the Oh Yeah centre in Belfast. The Oh Yeah centre is dedicated to the music of Northern Ireland and was named after the song \\"Oh Yeah\\" by Ash. =Lyrical themes and writing= With the release of the band's fifth studio record Twilight of the Innocents, in 2007, Wheeler spoke of how if the group hadn't toured so heavily they would have been more prolific, that: \\"It would have been cool to have twice as many songs by now. I definitely could have done it, but if I go on tour I have to stop writing. Writing needs to be a relaxing process and you need peace and quiet and the right stuff around you. Whenever we take a break I could write a song every day, pretty much.\\" Personal life Wheeler is an Arsenal FC fan, which began during his nine-year stint living in Highbury. He has been dating French model and art director Julia Restoin Roitfeld since 2018.

The H-reflex test is performed using an electric stimulator, which gives usually a square-wave current of short duration and small amplitude (higher stimulations might involve alpha fibers, causing an F-wave, compromising the results), and an EMG set, to record the muscle response. That response is usually a clear wave, called H-wave, 28-35 ms after the stimulus, not to be confused with an F-wave. An M-wave, an early response, occurs 3-6 ms after the onset of stimulation. The H and F-waves are later responses. As the stimulus increases, the amplitude of the F-wave increases only slightly, and the H-wave decreases, and at supramaximal stimulus, the H-wave will disappear. The M-wave does the opposite of the H-wave. As the stimulus increases the M-wave increases. There is a point of minimal stimulus where the M-wave is absent and the H-wave is maximal. H-reflex is analogous to the mechanically induced spinal stretch reflex (for example, knee jerk reflex). \\"The primary difference between the H-reflex and the spinal stretch reflex is that the H-reflex bypasses the muscle spindle, and, therefore, is a valuable tool in assessing modulation of monosynaptic reflex activity in the spinal cord.\\" Although stretch reflex gives just qualitative information about muscle spindles and reflex arc activity; if the purpose of the test to compare performances from different subjects, H-reflex should be used. In that case, in fact, latencies (ms) and amplitudes (mV) of H-wave can be compared. H-reflex amplitudes measured by EMG are shown to decrease significantly with applied pressure such as massage and tapping to the cited muscle. The amount of decrease seems to be dependent on the force of the pressure, with higher pressures resulting in lower H-reflex amplitudes. H-reflex levels return to baseline immediately after pressure is released except in high pressure cases which had baseline levels returned within the first 10 seconds. After about 5 days in zero gravity, for instance in orbit around Earth, the h-reflex diminishes significantly. It is generally assumed that this is due to a marked reduction in the excitability of the spinal cord in zero gravity. Once back on Earth, a marked recovery occurs during the first day, but it can take up to 10 days to return to normal. The H-reflex was the first medical experiment completed on the International Space Station. History It was first described by Paul Hoffmann (hence the name) in 1910.Hoffmann P.

Thermopylae Aristodemus was one of only two Spartan survivors, as he was not present at the last stand. Along with a comrade, Eurytus, Aristodemus was stricken with a disease of the eye (they were \\"·ΩÄœÜŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒºŒπ·ø∂ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ\\" as Herodotus wrote), causing King Leonidas to order the two to return home before the battle, but Eurytus turned back, though blind, and met his end charging into the fray.Herodotus, 7.229Schmitz vol 1. p304 The Greek historian Herodotus believed that had both Aristodemus and Eurytus returned alive, or had Aristodemus alone been ill and excused from combat, the Spartans would have ascribed no blame to Aristodemus. However, because Eurytus did turn back and died in combat, Aristodemus was regarded as a coward and subjected to humiliation and disgrace at the hands of his compatriots; in the words of Herodotus, \\"no man would give him a light for his fire or speak to him; he was called Aristodemus the Coward.\\"Herodotus 7.231 The other survivor of the Three Hundred was a man named Pantites, who had been sent by Leonidas on an embassy to Thessaly. He failed to return to Thermopylae in time for the battle, and on finding himself in disgrace in Sparta, hanged himself.Herodotus, 7.232 Plataea At the Battle of Plataea, Aristodemus fought with such fury that the Spartans regarded him as having redeemed himself. Although they removed the black mark against his name, they did not award him any special honors for his valour because he had fought with suicidal recklessness; the Spartans regarded as more valorous those who fought while still wishing to live. Aristodemus charged, berserker-like, out of the phalanx and fought, in the opinion of Herodotus, with the most bravery of all the Spartans before falling in battle.Herodotus, 9.71 In popular culture Aristodemos is the main figure in Caroline Snedeker's popular historical novel The Coward of Thermopylae (1911), retitled in 1912 as The Spartan. Aristodemos appears as a recurring background character in Steven Pressfield's 1998 novel Gates of Fire. Four years before the battle of Thermopylae, he is part of an ultimately unsuccessful four-man envoy sent to Rhodes to dissuade the Rhodian navy from serving Xerxes. While at Rhodes the envoy encounters a group of Egyptian marines, led by a captain named Ptammitechus (whom they simply call 'Tommie'), and is given a tour of their warships. Aristodemos is later mentioned as being one of the three hundred selected to accompany Leonidas to hold up the Persian army at the Hot Gates. He is also part of a three-man envoy sent to Athens a short time before the battle to finalize details of the allied Greek forces' defenses. At the Hot Gates before the battle is begun, a Persian herald is sent to convince the Greek allies to submit; the herald turns out to be Tommie, who calls out by name for each man of the envoy he had met at Rhodes (all four of whom are among the three hundred), before requesting to speak with Leonidas directly. Despite their refusal to surrender, Tommie presents a golden goblet as a gift to the Greeks, handing it to Aristodemos who in turn passes it to Leonidas. Before the fighting on the third day, Aristodemos is mentioned along with Eurytus to have been evacuated to the village of Alpenoi after eye-inflammation rendered them both sightless. Finally, Aristodemos's shameful treatment upon his return to Sparta is recalled, as well as his redemption by the heroic way he fought at Plataea. A character slightly based on Aristodemus named Dilios appears in and partly narrates Frank Miller's 1998 graphic novel 300, which retells the events of the Battle of Thermopylae. In the 2006 movie adaptation of the same name, Dilios was portrayed by David Wenham. Unlike Aristodemus, Dilios is not ordered home because of infection, although he does lose an eye in combat. It was so that he can use his oratorial skills to tell the story of his comrades in order to inspire the rest of Sparta, and then all of Greece. As such, he faces no scorn from his comrades on his return, and is later seen leading the Spartan army into battle at Plataea. The character also appears in the sequel, where he follows Queen Gorgo into battle and fights alongside her and Themistocles. The three of them survive the events of the film.

History The radio station started out as University Radio Surrey in 1972, before being rebranded as Guildford Campus Radio (GCR) in 1990. In 2001 the radio station was renamed GU2 after the postcode prefix of the area surrounding the University campus. Following the rebranding GU2 won the title of \\"Best Station\\" at the 2002 SRA Awards reflecting the pursuit of an innovative format featuring favourites such as The J-Team, Ben Lander, Gareth Davies, Pinal Gandhi (\\"P\\") with The Vibe and a fair smattering of Greek language and religious content overnight. GU2 also won the award for \\"Best Interview\\" at the 2010 SRA awards. James Alexander won the award for his interview with Sue Doughty, member of the Liberal Democrats and most recently Adam Read and Olivia Jones took Silver in Student Radio Chart Show 2013. In 2004 the radio station was visited by the Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex as part of his trip to the University. Also in that year GU2, along with many other UK student radio stations, faced a crisis when the Student Broadcast Network (SBN) closed down. SBN had not only been providing the station with a source of income, but also providing news and music programmes to fill gaps in the schedule. Other notable visitors include Cliff Richard who was interviewed by the station. In more recent times, members have conducted interviews with We Are Scientists, Wheatus, Alter Bridge, Glasvegas, The Twang, The Commitments, Venga Boys, Dan Le Sac Vs. Scroobius Pip, Empire of the Sun, Ivyrise, Anberlin, Faithless and White Lies. In 2010, the station featured in national newspaper, The Guardian, in an article by Lucy Tobin, about the importance of extra-curricular activities to give employability. In 2013, the station was re-branded to Stag Radio; the most recent and current radio name that has been taken on by Surrey Student Union. Organisation Stag Radio is a society and is run by a committee elected at annual general meetings held at the university. All students of the university are eligible to stand and vote in these elections. Stag Radio society has a constitution based on that of its parent body- the University of Surrey Students' Union.

Members Members Archer Prewitt, Mark Greenberg, John Upchurch, and Barry Phipps were largely self-taught musicians who experimented with various instruments and played in a manner they described as the Chinese fire drill method, in which they rotated instruments during live sets. For example, though Phipps often played bass, he was as likely to play guitar, drums, bass, saxophone, or theremin. Originally considered a loungecore band because of their name and because they covered some Martin Denny tunes, they considered themselves a garage jazz band. Unfortunately, when the lounge/easy listening revival bubbled up after the first Esquivel CD reissue in 1994, the Coctails‚Äîbecause of their name‚Äîwere too-often presumed to be part of the trend. However, the foursome were always curious musical adventurers and eager for a challenge, and in their final years they explored avant-garde jazz and indie rock, so their stylistic changes weren't entirely due to being pigeon-holed as musical lounge lizards. The four group members were also visual artists, and using a printshop which was installed in their loft created their own Coctails' line of merchandise, including buttons, calendars, t-shirts, news letters, and similar music giveaways. They even created their own line of stuffed dolls in the likeness of each band member. Later a line of 12\\" action figures of the band were produced in Japan by Presspop Gallery as well as a book of the art of the Coctails' flyers. At some point during a Coctails show, the audience would be served popcorn in bags (and sometimes boxes) imprinted with the band's images. The band created their own vinyl only record label called Hi-Ball Records. In addition to issuing their own records, they released records by the Vandermark Quartet (featuring Ken Vandermark), Masters Of The Obvious, Dame Darcy, Evergreen (featuring Britt Walford of Slint), Log Letters (featuring Mark Greenberg from the Coctails), Dianogah (featuring well known poster artist Jay Ryan (artist)), Dump (band) (a side band by James McNew of Yo La Tengo), and Brokeback (band) (a project of Douglas McCombs, bassist of Tortoise (band)).

On September 25, 1965 in a game against the Kansas City A's, Monbouquette was the starting pitcher versus 58-year-old Hall of Famer Satchel Paige. Monbouquette threw a complete game for his tenth win of the season, but became the final strikeout victim of Paige's career in the 3rd inning. After going 96-91 with Boston, Monbouquette was sent to the Detroit Tigers before the 1966 season. He also pitched for the New York Yankees and finished his career with the San Francisco Giants on September 3, 1968. He never made the postseason. Monbouquette was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2000. He was a pitching coach for Detroit Single-A affiliate team, Oneonta Tigers. Bill was also once professional hockey player Wayne Muloin's brother-in-law. When people would ask him for an autograph, he surprised people because although he pitched and batted right-handed, his hand writing was left handed. Illness and death In May 2008, the Boston Globe reported that Monbouquette was suffering from acute myelogenous leukemia. The chemotherapy and drug treatment he received had the disease in remission, but he needed a bone marrow and stem cell transplant to be cured. The Red Sox, in conjunction with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, on June 7, 2008 encouraged fans to enroll in the National Marrow Donor Registry at Tufts University in hopes of finding a suitable donor for Monbouquette and others suffering from the disease. In 2010, the Boston rock band The Remains released a song, \\"Monbo Time\\", as a tribute to Monbouquette. The Remains pledged to donate 50% of the revenues they receive from sales of the song to cancer research. Boston Herald, April 22, 2010; nesn.com, April 14, 2010) Monbouquette died on January 25, 2015, aged 78 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Medford Massachusetts. He was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, Medford, Massachusetts.

Souter was the first lighthouse in the world to be actually designed and built specifically to use alternating electric current, the most advanced lighthouse technology of its day. First lit in the 1870s, Souter was described at the time as 'without doubt one of the most powerful lights in the world'. Location The lighthouse is located on Lizard Point, but takes its name from Souter Point, which is located a mile to the south. This was the intended site for the lighthouse, but it was felt that Lizard Point offered better visibility, as the cliffs there are higher, so the lighthouse was built there instead. The Souter Lighthouse name was retained in order to avoid confusion with the then recently built Lizard Lighthouse in Cornwall. Souter Lighthouse is approximately three miles south of the mouth of the River Tyne. Some four miles or so to the north of the mouth of the Tyne is a sister Victorian lighthouse, St Mary's Lighthouse, on St Mary's Island. This has now been decommissioned, but is open to visitors. St Mary's Lighthouse can be seen with the naked eye from the top of Souter Lighthouse.Personal observation History The lighthouse was a much-needed aid to navigation due to the number of wrecks on the dangerous reefs of Whitburn Steel which lay directly under the water in the surrounding area. In one year alone ‚Äì 1860 ‚Äì there were 20 shipwrecks. This contributed to making this coastline the most dangerous in the country, with an average of around 44 shipwrecks per every mile of coastline. =19th century=  Construction  Designed by James Douglass it was opened in 1871, with construction supervised by civil engineer Henry Norris for Trinity House. The contract for building the lighthouse and keeper's cottage was reported in March 1869 as being ¬£8,000 and was awarded to the local firm of James Todd, after complaints that local builders had not had the opportunity to reply to tender as it had not been advertised locally. The foundation stone was ceremonially laid by Admiral Collinson's sister on 9 June 1869. After completing this project Douglass and Norris moved on to the building of Hartland Point Lighthouse in Devon.  Electricity  Souter Lighthouse's original generator Trinity House had carried out an extensive testing and selection process over five years and included comparison with oil lights and examination of equipment in Britain and France. The 800,000 candle power light was generated using carbon arcs and not an incandescent light bulb, and could be seen for up to 26 miles. The optics were designed and built by James Chance in 1870. The main lens array consisted of a third-order fixed catadioptric optic surrounded by a revolving assembly of eight vertical condensing-prisms which produced one flash every minute. In addition to the main light a red/white sector light shone from a window in the tower below the lantern, to highlight hazardous rocks to the south; it was powered using light diverted (through a set of mirrors and lenses) from the landward side of the main arc lamp. Carbon arc lights for lighthouses were pioneered by Professor Frederick Hale Holmes with experiments in (1857-60) at Blackwell and South Foreland Lighthouse off the Kent coast (described in a lecture by Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution) and a test installation at Dungeness in 1862 and complete installation at Souter in 1870. Electricity was provided by two of Holmes' own magneto electric generators for which he took out a series of patents during those years. One of the Holmes generators built in 1867 and used at Souter is now on display at the Science Museum, London. The generators were driven by one of a pair of 3 hp steam engines, located in the engine-house, which also drove an air-pump to feed the pressure tank of a foghorn. (The engines were worked alternately: one week on, one week off.)  Charts and engineering (1875)  ELLIOT(1875) p163 - Plate XV.

Souter Point, chart of vicinity.jpgChart of vicinity (1875) =20th century= The 1914 biform optic in the lighthouse. In 1914 the pioneering electric light at Souter was replaced with more conventional oil lamps. At the same time Chance Brothers provided a new, much larger bi-form first-order catadioptric revolving optic, which remains in situ in the tower; as a bi-form lens it is double-height, containing two lamps, one above the other. (A separate lamp was used for the sector light, lower down in the tower). In 1952 the lighthouse was again converted to run on (mains) electric power. The mechanism which caused the optic (lens array) to revolve was driven by clockwork until 1983. Souter Lighthouse was decommissioned in 1988,http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/ten-interesting-facts- south-shields-1342148 but continued to serve as a radio navigation beacon up until 1999 when it was finally closed.  Present day  As Souter was never automated, it remains much in its original operational state except for updates during its lifespan to its lantern and electrical apparatus. Today the decommissioned Souter lighthouse is owned by the National Trust and open to the public; the engine room, light tower and keeper's living quarters are all on view. There is also an outdoor play area, Trusty Club and indoor activities to accommodate young visitors. Two of the former lighthouse keepers' cottages are used as National Trust holiday cottages. The lighthouse is said to be haunted, and has even featured on British TV's Most Haunted ghost-hunting programme.http://www.tv.com/shows/most-haunted/souter-lighthouse-282470/  Foghorn  Present-day foghorn The original fog signal at Souter was a single Holmes-designed reeds, housed in a foghorn house to the east of the lighthouse tower; it sounded one blast every 45 seconds and was soon replaced by a pair of twin horns facing out to sea, angled north-east and south-east. Compressed air was piped to the foghorn from the engine room alongside the lighthouse, where the air compressor was driven by a common drive shaft from the engines powering the magnetos. A siren replaced the reeds in February 1879. The horns were superseded by twin Rayleigh trumpets in 1919, when a more powerful siren was installed; the foghorn house was remodelled at the seaward corners to accommodate them. The siren signal was a 5-second sound of 480 Hz every 5 minutes. The current pair of exponential horns dates from 1953, when a Stone Chance diaphone signal was installed. This produced a five-second blast every 30 seconds in poor weather, up until 1988 when Souter Lighthouse was decommissioned by Trinity House. The diaphone remains in working order and is sounded regularly for visitors throughout the year.

The two compounds are geometric isomers. The E-isomer is known as geranial or citral A. The Z-isomer is known as neral or citral B.  Occurrence  Citral is present in the oils of several plants, including lemon myrtle (90‚Äì98%), Litsea citrata (90%), Litsea cubeba (70‚Äì85%), lemongrass (65‚Äì85%), lemon tea-tree (70‚Äì80%), Ocimum gratissimum (66.5%), Lindera citriodora (about 65%), Calypranthes parriculata (about 62%), petitgrain (36%), lemon verbena (30‚Äì35%), lemon ironbark (26%), lemon balm (11%), lime (6‚Äì9%), lemon (2‚Äì5%), and orange.Fenaroli, G., Furia, T.E., Bellanca, N., Handbook of Flavor Ingredients, Lawless, J., The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Essential Oils, The Aromatic Plant Project  Uses  Citral has a strong lemon (citrus) odor. Neral's lemon odor is less intense, but sweeter. Citral is therefore an aroma compound used in perfumery for its citrus effect. Citral is also used as a flavor and for fortifying lemon oil. It also has strong antimicrobial qualities, and pheromonal effects in acari and insects. Citral is used in the synthesis of vitamin A, lycopene, ionone, and methylionone, to mask the smell of smoke. Health and safety information Two studies showed 1‚Äì1.7% of people to be allergic to citral, with allergies frequently reported. Citral on its own is strongly sensitizing to allergies; the International Fragrance Association recommends that citral only be used in association with substances that prevent a sensitizing effect.

It has three primates (leaders), each representing a tikanga, who share authority. The Anglican Church is an apostolic church, tracing its bishops back to the apostles via holy orders. A New Zealand Prayer Book, He Karakia Mihinare o Aotearoa (ANZPB/HKMOA), containing traditional liturgies, rites and blessings, is central to the church's worship. Since the 1960s and 1970s, the New Zealand Anglican Church has pursued a decidedly more liberal course; it has approved the marriage by a priest in a church of someone whose earlier marriage was dissolved (even though the former spouse still lives), and has approved blessings for same-sex couples. The Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia is not established as an official church of any sovereign state, unlike the Church of England from which it grew. However, Anglicans have taken a leadership role on New Zealand state occasions. The 2018 census recorded 314,913 Anglicans in the New Zealand part of the church. Names Until 1992, the church was known as the \\"Church of the Province of New Zealand\\", and was often referred to as the \\"Church of England\\". It is now known as the \\"Anglican Church\\", reflecting its membership of the Anglican Communion. Members of the church are referred to as \\"Anglicans\\". History =First New Zealand Anglicans= The MƒÅori name for the New Zealand Anglican Church, (the missionary church), reveals its origins in the work of the first missionaries to arrive in New Zealand. Anglicans began missionary work among MƒÅori in 1814 through the Church Missionary Society (CMS), a voluntary evangelical group within the Church of England. Evangelicalism began as a movement within 19th-century Protestant churches in Britain that combined humanitarian activism with an emphasis on the personal experience of sin, and the salvation gained through the death of Jesus Christ. The CMS mission to New Zealand was begun by Samuel Marsden, the Anglican chaplain in New South Wales. He had met the NgƒÅpuhi chiefs Te Pahi and Ruatara when they travelled outside New Zealand, and they encouraged him to visit their country. Ruatara provided protection for the first mission station, at Rangihoua in the Bay of Islands. This 1820 painting shows NgƒÅpuhi chiefs Waikato (left) and Hongi Hika, and Anglican missionary Thomas Kendall For the first years of the mission, intertribal Musket Wars hampered the missionaries‚Äô movements and MƒÅori interest in their message. Personal disputes between the early missionaries, and their involvement in trading muskets, also compromised their efforts. However one of the first CMS missionaries, Thomas Kendall, successfully produced the first written versions of the MƒÅori language. Henry Williams arrived to lead the New Zealand mission in 1823 and gave firm local leadership and new direction, emphasising evangelisation and peace-making between tribes. After Hongi Hika's death in 1828 the mission became less dependent on the goodwill and economic support of MƒÅori. Henry's brother William Williams arrived in 1826 and led the work of translating the prayer book and the Bible into MƒÅori. As MƒÅori became literate, some also became evangelists for the new teaching. The number of MƒÅori converts grew rapidly in the 1830s and early 1840s and MƒÅori began to include Christian ideas in their world view. The conversion of a whole tribe together contrasted with the missionary emphasis on individual conversion. =Missionaries and the Treaty of Waitangi= In England the church and state were interlinked and the Church of England had a special status guaranteed in law. Evangelicals, as loyal Anglicans, accepted this status and encouraged MƒÅori to look to the British Crown for protection and recognition. As a result CMS missionaries, especially Henry Williams, played a leading part in encouraging MƒÅori to sign the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. In later years this missionary support for the treaty led to increasing disillusionment among MƒÅori as the treaty was ignored by the colonial and settler governments. The emergence of MƒÅori religious movements such as Pai MƒÅrire and Ringat≈´ reflected this rejection of missionary Christianity. When the missionary Carl Sylvius V√∂lkner was suspected of spying by MƒÅori in 1865, the fact that he was a member of the Anglican clergy afforded him no protection, and he was executed. =Settler church= Bishop Selwyn After missionary work among MƒÅori, the second major influence shaping the Anglican Church came from rapidly growing numbers of Anglican migrants. The early CMS missionary beginnings and the large number of settlers who came from England resulted in Anglicans becoming the largest of the religious denominations in New Zealand. In 1858 more than half the population was Anglican. George Augustus Selwyn became Bishop of New Zealand (the only Anglican bishop to have this title) in 1841. He headed both the MƒÅori and settler Anglican parts of the church. Evangelical missionaries were suspicious of his control over them and his emphasis on the authority of the church, while settlers were hostile towards his pro-MƒÅori stance. He increasingly found himself caught between MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ issues of land and sovereignty. In 1865, Selwyn, who had served as a chaplain during the New Zealand Wars, wrote of the Anglican Church's relationship with MƒÅori, \\"oh! how things have changed! how much of the buoyancy of hope has been sobered down by experience! when, instead of a nation of believers welcoming me as their father, I find here and there a few scattered sheep, the remnant of a flock which has forsaken the shepherd\\".H. W. Tucker, Memoir of the life and episcopate of George Augustus Selwyn. London: Gardner, 1879, p. 206. =Church constitution= While Anglicans carried some of the privileges of the Church of England to New Zealand, they struggled to devise a method of church organisation which took account of their new non-establishment status alongside other churches. In 1857, after 15 years of consultation, a constitution for the New Zealand church was finalised on the basis of voluntary compact. Links with the traditions of the mother-church in England were guaranteed in their worship, ministry and beliefs. At national and regional levels, bishops, and representatives from the clergy and laity met together but voted separately on church matters, ensuring that each group had an equal voice. The constitution resolved problems for the settler church but failed to deal adequately with the administrative and leadership needs of the MƒÅori church. =Regional identity= Selwyn's diocese was progressively divided into sub-districts, beginning in 1856 when Christchurch became a new diocese; Wellington, Nelson and Waiapu (East Coast) followed in 1858, and Dunedin separated from Christchurch in 1869. Each diocese developed its own identity. The Christchurch diocese, formed out of the Canterbury Association of colonial settlers, had a strong English element. Under its second bishop, Andrew Suter, Nelson developed an evangelical flavour which continued in the 21st century. Waiapu had missionary beginnings, holding its first four synods (official church conferences) in the MƒÅori language. That missionary influence was overtaken by the New Zealand wars and the growth of settler influence. =20th and 21st centuries= St Mary's Church was the cathedral of Auckland until 1973 By 1936 the proportion of Anglicans in the total population had dropped from half to 40%. Anglican numbers declined more sharply from the mid-1960s. Around 900,000 people identified themselves as Anglican in 1976, 800,000 in 1981 and 580,000 in 2001. In the 2013 census 12% of the population, or 460,000 people, identified themselves as Anglicans. Anglicanism was the country‚Äôs second largest religious denomination after Catholicism. In parishes (local church communities) that no longer had enough church members to financially support a stipended priest, schemes for local people or self- supporting (in part or in whole) priests to take responsibility for the tasks of ministry were developed. The General Synod of the church adopted a revised constitution in 1992. This introduced the tikanga system. A New Zealand Prayer Book, He Karakia Mihinare o Aotearoa, was published in 1989 (after a period of revision starting in 1964). It was received with general enthusiasm and has largely supplanted usage of the Book of Common Prayer (BCP) since the 1990s. Leadership The church has decided that three bishops shall share the position of Primate and style of archbishop, each representing one of the three tikanga. These are the three bishops presently sharing the title of Primate and Archbishop of New Zealand: *Don Tamihere, Te Pƒ´hopa o Te TairƒÅwhiti and Te Pƒ´hopa o Aotearoa, who oversees Te Pƒ´hopatanga o Aotearoa (i.e. all five Hui Amorangi/Pƒ´hopatanga) for the MƒÅori people of Aotearoa New Zealand *Philip Richardson, Bishop of Taranaki and Senior Bishop of the New Zealand dioceses, who oversees dioceses in Aotearoa New Zealand for PƒÅkehƒÅ (people of European heritage) *Fereimi Cama, Bishop of Polynesia (the sole diocesan bishop of tikanga Pasefika), who oversees the Diocese of Polynesia for the Oceania region of the Pacific Islands that predominantly lie north and east of Aotearoa New Zealand Tikanga system =Aotearoa= Te Pƒ´hopatanga o Aotearoa, one of three tikanga, oversees churches for the MƒÅori people of Aotearoa. Aotearoa is made up of five pƒ´hopatanga or regional bishoprics (sometimes called hui amorangi, i.e. synods), each led by te pƒ´hopa o... (the bishop of...): *TairƒÅwhiti (literally east coast) *Tai Tokerau (literally north coast) *Upoko o Te Ika (literally the head of the fish, i.e. the southern part of the north island; Wellington/Taranaki) *Waipounamu (literally south island) *Manawa o Te Wheke (literally the heart of the octopus, i.e. north island central region) =New Zealand= 2013 census. The Anglican Church is represented by light blue shading. The tikanga of New Zealand is made up of seven dioceses: *Auckland *Christchurch *Dunedin *Nelson *Waiapu *Waikato and Taranaki *Wellington The dioceses in New Zealand are led by a \\"senior bishop\\" (previously \\"Convening Bishop\\") elected from among the diocesan bishops of the tikanga. In the three-person primacy, that Senior Bishop is ex officio co-equal Primate and Archbishop for the whole province. The current Senior Bishop is Philip Richardson, Bishop of Taranaki.

The diocese's first bishop was consecrated in 1908. The diocesan cathedral is Holy Trinity Cathedral in Suva, Fiji. In the province's three- person primacy, the diocesan Bishop of Polynesia is automatically Primate and Archbishop. The Bishop of Polynesia has been supported by four suffragan bishops: Api Qiliho recently retired as Bishop in Vanua Levu and Taveuni; Gabriel Sharma is Bishop in Viti Levu West;  ªAka Vaka is Bishop in Tonga; Halapua led the ministry to Polynesians in mainland New Zealand before he became diocesan bishop ‚Äî his suffragan post has not been filled since; there are archdeacons of Suva and Ovalau, Samoa and American Samoa, and Tonga. Guard Suva MatthiasSuessen-8368.jpgDiocese Of Polynesia Holy Trinity Cathedral in Suva, Fiji Ministry The Anglican Church embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest (or presbyter) and bishop. Increasingly, an emphasis is being placed on these orders to work collaboratively within the wider ministry of the whole people of God. =Theological training= Residential theological training is carried out primarily at St John's College, Auckland, which is also organised according to the three tikanga approach. Theological training was formerly carried out by Selwyn College, Otago in Dunedin and College House in Christchurch, currently these colleges are hall of residence for students from all faculties of the University of Otago and the University of Canterbury. While the two colleges still fall under the jurisdiction of the Anglican Diocese of Dunedin and Anglican Diocese of Christchurch and have the extensive theological holdings in their libraries, they no longer train ordinands. Worship and liturgy Use of the 1662 and 1928 versions of the Book of Common Prayer (BCP) of the Church of England are permitted, along with the prayer books of other provinces within the Anglican Communion. A New Zealand Prayer Book, He Karakia Mihinare o Aotearoa, providing liturgy for \\"a multitude of voices\\", contains the Calendar of events in the life of the world wide catholic church and this local Church, Liturgies of the Word (such as Morning and Evening Prayer), of Baptism, of the Eucharist (also known as Holy Communion and the Mass), for Pastoral use (in the home), for Marriage, for Funerals, for Ordination and a Catechism (teaching on the faith). All these are central to this Church's worship. =Ordination of women= The Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia has allowed the ordination of women as deacons and priests since 1977Proceedings of the Forty-Third General Synod (pp. 11‚Äì13) and as bishops since 1988.Proceedings of the Forty-seventh General Synod (pp. 81‚Äì85), Proceedings of the Special Session of the Forty- seventh General Synod (p. S-50) and Proceedings of the Forty-Eighth General Synod (pp. 104‚Äì105) Penny Jamieson, Bishop of Dunedin from 1990 to 2004, was the world‚Äôs first Anglican diocesan woman bishop. Wai Quayle became the first indigenous woman bishop in 2019. =Divorce and abortion= In 1970 it became possible for divorcees to be married in Anglican churches with the permission of the diocesan bishop; since 1984 this permission is no longer necessary. From the 1980s society's acceptance of unmarried couples living together and the use of secular marriage celebrants further undermined the church's traditional attitude towards and role in controlling marriage. Anglican submissions to the McMillan Committee on Abortion in 1937 opposed abortion, regarding both abortion and birth control as part of a general moral decline. The church‚Äôs submissions to the 1974 Royal Commission on Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion showed a considerable shift from this earlier position, with a range of opinions on abortion and an attempt to balance religious care for the mother and the rights of the foetus. This diversity indicated a lack of an authoritative Anglican Church position on issues like abortion and a loosening of traditional attitudes. =Homosexuality= The Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia has no official position on homosexuality. It has also been one of the many churches of the Anglican Communion considering same-sex unions. In 2018, the General Synod/Te Hinota voted in favour of allowing the blessing of same-sex relationships including civil marriages and civil unions. In 2011, the Diocese of Auckland voted in favour of ordaining partnered gay and lesbian priests. Congregations in the Auckland Diocese may offer a 'relationship blessing' for two partners. In 2005, a same-sex couple was joined in a civil union at St Matthew in the City in the Auckland Diocese. A gay priest was licensed in the Auckland Diocese as of 2009. The Dunedin Diocese also provides a blessing for the relationship of \\"two people\\" irrespective of gender. In the Dunedin Diocese, \\"Blessings of same-sex relationships are offered in line with Diocesan Policy and with the bishop‚Äôs permission.\\" The Dunedin Diocese also ordained an openly gay deacon in \\"a committed same-sex relationship.\\" Subsequently, the same deacon was ordained a priest. In 2011, the Waiapu Diocese adopted a resolution affirming the ordination of gay and lesbian clergy and asking for an authorised liturgy for blessing same-sex relationships. The Bishop's chaplain in the Waiapu Diocese has also performed a blessing for a same-sex couple. In 2017, the Bishop of Waiapu installed an openly gay priest, who is married to his partner, as the dean of Waiapu Cathedral. In 2012, some bishops and four dioceses supported a rite of blessing for same-sex unions. Motion 30, adopted by the 62nd General Synod on 14 May 2014, designated a working task group with the purpose of creating a \\"process and structure\\" that would allow the blessing of same-sex unions, while also upholding the traditional doctrine of marriage as the union of a man and a woman. This proposal drew the opposition of the most conservative factions of the province's clergy and laity, with a submission presented by two clergy and a layman stating that the church's constitution stated that \\"No doctrines which are repugnant to the Doctrines and Sacraments of Christ as held and maintained by this Church shall be advocated or inculcated by any person acknowledging the authority of General Synod.\\" While the blessing services were being developed and discussed, the resolution said \\"clergy should be permitted 'to recognise in public worship' a same-gender civil union or state marriage of members of their faith community.\\" In 2016, the committee responsible for developing the rites of blessing released its proposed liturgies for same-sex couples to be discussed by the General Synod. The General Synod 2016 voted to 'receive' the report on blessings but left the option to \\"[lie] on the table\\" and the issue will be reviewed again in 2018. The church's spokesperson said that \\"[the Synod] needs more work and time to create a structure that can allow for blessing of committed life-long monogamous same-sex relationships.\\" \\"However, Synod did pass a constitutional change allowing bishops the right to authorize (sic) a service for use in his or her diocese\\". In 2018, Synod voted in favour of approving Motion 29 and allowing blessing rites for same-sex unions. =Relation with the Anglican realignment= The Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans in New Zealand was started in April 2016 with two conferences that took place in Auckland and Christchurch with nearly 500 members of the province. The FCA in New Zealand is the local expression of the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON), whose chairman, Archbishop Eliud Wabukala from Kenya, sent a message of support read at the conferences. Video greetings were also sent by Archbishop Foley Beach of the Anglican Church in North America and Bishop Richard Condie, of the Anglican Diocese of Tasmania and chairman of FCA Australia. The Rev. Jay Behan became the chair of FCA New Zealand. The creation of FCA New Zealand was a result of the passing of Motion 30 by the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, and the subsequent document A Way Forward, proposing the blessing of same-sex marriages, presented at their general synod in May 2014.\\"Formation of Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans New Zealand, Anglican Mainstream\\", 19 April 2016. Bishop Richard Ellena of Nelson, an Evangelical Anglican, is a supporter of the Anglican realignment, having attended the Global South Fourth Encounter in Singapore in April 2010 and GAFCON II in Nairobi, Kenya, in October 2013.\\"Gafcon looks to the future\\", Church Times, 25 October 2013.

The Church of Confessing Anglicans Aotearoa/New Zealand was created from the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans of New Zealand and was officially established on 17 May 2019. This followed the decision taken by the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia to allow the blessing of same-sex marriages and civil unions.

He was a combative player known for his attacking free kicks and a utility player who excelled in defence, but could play equally well in midfield. Blackmore began his professional career at Manchester United in 1982, having progressed through the club's youth ranks. After twelve years and 186 league appearances, he switched to Middlesbrough on a free transfer, and made 53 league appearances in five years, whilst also having a brief loan spell at Bristol City in 1996. Having left Middlesbrough in 1999, he had short spells at Barnsley, Notts County and Leigh RMI over the next couple of seasons, before a much longer stint at Bangor City commenced in 2000. He left Bangor City in 2006 (after a brief stint as player-manager), having made 176 league appearances for the club, and, after spending a season with Porthmadog (where he was also player-manager), switched to Neath Athletic in 2007, where he made a further 22 league appearances before retiring in 2010. Internationally, Blackmore won 39 caps for Wales between 1985 and 1997. Club career =Manchester United= He joined Manchester United as an associated schoolboy at the age of 14, and was an FA Youth Cup finalist in 1982. He was given his debut for United on 16 May 1984 by manager Ron Atkinson, in their 2‚Äì0 league defeat against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. He made a solitary league appearance the following season, although in 1985‚Äì86 he scored three goals in 12 league games, but he did not get a serious run in the side until the 1987‚Äì88 season, by which time Alex Ferguson was United's manager, when he played 22 league games and scored three goals. 1988‚Äì89 saw Blackmore enjoy even more first team opportunities as he played 28 times in the league. He made 35 League appearances for United in 1990‚Äì91, and 33 in 1991‚Äì92. In 1991, he won a European Cup Winners' Cup medal with United, and in 1990 he won the FA Cup with them. He was United's regular left-back in the 1990‚Äì91 season, but when Paul Parker signed in the close season, Denis Irwin was switched to left-back and Blackmore returned to his familiar pattern of alternating between different positions, although he did enjoy a good run at right-back when Parker was injured. Blackmore collected an FA Premier League title medal in 1992‚Äì93, although he was no longer a regular player at the club, often coming on a substitute or standing in as a full-back or on the flanks on the few occasions he did start a game. A succession of injuries meant that he was unable to play in the 1993‚Äì94 season, and competition throughout the team was growing. In the days of 1‚Äì11 numbering of shirts (with players not being assigned the same shirt number for every game of the season), Blackmore's versatility meant that he wore every shirt number from 2 to 11, as well as some of the shirt numbers from 12 to 16 as a substitute. He was assigned with the number 15 when squad numbers were introduced by the FA Premier League for the 1993‚Äì94 season, but did not play any first team games that season. =Middlesbrough= He joined Middlesbrough on a free transfer for the 1994‚Äì95 season after spending more than a decade at Old Trafford. He was signed by newly appointed player-manager Bryan Robson, who had just headed to Teesside from United. He helped them win promotion to the Premier League as Division One champions in his first season on Teesside, playing in 30 League games and scoring two goals. He also appeared in Middlesbrough's 1997 FA Cup Final defeat by Chelsea.1997 FA Cup Final report and line-ups at fa- cupfinals.co.uk Whilst at Boro he had a loan spell with Bristol City. =Later career= He later had brief spells with Barnsley and at Notts County.

Sunset Sound Recorders In 1956 Walt Disney hired him to form Disneyland Records and to be Music Director and producer for the label. Camarata had suggested Disney build his own recording studio, but Disney declined and instead encouraged Camarata to build his own. In 1958 Camarata purchased the first building, an old auto repair shop on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California, that would become the location of Sunset Sound Recorders. He produced over three hundred albums there during his 16-year association with Disney. He scored several albums at Disney to help children gain a knowledge of, and love for, Western classical music. Radio television and cinema work During the 1940s Camarata served as the musical arranger for the Jean Sablon Show on the CBS radio network, which included musical performances by the accordionist John Serry Sr. and an orchestra led by Paul Baron.http://www.otrrpedia.net/getprogram.php?item=7121 Camarata was the musical conductor for several TV series, including Startime, The Vic Damone Show and The Alcoa Hour. He was also the vocal supervisor for the 1963 movie Summer Magic, which included musical performances by Hayley Mills and Burl Ives. A great many Disney movie sound tracks were also made at Sunset. Sound Factory In November 1981, Camarata would also purchase The Sound Factory, previously owned by David Hassinger. Like the Sunset Sound studios, the Sound Factory is one of the top recording studios in Hollywood, and has been used by many top music artists including Jackson Browne, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Linda Ronstadt, Ringo Starr, T Bone Burnett, Bette Midler, Richie Furay, Warren Zevon, Dolly Parton, Elvis Costello, Sam Phillips, Tonio K., Neil Diamond, Cher, Los Lobos, The Wallflowers, KISS, Kenny Rogers, Beck, Brian Wilson, Victoria Williams, Ben Folds Five, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Danny Elfman, and many others. Final work Camarata's last album was The Power and the Glory, on which he worked for four years. Once completing the arrangements, Camarata returned to England (St. John's Smith Square) to conduct a large orchestra and choir for the recording of the album, which he had noted in one of his last interviews to be one of his most important works.

The project was the first of several such projects organized by Guthrie's daughter, Nora Guthrie, original director of the Woody Guthrie Foundation and archives. Mermaid Avenue was released on the Elektra Records label on June 23, 1998. A second volume of recordings, Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, followed in 2000 and both were collected in a box set alongside volume three in 2012 as Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions. The projects are named after the song \\"Mermaid's Avenue\\", written by Guthrie. This was also the name of the street in Coney Island, New York on which Guthrie lived. According to American Songwriter Magazine, \\"The Mermaid Avenue project is essential for showing that Woody Guthrie could illuminate what was going on inside of him as well as he could detail the plight of his fellow man\\". It was voted number 939 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). Recording During the spring of 1992, Woody Guthrie's daughter Nora contacted English singer-songwriter Billy Bragg about writing music for a selection of completed Guthrie lyrics after Bragg played a Guthrie tribute concert in New York City's Central Park. Her father had left behind over a thousand sets of complete lyrics written between 1939 and 1967; as they had not been recorded by Guthrie, and he did not write music, none of these lyrics had any music other than a vague stylistic notation. Nora Guthrie's liner notes in Mermaid Avenue indicate that it was her intention that the songs be given to a new generation of musicians who would be able to make the songs relevant to a younger generation. Nora Guthrie contacted Bragg, who in turn approached Wilco and asked them to participate in the project as well. Wilco agreed, and in addition to recording with Bragg in Ireland, they were given their own share of songs to finish. Rather than recreating tunes in Guthrie's style, Bragg and Wilco created new, contemporary music for the lyrics. What seemed like a risky enterprise surprised everyone; released in 1998 as Mermaid Avenue, the results were met with universal acclaim. The album received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and went on to place fourth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1998 (right behind Bob Dylan's Live 1966). Since the release of the Mermaid Avenue albums, many other musicians have released recordings that similarly have drawn upon the trove of unpublished Guthrie material. According to Bob Dylan's autobiography, Chronicles, Woody Guthrie had offered his unpublished lyrics to Dylan, but when Dylan visited Guthrie's house to obtain them, Guthrie's wife Marjorie was not home. Guthrie's son Arlo told his babysitter to let Dylan in, but Arlo didn't know about the manuscripts and Dylan left empty-handed. Man in the Sand, a documentary about the collaboration between Billy Bragg and Wilco, was released in 1999. A DVD of the film is included in Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions.

It features two auditoria, the S. Mark Taper Foundation Auditorium, a 2500-seat performance venue, as well as the Illsley Ball Nordstrom Recital Hall, which seats 536. Opened in September 1998 at a cost of $120 million, Benaroya quickly became noted for its technology- infused acoustics, touches of luxury and prominent location in a complex thoroughly integrated into the downtown area. Benaroya occupies an entire city block in the center of the city and has helped double the Seattle Symphony's budget and number of performances. The lobby of the hall features a large contribution of glass art, such as one given the title Crystal Cascade, by world-renowned artist Dale Chihuly. Benaroya Hall is named for noted philanthropist Jack Benaroya, whose $15.8 million donation was the first and largest of many for construction of the facility. The hall was designed by LMN Architects of Seattle, and was awarded the National Honor Award from the American Institute of Architects in 2001. The structural engineer on the project was Magnusson Klemencic Associates. The building sits directly above the Great Northern Tunnel, which carries the primary rail corridor through the city, and adjacent to the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, which has a station directly integrated into the building. The performance hall is insulated from the rumbles of the traffic in these tunnels and the streets outside the hall by floating on rubber pads which insulate it from the outer shell of the building. These same noise-insulation features would also serve to dampen the destructive effects of any prospective earthquakes.

July 7, 2006. Accessed on December 20, 2007. The name is an allusion to the movie Edward Scissorhands. In the United Kingdom, the game is sometimes played with bottles of wine and is called Amy Winehands, an allusion to the British singer Amy Winehouse. Rules The drinker needs to finish the drinks in order to remove the bottles. House rules differ as to whether one may finish and remove one bottle at a time. Because the drinkers typically need use of their hands, for example, to urinate or answer a phone call, participants have an incentive to finish their alcohol as quickly as possible. It can also be used as a \\"goal\\" for the game: to see who can abstain from these activities until the drinks are finished. Furthermore, in some versions players are allowed to engage these activities so long as they can be accomplished with the bottles still taped to their hands or if a friend is willing to help. Vomiting is sometimes considered a disqualification. In popular culture The game has appeared or been mentioned in several television series and other pop-culture contexts, most often in the United States: * The episode \\"The Mess\\" of The Mick * The episode \\"Super Milo\\" of Men at Work * The episodes \\"Piss & Shit\\", \\"Dry Guys\\", and \\"Karl's Wedding\\" of Workaholics * The episode \\"Perfect Health\\" of Perfect Couples * A promo for Redneck Island on CMT * The episode \\"The Beer Mile\\" of The League * The episode \\"Hung Out to Dry\\" of CSI: NY * The episode \\"Adam Ruins College\\" of Adam Ruins Everything, representing the difficulty of paying off student loans * The premier episode of Kidding on Showtime * Season 1, episode 12 of Single Parents * Season 2, episode 9 (\\"Pulpo\\") of Cobra Kai * Season 7, episode 2 \\"The Naked Truth\\" of How I Met Your Mother * The episode \\"Trends with Benefits\\" of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation The music video for the song \\"Saintlike\\" by Jakey features the game.

He specializes in vocals, guitar and barrels, and is a leading member of the Norwegian band Kaizers Orchestra. History = Youth and first contact with music = Bryne, where Ottesen grew up, had few activities available at the time other than football, so he was given a guitar by his grandmother when he was a child. Ottesen and his friend Geir Zahl began writing music in his cellar, recording their music on a cheap tape recorder. The partnership between Ottesen and Zahl eventually evolved into the band Blod, Sn√•tt og Juling. In 1994 they produced their first studio album En glad tunnel, which only sold 50 copies. They made a more serious attempt with better studio equipment for their second album, but this still only managed to sell around 100 copies. = gnom and Kaizers Orchestra = Janove Ottesen, Kaizers Orchestra at Trans Musicales 2004 in Rennes Ottesen moved to Bergen in 1995 to study. In 1996 he joined the army, but soon after moved back to Bergen and became a music teacher. Upon his return Ottesen and Geir formed a new band gnom. They released the album Mys in 1998, but it sold poorly. After gnom's dissolution, the pair finally found critical success in forming the band Kaizers Orchestra. = Solo career = After two albums had been released by Kaizers Orchestra, Janove decided to launch a parallel solo career while working on a third album Maestro (released in 2005). His 2004 solo album, Francis' Lonely Nights is entirely in English and contains 12 songs, two of which had their music videos filmed in Scandinavia. In September 2015 Ottesen announced he was returning to the mainstream music industry under the artist name Janove. His first single \\"Regnbuen Treffer Oss Ikkje Lenger\\" (\\"The Rainbow Doesn't Hit Us Anymore\\") premiered on Spellemannprisen on 30 January 2016 as he performed it live for the first time.

The lyrics will also be more modern than the fans might have gotten used to with Kaizers Orchestra. = Career as a producer and other music = In 2007, Kaizers decided to take a break for the majority of the year, only writing up demos for their fourth album and playing three concerts (including opening the German art expo Documenta festival). Janove took this opportunity to write music for Det Tusende Hjertet, a family musical which opened in November 2007. In August 2007 he revealed that his next side project will not be a solo album, and that he has assembled another band (like fellow Kaizer bandmate Terje Winterst√∏ R√∏thing and his band Skambankt). Nothing is known about the status of this project. Aside from his work with Kaizers and as an independent artist, he has also acted as producer for multiple albums, working with various artists with various styles, including Micke From Sweden (Folk), Britt-Synn√∏ve Johansen (Tango), and The Brigade (Americana). He also participated in Geir \\"Uncle Deadly\\" Zahl's album Monkey Do, that was released on 1 February 2010. Personal life Ottesen is married and has two children. They live in Stavanger.

It was designed by architect Rem Koolhaas and opened in 2005. Designed to mark the festive year of 2001 in which the city of Porto was designated European Capital of Culture, it was the first building in Portugal aimed from its conception to be exclusively dedicated to music, either in public performances or in the field of artistic training and creation. Casa da M√∫sica's project was set in motion in 1999 as a result of an international architecture tender won by the project presented by Rem Koolhaas - Office for Metropolitan Architecture. Ground was broken in 1999 at the old tram terminus station in Boavista roundabout (Rotunda da Boavista), and Casa da Musica was inaugurated on 15 April 2005. History A view of the location along the Avenida da Boavista and neighbourhood of the same name Casa da M√∫sica on opening day (14 April 2005) On 1 September 1998, the Ministro da Cultura (Ministry of Culture) announced the construction of Casa da M√∫sica, during the ambit of Porto's 2001 tenure as the European Capital of Culture. The building engineers were AFA Arup Group Limited (London), together with Afassociados (Porto). It was designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, in association with the Porto Office of Metropolitan Architecture, the scene agency Ducks sc√©no, the acoustician Renz Van Luxemburg and AFA, while the interiors were designed by Inside Outside (Petra Blaisse). These included the 13 large surfaces, ranging from to , with a gold leaf woodgrain pattern in the large auditorium. Its location was decided on 8 March 1999, on a municipal tract of Boavista. The site was once a staging area for trams. Construction occurred in the next four years over schedule, and cost 100 million euros. The project challenged engineers because of the building's unusual configuration. It was open to the public on 14 April 2005, with performances by Cl√£ and Lou Reed, while the official inauguration occurred the next day in the presence of the Portuguese president, prime minister, other notable politicians and members of Portuguese society, with a concert by the Orquestra Nacional do Porto (Porto National Orchestra). It immediately became a city icon. Featuring a 1300-seat auditorium suffused with daylight, it is the only concert hall in the world with two walls made entirely of glass. On 5 November 2005, an administrative process was begun to classify the building as Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico (Property of Public Interest). The building's design was acclaimed worldwide. Nicolai Ouroussoff, architecture critic from The New York Times, called it the \\"most attractive project the architect Rem Koolhaas has ever built\\" and indicated that it is \\"a building whose intellectual ardor is matched by its sensual beauty\\". He also compared it to the \\"exuberant design\\" in Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. \\"Only looking into the original aspect of the building, this is one of the most important concert halls built in the last 100 years\\". He compares it to the Walt Disney Concert Hall, in Los Angeles, and the Berliner Philharmonie. A foundation, the Funda√ß√£o Casa da M√∫sica, was instituted on 26 January 2006 under decree 16/2006.

The building is accessible through a front stairway and stands at the center of a vast open plaza of marble, yellow with hint of brown. Its isolated architectural form, deeply set back from adjacent streets, including the main Avenida da Boavista, and from the city's prime ceremonial public space, the Pra√ßa Mouzinho de Albuquerque, is evocative of the hull of a ship beached at low tide. It deliberately ignores and challenges the neoclassical order of converging avenues and the vast oval of continuous blocks centered on a tall monument, Heroes of the Peninsular War, that has defined the Pra√ßa.

Using excerpts from speeches by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, a recording was spliced together which purported to be a telephone conversation between the two leaders. During the course of the tape Reagan seems to state his intention to use Europe as a battle front to show the Soviet leaders the US's resolve in a nuclear conflict, whilst Thatcher appears to imply that HMS Sheffield was deliberately sacrificed in order to escalate the Falklands war.

Appointed by the colonial Governor, the Island Secretary is an ex officio member of the Island Council, the legislative body of Britain's last remaining Pacific colony. She previously served as an elected member of the Council in 1990 and 1993. Betty Christian is a sixth-generation Pitcairner. She was educated at Pulau School on Pitcairn, and subsequently studied meteorology and radio telegraphy and telephony. She joined the island's communications staff in 1963, and succeeded her husband, Tom Christian (whom she married in May 1966) as Communications Officer in November 2000. The couple have four daughters, all of whom live abroad, and two grandsons. Role in the Pitcairn sexual assault trial Christian has publicly broken ranks with most of her fellow-Pitcairners over the appeal to the verdicts rendered in the Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004, in which six of seven defendants were convicted on various charges of rape, indecent assault, and pedophilia. With the public support of most of the island's women, including some of the alleged victims, the six are appealing their sentences, claiming that according to Polynesian culture, sexual activity at a young age is regarded as normal, and that they were not aware that such acts were illegal under British law. They are also challenging the applicability of British law to Pitcairn, saying that their ancestors had effectively renounced their British citizenship by committing an act of treason (the burning of ), and that the islands were never lawfully incorporated into the British Empire. Testifying in the Pitcairn Supreme Court in Papakura, New Zealand, specially constituted for the trial with New Zealand judges, Christian rejected the claims of the defendants that, saying that islanders were well-educated, well-travelled, and well-aware of what was legal and what was not. She also maintained that the islanders had always considered themselves British, and that the territory's status as a British dependency had never been challenged until then-Mayor Steve Christian, then a defendant facing rape charges (he was later convicted), raised the matter at a United Nations decolonization conference. (The charges against him then had not been made public). Christian dismissed the reasoning of Adrian Cook, defence lawyer for the accused, that as the persons responsible for the 1789 Mutiny on the Bounty never legally married their Tahitian companions, their children were illegitimate and assumed the nationality of their mothers. Until recent time, the islanders had never emphasized the Polynesian side of their heritage, she said. She also contradicted the defence that underage sex in Pitcairn society has always been regarded as normal. She said that the community traditionally followed values no different from any other modern society.

It was located inside the Twin Peaks Tunnel, very close to its eastern end in the Eureka Valley neighborhood. The station opened in 1918, and was closed in 1972 during the construction of the Market Street subway. History Arnold's 1913 proposal for the Eureka Valley station included an underground island platform During early planning of the municipal transit system, Eureka Valley station was positioned to serve as a transfer station to the Sunset Tunnel, whose east portal was originally to be located at the corner of Market and Eureka streets. The station had low platforms, with a single staircase on each platform leading to small headhouses on either side of Market Street. It opened with the Twin Peaks Tunnel on February 3, 1918; the Sunset Tunnel was built a decade later with an east portal at Duboce and Noe instead. Just east of the station, the tunnel dipped sharply (to connect to a planned Market Street tunnel) then rose to the surface at Castro Street. When the Market Street subway was under construction, Forest Hill station was retained and years later upgraded to Muni Metro standards with high platforms, but Eureka Valley station was not. Plagued by high crime due to its low ridership and bent staircases, it was \\"a place as dangerous as any in the city.\\" The station was permanently closed in 1972, and \\"temporary\\" ramps to the surface were built through the east end of the platforms, allowing construction of the new tunnel while maintaining existing streetcar service (on 17th Street, Church, and Duboce). Streetcars run through the closed station in 1973 while the temporary ramps are constructed around it Cars on the K, L, and M lines began using temporary trackage on 17th Street on December 2, 1972, though the ramps were not completed until 1973. After eight years of construction, Castro station opened slightly to the east in 1980 when Muni Metro service was inaugurated on the three Twin Peaks Tunnel lines. The ramps remained in regular service on weekends until September 19, 1982, when the last PCC streetcar service was discontinued. After its closure, Eureka Valley station continued to attract illicit activity like parties and sex; Muni removed the decrepit headhouses in February 1980, and the station was more tightly secured with fences and doors. The fenced-off ramps are still used for overnight maintenance access; they are not regularly used by trains but are still present in Muni's train control system. The remaining platforms - the Bay Area's only ghost station - can be seen from passing trains, and the former stairwells serve as emergency exits that lead to hatches on the sidewalks outside. Planned renovations of the Twin Peak Tunnel include seismic retrofitting of the former station.

The first woman lawyer in Dominica, she was Dominica's first, and to date only, female prime minister. She was the second female prime minister in the Caribbean after Lucina da Costa of the Netherlands Antilles. She was the first woman in the Americas to be elected in her own right as head of government. She served for the longest period of any Dominican prime minister, and was the world's third longest-serving female Prime Minister, behind Indira Gandhi of India and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka. She established a record for the longest continuous service of any woman Prime Minister. Personal life Daughter of Josephine (n√©e Delauney) and John B. Charles, Eugenia Charles was born in the fishing village of Pointe Michel in Saint Luke parish, Dominica. Her family was considered part of the \\"coloured bourgeoisie\\", descendants of free people of color. Her father was a mason who became a wealthy landowner and had business interests in export-import. She attended the Catholic Convent School in Dominica, then the island's only girls' secondary school. Afterward Charles became interested in law while working at the colonial magistrate's court. She worked for many years as assistant to Alastair Forbes. Charles attended the University of Toronto in Canada (LL.B., 1947), then moved to the United Kingdom to attend the London School of Economics. She was a member of the sorority Sigma Gamma Rho. She passed the bar and returned to Dominica, where she became the island's first female lawyer. She established a practice specialising in property law. Charles never married nor had children. In 1991 she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Political career American President Ronald Reagan in the White House's Oval Office about ongoing events in Grenada Charles began campaigning in politics during the 1960s against restrictions on press freedom. She helped to found the Dominica Freedom Party (DFP), and was its leader from the early 1970s until 1995. She was elected to the House of Assembly in 1970 and became Opposition Leader in 1975. She continued serving after Dominica gained full independence from British rule in 1978. Charles became Prime Minister when the DFP swept the 1980 elections, the party's first electoral victory. She took over from Oliver Seraphin, who had taken over only the year before, when mass protests had forced the country's first prime minister, Patrick John, to step down from office. She additionally served as Dominica's Foreign Minister from 1980 to 1990, Minister of Finance from 1980 to 1995, and as chairperson of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).Caricom Biography In 1981 she faced two attempted coups d'√©tat. That year Frederick Newton, commander of the Military of Dominica, organised an attack on the police headquarters in Roseau, resulting in the death of a police officer. Newton and five other soldiers were found guilty in the attack and sentenced to death in 1983. The sentences of the five accomplices were later commuted to life in prison, but Newton was executed in 1986. In 1981, a group of Canadian and American mercenaries, mostly affiliated with white supremacist and Ku Klux Klan groups, planned a coup to restore former Prime Minister Patrick John to power. The attempt, which the conspirators codenamed Operation Red Dog, was thwarted by American federal agents in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was soon facetiously dubbed the \\"Bayou of Pigs\\", referring to the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion years before in Cuba. Charles became more widely known to the outside world for her role in the lead-up to the United States Invasion of Grenada. In the wake of the arrest and execution of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, Charles, then serving as chair of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, appealed to the United States, Jamaica, and Barbados for intervention. She appeared on television with U.S. president Ronald Reagan, supporting the invasion. Journalist Bob Woodward reported that the US paid millions of US dollars to the Dominica Government, some of which was regarded by the CIA as a 'payoff' for Mrs. Charles's support for the US intervention in Grenada.Woodward, Bob, Veil: the Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987, pp. 290, 300. Charles and her party were considered conservative by Caribbean standards. However, American observers considered many of her policies to be centrist or even leftist; for instance, she supported some social welfare programmes. Other issues that were important to her were anti-corruption laws and individual freedom. For her uncompromising stance on this and other issues, she became known as the \\"Iron Lady of the Caribbean\\" (after the original \\"Iron Lady\\", Margaret Thatcher). Later years and death With popularity declining during her third term, Charles announced her retirement in 1995. The DFP subsequently lost the 1995 elections. After retiring, Charles undertook speaking engagements in the United States and abroad. She became involved in former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's Carter Center, which promotes human rights and observes elections to encourage fairness. On 30 August 2005, Charles entered a hospital in Fort-de-France, Martinique, for hip-replacement surgery. She died from a pulmonary embolism on 6 September at 86 years of age.

The courtyard is probably named after a 16th-century inn sign dating back to the Reformation that was displayed on a pub called the Bleeding Heart in nearby Charles Street. The inn sign showed the heart of the Virgin Mary pierced by five swords.Philpotts, Trey. A Companion to Little Dorrit. Helms Information Ltd. 2003, p. 172. Urban legend has it that the courtyard's name commemorates the murder of Lady Elizabeth Hatton, the second wife of Sir William Hatton, whose family formerly owned the area around Hatton Garden. It is said that her body was found here on 27 January 1646, \\"torn limb from limb, but with her heart still pumping blood.\\" In literature An image of Bleeding Heart Yard from Walter Thornbury's Old and New London, 1873-8. Bleeding Heart Yard features in the Charles Dickens novel Little Dorrit as the home of the Plornish family. Dickens wrote of it: > [It was] a place much changed in feature and in fortune, yet with some > relish of ancient greatness about it. Two or three mighty stacks of > chimneys, and a few large dark rooms which had escaped being walled and > subdivided out of the recognition of their old proportions, gave the Yard a > character. It was inhabited by poor people, who set up their rest among its > faded glories, as Arabs of the desert pitch their tents among the fallen > stones of the Pyramids; but there was a family sentimental feeling prevalent > in the Yard, that it had a character.Dickens, Charles. , Little Dorrit, > chapter 12. Before Dickens, the courtyard was best known for its appearance in R.H. Barham's The Ingoldsby Legends, a collection of poems and stories first published in Bentley's Miscellany beginning in 1837. In one of the stories, The House-Warming: A Legend Of Bleeding-Heart Yard, Lady Hatton, wife of Sir Christopher Hatton, makes a pact with the devil to secure wealth, position, and a mansion in Holborn. During the housewarming of the mansion, the devil dances with her, then tears out her heart, which is found, still beating, in the courtyard the next morning. It is from this legend, together with a case of mistaken identity, that the myth of Lady Elizabeth Hatton's murder -- wife, not of Christopher, but of William Hatton -- was born. \\"Bleeding Heart Square\\" by Andrew Taylor (published by Michael Joseph 2008 and by Penguin Books 2009). A gothic thriller and crime novel combined, \\"Bleeding Heart Square\\" is set in the 1930s in and around Bleeding Heart Yard and the adjacent Ely Place. Many of the street names in the area, e.g. Holborn Circus, Farringdon Road and Hatton Garden remain unchanged, but many have been altered, in keeping with a long and respected tradition among novelists. Bleeding Heart Yard is mentioned (as \\"Bleeding-Heart-Yard\\") in Stephen Vincent Ben√©t's poem American Names, as one of a list of old world places whose names are compared, unfavorably, with the place names of America. The yard today A French restaurant, bistro and tavern called The Bleeding Heart now occupies a number of the buildings in the courtyard. A gate at the south of the yard leads to Ely Place.

Ionones are aroma compounds found in a variety of essential oils, including rose oil. Œ≤-Ionone is a significant contributor to the aroma of roses, despite its relatively low concentration, and is an important fragrance chemical used in perfumery. The ionones are derived from the degradation of carotenoids. The combination of Œ±-ionone and Œ≤-ionone is characteristic of the scent of violets and used with other components in perfumery and flavouring to recreate their scent. The carotenes Œ±-carotene, Œ≤-carotene, Œ≥-carotene, and the xanthophyll Œ≤-cryptoxanthin, can all be metabolized to Œ≤-ionone, and thus have vitamin A activity because they can be converted by plant-eating animals to retinol and retinal. Carotenoids that do not contain the Œ≤-ionone moiety cannot be converted to retinol, and thus have no vitamin A activity. Biosynthesis Carotenoids are the precursors of important fragrance compounds in several flowers. For example, a 2010 study of ionones in Osmanthus fragrans Lour. var. aurantiacus determined its essential oil contained the highest diversity of carotenoid-derived volatiles among the flowering plants investigated. A cDNA encoding a carotenoid cleavage enzyme, OfCCD1, was identified from transcripts isolated from flowers of O. fragrans Lour. The recombinant enzymes cleaved carotenes to produce Œ±-ionone and Œ≤-ionone in in vitro assays. The same study also discovered that carotenoid content, volatile emissions, and OfCCD1 transcript levels are subject to photorhythmic changes, and principally increased during daylight hours. At the times when OfCCD1 transcript levels reached their maxima, the carotenoid content remained low or slightly decreased. The emission of ionones was also higher during the day; however, emissions decreased at a lower rate than the transcript levels. Moreover, carotenoid content increased from the first to the second day, whereas the volatile release decreased, and the OfCCD1 transcript levels displayed steady-state oscillations, suggesting that the substrate availability in the cellular compartments is changing or other regulatory factors are involved in volatile norisoprenoid formation. The formation of ionones proceeds by a process mediated by the carotenoid dioxygenases. Biosynthesis of the ionones Organic synthesis Ionone can be synthesised from citral and acetone with calcium oxide as a basic heterogeneous catalyst and serves as an example of an aldol condensation followed by a rearrangement reaction. The nucleophilic addition of the carbanion 3 of acetone 1 to the carbonyl group on citral 4 is base catalysed. The aldol condensation product 5 eliminates water through the enolate ion 6 to form pseudoionone 7. Image:ionone3.svg The reaction proceeds by acid catalysis where the double bond in 7 opens to form the carbocation 8. A rearrangement reaction of the carbocation follows with ring closure to 9. Finally a hydrogen atom can be abstracted from 9 by an acceptor molecule (Y) to form either 10 (extended conjugated system) or 11. Image:ionone4.svg Genetic differences in odor perception A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the OR5A1 receptor (rs6591536) causes very significant differences in the odor perception of beta-ionone, both in sensitivity and also in subjective quality. Individuals who contain at least one G allele are sensitive to beta-ionone and perceive a pleasant floral scent, while individuals who are homozygous AA are ~100 times less sensitive and at higher concentrations perceive a pungent sour/vinegar odor instead.

He was not only effective in keeping control of Oudh, but also managed to render valuable assistance to the weakened Emperor Muhammad Shah. He was soon given governorship of Kashmir as well, and became a central figure at the Delhi court. During the later years of Muhammad Shah, he gained complete control of administration over the whole Mughal Empire.

He graduated from the Dominica Grammar School. He holds a Bsc degree in Botany from the University of East London, a MSc degree in Biochemistry from the University of Reading and a post graduate diploma in crop protection technology from Imperial College. He worked in a number of local and regional institutions including the Caribbean Development Bank, but it was as manager of the Dominica Banana Marketing Company that he rose to prominence on the island. He was instrumental in resuscitating the island's critical banana industry which had been decimated by Hurricane David. James has been active in regional cricket as an administrator; he was Manager of the Windward Islands cricket team and the Combined Islands cricket team. He is also a member of the Rotary Club. Career =1988-1999= In 1988 he headed a committee which founded the United Workers' Party and became its first political leader. From its inception the party was assailed as a group of \\"disgruntled businessmen\\"; or \\"greedy businessmen\\" by the established parties, but in 1990 the party captured 6 seats in the 21 seat House of Assembly and James became the leader of the opposition. As leader of the opposition, he criticized the ruling Dominica Freedom Party for instituting an economic-citizen programme whereby persons could become citizens of the island for a fee. In the run-up to the 1995 elections, James accused the Eugenia Charles-led government of bugging his party's offices. A commission formed to investigate the matter concluded that the allegations were baseless. In the June 12, 1995 elections he led the party to victory with 11 out of 21 seats with fewer votes than the incumbent Freedom Party and became Prime Minister. By then the banana industry was no longer vibrant and so the James-led government embarked on an ambitious program of economic diversification. They passed legislation allowing the creation of off-shore business. In addition, they sought to allow an Australian mining company to conduct exploratory drilling on the island but that move was subsequently abandoned due to criticisms that it would sully the island's reputation as \\"The Nature Isle\\". When the UWP government divested its shares in the island's sole power company, the move was met with vociferous condemnation by the opposition. The Opposition was also aroused to indignation by the government's decision to offer asylum to Saudi dissident Mohammad al- Massari, a decision which James later admitted was based on a hope of increased British aid. The government was also pilloried for the economic citizenship program which it had re-engineered and enlarged when they came into office; some thought that the island could become a haven for criminal elements. This criticism was fuelled by the revelation that Australian fugitive Christopher Skase had used the programme to become a citizen of the island. Trying to increase the number of stay-over visitors to the island, the UWP government sought to build an international airport, but this was again met with a cacophony of criticism as some thought that the country would not be able to pay back the debt which would have had to be contracted. The government purchased the requisite lands for the airport but did not have time to physically begin the project. The James-led government was dogged by charges of corruption and these allegations only increased as their term progressed. James' government did produce some significant achievements. There was a proliferation in the number of scholarships available for secondary and college education. There was some success in diversifying the island's monocrop agricultural sector away from bananas and towards other crops. They also increased public spending on capital project including roads, schools and sea walls. These projects had a visible impact on the economy and the economy grew every year under James' leadership. This sort of economic program was branded 'tou-pas-touism', a Creole word meaning 'everywhere'. The opposition sought to downplay the growing economy, since they felt that it was only being financed by debt. Feeling confident with his government's achievements, James called a snap election six months before they were due in order to quell the allegations of corruption. =2000-present= In the elections of January 2000, the party suffered a surprise defeat. Though they won the most vote votes as a block, the party lost 3 seats and its majority in parliament. No party won enough seats to form a government on its own. Dominica's other two major parties, the Dominica Freedom Party and the Dominica Labour Party, had agreed to a co-operation agreement to win the election and it was no surprise when they made a coalition against the Workers' Party. James was replaced as prime minister by Roosevelt Douglas. As of February 2000, James returned to the office of leader of the opposition. Back in opposition, James called on the government to prosecute the charges of corruption in order to clear his party's name, but the government never charged any members of his party with wrongdoing. James was sued for libel by Eugenia Charles as a result of the bugging allegations; he agreed to compensate as well as to publicly apologise to Dame Eugenia. In the May 2005 elections, the party conducted a vigorous campaign but they lost one seat in parliament. James continued on as leader of the opposition. In July 2005 James was appointed to the CARICOM leaders of government and parliamentary opposition parties committee. However, in December 2005, he did not seek re-election as party leader and he was replaced as leader by Earl Williams. In July 2007 he ceded the office of Leader of the Opposition to Williams. A February 2007 poll conducted by Caribbean Development Research Services Inc (CADRES) found that though he is no longer leader of the United Workers' Party, Mr. James still enjoyed considerable support. 32% of respondents favored his leadership, compared to 58% for Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit and 6% for current United Workers' Party leader Earl Williams.\\"Dominica's prime minister leads popularity poll\\" , Caribbean Net News, March 30, 2007.

She served as lady-in-waiting to the queen consort of England, Anne of Denmark. She was the daughter of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, and Dorothy Neville, and the granddaughter of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. She was the wife of Sir William Hatton and later of Sir Edward Coke. Dorothy Neville, mother of Elizabeth Cecil  Early life  In 1578, Hatton was born as Elizabeth Cecil. Hatton's father was Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter her mother was Dorothy Neville (1548‚Äì1609). Hatton's maternal grandfather was John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer and her maternal grandmother was Lady Lucy Somerset, daughter of Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester and his first wife Lady Margaret Courtenay. Hatton's paternal grandfather was William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley and her paternal grandmother was Mary Cheke (died February 1543). Marriages and issue In the early 1590s Elizabeth married firstly, Sir William Newport alias Hatton (1560‚Äì1597), the son of John Newport (d.1566) of Hunningham, Warwickshire, and his wife, Dorothy Hatton (d.1566x70), the sister of Elizabeth I's Lord Chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton. Newport had taken the surname Hatton when his childless uncle, Sir Christopher Hatton, settled his estates on him as his heir.'Parishes: Hunningham', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 6: Knightlow hundred (1951), pp. 117-120 Retrieved 26 August 2013. When Sir Christopher Hatton died in 1591, Robert Greene dedicated his A Maiden's Dream to 'The right worshipful, bountiful, and virtuous lady, the Lady Elizabeth Hatton, wife to the right worshipful Sir William Hatton, Knight'. William Hatton had earlier married, in June 1589, Elizabeth Gawdy, the daughter and heiress of Sir Francis Gawdy (died 1605) and Elizabeth Coningsby, who died soon after the marriage, leaving an only daughter, Frances Hatton (1590‚Äì1623), who on 24 February 1605 married Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. After the marriage, Frances Hatton's grandfather, Sir Francis Gawdy, broke off relations with her. After the death of William Hatton on 12 March 1597, and after a failed wooing by Sir Francis Bacon, on 6 November 1598 Elizabeth married secondly, Sir Edward Coke. The marriage was held at a private house at the wrong time rather than between 8 and 12 in the morning at a church. Subsequently, all involved parties to the marriage were prosecuted for breaching ecclesiastical law and Sir Edward had to sue for a royal pardon. When King James VI of Scotland set out to claim the English throne after the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603, the Cokes immediately began ingratiating themselves with the new monarch and his family. Elizabeth traveled to Scotland to meet the incoming Queen, Anne of Denmark, and it was said that the high-tempered beauty managed to please the withdrawn, strong- willed Queen. Hence, she and her husband were able to hold the affections and trust of the Queen as long as she lived. Elizabeth was 26 years younger than her second husband and had a disposition that was hot-tempered and articulate. They were said to be not compatible but at least well-matched. By 1604, Elizabeth's marriage to Sir Edward Coke deteriorated and she was said to have become a formidable character and thorn at her husband's side. They quarreled over their respective rights to the Hatton estate which Elizabeth had inherited from her first husband: the dispute became so bitter that the King intervened personally to mediate. Elizabeth had two daughters by her second husband, Frances Coke, Viscountess Purbeck, and Elizabeth Coke (who died unmarried). Her daughter Frances was later married to John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck, the elder brother of King James' favourite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, which was a major factor of marital strife between Elizabeth and her second husband. For Elizabeth had opposed of the match (presumably because Villiers was generally believed to be insane) and sent her daughter Frances away from Hatton House in Holborn without informing her husband. Her plans were to keep Frances in a rented house with the help of her relatives. Elizabeth thus placed her daughter with Lady Withipole, daughter of Sir William Cornwallis, where she intended her daughter to be betrothed to Henry de Vere, 18th Earl of Oxford. However, her husband later located their daughter by chance and took her away, keeping her locked up by legal means in various houses of his friends. Then in September 1617, Frances was married at Hampton Court in the presence of the King and Queen to John Villiers. The marriage was a disastrous failure, and in 1621 Frances eloped with Sir Robert Howard, with whom she lived in an unofficial union for many years. Elizabeth and her husband were never reconciled: at his funeral she remarked \\"We shall never see his like again, thanks be to God\\". Elizabeth's daughter Frances, Lady Purbeck Death and burial Hatton died 3 January 1646, and was buried in the parish church of St Andrew Holborn.

In state schools they have three main functions:http://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270398/Governors- Handbook-January-2014.pdf of: *Giving the school a clear vision, ethos and strategic direction *Holding the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils *Overseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent. They are the largest volunteer force in the country. State schools =Composition= In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, every state school has a governing body, consisting of specified numbers of various categories of governors depending on the type and size of school. Governors are unpaid, but they may be reimbursed for expenses for such as the care of dependants or relatives and travel costs. Under section 50 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 employers must give anyone in their employment who serves as a governor reasonable time off their employ to carry out their governor duties. Employers can decide whether this time off is given with or without pay. Generally, the following categories are applicable: * Parent governors: parents of children at the school; * Staff governors: members of the school staff; * Authority governors (previously known as LEA governors): nominated by the local education authority; * Co-opted governors (previously known as community governors): members of the local community (appointed by the rest of the governing body); * Foundation, partnership and sponsor governors: representatives of any sponsoring bodies. The proportions vary between differing types of school, but as an example, in community schools, which are usually owned by the LEA, the regulations prescribe that parent governors should be at least one-third of the governors, staff governors at least two places, but no more than one- third, including the headteacher; LEA governors 20% and community governors at least 20%. Church schools will typically include a representative of the church in addition to the above categories. The minimum number of governors is nine, the maximum is twenty (although sponsor governors are additional to these numbers). Governors are appointed for a maximum of four years, this term is renewable. The headteacher of each school is ex officio a staff governor, but he or she can decline to take up the position. Should they decide not to become a member of the governing body, their place is left vacant. Staff governors (other than the head teacher) are elected by the school staff and must be paid to work at the school, directly by the school (that is, not under an external contract such as catering or cleaning). At least one staff governor must be a teacher, and if there are three or more staff governors, at least one must be a member of the support staff. If no member of the appropriate category stands for election, the vacant place can be filled by an elected person from the other category (i.e. if no teachers wish to become governors, all staff governors may be support staff, and vice versa). Parent governors can either be elected by parents of children at the school, or if insufficient numbers are elected, can be appointed by the governing body to fill any remaining vacancies. Such appointees need not be parents of children currently attending the school ‚Äì if no suitable candidates are found, they may be parents of former pupils, or of any child of school age. Parents so appointed can be removed from their positions by a majority vote of the governing body. Associate members may be appointed by the governing body as members of committees, and may include pupils, school staff, or anyone else who the governing body feel could contribute to its work. Their voting rights are decided by the governing body, and are also limited by law to exclude matters concerning the budget, admissions, pupil discipline and the election or appointment of governors. Associate members are not governors and are not included in the school's instrument of government. By law, governing bodies meet at least three times every year, as a full governing body, where the ongoing business of committees, the governing body and the school are discussed, reported on and where decisions are taken by a majority vote. Most of the work of governors, however, is done at committee level. =Chair= The governing body is led by the chair, elected by the governing body from within its membership, though anyone who works at the school cannot stand for the office. Since 1 September 2003, the term of office for the chair can be set to more than one year. The chair is supported in their work by one or more vice chairs, who may be delegated certain tasks or responsibilities. Certain tasks, including signing-off the school budget, can only be done by the chair. The process for election of chair and vice-chair and their term of office should be laid down in the governing body's standing orders. The full governing body can remove the chair or any vice chairs by a majority vote of no confidence. =Clerk= The governors are supported in their work by a clerk to the governing body. In many schools this role is combined with that of bursar or administrative officer, although they may also be employed solely in a clerking role. In some areas clerking services may be provided by the local education authority. The clerk is remunerated for their work. The clerk is usually considered an integral part of the governing body, giving advice whilst not entitled to vote. Their role is primarily one of providing advice and interpretation on the regulatory and administrative framework in which governors work, preparing and distributing minutes and agendas, keeping records and dealing with correspondence. =Responsibilities= The headteacher of the school is responsible for day-to-day management of the school. The role of the governing body is to provide strategic management, and to act as a \\"critical friend\\", supporting the work of the headteacher and other staff. Schools generally have a delegated budget to cover salaries, running costs, maintenance and equipment; the governing body is responsible for managing this budget. They can decide how many and what types of staff to employ, which equipment to upgrade or replace and what the priorities are for implementing new strategies and initiatives. Governors must appoint the headteacher, and may be involved in the appointment of other staff. Governors also have a role in monitoring the school's progress, and in setting annual targets for the school's performance and for the headteacher (and ensuring that the headteacher sets targets for other staff). Governors must review school exclusions in certain circumstances, and have the power to reinstate an excluded pupil or reduce the term of the exclusion (although not to increase it). Foundation schools, voluntary aided schools and academies act as their own admissions authorities. In such schools, the governing body sets the admissions policy, makes admissions decisions and defends admissions appeals. =Committees= Most governing bodies use a committee structure to undertake their monitoring and evaluation roles. Membership and terms of reference of committees must be determined annually. Finance, staffing, admissions, health and safety, curriculum and premises committees are very common. Other areas covered by committees may include marketing, discipline and management. Many governing bodies form working groups to tackle specific problems. Since 1 September 2003, particular committees can be given delegated powers to make decisions about the school that do not then require any approval by the full governing body =Training= Governors and clerks can be offered training and support either by the local authority, by central government or by other organisations. =Support organisations= There are a number of organisations, websites and resources that support governors and governing bodies in England and Wales. The Key for School Governors is a subscription service which provides up-to-the-minute intelligence and resources to support governing boards. In addition to e-learning and online tools like Compliance Tracker, The Key offers free online governor induction in partnership with Governors for Schools and Lloyd's Banking Group. The National Governors' Association is a representative body for school governors in England. The NGA is an independent charity. Governors can join the NGA as individuals, as members of a governing body, or through their local governors' association. Governor Wales is the voice of governors of schools in Wales. Governor Wales is funded by the Welsh Assembly. Governors for Schools is a government funded charity tasked with recruiting governors for governing bodies in England. Governors for Schools also receives support from business organisations. The Governors for Schools service is free to local education authorities, volunteers, employers and schools. In 2012 Governors for Schools began a partnership with the University of Manchester to ensure local schools have access to skilled governors.https://www.governorsforschools.org.uk/ GovernorLine offers free, confidential advice, information and support to school governors, clerks and individuals involved directly in the governance of maintained schools in England. GovernorLine is a free service delivered by an organisation called WorkLife Support under contract to the UK government. GovernorNet.co.uk was a UK government website with information for school governors. It was closed by the Department for Education in April 2011, with a recommendation to governors to use the variety of forums that are available including UK Governors and TES Connect. Independent schools Independent schools, and public schools in particular, generally have governing bodies, although by their very nature, such schools usually decide on their own requirements for their composition.

History The British Land Company was founded in 1856 as an offshoot of the National Freehold Land Society (later Abbey National) formed in 1849 with the two chief architects of the freehold land movement Richard Cobden and John Bright. Both were ardent supporters of a movement to extend enfranchisement. To qualify for a parliamentary vote it was then necessary to be a landowner and the main object of the National Freehold was to facilitate the acquisition of small plots of land by the people. To do this the British Land Co. would purchase land and then resell it on the best terms to any customer who wanted to buy it. With extension of the franchise this reason ceased to govern the operation of the company, and it began to operate as a normal business in the latter part of the nineteenth century.W. C.

He was chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) from 1991 to 1996.

Early years Zhan Videnov was born 22 March 1959 in Plovdiv. He graduated from the Plovdiv English Language School (ELS).Official site of ELS He subsequently graduated in Foreign Economic Relations from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Term in office Despite promises of change, the stagnation that had characterized the entire post-communist period since 1989 persisted during Videnov's term, as did the shady privatization schemes, the underfunding of social services, government inaction against organized crime groups such as VIS-2, SIC and Multigroup, alleged government patronizing of dingy business groups (such as the so-called \\"Orion friend circle\\") and the emigration of young and educated Bulgarians. Despite this, the BSP still had popular support for a time, as it was able to win the local elections in 1995. One significant initiative was the government's launching of a campaign for mass privatization, in which ordinary middle-class citizens were to acquire shares in the factories and firms that were being de- nationalized. Crisis During the second year of Videnov's term, Bulgaria experienced a severe economic crisis and declining quality of living standard. One element of this was the grain crisis. In mid-1996, the first reports appeared that the country's grain reserves were near complete depletion due to excessive exports, and bread did actually become scarce for some time in the winter of 1996‚Äì1997. At the same time, the postponement of the payment of interest on Bulgaria's foreign debt, which had been negotiated by the Filip Dimitrov government (Union of Democratic Forces, UDF) in 1992, ran out and no further postponement was granted despite Bulgaria's continuing inability to pay. The government also failed to negotiate a loan to relieve the situation. This decreased the country's credit rating and initiated the destabilization of the finance system. In a short period of time, more than half of Bulgaria's commercial banks went bankrupt, with hundreds of thousands of people losing their savings, while the so-called \\"credit millionaires\\" profited enormously from the situation because their immense debts to the banks were reduced to nothing. Simultaneously, inflation skyrocketed, with the lev's value plummeting from 70:1 USD in early 1996 to 3,000:1 in early 1997, causing a sharp decline in purchasing power. According to the Bulgaria-based Institute for Market Economics, the hyperinflation was caused by the government's inept finance policy. Videnov himself blamed the Bulgarian National Bank's incompetent actions, and abuses committed during the previous coalition government headed by Lyuben Berov. Despite its initial refusal in order to save its reputation during the presidential elections campaign in 1996, the government was forced by the crisis to accept eventually the currency board proposed by the International Monetary Fund, a decision that was officially implemented by the next government in July 1997. Fall from power The BSP lost the November 1996 presidential election by an almost 20% margin in the runoff between their candidate Ivan Marazov and the UDF's candidate Petar Stoyanov. Following the results, several chief members of cabinet resigned and joined the internal BSP opposition against the party leader. Videnov tendered his own resignation as both prime minister and chairman of the BSP on 21 December 1996, but stayed on as acting prime minister until a successor could be appointed. The BSP, which still held the majority in Parliament, attempted to form a new cabinet. However, the UDF-headed opposition responded by organizing month-long street protests in big cities, demanding that the parliament should be dissolved and that elections must be held immediately because of the BSP's responsibility for the crisis. The protests culminated in a general strike and a siege of the house of Parliament, which was stormed and set on fire by the protesters on 10 January 1997. Bowing to popular pressure, BSP leaders eventually agreed to early elections and a caretaker cabinet headed by Stefan Sofiyanski (UDF) took over on 13 February 1997. Videnov stayed for a brief period as a figure in the hardline opposition within BSP and as a low-ranking functionary, but he soon left politics altogether.  Subtle political affairs  The Plovdiv movement Che Guevara protesting for the keeping of the Monument to the Soviet Army, Sofia in 2011, later Che Guevara movement took part in the February 2013 protests Despite the widespread corruption and swindles of his time, Videnov was commonly said to have been a personally honest man whose naivety was misused by his own associates. This assessment was supported with the argument that, unusually for Bulgaria, he apparently didn't make any personal profit from his position and indeed left politics as poor as he had entered it.–ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–æ–≤, –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª. –ó–∞–±—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è. –≤. –ú–æ–Ω–∏—Ç–æ—Ä 17.3.2006–õ–∞–º–±–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏, –ë–æ–π–∫–æ. –ú–∞ –ø–æ–∫—Ä–∞–¥–Ω—é–≤–∞ —Å–µ –±–µ, –≥–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∞... –í.\\"–°–µ–≥–∞\\" 10.3.2008–ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—é —Å –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏ –¢–∞–º–±—É–µ–≤. –° –¥–æ—Å–∏–µ—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—Ç–µ –¥–æ–Ω–∏–∫—ä–¥–µ –Ω—è–º–∞ –¥–∞ —Å—Ç–∏–≥–Ω–∞—Ç. 09.11.2005.

The history of Washington, D.C., is tied to its role as the capital of the United States. Originally inhabited by an Algonquian-speaking people known as the Nacotchtank, the site of the District of Columbia along the Potomac River was first selected by President George Washington. The city came under attack during the War of 1812 in an episode known as the Burning of Washington. Upon the government's return to the capital, it had to manage reconstruction of numerous public buildings, including the White House and the United States Capitol. The McMillan Plan of 1901 helped restore and beautify the downtown core area, including establishing the National Mall, along with numerous monuments and museums. Unique among cities with a high percentage of African Americans, Washington has had a significant black population since the city's creation. As a result, Washington became both a center of African American culture and a center of Civil Rights Movement. Since the city government was run by the U.S. federal government, black and white school teachers were paid at an equal scale as workers for the federal government. It was not until the administration of Woodrow Wilson, a Southern Democrat who had numerous Southerners in his cabinet, that federal offices and workplaces were segregated, starting in 1913. This situation persisted for decades: the city was racially segregated in certain facilities until the 1950s. Today, D.C. is marked by contrasts. Neighborhoods on the eastern periphery of the central city, and east of the Anacostia River tend to be disproportionately lower-income. Following World War II, many middle-income whites moved out of the city's central and eastern sections to newer, affordable suburban housing, with commuting eased by highway construction. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee on April 4, 1968 sparked major riots in chiefly African American neighborhoods east of Rock Creek Park. Large sections of the central city remained blighted for decades. By contrast, areas west of the Park, including virtually the entire portion of the District between the Georgetown and Chevy Chase neighborhoods (the latter of which spills into neighboring Chevy Chase, Maryland), contain some of the nation's most affluent and notable neighborhoods. During the early 20th century, the U Street Corridor served as an important center for African American culture in DC. The Washington Metro opened in 1976. A rising economy and gentrification in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to revitalization of many downtown neighborhoods. Article One, Section 8, of the United States Constitution places the District (which is not a state) under the exclusive legislation of Congress. Throughout its history, Washington, D.C. residents have therefore lacked voting representation in Congress. The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1961, gave the District representation in the Electoral College. The 1973 District of Columbia Home Rule Act provided the local government more control of affairs, including direct election of the city council and mayor. Early settlement Archaeological evidence indicates American Indians settled in the area at least 4,000 years ago, around the Anacostia River. Early European exploration of the region took place early in the 17th century, including explorations by Captain John Smith in 1608.(1) McAtee, p. 5. (2) At the time, the Patawomeck (loosely affiliated with the Powhatan) and the Doeg lived on the Virginia side, as well as on Theodore Roosevelt Island, while the Piscataway (also known as Conoy) tribe of Algonquians resided on the Maryland side. Native inhabitants within the present-day District of Columbia included the Nacotchtank, at Anacostia, who were affiliated with the Conoy. Another village was located between Little Falls and Georgetown, and English fur trader Henry Fleet documented a Nacotchtank village called Tohoga on the site of present-day Georgetown. The first colonial landowners in the present- day District of Columbia were George Thompson and Thomas Gerrard, who were granted the Blue Plains tract in 1662, along with Saint Elizabeth, and other tracts in Anacostia, Capitol Hill, and other areas down to the Potomac River in the following years. Thompson sold his Capitol Hill properties in 1670, including Duddington Manor, to Thomas Notley; The Duddington property was handed down over the generations to Daniel Carroll, of Duddington. As European settlers arrived, they clashed with the Native Americans over grazing rights. In 1697, Maryland authorities built a fort within what is now the District of Columbia. In that same year, the Conoy relocated to the west, near what is now The Plains, Virginia, and in 1699 they moved again, to Conoy Island near Point of Rocks, Maryland.Harrison Williams, Legends of Loudoun, pp. 20-21. Georgetown was established in 1751 when the Maryland legislature purchased sixty acres of land for the town from George Gordon and George Beall at the price of ¬£280, while Alexandria, Virginia was founded in 1749. Situated on the fall line, Georgetown was the farthest point upstream to which oceangoing boats could navigate the Potomac River. The strong flow of the Potomac kept a navigable channel clear year-round; and, the daily tidal lift of the Chesapeake Bay, raised the Potomac's elevation in its lower reach; such that fully laden ocean-going ships could navigate easily, all the way to the Bay. Gordon had constructed a tobacco inspection house along the Potomac in approximately 1745. Warehouses, wharves, and other buildings were added, and the settlement rapidly grew. The Old Stone House, located in Georgetown, was built in 1765 and is the oldest standing building in the District. It did not take long before Georgetown grew into a thriving port, facilitating trade and shipments of tobacco and other goods from colonial Maryland. With the economic and population growth of Georgetown came also the founding of Georgetown University in 1789, at its founding drawing students from as far away as the West Indies. Founding =Establishment= Territorial progression of Washington, D.C. The United States capital was originally located in Philadelphia, beginning with the First and Second Continental Congress, followed by the Congress of the Confederation upon gaining independence. In June 1783, a mob of angry soldiers converged upon Independence Hall to demand payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War. Congress requested that John Dickinson, the governor of Pennsylvania, call up the militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia. As a result, Congress was forced to flee to Princeton, New Jersey, on June 21, 1783. Dickinson's failure to protect the institutions of the national government was discussed at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787. The delegates therefore agreed in Article One, Section 8, of the United States Constitution to give the Congress the power: > To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such > District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of Particular > States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of > the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased > by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, > for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards and other needful > Buildings;Wikisource: Constitution of the United States of America James Madison, writing in Federalist No. 43, also argued that the national capital needed to be distinct from the states, in order to provide for its own maintenance and safety. The Constitution, however, does not select a specific site for the location of the new District. Proposals from the legislatures of Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia all offered territory for the location of the national capital. Northern states preferred a capital located in one of the nation's prominent cities, unsurprisingly, almost all of which were in the north. Conversely, Southern states preferred that the capital be located closer to their agricultural and slave-holding interests. The selection of the area around the Potomac River, which was the boundary between Maryland and Virginia, both slave states, was agreed upon between James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton had a proposal for the new federal government to take over debts accrued by the states during the Revolutionary War. However, by 1790, Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts. Hamilton's proposal would require Southern states to assume a share of Northern debt. Jefferson and Madison agreed to this proposal and in return secured a Southern location for the federal capital. On December 23, 1788, the Maryland General Assembly passed an act, allowing it to cede land for the federal district. The Virginia General Assembly followed suit on December 3, 1789. The signing of the federal Residence Act on July 16, 1790, mandated that the site for the permanent seat of government, \\"not exceeding ten miles square\\" (100 square miles), be located on the \\"river Potomack, at some place between the mouths of the Eastern-Branch and Connogochegue\\". The \\"Eastern-Branch\\" is known today as the Anacostia River. The Connogocheque (Conococheague Creek) empties into the Potomac River upstream near Williamsport and Hagerstown, Maryland. The Residence Act limited to the Maryland side of the Potomac River the location of land that commissioners appointed by the President could acquire for federal use. The Residence Act authorized the President to select the actual location of the site. However, President George Washington wished to include the town of Alexandria, Virginia within the federal district. To accomplish this, the boundaries of the federal district would need to encompass an area on the Potomac that was downstream of the mouth of the Eastern Branch. The U.S. Congress amended the Residence Act in 1791 to permit Alexandria's inclusion in the federal district. However, some members of Congress had recognized that Washington and his family owned property in and near Alexandria, which was just seven miles (11 km) upstream from Mount Vernon, Washington's home and plantation. The amendment therefore contained a provision that prohibited the \\"erection of the public buildings otherwise than on the Maryland side of the river Potomac\\".Hazleton, p. 4(1) United States Statutes at Large: Volume 1: 1st Congress: 3rd Session; Chapter 17> XVII.‚ÄîAn Act to amend ‚ÄúAn act for establishing the temporary and permanent seat of the government of the United States\\" (2) The final site was just below the fall line on the Potomac, the furthest inland point navigable by boats (see: Atlantic Seaboard fall line). It included the ports of Georgetown and Alexandria. The process of establishing the federal district, however, faced other challenges in the form of strong objections from landowners such as David Burns who owned a large, tract of land in the heart of the district. On March 30, 1791, Burns and eighteen other key landowners relented and signed an agreement with Washington, where they would be compensated for any land taken for public use, half of remaining land would be distributed among the proprietors, and the other half to the public. Pursuant to the Residence Act, President Washington appointed three commissioners (Thomas Johnson, Daniel Carroll, and David Stuart) in 1791 to supervise the planning, design and acquisition of property in the federal district and capital city. In September 1791, using the toponym Columbia and the name of the president, the three commissioners agreed to name the federal district as the Territory of Columbia, and the federal city as the City of Washington. On March 30, 1791, Washington issued a presidential proclamation that established \\"Jones's point, the upper cape of Hunting Creek in Virginia\\" as the starting point for the federal district's boundary survey. The proclamation also described the method by which the survey should determine the district's boundaries. Working under the general supervision of the three commissioners and at the direction of President Washington, Major Andrew Ellicott, assisted by his brothers Benjamin and Joseph Ellicott, Isaac Roberdeau, Isaac Briggs, George Fenwick, and an African American astronomer, Benjamin Banneker, then proceeded to survey the borders of the Territory of Columbia with Virginia and Maryland during 1791 and 1792.(1) (2) (3) The survey team enclosed within a square an area containing the full that the Residence Act had authorized.

In early 1791, President Washington appointed Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant to devise a plan for the new city in an area of land at the center of the federal territory that lay between the northeast shore of the Potomac River and the northwest shore of the Potomac's Eastern Branch. Note: The plan that this web page describes identifies the plan's author as \\"Peter Charles L'Enfant\\". The web page nevertheless identifies the author as \\"Pierre-Charles L'Enfant.\\" L'Enfant identified himself as \\"Peter Charles L'Enfant\\" during most of his life, while residing in the United States. He wrote this name on his Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States . ... (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., Jean Jules Jusserand, popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, \\"Pierre Charles L'Enfant\\". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic. George Washington University, Washington, D.C. ). The National Park Service has identified L'Enfant as \\"Major Peter Charles L'Enfant\\" and as \\"Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant\\" in its histories of the Washington Monument on its website. The United States Code states in : \\"(a) In General.‚ÄîThe purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant.\\" L'Enfant then designed in his \\"Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of the United States ... \\" the city's first layout, a grid centered on the United States Capitol, which would stand at the top of a hill (Jenkins Hill) on a longitude designated as 0,0¬∞. The grid filled an area bounded by the Potomac River, the Eastern Branch (now named the Anacostia River), the base of an escarpment at the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line along which a street (initially Boundary Street, now Florida Avenue) would later travel, and Rock Creek.(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Freedom Plaza in downtown D.C. contains an inlay of the central portion of L'Enfant's plan at coordinates North‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest streets formed the grid. Wider diagonal \\"grand avenues\\" later named after the states of the union crossed the grid. Where these \\"grand avenues\\" crossed each other, L'Enfant placed open spaces in circles and plazas that were later named after notable Americans. L'Enfant's broadest \\"grand avenue\\" was a garden-lined esplanade, which he expected to travel for about along an east‚Äìwest axis in the center of an area that the National Mall now occupies. A narrower avenue (Pennsylvania Avenue) connected the \\"Congress house\\" (the Capitol) with the \\"President's house\\" (the White House). In time, Pennsylvania Avenue developed into the capital city's present \\"grand avenue\\". L'Enfant's plan included a system of canals, one of which would travel near the western side of the Capitol at the base of Jenkins Hill. To be filled by the waters of Tiber Creek (also named \\"Goose Creek\\") and James Creek, the canal system would traverse the center of the city and would enter both the Potomac River and the Eastern Branch (see: Washington City Canal). On June 22, L'Enfant presented his first plan for the federal city to President. On August 19, he appended a new map to a letter that he sent to the President. President Washington retained one of L'Enfant's plans, showed it to Congress, and later gave it to the three Commissioners. The survey map may be one that L'Enfant appended to his August 19 letter to the President. L'Enfant subsequently entered into a number of conflicts with the three commissioners and others involved in the enterprise. During a contentious period in February 1792, Andrew Ellicott, who had been conducting the original boundary survey of the future District of Columbia (see: Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia) and the survey of the federal city under the direction of the Commissioners, informed the Commissioners that L'Enfant had not been able to have the city plan engraved and had refused to provide him with the original plan (of which L'Enfant had prepared several versions).Ellicott, Andrew (February 23, 1792). \\"To Thomas Johnson, Daniel Carroll and David Stuart, Esqs.\\" In (1) (2) Ellicott, with the aid of his brother, Benjamin Ellicott, then revised the plan, despite L'Enfant's protests.Kite, from L'Enfant and Washington\\" in website of Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons (Freemasons).

Ellicott's revisions, which included the straightening of the longer avenues and the removal of Square No. 15 from L'Enfant's original plan, created minor changes to the city's layout. Ellicott stated in his letters that, although he was refused the original plan, he was familiar with L'Enfant's system and had many notes of the surveys that he had made himself. It is therefore possible that Ellicott recreated the plan. At HathiTrust Digital Library. Shortly thereafter, Washington dismissed L'Enfant. Ellicott gave the first version of his own plan to James Thakara and John Vallance of Philadelphia, who engraved, printed and published it. This version, printed in March 1792, was the first Washington city plan that received wide circulation.. After L'Enfant departed, Ellicott continued the city survey in accordance with his revised plan, several larger and more detailed versions of which were also engraved, published and distributed. As a result, Ellicott's revisions became the basis for the capital city's future development.The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans in \\"Washington, D.C., A National Register of Historic Places Travel Inventory\\" in official website of the U.S. National Park Service Accessed August 14, 2008. In 1800, the seat of government was finally moved to the new city, and on February 27, 1801, the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 placed the District under the jurisdiction of Congress. The act also organized the unincorporated territory within the District into two counties: the County of Washington on the northeast bank of the Potomac, and the County of Alexandria on the southwest bank. On May 3, 1802, the City of Washington was granted a municipal government consisting of a mayor appointed by the President of the United States. 19th century =Economic development= The District of Columbia relied on Congress for support for capital improvements and economic development initiatives. However, Congress lacked loyalty to the city's residents and was reluctant to provide support. Congress did provide funding for the Washington City Canal in 1809, after earlier private financing efforts were unsuccessful. Construction began in 1810 and the canal opened in late 1815, connecting the Anacostia River with Tiber Creek. Construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O;) began in Georgetown in 1828. Construction westward through Maryland proceeded slowly. The first section, from Georgetown to Seneca, Maryland, opened in 1831. In 1833 an extension was built from Georgetown eastward, connecting to the City Canal. The C&O; reached Cumberland, Maryland in 1850, although by that time it was obsolete as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) had arrived in Cumberland in 1842. The canal had financial problems, and plans for further construction to reach the Ohio River were abandoned. =War of 1812= The United States Capitol after the burning of Washington in the War of 1812. Watercolor and ink depiction from 1814, restored. City of Washington from Beyond the Navy Yard by George Cooke, 1833, on display in the White House Oval Office During the War of 1812, British forces conducted an expedition between August 19 and 29, 1814, that took and burned the capital city. On August 24, the British routed an American militia, which had gathered at Bladensburg, Maryland to protect the capital (see Battle of Bladensburg). The militia then abandoned Washington without a fight. President James Madison and the remainder of the U.S. government fled the capital shortly before the British arrived. The British then entered and burned the capital during the most notably destructive raid of the war. British troops set fire to the capital's most important public buildings, including the Presidential Mansion (the White House), the United States Capitol, the Arsenal, the Navy Yard, the Treasury Building, and the War Office, as well as the north end of the Long Bridge, which crossed the Potomac River into Virginia. The British, however, spared the Patent Office and the Marine Barracks. Dolley Madison, the first lady, or perhaps members of the house staff, rescued the Lansdowne Portrait, a full-length painting of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart, as the British approached the Mansion. The aftermath of the war kicked off a mild crisis with many northerners pushing for a relocation of the capitol with a vote brought to the floor of Congress proposing the removal of the government to Philadelphia. It was defeated 83 to 74 votes and the seat of government remained in Washington, D.C. =Railroads arrive in Washington= The B&O; opened a rail line from Baltimore to Washington in 1835. Passenger traffic on the Washington Branch had increased by the 1850s, as the company opened a large station in 1851 on New Jersey Avenue NW, just north of the Capitol. Further railroad development continued after the Civil War, with a new B&O; line (the Metropolitan Branch) connecting Washington to the west, and the introduction of competition from the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in the 1870s. In 1907, Union Station opened as the city's central terminal. =Retrocession= Library of CongressMap of the District of Columbia in 1835, prior to the retrocession Almost immediately after the \\"Federal City\\" was laid out north of the Potomac, some residents south of the Potomac in Alexandria County, D.C., began petitioning to be returned to Virginia's jurisdiction. Over time, a larger movement grew to separate Alexandria from the District for several reasons: * Alexandria was a center for slave trading. There was increasing talk of abolition of slavery in the national capital. Alexandria's economy would suffer if slavery were outlawed in the District of Columbia. (In 1848, Congressman Abraham Lincoln submitted a bill to abolish slavery in the District. Of course, it failed.) * There was an active abolition movement in Virginia, and the pro-slavery forces held a slim majority in the Virginia General Assembly. (In 1863, during the Civil War, the most anti-slavery counties would secede from Virginia to form West Virginia.) If Alexandria and Alexandria County were retroceded to Virginia, they would provide two new pro-slavery representatives. * Alexandria's economy had stagnated as competition with the port of Georgetown, D.C., had begun to favor the north side of the Potomac, where most members of Congress and local federal officials resided. * The Residence Act prohibited federal offices from locating in Virginia. * The Alexandria Canal, which connected the C&O; Canal to Alexandria, needed repairs, which the federal government was reluctant to fund. * Alexandria's residents had lost representation and the right to vote at any level of government. After a referendum, Alexandria County's citizens petitioned Congress and Virginia to return the area to Virginia. By an act of Congress on July 9, 1846, and with the approval of the Virginia General Assembly, the area south of the Potomac () was returned, or \\"retroceded,\\" to Virginia effective in 1847. The retroceded land was then known as Alexandria County, Virginia, and now includes a portion of the independent city of Alexandria and all of Arlington County, the successor to Alexandria County. A large portion of the retroceded land near the river was an estate of George Washington Parke Custis, who had supported the retrocession and helped develop the charter in the Virginia General Assembly for the County of Alexandria, Virginia. The estate (Arlington Plantation) would be passed on to his daughter (the wife of Robert E. Lee), and would eventually become Arlington National Cemetery. =Civil War era= President Lincoln insisted that construction of the U.S. Capitol continue during the Civil War. A portion of the Washington Aqueduct opened in 1859, providing drinking water to city residents and reducing their dependence on well water. The aqueduct, which was built by the US Army Corps of Engineers, opened for full operation in 1864, using the Potomac River as its source.Harry C. Ways, \\"The Washington Aqueduct: 1852‚Äì1992.\\" (Baltimore, MD: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, 1996) Washington remained a small city of a few thousand residents, virtually deserted during the summertime, until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. President Abraham Lincoln created the Army of the Potomac to defend the federal capital, and thousands of soldiers came to the area. The significant expansion of the federal government to administer the war‚Äîand its legacies, such as veterans' pensions‚Äîled to notable growth in the city's population ‚Äì from 75,000 in 1860 to 132,000 in 1870. Slavery was abolished throughout the District on April 16, 1862 ‚Äì eight months before Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation‚Äîwith the passage of the Compensated Emancipation Act. The city became a popular place for freed slaves to congregate. Throughout the war, the city was defended by a ring of military forts that mostly deterred the Confederate army from attacking. One notable exception was the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864 in which Union soldiers repelled troops under the command of Confederate General Jubal A. Early. This battle was only the second time that a U.S. President came under enemy fire during wartime when Lincoln visited the fort to observe the fighting. (The first had been James Madison during the War of 1812.) Meanwhile, over 20,000 sick and injured Union soldiers were treated in an array of permanent and temporary hospitals in the capital. On April 14, 1865, just days after the end of the war, Lincoln was shot in Ford's Theatre by John Wilkes Booth during the play Our American Cousin. The next morning, at 7:22 am, President Lincoln died in the house across the street, the first American president to be assassinated. Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton said, \\"Now he belongs to the ages.\\" =Post- Civil War era= Newspaper Row on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C., 1874 By 1870, the District's population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents. Despite the city's growth, Washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation. The situation was so bad that some members of Congress suggested moving the capital further west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider such a proposal. In response to the poor conditions in the capital, Congress passed the Organic Act of 1871, which revoked the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia. The act provided for a governor appointed by the President, a legislative assembly with an upper-house composed of eleven appointed council members and a 22-member house of delegates elected by residents of the District, as well as an appointed Board of Public Works charged with modernizing the city. President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd, an influential member of the Board of Public Works, to the post of governor in 1873. Shepherd authorized large-scale municipal projects, which greatly modernized Washington. However, the governor spent three times the money that had been budgeted for capital improvements and ultimately bankrupted the city. In 1874, Congress abolished the District's territorial government and replaced it with a three-member Board of Commissioners appointed by the President, of which one was a representative from the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The three Commissioners would then elect one of themselves to be president of the commission. An additional act of Congress in 1878 made the three-member Board of Commissioners the permanent government of the District of Columbia. The act also had the effect of eliminating any remaining local institutions such as the boards on schools, health, and police. The Commissioners would maintain this form of direct rule for nearly a century. The first motorized streetcars in the District began service in 1888 and spurred growth in areas beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries. In 1888, Congress required that all new developments within the District conform to the layout of the City of Washington. The City of Washington's northern border of Boundary Street was renamed Florida Avenue in 1890, reflecting growth of suburban areas in the County of Washington. The city's streets were extended throughout the District starting in 1893. An additional law passed in 1895 mandated that Washington formally absorb Georgetown, which until then had maintained a nominal separate identity, and renamed its streets. With a consolidated government and the transformation of suburban areas within the District into urban neighborhoods, the entire city eventually took on the name Washington, D.C. In the early 1880s, the Washington City Canal was covered over. Originally an expansion of Tiber Creek, the canal connected the Capitol with the Potomac, running along the north side of the Mall where Constitution Avenue is today. However, as the nation transitioned over to railroads for its transport, the canal had become nothing more than a stagnant sewer, and so it was removed. Some reminders of the canal still exist. South of the Capitol, a road named Canal Street connects Independence Avenue, SW, and E Street, SE (although the northernmost section of the street was renamed Washington Avenue to commemorate the state of Washington).Coordinates of Canal Street: A lock keeper's house built in 1835 at the eastern terminal of the C&O; Canal (where the C&O; emptied into Tiber Creek and the Potomac River) remains at the southwest corner of Constitution Avenue, NW, (formerly B Street, NW) and 17th Street, NW (see: Lockkeeper's House, C & O Canal Extension).(1) \\"Lock Keeper's House\\" marker in website of HMdb.org: The Historical Marker Database.

One of the most important Washington architects of this period was the German immigrant Adolf Cluss. From the 1860s to the 1890s, he constructed over 80 public and private buildings throughout the city, including the National Museum, the Agriculture Department, Sumner and Franklin schools. The Washington Monument, a tribute to George Washington and the world's tallest stone structure, was completed in 1884.National Park Service, Washington, D.C. (2012). \\"Washington Monument: History & Culture.\\" 20th century The National Mall was the centerpiece of the 1901 McMillan Plan. A central pathway traversed the length of the Mall.In 1901, the Senate Park Improvement Commission of the District of Columbia (the \\"McMillan Commission\\"), which Congress had formed the previous year, formulated the McMillan Plan, an architectural plan for the redevelopment of the National Mall.The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans in \\"Washington, D.C., A National Register of Historic Places Travel Inventory\\" in official website of the U.S. National Park Service. Retrieved 2009-09-14. The commission was inspired by L'Enfant's 1791 plan for the city, which had not been fully realized. The members of the commission also sought to emulate the grandeur of European capitals such as Paris, London, and Rome. They were also strongly influenced by the City Beautiful movement, a Progressive ideology that intended to build civic virtue in the poor through important, monumental architecture. Several of the Commission members, including Daniel Burnham and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. had in fact participated in the 1893 World Columbian Exposition, which was widely popular and helped to spread interest in the City Beautiful movement. The McMillan Plan in many respects was an early form of urban renewal that removed many of the slums that surrounded the Capitol, replacing them with new public monuments and government buildings. The Plan proposed a redesign of the National Mall and the construction of the future Burnham-designed Union Station. World War I interrupted the execution of the Plan, but construction of the Lincoln Memorial in 1922 largely completed it. Although the McMillan Plan resulted in the demolition of some slums in the Federal Triangle area, substandard housing was a much larger problem in the city during the early 1900s, with large portions of the population living in so-called \\"alley dwellings.\\" Progressive efforts eventually led to the creation of the Alley Dwelling Authority in 1934. The agency, led by John Ihlder, was an early example of a public housing agency, and was responsible for demolishing slum housing and building new units that were affordable, modern, and sanitary. During his first administration (which started in 1913), President Woodrow Wilson introduced segregation into several federal departments, for the first time since 1863. He supported some cabinet appointees in their request for segregation of employees and creation of separate lunchrooms and restrooms. He was highly criticized for this, especially as he had attracted numerous votes from blacks. The policy held for decades.Kathleen L. Wolgemuth, \\"Woodrow Wilson and Federal Segregation\\", The Journal of Negro History, Vol. 44, No. 2 (April 1959 ), p. 158 One advantage of federal rule over the District of Columbia was that the public school teachers were considered federal workers. Although the schools were segregated, black and white teachers were paid on an equal scale. The system attracted highly qualified teachers, especially for the M Street School (later called Dunbar High School), the academic high school for African Americans.Thomas Sowell, \\"The Education of Minority Children\\" in Thomas Sowell website. Retrieved 2007-12-12. In July 1919, whites, including uniformed sailors and soldiers, attacked blacks in Washington during Red Summer, when violence broke out in cities across the country. The catalyst in Washington was the rumored arrest of a black man for rape; in four days of mob violence, white men randomly beat black people on the street, and pulled others off streetcars for attacks. When police refused to intervene, the black population fought back. Troops tried to restore order as the city closed saloons and theaters, but a summer rainstorm had a more dampening effect. A total of 15 people were killed: 10 whites, including two police officers; and five blacks. Fifty people were seriously wounded and another 100 less severely wounded.Kenneth D. Ackerman, Young J. Edgar: Hoover, the Red Scare, and the Assault on Civil Liberties (NY: Carroll & Graf, 2007, ), 60‚Äì2 The NAACP protested to President Wilson.New York Times: \\"Protest Sent to Wilson,\\" July 22, 1919.

Eisenhower received a hero's welcome in Washington, D.C. in June 1945 In 1922, Washington was hit by its deadliest natural disaster when the Knickerbocker Storm dumped of snow, causing the roof to collapse at the Knickerbocker Theater, a silent movie house. Ninety-eight people were killed, including a U.S. Congressman; 133 were injured. On July 28, 1932, President Herbert Hoover ordered the United States Army to forcibly evict the \\"Bonus Army\\" of World War I veterans who gathered in Washington, D.C., to secure promised veterans' benefits early. U.S. troops dispersed the last of the \\"Bonus Army\\" the next day. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the city's population grew rapidly with the creation of additional Federal agencies under the New Deal programs of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, during which most of the Federal Triangle buildings were constructed. Though, Washington was still administered by politicians uninterested in the well-being of the local population; in the late 1930s, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on District Appropriations Ross A. Collins from Mississippi cut spending on local DC funds for welfare and education stating that \\"my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers\\". Home Rule or House Rule? Congress and the Erosion of Local Governance in the District of Columbia by Michael K. Fauntroy, University Press of America, 2003 at Google Books, page 94 World War II brought further population increases‚Äîmore than 300,000 between 1940 and 1943‚Äîand a significant housing shortage, as existing residents were urged to rent rooms to the influx of Federal staffers who arrived from throughout the country. \\"It is a terrible place to live\\", Life magazine wrote in 1943; the city's infrastructure was unable to grow as fast as the population, and residents had to wait in long lines for food, transportation, shopping, entertainment, and almost every other area of life. During the war, as many as 200,000 railroad passengers passed through Union Station in a single day. The Pentagon was built in nearby Arlington to efficiently consolidate Federal defense offices under one roof. One of the largest office buildings in the world, it was built rapidly during the early years of the war, partially opening in 1942, and complete in 1943. =Civil rights= President Harry Truman ended de jure racial discrimination in the Armed Forces and federal workplaces in 1948. Parks and recreation facilities in Washington remained segregated until 1954. Public schools were desegregated soon after.Constance McL. Green, Secret City: History of Race Relations in the Nation's Capital (1969) When the city's Board of Education began building the John Phillip Sousa Junior High, a group of parents from the Anacostia neighborhood petitioned to have the school admit black and white students. When it was constructed, the board declared that only whites could enroll. The parents sued in a case decided in the landmark Supreme Court ruling Bolling v. Sharpe. Partly due to the District's unique status under the Constitution, the court decided unanimously that all of D.C.'s public schools had to be integrated. In the wake of this and the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, the Eisenhower administration decided to make D.C. schools the first to integrate, as an example to the rest of the nation. Civil rights marchers at the Lincoln Memorial, August 28, 1963. In 1957, Washington became the first major city in the nation with a majority African-American population. Like many cities, it had received thousands of black people from the South in the Great Migration, starting during World War I and accelerating in the 1940s and 1950s. With the buildup of government and defense industries during World War II, many new residents found jobs. In the postwar years, whites who were better established economically began to move to newer housing in adjoining states in the suburbanization movement that occurred around most major cities. They were aided by the extensive highway construction undertaken by federal and state governments. On August 28, 1963, Washington took center stage in the Civil Rights Movement, with the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famed \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial. Following King's assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Washington was devastated by the riots that broke out in the U Street neighborhood and spread to other black areas, including Columbia Heights. The civil unrest drove many whites and middle-class blacks to move out of the city core. There had already been a steady movement of some residents to suburban locations in the search for newer housing and to avoid school integration. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many businesses left the downtown and inner city areas, drawn to suburban malls and following residential development. Marks of riots scarred some neighborhoods into the late 1990s. =Home rule= The District elects a delegate to the House of Representatives who has the usual rights of House membership, such as seniority and committee membership, except that the delegate cannot formally vote. The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified on March 29, 1961, gives the people a voice in the electoral college of the size of the smallest state (three votes). In 1973, Congress passed the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, ceding some of its power over the city to a new, directly elected city council and mayor. Walter Washington became the first elected mayor of Washington, D.C. The first of the Washington Metro subway system opened on March 27, 1976, following years of acrimonious battles with Congress over funding and highway construction, including a rejected proposal to build a north-central freeway. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority had been created in 1973 through a merger of several local bus companies. Several new Metro stations such as Friendship Heights, Van Ness, Gallery Place, Columbia Heights, U Street, and Navy Yard ‚Äì Ballpark eventually became catalysts for commercial development. The Kennedy Center opened, as well as several new museums and historic monuments on and around the National Mall. In 1978 Congress sent the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment to the states for ratification. This amendment would have granted the District representation in the House, Senate, and Electoral College as if it were a state. The proposed amendment had a seven-year limit for ratification, and only sixteen states ratified it in this period. The city's local government, particularly during the mayoralty of Marion Barry, was criticized for mismanagement and waste. Barry defeated incumbent mayor Walter Washington in the 1978 Democratic Party primary. Barry was then elected mayor, serving three successive four-year terms. During his administration in 1989, The Washington Monthly magazine claimed that the District had \\"the worst city government in America\\". After being imprisoned for six months on misdemeanor drug charges in 1990, Barry did not run for reelection. In 1991, Sharon Pratt Kelly became the first black woman to lead a major U.S. city. Barry was elected again in 1994 and by the next year the city had become nearly insolvent. In 1995, Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee all municipal spending and rehabilitate the city government. Mayor Anthony Williams won election in 1998. His administration oversaw a period of greater prosperity, urban renewal, and budget surpluses. The District regained control over its finances in 2001 and the oversight board's operations were suspended in September of that year. Williams did not seek reelection in 2006. Council member Adrian Fenty defeated Council Chairwoman Linda Cropp in that year's Democratic primary race to succeed Williams as mayor and started his term in 2007. Shortly upon taking office, Fenty won approval from the city council to directly manage and overhaul the city's under-performing public school system. However, Fenty lost a Democratic Party primary to former Council Chair Vincent Gray in August 2010. Mayor Gray won the general election and assumed office in January 2011 with a pledge to bring economic opportunities to more of the city's residents and under-served areas. 21st century =Terrorism and security= The Washington area was a main target of the September 11, 2001 attacks. American Airlines Flight 77 was hijacked by five Islamic terrorists and flew into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, killing 125 people inside the building, as well as 64 on board the airliner, including the five terrorists. United Airlines Flight 93, which was also hijacked and which went down in an open field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, supposedly intended to target either the White House or the U.S. Capitol. Since September 11, 2001, a number of high-profile incidents and security scares have occurred in Washington. In October 2001, anthrax attacks, involving anthrax-contaminated mail sent to numerous members of Congress, infected 31 staff members, and killed two U.S. Postal Service employees who handled the contaminated mail at the Brentwood sorting facility. An FBI and DOJ investigation determined the likely culprit of the anthrax attacks to be Bruce Edwards Ivins, a scientist, but he committed suicide in July 2008 before formal charges were filed. During three weeks of October 2002, fear spread among residents of the Washington area, during the Beltway Sniper attacks. Ten apparently random victims were killed, with three others wounded, before John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo were arrested on October 24, 2002. In 2003 and 2004, a serial arsonist set over 40 fires, mainly in the District and the close-in Maryland suburbs, with one fire killing an elderly woman. A local man was arrested in the serial arson case in April 2005 and pleaded guilty. The toxin ricin was found in the mailroom of the White House in November 2003 and in the mailroom of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist in February 2004. After the September 11 attacks, security was increased in Washington. Screening devices for biological agents, metal detectors, and vehicle barriers became more commonplace at office buildings as well as government buildings. After the 2004 Madrid train bombings, local authorities decided to test explosives detectors on the vulnerable Washington Metro subway system. When U.S. forces in Pakistan raided a house suspected of being a terrorist hideout, they found information several years old about planned attacks on Washington, D.C., New York City, and Newark, New Jersey. It was directed to intelligence officials. On August 1, 2004, the Secretary of Homeland Security put the city on Orange (High) Alert. A few days later, security checkpoints appeared in and around the Capitol Hill and Foggy Bottom neighborhoods, and fences were erected on monuments once freely accessible, such as the Capitol. Tours of the White House were limited to those arranged by members of Congress. Screening devices for biological agents, metal detectors, and vehicle barriers became more common at office buildings as well as government buildings and in transportation facilities. This ultra-tight security was referred to as \\"Fortress Washington\\"; many people objected to \\"walling off Washington\\" based on information several years old. The vehicle inspections set up around the U.S. Capitol were removed in November 2004. =Washington Navy Yard shooting= On September 16, 2013, the Washington Navy Yard shooting occurred when lone gunman Aaron Alexis fatally shot twelve people and injured three others in a mass shooting at the headquarters of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) inside the Washington Navy Yard in the Southeast quadrant of the city. The attack, which took place in the Navy Yard's Building 197, began around 8:20 a.m. EDT and ended when Alexis was killed by police around 9:20 a.m. EDT. It was the second-deadliest mass murder on a U.S. military base, behind only the Fort Hood shooting in November 2009. =Statehood movement= On November 8, 2016, Washington voters were asked to advise the Council to approve or reject a proposal, which included advising the council to petition Congress to admit the District as the 51st State and to approve a constitution and boundaries for the new state. The voters of the District of Columbia voted overwhelmingly to advise the Council to approve the proposal, with 86% of voters voting to advise approving the proposal. Challenges, including Republican opposition in Congress and constitutional issues, continue to cause problems for the movement. Changing demographics New migration patterns have appeared. Washington has a steadily declining black population, due to many African Americans' leaving the city for suburbs. At the same time, the city's Caucasian and Hispanic populations have steadily increased. Since 2000 there has been a 7.3% decrease in the African-American population, and a 17.8% increase in the white population. In addition, many African Americans are going to the South in a New Great Migration, because of family ties, increased opportunities and lower cost of living. They still are a majority in the city, comprising 51 percent of the population.

Here, a coachman in the Netherlands wears them during Prinsjesdag, 2013. Breeches as worn in the United States in the late 18th century: Elijah Boardman by Ralph Earl, 1789. Breeches ( )Collins English Dictionary are an article of clothing covering the body from the waist down, with separate coverings for each leg, usually stopping just below the knee, though in some cases reaching to the ankles. The breeches were normally closed and fastened about the leg, along its open seams at varied lengths, and to the knee, by either buttons or by a drawstring, or by one or more straps and buckle or brooches. Formerly a standard item of Western men's clothing, they had fallen out of use by the mid-19th century in favour of trousers. Note that modern athletic garments used for English riding and fencing, although called breeches or britches, differ from breeches in ways discussed below. See and . Etymology Breeches is a double plural known since c. 1205, from Old English , the plural of \\"garment for the legs and trunk\\", from the Proto- Germanic word *br≈çk-, plural *br≈çkiz whence also the Old Norse word , which shows up in the epithet of the Viking king Ragnar Lo√∞br√≥k, Ragnar \\"Hairy- breeches\\". Like other words for similar garments (e.g., pants, knickers, and shorts) the word breeches has been applied to both outer garments and undergarments. Breeches uses a plural form to reflect it has two legs; the word has no singular form (it is a plurale tantum). This construction is common in English and Italian (, plural of the never used ), but is no longer common in some other languages in which it was once common; e.g., the parallel modern . At first breeches indicated a cloth worn as underwear by both men and women. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, uses the word breech as a synonym or perhaps a euphemism for anus in his letters. In the latter 16th century, breeches began to replace hose (while the German , also a plural, ousted as the general English term for men's lower outer garments, a usage that remained standard until knee-length breeches were replaced for everyday wear by long pantaloons or trousers. The difference was that hose were in principle separate garments for each leg, requiring the tunic or a cod-piece to cover the private parts; whereas breeches were sewn together as a single all-enveloping garment. Until around the end of the 19th century (but later in some places), small boys wore special forms of dresses until they were \\"breeched\\", or given the adult male styles of clothes, at about the age of 6 to 8 (the age fell slowly to perhaps 3). Male and female children's styles were distinguished by chest and collar, as well as other aspects of attire, such as hairstyle. During the French Revolution, breeches ( in French) were seen as a symbol of the nobility. Lower-class revolutionaries became known as (\\"without breeches\\"). =Britches= The spelling britches is a spelling variant, not a corruption, dating from the 17th century. Presently, britches reflects a common pronunciation often used in casual speech to mean trousers or pants in many English-speaking parts of the world. Breeks is a Scots or northern English spelling and pronunciation. =Breech= The singular form of the word has survived in the sense of the part of the body covered by breeches, (i.e., posterior, buttocks); paradoxically, the alliterative expression \\"bare breech\\" thus means without any inner or outer breeches.MedicineNet.com This also led to the following words: * a (gun) breech is the part of a firearm behind the bore (since 1575 in gunnery). * breech birth in childbirthing (since 1673). Types A pair of buckles for dress breeches. The T-hook of the buckle is inserted into a buttonhole located on the strap at the bottoms of the leg of the breeches. The end of the strap is slipped through, the prongs lowered and then the end slipped through the other side of the buckle. The terms breeches or knee-breeches specifically designate the knee-length garments worn by men from the later 16th century to the early 19th century. After that, they survived in England only in very formal wear, such as the livery worn by some servants into the early 20th century, and the court dress worn by others, such as Queen's Counsel, down to the present day on formal occasions. * Spanish breeches, stiff, ungathered breeches popular from the 1630s until the 1650s. * Petticoat breeches, very full, ungathered breeches popular from the 1650s until the early 1660s, giving the impression of a woman's petticoat. * Rhinegraves, full, gathered breeches popular from the early 1660s until the mid-1670s, often worn with an overskirt over them. * Fall front breeches, breeches with a panel or flap covering the front opening and fastened up with buttons at either corner. * Dress breeches are tight fitting and have buttons and a strap and buckle (which are detachable) closure at the bottoms, made of velvet or barathea wool, used for livery, formal and court dress. * From the 1890s to the 1930s a form of breeches called knickerbockers or knickers (US) were in fashion with both men and boys. Like their 18th century predecessor, they reached and were fastened just below the knees, but the thighs were more loosely worn. There were various versions including \\"plus fours\\" for golf wear which reached down a further four inches below the knees, or \\"plus twos\\" that reached down only two inches, often used as apparel for the sport of bird-shooting, especially in Britain. * () are the traditional breeches of the islands of Greece from the westernmost Ionian Islands to the easternmost, Cyprus, and the southern coast of the Peloponnese. Greek breeches are extremely roomy and are meant to be tucked inside tall boots just below the knee. They were originally meant to facilitate movement on fishing boats and sailing ships. :They are usually accompanied by a long, wide piece of cloth turned many times around the natural waist as a belt. As the vr√°ka lack pockets, items (such as money) are stored inside the folds of this belt. are usually made of sturdy cotton double cloth, usually dark blue or black, with brighter color cloth used as the belt. They were usually worn with white, long-sleeved shirts and a roomy waistcoat. : In Cyprus, the vr√°ka was originally made of white material which was then sent to a dyer known as a (œÄŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ±œÑŒ∂ŒπŒÆœÇ in Cypriot Greek, related Standard Modern Greek , \\"painter\\", but semantically Œ≤Œ±œÜŒ≠Œ±œÇ, ) to garment dye the after making-up. : In contrast to its present-day use, black coloured vr√°kes in Cyprus were worn as a formal dress in events such as weddings or for going to church on Sunday, whereas the everyday vr√°ka that Cypriot men wore were of thin blue or white cloth in the summer, and thicker dark blue cloth (similar to the Cretan blue vr√°ka) in the winter. In the hills, Cypriot men wore shorter vr√°kes in order to make their work easier and wore frangopod√≠nes (œÜœÅŒ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒøœÄŒøŒ¥ŒØŒΩŒµœÇ, \\"Frankish boots\\", i.e. boots in a Western European style), a knee-length boot. In large cities of Cyprus, the vr√°ka was always black. * Breeches are still worn by many Hasidic men, particularly those of Galician or Hungarian origin, such as Satmar and Sanz * In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term breech-cloth or breech-clout was also used to describe the apron-like loincloths worn by some Indigenous peoples of the Americas. * In the Book of Exodus, the kohanim (priests) were commanded to wear white linen breeches, the priestly undergarments. =Riding breeches= Equestrian portrait of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn by David Morier around 1765. Riding breeches are specifically designed for equestrian activities. Traditionally, they were tight in the legs, stopping about halfway down the calf, with buttons or laces in the calf section, and had a pronounced flare through the thighs that allowed freedom of movement for the rider. Before the invention of the fly front, they were made with flaps, 5-8 inches wide, called falls. However, with the advent of modern stretch materials such as spandex, many modern breeches have no flare and fit skin-tight. In some cases, zippers and velcro fastenings have replaced laces and buttons at the calves as well. The flared style is seen at times, and is available to cavalry and other historic reenactors. There are four main types of riding breeches: ;Knee-patch breeches :Breeches that stop mid-calf, designed to be worn with tall boots, which come up to the knee, or with half chaps and short paddock boots. They have grippy material, usually suede leather or a \\"grippy\\" synthetic, only on the inside of the knee area. These are the only type of breeches worn by hunt seat riders. Show jumpers, eventers, show hunters, as well as some endurance riders, and pleasure riders also often use the breeches.Price, Steven D. (ed.) The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated New York: Fireside 1998 pp. 211‚Äì15 ;Full seat breeches :Breeches with suede or another grippy material from the knee, up the inner thigh, and across the buttocks. These breeches are primarily seen in dressage competition, where the \\"sticky\\" seat helps riders stay quiet and deep in the saddle as they sit the gaits of their horses. However, they are also worn by eventers and other riders. They are designed to be worn with tall boots or half chaps. ;Jockeys' breeches :Also known as silks, jockeys' breeches are made from a white lightweight fabric, usually nylon and typically have elasticised lower legs. Some racing authorities have regulations that require a jockey's name to be inscribed along the thigh of the breeches. ;Jodhpur breeches 2005 Melbourne show competitor in jodhpurs. :These breeches, which are also called jodhpurs, are a type of riding pants with legs extending to the ankles, where they end in a small cuff that fits over the top of a low riding boot. They are commonly placed in a separate category from other types of breeches due to their additional length. They are most often worn by children. However, they are worn by adults in the show ring in the United Kingdom and Australia, and in the United States are seen on adults during riding lessons and for casual riding. These riding pants have elastic straps or \\"stirrups\\" that run under the rider's boots, and are usually worn with garters, to prevent them from riding up. They are meant to be worn with jodhpur boots, also known as \\"paddock boots\\", which come up just above the ankles. The advantage of jodhpurs is that expensive high riding boots are not required to protect the calf of the leg from rubbing against the horse's flank or the stirrup leathers. ;Kentucky jodhpurs :Kentucky jodhpurs are full-length riding pants used exclusively in saddle seat style riding. Like hunt seat jodhpurs, they are close-fitting from waist to ankle, but differ in that they are much longer, ending with a flared bell bottom that fits over the jodhpur boot, usually extending longer than the heel of the boot in back, and covering the arch of the foot (but not the toe) in front. The overall look gives the impression of a rider with a long leg, a desired equitation standard. Like the hunt seat jodhpur, they have elastic straps that run under the boot to help hold the pant leg in place. Color is important in selecting breeches for competition. Sanctioning organizations and tradition both dictate that show clothing is to be quiet, classic and conservative in design. White is common in dressage, and is also seen in show jumping. Beige is seen in most hunt seat-style equestrian disciplines, though light grays, \\"canary\\" (a dull yellow), rust, tan, and an olive-greenish colour are periodically popular with hunt seat competitors. Eventers wear classic colours for the dressage and stadium phase, but less classic colours may be seen on the cross-country course (especially at the lower levels) to match the \\"stable colours\\" of the rider. Saddle seat riders, whose riding clothing styles derived from men's business suits, wear Kentucky jodhpurs in dark colors, usually black, navy blue, or a shade that matches the riding coat. Breeches may be front or side zip. Some competitors believe the side-zip to give a cleaner appearance and to be more flattering. Styles are also developing to parallel trends in street clothing, including low-rise breeches and brightly colored and patterned breeches & jodhpurs that are aimed primarily at children. Riding breeches were formerly made of thick cavalry-twill and had flared thighs (balloon legs), until the invention and use of multi-stretch fabrics like Nylon and Spandex became widespread for riding in the 1960s. The balloon legs were there to accommodate the riders knees as they sat in the saddle, but fabrics that stretched in all four directions made such excess material unnecessary and the form-fitting and much thinner modern breeches and jodhpurs became normal. =Fencing breeches= Fencing breeches are worn in the sport of fencing to permit fencers to extend their legs more than they could wearing normal jogging trousers or tracksuit bottoms. Fencing breeches are also used as protective clothing for the legs.

Nizwa is about (1.5 hours) from Muscat. The population is estimated at around 72,000 people, including the two areas of Burkat Al Mooz and Al-Jabel Al-Akhdar. Nizwa is one of the oldest cities in Oman and it was once a center of trade, religion, education and art. Its Jama (grand mosque) was formerly a center for Islamic learning. Nizwa acquired its importance because it has been an important meeting point at the base of the Western Hajar Mountains. Set amid a verdant spread of date palms, it is strategically located at the crossroads of routes linking the interior with Muscat and the lower reaches of Dhofar thus serving as the link for a large part of the country. Today, Nizwa is a diverse prosperous place with numerous agricultural, historical and recreational aspects. Nizwa is a center for date growing and is the market place for the area. Etymology Historians cannot agree on the origins of the name of the city. Some suggest the name was derived from the Arabic verb () which means being alone. Others say that the city was named after an old water spring. History British RAF Venom attacking Nizwa Fort during Jebel Akhdar War Nizwa was the capital of Oman in the 6th and 7th centuries AD. With its deep connection to the root of Islam, Nizwa possesses a number of renowned mosques, such as Sultan Qaboos Jama (Friday mosque), So'al Mosque built in the 2nd century AH (9th century AD), Ash-Shawathinah Mosque in Uqr and Ash-Sharja Mosque. There are also Al-Ain Mosque, Ash-Sheikh Mosque and Shuraij Mosque in Tanuf built in 377 AH (around 1000 AD). Ibn Battuta visited, noting it as \\"a city at the foot of a mountain, enveloped by orchards and streams, and with fine bazaars and splendid clean mosques.\\" In the early 1950s, the large round tower of the ancient fort built in the center of the town was bombed and rocketed by the British Royal Air Force, who were called in to assist the then-reigning Sultan Said bin Taymour in suppressing a revolt by leaders of the interior Imamate of Oman. The conflict was driven by a struggle for shares in Oman's newly discovered oil wealth. Nizwa has become a more modern city since 1970 under the reign of Sultan Qaboos. Improvements include connections to Muscat via a two-lane highway, which has increased tourism. Communications have been improved to include broadband access, and the city is home to a substantial hospital. It is also a hub for education including a Technical College, College of Applied Sciences, The University of Nizwa, and the training academy for the Royal Oman Police. There are now four hotels and tourism is promoted in the area. Geography and climate Mountains surround Nizwa from every side and there are some outstanding mountain scenery close by. Nizwa has an arid climate under K√∂ppen's climate classification. In the winter from November until March the climate is pleasant with temperatures as low as 12 C in January. In the summer, the climate is hot and dry with temperatures reaching 45 C in July. Attractions The main tourist attractions in the city are Nizwa Fort, the traditional Souq and Falaj Daris. In the 1990s, the Jama, the fort and the souq which sit next to each other in the centre were renovated using the same traditional materials. In 1993 Nizwa won the award of 'Organisation of Arab Cities'. =Nizwa Fort= Nizwa's enormous fort Nizwa fort was built in the 1668 AD by Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya'rubi. It is Oman's most visited national monument. The fort was the administrative seat of authority for the presiding Imams and Walis in times of peace and conflict. The main bulk of the fort took about 12 years to complete and was built above an underground stream. The fort is a reminder of the town's significance through turbulent periods in Oman's long history. It was a formidable stronghold against raiding forces that desired Nizwa's abundant natural wealth and its strategic location at the crossroads of vital routes. =Nizwa Souq= Nizwa souk The city, famous for its handicrafts and agricultural products, has an expansive souq with an array of products. It is one of the most important in the country besides Muttrah. The souq bustles with vendors selling everything from meat, fish, fruits and vegetables to spices, dates, gold and silverware. Nizwa is renowned for its silver jewelry which is considered to be the best in the country. Its people are masters in Khanjar making (curved dagger), recognised for its distinctive style and patterns. They also make copper ware, coffee pots, swords, leather goods and pottery. Nizwa fort =Falaj Daris= Falaj Daris (a World Heritage Site) is the largest falaj in Oman and is the life maintainer of Nizwa. It provides the surrounding countryside with much needed water for the plantations. Al Ghantuq and Dhoot are two other important falajs in Nizwa. Farming is widely practiced and the town's immense palm farms stretches for eight kilometers along the course of two wadis (Kalbouh and Al Abiadh). Also in practice are red sugar processing and hide tanning. Economy Historically, Nizwa was known for producing mats from straw. As of 1920, the city was described as having a \\"thriving\\" metalworking industry.

Early life Tinsley was raised in a musical family. His father was a choir director and his uncle a bassist who also played the trumpet for local bands. Tinsley graduated from the University of Virginia. While there, he became a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. Career =Dave Matthews Band= In 1991, Dave Matthews asked Tinsley to play violin on the song \\"Tripping Billies\\" with his band for their demo tape. Tinsley left his existing band (the Boyd Tinsley Trio) to join Dave Matthews Band. He became a full-time band member in 1992. Matthews later said, \\"We had no plans of adding a violinist. We just wanted some fiddle tracked on this one song \\"Tripping Billies\\", and Boyd was a friend of Leroi. He came in and it just clicked. That completely solidified the band, gave it a lot more power.\\" After noticeably struggling at shows during 2014 in Australia, Tinsley revealed via his Twitter page that he had developed arthritis in his right hand. Tinsley underwent surgery to correct carpal tunnel syndrome. In February 2018, Tinsley took a leave of absence from the band to focus on his health. On May 18, 2018, the band announced that Tinsley had been fired in response to a lawsuit filed by former Crystal Garden band member James Frost-Winn alleging sexual misconduct by Tinsley. =Crystal Garden= In August 2015, Tinsley formed Crystal Garden with Mycle Wastman, Charlie Csontos and Matt Frewen. For two years, he looked for a specific group of musicians who would form a modern day rock band. On the forming of the band, Tinsley commented, \\"The band was an idea I had maybe three years ago. I really wanted to create a young rock band ‚Äì not a pop band ‚Äì but a real rock band that had the same sensibility that rock from the 1960s and 1970s had to it. You know, something rocking from the heart and expressing something real\\". In their first week of recording sessions at Boyd's studio in Virginia they tracked the bulk of their first studio album, Let The Rocks Cry Out, which Tinsley produced. The album was released digitally on all platforms March 14, 2017 and physically on April 22, 2017. The band appeared on numerous morning shows. On February 2, 2018, attorneys for former Crystal Garden band member James Frost-Winn sent Tinsley a demand letter in an effort to obtain an out-of-court settlement in regard to sexual harassment allegations. The case was settled in June 2019. =Other work= In 2000, Tinsley made a guest appearance on The Getaway People's second album, Turnpike Diaries.Bessman, Jim (May 27, 2000), \\"Getaway People Tour For 2nd Columbia Set\\". Billboard. 112 (22):15 In 2003, Tinsley released a solo album, True Reflections, featuring the title track he had written over a decade earlier. Tinsley was the principal songwriter of the album. True Reflections focuses on Tinsley as a singer-songwriter and does not feature much violin playing. On March 20, 2009, Tinsley appeared with former U.S. poet laureate Rita Dove at the Paramount Theater in Charlottesville when she launched her poetry book Sonata Mulattica, about 19th-century violin virtuoso George Bridgetower; Tinsley is mentioned in the first poem in the book, \\"The Bridgetower\\". He composed and performed a musical piece for the event, read a poem from the book and discussed his musical life in particular and the role of classically trained African- American musicians in general with Dove. Tinsley was a writer for the short film Faces in the Mirror, which was first shown at the Woodstock Film Festival on October 13, 2012. Personal life Tinsley has two children with his wife Emily: a daughter, Abagail (born 1996) and a son, Noah (born 1999). Tinsley played in a celebrity doubles tennis match in 2007 with John McEnroe against Pete Sampras and Autria Godfrey.

Family members - Isoforms Akt1 is involved in cellular survival pathways, by inhibiting apoptotic processes. Akt1 is also able to induce protein synthesis pathways, and is therefore a key signaling protein in the cellular pathways that lead to skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and general tissue growth. Mouse model with complete deletion of Akt1 manifests growth retardation and increased spontaneous apoptosis in tissues such as testes and thymus. Since it can block apoptosis, and thereby promote cell survival, Akt1 has been implicated as a major factor in many types of cancer. Akt (now also called Akt1) was originally identified as the oncogene in the transforming retrovirus, AKT8. Akt2 is an important signaling molecule in the insulin signaling pathway. It is required to induce glucose transport. In a mouse which is null for Akt1 but normal for Akt2, glucose homeostasis is unperturbed, but the animals are smaller, consistent with a role for Akt1 in growth. In contrast, mice which do not have Akt2, but have normal Akt1, have mild growth deficiency and display a diabetic phenotype (insulin resistance), again consistent with the idea that Akt2 is more specific for the insulin receptor signaling pathway. Akt isoforms are overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, and, at the genomic level, are amplified in gastric adenocarcinomas (Akt1), ovarian (Akt2), pancreatic (Akt2) and breast (Akt2) cancer. The role of Akt3 is less clear, though it appears to be predominantly expressed in the brain. It has been reported that mice lacking Akt3 have small brains. Name The name Akt does not refer to its function. The \\"Ak\\" in Akt refers to the AKR mouse strain that develops spontaneous thymic lymphomas. The \\"t\\" stands for 'thymoma'; the letter was added when a transforming retrovirus was isolated from the Ak strain, which was termed \\"Akt-8\\". When the oncogene encoded in this virus was discovered, it was termed v-Akt. Thus, the later identified human analogues were named accordingly. Regulation Akt1 is involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and other signaling pathways. =Binding phospholipids= Akt possesses a protein domain known as a PH domain, or Pleckstrin Homology domain, named after Pleckstrin, the protein in which it was first discovered. This domain binds to phosphoinositides with high affinity. In the case of the PH domain of Akt, it binds either PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate, PtdIns(3,4)P2). This is useful for control of cellular signaling because the di-phosphorylated phosphoinositide PIP2 is only phosphorylated by the family of enzymes, PI 3-kinases (phosphoinositide 3-kinase or PI3-K), and only upon receipt of chemical messengers which tell the cell to begin the growth process. For example, PI 3-kinases may be activated by a G protein coupled receptor or receptor tyrosine kinase such as the insulin receptor. Once activated, PI 3-kinase phosphorylates PIP2 to form PIP3. =Phosphorylation= Once correctly positioned at the membrane via binding of PIP3, Akt can then be phosphorylated by its activating kinases, phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDPK1 at threonine 308) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2 at serine 473) which is found at high levels in the fed state, first by mTORC2. mTORC2 therefore functionally acts as the long-sought PDK2 molecule, although other molecules, including integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2) can also serve as PDK2. Phosphorylation by mTORC2 stimulates the subsequent phosphorylation of Akt by PDPK1. Activated Akt can then go on to activate or deactivate its myriad substrates (e.g. mTOR) via its kinase activity. Besides being a downstream effector of PI 3-kinases, Akt can also be activated in a PI 3-kinase- independent manner. ACK1 or TNK2, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, phosphorylates Akt at its tyrosine 176 residue, leading to its activation in PI 3-kinase-independent manner. Studies have suggested that cAMP-elevating agents could also activate Akt through protein kinase A (PKA) in the presence of insulin. = O-GlcNAcylation = Akt can be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT. O-GlcNAcylation of Akt is associated with a decrease in T308 phosphorylation. =Ubiquitination= Akt is normally phosphorylated at position T450 in the turn motif when Akt is translated. If Akt is not phosphorylated at this position, Akt does not fold in the right way. The T450-non-phosphorylated misfolded Akt is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Akt is also phosphorylated at T308 and S473 during IGF-1 response, and the resulting polyphosphorylated Akt is ubiquitinated partly by E3 ligase NEDD4. Most of the ubiquitinated-phosphorylated-Akt is degraded by the proteasome, while a small amount of phosphorylated-Akt translocates to the nucleus in a ubiquitination- dependent way to phosphorylate its substrate. A cancer-derived mutant Akt (E17K) is more readily ubiquitinated and phosphorylated than the wild type Akt. The ubiquitinated-phosphorylated-Akt (E17K) translocates more efficiently to the nucleus than the wild type Akt. This mechanism may contribute to E17K-Akt-induced cancer in humans. =Lipid phosphatases and PIP3= PI3K-dependent Akt activation can be regulated through the tumor suppressor PTEN, which works essentially as the opposite of PI3K mentioned above. PTEN acts as a phosphatase to dephosphorylate PIP3 back to PIP2. This removes the membrane-localization factor from the Akt signaling pathway. Without this localization, the rate of Akt activation decreases significantly, as do all of the downstream pathways that depend on Akt for activation. PIP3 can also be de-phosphorylated at the \\"5\\" position by the SHIP family of inositol phosphatases, SHIP1 and SHIP2. These poly-phosphate inositol phosphatases dephosphorylate PIP3 to form PIP2. =Protein phosphatases= The phosphatases in the PHLPP family, PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 have been shown to directly de- phosphorylate, and therefore inactivate, distinct Akt isoforms. PHLPP2 dephosphorylates Akt1 and Akt3, whereas PHLPP1 is specific for Akt 2 and Akt3.  Function  Akt regulates cellular survival and metabolism by binding and regulating many downstream effectors, e.g. Nuclear Factor-Œ∫B, Bcl-2 family proteins, master lysosomal regulator TFEB and murine double minute 2 (MDM2). =Cell survival= Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis. Akt could promote growth factor-mediated cell survival both directly and indirectly. BAD is a pro-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family. Akt could phosphorylate BAD on Ser136, which makes BAD dissociate from the Bcl-2/Bcl-X complex and lose the pro-apoptotic function. Akt could also activate NF-Œ∫B via regulating IŒ∫B kinase (IKK), thus result in transcription of pro-survival genes. =Cell cycle= Akt is known to play a role in the cell cycle. Under various circumstances, activation of Akt was shown to overcome cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 phases. Moreover, activated Akt may enable proliferation and survival of cells that have sustained a potentially mutagenic impact and, therefore, may contribute to acquisition of mutations in other genes. =Metabolism= Akt2 is required for the insulin-induced translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) could be inhibited upon phosphorylation by Akt, which results in increase of glycogen synthesis. GSK3 is also involved in Wnt signaling cascade, so Akt might be also implicated in the Wnt pathway. Its role in HCV induced steatosis is unknown. =Lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy= Akt regulates TFEB, a master controller of lysosomal biogenesis, by direct phosphorylation at serine 467. Phosphorylated TFEB is excluded from the nucleus and less active. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt promotes nuclear translocation of TFEB, lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. =Angiogenesis= Akt1 has also been implicated in angiogenesis and tumor development. Although deficiency of Akt1 in mice inhibited physiological angiogenesis, it enhanced pathological angiogenesis and tumor growth associated with matrix abnormalities in skin and blood vessels. Clinical relevance Akt is associated with tumor cell survival, proliferation, and invasiveness. The activation of Akt is also one of the most frequent alterations observed in human cancer and tumor cells. Tumor cells that have constantly active Akt may depend on Akt for survival. Therefore, understanding Akt and its pathways is important for the creation of better therapies to treat cancer and tumor cells. A mosaic-activating mutation (c. 49G‚ÜíA, p.Glu17Lys) in AKT1 is associated with the Proteus Syndrome, which causes overgrowth of skin, connective tissue, brain and other tissues. =AKT inhibitors= Because of the Akt functions above, Akt inhibitors may treat cancers such as neuroblastoma. Some Akt inhibitors have undergone clinical trials. In 2007 VQD-002 had a phase I trial. In 2010 Perifosine reached phase II. but it failed phase III in 2012. Miltefosine is approved for leishmaniasis and under investigation for other indications including HIV. AKT is now thought to be the \\"key\\" for cell entry by HSV-1 and HSV-2 (herpes virus: oral and genital, respectively). Intracellular calcium release by the cell allows for entry by the herpes virus; the virus activates AKT, which in turn causes the release of calcium. Treating the cells with AKT inhibitors before virus exposure leads to a significantly lower rate of infection. MK-2206 reported phase 1 results for advanced solid tumors in 2011, and subsequently has undergone numerous phase II studies for a wide variety of cancer types.MK-2206 phase-2 trials In 2013 AZD5363 reported phase I results regarding solid tumors.AKT inhibitor AZD5363 well tolerated, yielded partial response in patients with advanced solid tumors with a study of AZD5363 with olaparib reporting in 2016. Ipatasertib is in phase II trials for breast cancer. =Decreased AKT can cause deleterious effects= AKT activation is associated with many malignancies; however, a research group from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University unexpectedly observed a converse role for AKT and one of its downstream effector FOXOs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). They claimed that low levels of AKT activity associated with elevated levels of FOXOs are required to maintain the function and immature state of leukemia- initiating cells (LICs). FOXOs are active, implying reduced Akt activity, in ‚àº40% of AML patient samples regardless of genetic subtype; and either activation of Akt or compound deletion of FoxO1/3/4 reduced leukemic cell growth in a mouse model. =Hyperactivation of AKT can cause deleterious effects= Two studies show that AKT1 is involved in Juvenile Granulosa Cell tumors (JGCT). In-frame duplications in the pleckstrin-homology domain (PHD) of the protein were found in more than 60% of JGCTs occurring in girls under 15 years of age. The JGCTs without duplications carried point mutations affecting highly conserved residues. The mutated proteins carrying the duplications displayed a non-wild-type subcellular distribution, with a marked enrichment at the plasma membrane. This led to a striking degree of AKT1 activation demonstrated by a strong phosphorylation level and corroborated by reporter assays. Analysis by RNA-Seq pinpointed a series of differentially expressed genes, involved in cytokine and hormone signaling and cell division- related processes. Further analyses pointed to a possible dedifferentiation process and suggested that most of the transcriptomic dysregulations might be mediated by a limited set of transcription factors perturbed by AKT1 activation. These results incriminate somatic mutations of AKT1 as major probably driver events in the pathogenesis of JGCTs.

He worked on Gas Works Park in Seattle, Washington and on the Bloedel Reserve on Bainbridge Island. He founded the Landscape Architecture Program at the University of Washington and held multiple design awards. Richard Haag's modernist and minimalist ideals set the tone for northwestern landscape design. Richard Haag was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He attended the University of Illinois, the University of California, received his bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture (B.L.A.) at the University of California, Berkeley, and his master's degree in Landscape Architecture (M.L.A.) at Harvard Graduate School of Design. In 1958 Richard Haag joined the University of Washington faculty in Seattle, Washington in an attempt to start a Landscape Architecture Design program at the university. His efforts resulted in a Landscape Architecture Department by 1964. At the same time that he was building up the program at the University of Washington, Richard Haag was acting as lead designer at his self-made design company Richard Haag Associates. Through his position at Richard Haag Associates he has generated over 500 designs and planning projects. His company, located in Seattle, closed on June 30, 2016Richard Haag Studio and he died in May 2018 at the age of 94.

In 1906 on a peninsula on the north shore of Lake Union the Seattle Gas Company constructed a coal gas plant. By 1956 the plant was shut down, leaving behind the old refinery towers. Upon purchasing the land in 1970, Haag was the person asked to develop a park design for the site. While most planners had expected the demolition of the refinery towers, Haag decided to keep them‚Ä†. He did not incorporate them into the design for historic purposes, but rather to visually enhance the design of the park. While convincing city government to accept this radical plan was challenging enough, Haag also had to develop a design which integrated bioremediation methods in order to detoxify the soil without transporting and replacing it. Haag and his colleagues suggested the use of oil-degrading enzymes and organic material in order to stimulate growth of microorganisms and to breakdown the toxic materials that were still present in the soil, left behind by the ancient industrial processes of the plant. Before Richard Haag was asked to develop this design, he submitted the site as a design problem to a national undergraduate design competition. All 130 designs removed all indications that a gas plant ever existed. Haag took the environmentalist ideal to another level; acknowledging the potential aesthetics of industrial structures without the hazard to the environment. His design for Gas Works Park brought Haag his first American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) President's Award for Design Excellence. Bloedel Reserve A willow at Bloedel Reserve Haag received his second ASLA award for his design titled \\"Sequence of Gardens\\" at Bloedel Reserved located on Bainbridge Island. The Bloedel Reserve, deeded to the University of Washington in 1970, was again sold in 1986 to the Arbor Fund‚Ä†. This non-profit corporation hired Haag as head designer for the site in order to maintain the company's dedication to \\"...developing, maintaining, and managing the reserve for public and educational purposes\\". Haag split the land into four main garden quadrants. Each 'room' had a specific theme yet maintained certain qualities that fluidly connected the spaces together. The gardens are described as having been created in pairs; that garden one and three are a design pair and two and four are also‚Ä†. Garden one and three are noted for their geometric-based designs. The first garden known as the Garden of Planes is described as being the most abstract of the four gardens. The third garden is the Reflection Garden; which incorporates the use of free-standing walls of yew and the introduction of a pool that uses reflection to enhance visual aesthetics. Gardens two and four exude the theme of life and death. The second garden known as the Anteroom connects the Garden of Planes and the Reflection Garden. This garden teems with mosses, lichens, ferns, leaving observers with a sense of decay and death. Garden four on the other hand is known as the Bird Sanctuary and is the final garden in the sequence. This garden poses as the opposite of the Anteroom through its use of dark and still waters. The purpose of this garden is to attract various wildlife to its natural-looking design.

Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411 (1964), was a United States Supreme Court decision that refined the procedures for U.S. federal courts to abstain from deciding issues of state law, pursuant to the doctrine set forth in Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496 (1941). Facts The plaintiffs were chiropractors in the state of Louisiana. They sued in the United States District Court to prevent state officials from applying a licensing scheme to them, arguing both that they were not within the group to whom the statute applied, and that the statute infringed the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The District Court noted that a state court might find that the state law did not apply to the plaintiffs, and abstained from hearing the case pursuant to the Pullman abstention doctrine. The plaintiffs noted that a case refining Pullman called Government and Civil Employees Organizing Committee, CIO v. Windsor, 353 U.S. 364 (1957) had held that the judgment of the state court was meaningless unless the state court was aware that constitutional questions had also been raised as to the validity of the statute. The plaintiffs therefore brought both claims in the Louisiana state court (as they believed Pullman and Windsor required). The state court found against them on both statutory and constitutional claims. The plaintiffs then returned to the District Court seeking a new hearing on the constitutional question. The defendant then sought a dismissal on res judicata grounds, contending that the decision of the state court was binding as to the constitutional issue. Issue Can the federal court hear the case once the state has ruled on the merits of the constitutional issue? Result The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Brennan, noted that the state court determination would indeed bind the federal court. The proper procedure, the Court determined, is to give notice that the federal issue is contended, but to expressly reserve the claim on the federal issue for the federal court. If such a reservation is made, the parties can return to the federal court, even if the state court makes a ruling on the issue. However, the Court also noted that even if the parties did not expressly reserve the federal issues, they can still return to the federal court if it is apparent that the parties had avoided adjudication of the state law issues. Because the plaintiffs in this case believed that they were just following the law as required, they would not be barred from continuing in the federal court.

An English Parliamentarian force under Roger Boyle, (Lord Broghill), defeated an Irish Confederate force under David Roche. Background Boyle had taken Cork for the English Parliamentarians by inducing its English Royalist garrison to defect to the Parliamentary side, which they had served until 1648. This was a major help to Oliver Cromwell's campaign in Ireland, as it secured for him most of Munster and its port towns. The Irish and Royalist troops in the province retreated to western County Kerry, which is a natural stronghold due to its remote and mountainous terrain. The battle David Roche, an Irish officer, organised an offensive, out of Kerry with 1,400 men in May 1650, in an effort to relieve the Siege of Clonmel. Cromwell sent Boyle to intercept Roche's force with 1,500 infantry and 500 cavalrymen. When Roche realised that he was being pursued, he turned back. Rather than let the Irish force escape, Boyle followed them with his cavalry alone. He caught them at Macroom on the 10th of May. The English surprised the Irish with a cavalry charge before they could form up for battle and routed them. Several hundred Irish soldiers were killed. The Parliamentarian's losses were light. Roche's force broke up in disorder and fell back towards the mountains of Kerry. Aftermath The following day, Boyle besieged and took Carrigadrohid castle. His men had taken Boetius MacEgan, the Catholic Bishop of Ross prisoner and warned the garrison that they would kill him unless they surrendered. MacEgan told the garrison not to surrender and was then hanged in view of the castle walls. The garrison surrendered shortly afterwards but were allowed to march away unmolested.

Early years Le Guillou was born in Quimperl√©, France. He immigrated from France to the Island of Guadeloupe in the French West Indies where he became a land owner.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service Father of Vieques In 1823, Le Guillou went to the island of Vieques with the intention of purchasing hardwoods. The island at the time had a few residents who were dedicated woodcutters. He was impressed with the island of Vieques and saw the agricultural potential of the island. He returned the following year and purchased lands from a woodcutter named Patricio Ramos. Soon, he established the largest sugar plantation on the island which he named \\"La Pacience\\". He then got rid of the pirates and those involved in contraband activities an action which in itself pleased the Spanish colonial government. Le Guillou is considered to be the founder of the municipality of Vieques. Military commander of Vieques In 1832, Le Guillou proceeded Francisco Rosello as the military commander of Vieques after Rosello's death. Between 1832 and 1843, Le Guillou who had been given the title of \\"Political and Military Governor of the Spanish Island of Vieques\\" by the Spanish Crown, developed a plan for the political and economic organization of the island.Enlaces de Vieques (Spanish) He established five sugar plantations in the island named Esperanza, Resolucion, Destino, Mon Repos and Mi Reposo.\\"Guias para el Desarollo Sustentable de Vieques\\" (Spanish), By Grupo de Apoyo Tecnicos y Profesionales, Special Commission on Vieques, Pg.5 French immigrants House of Henri Muraille Le Guillou, who was the most powerful landlord and owner of slaves in the island, requested from the Spanish Crown permission to allow the immigration of French families from the Caribbean Islands of Martinique and Guadalupe which at the time were French possessions. Attracted by the offer of free land as one of the concessions stipulated in the revised Spanish Royal Decree of 1815, dozens of French families, among them the Mouraille's, Martineau's and Le Brun's, immigrated to Vieques and with the use of slave manpower established sugar plantations. By 1839, there were 138 \\"habitaciones\\" which comes from the French word \\"habitation\\" meaning plantation. These habitaciones were located from Punta Mulas and Punta Arenas.

The movie reached #50 on the Variety magazine national box office list in 1967.Adam Victor, The Elvis Encyclopedia. Overlook, 2008. Easy Come, Easy Go, Presley's twenty-third film, was released on March 22, a mere two weeks before his twenty-fourth, Double Trouble, released on April 5. However, Double Trouble was filmed before Easy Come, Easy Go. Plot United States Navy officer Lieutenant Junior Grade (j.g.) Ted Jackson (Elvis Presley) is a former U.S. Navy frogman who divides his time between twin careers as a deep sea diver and nightclub singer. Ted discovers what he believes could be a fortune in Spanish gold aboard a sunken ship and sets out to rescue it with the help of go-go dancing yoga expert Jo Symington (Dodie Marshall) and friend Judd Whitman (Pat Harrington, Jr.). Gil Carey (Skip Ward), however, is also after the treasure and uses his girlfriend Dina Bishop (Pat Priest) to foil Ted's plans. Presley's sings six songs in the movie: the title song, \\"I'll Take Love\\", \\"Sing You Children\\", \\"You Gotta Stop\\", \\"Yoga Is as Yoga Does\\" in a duet with Elsa Lanchester, and \\"The Love Machine\\". The film would be the first starring Presley that had a ballad-free soundtrack since his 1956 film debut, Love Me Tender.

Soundtrack Reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times called the film \\"a tired little clinker that must have been shot during lunch hour\\" and also criticized it for only including \\"three measly songs. A pittance!\\" Variety was more positive, writing: \\"Good balance of script and songs, plus generally amusing performances by a competent, well-directed cast, add up to diverting entertainment.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four and wrote that it was \\"obviously produced with a minimum of care and with the sole purpose of contriving a plot, any plot, to fill in between when Elvis sings.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film was \\"aptly summed up in its title: easy to take, easy to forget.

An 1863 Springfield Rifled Musket and an Enfield Musketoon. Springfield and Enfield Actions. Mini√© balls. The Springfield Model 1861 was a Mini√©-type rifled musket shoulder-arm used by the United States Army and Marine Corps during the American Civil War. Commonly referred to as the \\"Springfield\\" (after its original place of production, Springfield, Massachusetts), it was the most widely used U.S. Army weapon during the Civil War, favored for its range, accuracy, and reliability. Overview The barrel was forty inches (102 cm) long, firing a .58 caliber Mini√© ball, and the total weight was approximately nine pounds (4,9 kg). The Springfield had a general effective range of 200 to 300 yards (183‚Äì274 m) but could reliably hit man sized targets out to 500 yards (457 m) when used by marksmen, and used percussion caps to fire (rather than the flintlocks of the 18th century; the last U.S. flintlock musket was the Model 1840). Well-trained troops were able to fire at a rate of three aimed shots per minute while maintaining accuracy up to 500 yards, though firing distances in the war were often much shorter.''' The most notable difference between the Model 1861 and the earlier Model 1855 was the elimination of the Maynard tape primer for the Model 1861 (the Maynard primer, a self-feeding primer system, was unreliable in damp weather, and the priming mechanism was expensive and time-consuming to produce). Further, unlike the Model 1855, the Model 1861 was never produced in a two-banded \\"rifle\\" configuration. The Springfield was aimed using flip-up leaf sights. The sight had two leaves, one for 300 yards and the other for 500 yards, and with both leaves down, the sight was set for a range of one hundred yards (91 m). By contrast, the British Pattern 1853 Enfield, favored by the Confederates, utilized a ladder-sight system with a hundred-yard increments, using steps from 100 to 400 yards (91‚Äì366 m) and a flip up ladder for ranges beyond 500 yards. While the Enfield's sights did allow finer range settings, the Springfield's simple leaves were more rugged and were less expensive to produce. The Enfield's sights extended to 900 yards (823 m) (and further, on later models), compared to the 500 yard maximum range of the Springfield's sights. Realistically, though, hitting anything beyond 600 yards (549 m) with either weapon was mostly a matter of luck. While the sight designs were very different, the two weapons were otherwise very similar, and had very similar effective ranges. The Springfield Rifle cost twenty dollars each at the Springfield Armory where they were officially made. Overwhelmed by the demand, the armory opened its weapons patterns up to twenty private contractors. The most notable producer of contract Model 1861 Springfields was Colt, who made several minor design changes in their version, the \\"Colt Special\\" rifled musket. These changes included redesigned barrel bands, a new hammer, and a redesigned bolster. Several of these changes were eventually adopted by the Ordnance Department and incorporated into the Model 1863 rifled musket. The Springfield Model 1861 was equipped with a triangular socket bayonet. History The Model 1861 was relatively scarce in the early years of the Civil War (many troops were still using Model 1842 smoothbore muskets and Model 1816/1822 muskets converted to percussion cap primers, both in .69 caliber). It is unlikely that any of these were available for use in the First Battle of Bull Run. However, over time, more and more regiments began receiving Model 1861 rifled muskets, though this upgrade appeared somewhat quicker in the Eastern Theater of Operations. Over 1,000,000 Model 1861 rifles were produced, with the Springfield Armory increasing its production during the war by contracting out to twenty other firms in the Union. The number of Model 1861 muskets produced by the Springfield Armory was 265,129 between January 1, 1861 and December 31, 1863. According to United States Muskets, Rifles and Carbines by Arcadi Gluckman Colonel Infantry, United States Army, published 1949. The Model 1861 was certainly a step forward in U.S. small arms design, being the first rifled shoulder weapon to be produced on such a large scale (relatively few Model 1855 rifled muskets were produced, and the 1803 Harper's Ferry rifle was, and is, genuinely rare). However, some argue that its impact on the Civil war has been overstated. While more accurate in the hands of an experienced marksman, the rifled musket's accuracy was often lost in the hands of recruits who received only limited marksmanship training (the emphasis was on rate of fire). Further, most Civil War firefights were waged at a relatively close range using massed-fire tactics, minimizing the effect of the new rifle's long-range accuracy. Lastly, the .58 caliber bullet, when fired, followed a high parabolic trajectory. As a result, many inexperienced soldiers who did not adjust their sights would shoot over their enemies' heads in combat. There are numerous accounts of this happening in the war's earlier battles. With this in mind, soldiers were often instructed to aim low. Due to the width of the front sight on the Model 1861 Special the only bayonet that would fit was the Collins manufactured bayonet. The Springfield Model 1861 was succeeded by the Springfield Model 1863 which was a slightly improved version of the Model 1861. With the introduction of modern brass ammunition after the war, the Model 1861 served as the starting point for several breechloaders, most of which were converted Model 1861 rifles, culminating in the Springfield Model 1873 which would serve through the Indian Wars and all U.S. military actions until the end of the 19th century. Modern usage The Springfield Model 1861 is very popular today among Civil War reenactors and collectors alike for its accuracy, reliability and historical background. Original antique Springfields are expensive, so companies such as Davide Pedersoli & C., Armi Sport and Euro Arms make modern reproductions at much more affordable prices.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is one of only three places in the area to be explicitly associated with the ancient Celtic kingdom of Elmet via featuring the kingdom's title in its name, the others being Barwick-in-Elmet and Scholes-in-Elmet. According to the 2011 census, Sherburn has a population of 6,657. History The village is of ancient establishment, possibly with Roman origins and was part of the wapentake of Barkston Ash in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The field adjoining All Saints' Church is the site of the palace of kings of Elmet, which was given (with the manor of Cawood) by Athelstan to the Archbishops of York on his conversion to Christianity in or around the 10th century. All Saints Church The church itself is unusually large for a village parish church and dates from around 1120, with Norman pillars and a later-built large tower housing a ring of eight bells. It was built on the site of an earlier Anglo-Saxon church. The church is now a Grade I listed building. The Battle of Towton was fought nearby in 1461 and local legend tells that King Edward IV, who won the battle, used the church tower as a point for surveying the battle lines. During the English Civil War, the village was garrisoned by the Royalists for King Charles I; it was close to their stronghold at Selby and the northern capital of York, and commanded the approaches from both the south and the west. In 1645, the Parliamentarians attacked Sherburn and defeated the garrison. On 15 October 1645 the Battle of Sherburn-in-Elmet took place. A Royalist force commanded by Lord Digby and Sir Marmaduke Langdale attacked and initially defeated the Parliamentarian garrison now based in the village. However, another Parliamentarian force, under Colonel Copley, counterattacked and routed the Royalists. Thus was defeated the last significant Royalist force in the North during the First English Civil War.C. Hibbert, Cavaliers and Roundheads (1993), pp.237‚Äì238; V. Wedgwood, The King's War (1983 edition), p.504 Culture and community The Swan, One of the many pubs in Sherburn Sherburn in Elmet is often referred to locally as simply 'Sherburn'. It has Leeds as its post town and an LS25 postcode, but is in the Borough of Selby in North Yorkshire rather than the City of Leeds, which is in West Yorkshire. The village has four supermarkets: Spar, Tesco Express, Aldi and Co-op. There are several independently owned shops, and a market in the centre of the village on Wednesdays and Saturdays. HSBC Bank Squires Cafe just outside Sherburn is a long-established meeting place for motorcycle riders, particularly on Wednesday evenings and Sunday afternoons. The roads leading into Sherburn-in- Elmet are known nationally for the varied and pleasurable rides they offer for motorcyclists. The village is now home to a major industrial site attracting large businesses such as Eddie Stobart Ltd. The former Gascoigne Wood mine, which was part of the Selby coalfield project, is to the south-east. Home to Sherburn-in-Elmet Airfield which is currently the base for the Sherburn Aero Club, Sherburn's links with the air industry go back to the Second World War when the Blackburn Aircraft Company built the Fairey Swordfish in the village. Production ended in 1945, and by then 1,699 such aircraft had been built in Sherburn. The airfield also saw the first flight of L.E. Baynes's famous prototype glider, the Baynes Bat.

Later, he also appears in several Scandinavian folk tales as Gest Blinde. Hervarar saga According to Hervarar saga, Gestumblindi was a powerful man in Reidgotaland, i.e. a Goth, who had angered king Heidrek by refusing to pay him tribute. King Heidrek had in his hird twelve men who were entrusted to take care of all the legal disputes in the kingdom. If anyone had any complaint, they had the right to approach these men and would have right to both life and limb on the condition that they asked the king a number of riddles that the king could not answer. Heidrek sent a message to Gestumblindi that if he did not appear at the court at a certain date, he would be imprisoned. In desperation, Gestumblindi sacrificed to Odin asking him for assistance. Shortly thereafter, a stranger appeared at Gestumblindi's homestead, and this stranger also called himself Gestumblindi. The two men were so similar that no one could tell them apart. They changed clothes and Gestumblindi went away to hide. Everyone thought that the new man was the real Gestumblindi and then the stranger went to king Heidrek and between them was the most exquisite contest in wisdom. Gestumblindi told riddles, mostly about nature but also about Norse mythology, and Heidrek answered them all (these riddles are presented in detail and they are among the most interesting riddles in Norse mythology). Finally, Odin/Gestumblindi told Heidrek the same riddle that he had once asked Vafthruthnir, i.e. \\"What did Odin whisper in Balder's ear before Balder was cremated?\\" Heidrek, realising that Gestumblindi was Odin, became very angry and wanted to strike Odin with his cursed sword Tyrfing. Odin turned into a hawk, but Heidrek's sword cut off a piece of the bird's tail, which is why the hawk has the tail he has. Gesta Danorum Saxo Grammaticus relates that Gestiblindus was a king of the Geats who gave himself and his kingdom up to Frodi, the king of Denmark on condition that Frodi would defend him against Alrik, the king of Sweden.

Etymology  The term comes from Old Norse hir√∞, again from either Old English hir(e)d 'household, family, retinue, court'See for instance, 'hir√∞' in Cleasby-Vigfusson, Icelandic- English Dictionary, online copy or perhaps the old German cognate heirat 'marriage', both of which can mean \\"body of men\\" or more directly linked to the term for hearthguard, or men of one's own home and hearth.  History  While the term is often used in Norse sagas and law codices, it is a medieval term ‚Äì the sagas were primarily written down in the 12th century using the language of their own time. There is some uncertainty as to what the term replaced, although the term hlid or li√∞ is used in Danish sources for the warrior following of Canute the Great. By the reign of H√•kon IV (1204-1263) the Norwegian hird was no longer exclusively focused on the military function, and had acquired several subdivisions on continental patterns, with squires (kertilsveinr, literally \\"candle-men\\", which were ceremonially required to hold candles at hird ceremonies), men-at-arms (hirdmenn) and knights (skutilsveinr, literally \\"table-men\\"). In addition there were low-born gestir, who received only half pay and served as a sort of intelligence service, and were not allowed to sit at the king's table for supper, apart from Christmas day and Easter day, when the entire hird was assembled and sections of their law code, the Hirdskraa was read or recited. The upper levels of the hird were a recruitment ground for numerous royal officials, and most external officials were also incorporated into the hird. Somewhere during the reign of Magnus VI the older laws of the Hird were incorporated into the Hirdskraa law code. During the reign of H√•kon V (1299-1319) the Norse titles were dropped entirely in favor of continental titles. Emphasis was put on the Norwegian king's hird as a community of equals, a chivalresque corporation of warriors in which, technically, the king was the first among equals.  Hirdman  Hirdman (plural Hirdmen) is a word in Scandinavian languages (notably Norwegian and Swedish), literally for a member of a Hird 'household, family'. It is used as a title, originally, even in Norse mythology, for informal companions or retainers of the powerful, in the unruly old (often still pagan) times especially as companions in arms, later more refined like courtiers, a development not unlike that of the thegn or the Roman comes. When the Norwegian royal hird had developed into a formal court, hirdman became the title of the highest of its four ranks, those magnates who were allowed to seat in the royal council (the closest feudal equivalent of a cabinet) and thus had a say in governmental and other important matters. Under the rule of Nazi collaborator Vidkun Quisling, the word was again used in Norway in its original sense of 'warriors', as troops. See Hird (Nazi).

Christine Gibson \\"Our 10 Greatest Natural Disasters,\\" American Heritage, Aug./Sept. 2006. It was the 7th deadliest hurricane in the United States history, and was one of the three deadly hurricanes during the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season; the storm killed an estimated 1,000‚Äì2,000 people, mostly from storm surge. This is also the storm that made United States Life-Saving Service Keeper Dunbar Davis famous. Meteorological history Modern analysis of historical records has allowed the history of this storm to be pieced together, although the analysis is only an estimate since few accurate meteorological records were taken. On August 15, 1893, a tropical storm formed east of Cape Verde. It likely passed directly through the islands on the 16th, leaving their vicinity during the evening of the 17th. It became a hurricane on the 19th, while crossing the Atlantic between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles. The hurricane continued to strengthen, attaining Category 3 status on August 22 while located northeast of the Lesser Antilles. By the evening of the 25th, the storm was approaching the Bahamas. During the approach it began to deviate from its westerly course and arc west-northwest. It is believed that the first effects of the storm were beginning to be felt in the Sea Islands area, with the winds steadily increasing during the night of the 25th. Some of the inhabitants anticipated the storm and left the islands as quickly as possible. The conditions soon rapidly deteriorated on the island and the hurricane passed over sometime on the 26th. By now the hurricane was turning more and more towards the north. It moved parallel to the coast for about one hundred miles before making landfall. Landfall occurred near Savannah, Georgia, on August 27. Reports from the time say that wind during landfall was around , making it a category 3 storm. Pressure in Savannah was measured at ; modern estimates put the pressure around at landfall, and possibly as low as out at sea. This would have made the hurricane most likely stronger than a Category 3 storm on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. The hurricane passed north over South Carolina on August 28 and moved up the U.S. East Coast before becoming extratropical over Atlantic Canada. The storm likely intensified to a Category 4, or 5, but there are no reports of this occurring. Impact Workers sort seed potatoes that will be used to restore inundated fields following the Sea Islands, South Carolina Hurricane, which struck on August 27, 1893. The hurricane carried with it a heavy storm surge (, according to Clara Barton, although the modern NOAA SLOSH model calculates that some areas may have been inundated up to 30 feetNOAA SLOSH model), which caused great destruction along the coastline and offshore Sea Islands in Georgia and South Carolina. An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people were killed (mostly by drowning), putting it on-par with 2005's Hurricane Katrina as the sixth-deadliest hurricane in US history. St. Helena was estimated to have 6,000 African-Americans living there while 2,000 were women. The majority of the African-Americans owned land there and some rented. A lot of structures in that area were not elevated higher than 2 feet; therefore, they were covered by the first waves that went above the normal water mark. Although the hurricane was devastating, the American Red Cross did not arrive until October 1, possibly because of ongoing efforts following another hurricane that hit South Carolina in June. After the Red Cross arrived, a warehouse of clothing and food was started at Beaufort, South Carolina, to provide services to the affected. Relief efforts were impeded by a second Category 3 hurricane that struck just north of the area, near Charleston, South Carolina, on October 13. During a massive 10-month relief campaign, success was declared, with the Sea Islands population living in decent houses producing their own food again. Damages from the storm totaled to at least $1 million (1893 USD).David Longshore Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones pg. 286 Damage was reported as far north as Maine. Some areas, particularly New York City and Long Island, were already reeling from what later came to be known as the 1893 New York hurricane that had struck the region just days before, on August 24, and were damaged anew by this storm. \\"Immense\\" damage was reported to shade trees and telegraph and telephone wires in Washington. In Annapolis, Maryland \\"hardly a tree was left standing\\" and Baltimore reported the worst flooding since 1868. In New Jersey, damage was \\"heavy\\" in the New Brunswick area, and many trees were downed and roofs were blown off in Trenton. Damage was heavy all along the New Jersey coast and breakers were described as the biggest ever witnessed. Railroad tracks were under four feet of water between Bay Head and Berkley. In New York, several lives were lost in The Rockaways, and a number of people were killed at points along the Hudson River when tow boats were destroyed. Crops were heavily damaged in Pennsylvania and upstate New York. Boats were wrecked and sunk in the Dunkirk area. In Brooklyn, where 13 houses under construction were destroyed, damage was \\"severe\\" and Gravesend Bay was \\"littered with the wrecks of small yachts and boats.\\" In Coney Island, roofs were lifted off big buildings and carried for blocks. Waves topped the seawall by 15 feet at Battery Park. Damage was heavy at resorts on Long Island and it was the worst storm on the New England coast in 20 years.

It is one of fourteen species of marmots, and is native to mountainous regions of southwestern Canada and western United States, including the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, and Mount Rainier in the state of Washington, typically living above . The fur is mainly brown, with a dark bushy tail, yellow chest and white patch between the eyes, and they weigh up to approximately . They live in burrows in colonies of up to twenty individuals with a single dominant male. They are diurnal and feed on plant material, insects, and bird eggs. They hibernate for approximately eight months starting in September and lasting through the winter.  Description  Well-fed Marmota flaviventris standing, Ansel Adams Wilderness, CA Yellow-bellied marmots usually weigh from when fully grown, though males typically weigh more than females. The weight fluctuates quite drastically through the year, with the least measured in early spring and the most measured in early autumn. Adult males typically weigh between and adult females typically weigh between . They measure from in length, have a short tail measuring with buffy, reddish and black hairs and hindfoot measuring . They have a rather frosty appearance with some of the guard hairs having pale tips with dark bands. The yellow-bellied marmot has a broad and flat skull, dark head, and a dark nose with a white furry patch. The pelage comprises coarse, long outer hairs and woolly, shorter underfurs. They have a brown coat, a white patch of fur on the snout in front of the eyes. Due to the bright yellow fur on their belly, sides of the neck, and throat, they get their scientific and common names. Their ears are small and round, measuring in length, having a short white muzzle. Their back is reddish-brown in color with grizzled black and light-grey tan. Their feet are yellowish to dark brown to in color. They gain additional fat reserves in the autumn, in preparation for hibernation.  Distribution and habitat  Marmot on left The yellow-bellied marmot lives in southwestern Canada and western United States, including the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Northwards, its range extends into the southern British Columbia and goes eastwards up to the montane and basin regions of Wyoming, eastern Montana, Colorado, and southern Alberta. Southwards, its range extends into northern New Mexico. It inhabits steppes, meadows, talus fields, and other open habitats, sometimes on the edge of deciduous or coniferous forests, and found from as low as to over of elevation. They are found in valleys, meadows, and foothills, and tend to occupy open areas which are free of vegetation. Their territory is about around a number of burrows dug during the summer. They choose to dig burrows under rocks, as it is less likely to be visible to predators. These predators include foxes, dogs, coyotes, wolves, and eagles. Upon seeing a predator, the yellow-bellied marmot whistles to warn the others in the area, after which it typically hides in a nearby rock pile until there is no more threat .  Biology  = Behavior = Female with nursing pup, Kamloops, British Columbia Marmots eating trash left by backpackers at Trail Camp near Mount Whitney, CA Marmots reproduce starting at around two years of age, and may live up to an age of fifteen. They reside in colonies of about ten to twenty individuals. Each male marmot digs a burrow soon after it wakes from hibernation, and starts looking for females to reproduce. By summer, it may have up to four female mates. Litters usually average three to five offspring per female. Only about half of those pups survive and become yearlings. Marmots have a \\"harem-polygynous\\" mating system in which the male reproduces with two or three females at the same time. Female offspring tend to stay in the area around their home, while male offspring typically leave when they are yearlings and will defend one or more females. Yellow-bellied marmots spend about 80% of their lives in their burrows, 60% of which is spent hibernation. They often spend mid-day and night in a burrow as well. These burrows are usually constructed on a slope, such as a hill, mountain, or cliff. The hibernating burrows can be up to deep; however, the burrows constructed for daily use are usually only deep. Their hibernation period varies on elevation, but it is typically from September to May. Occasionally, they climb trees and other flora, though they are usually terrestrial. = Diet = Yellow-bellied marmots are diurnal, and are less active during the night. They are omnivores, but generally eat a wide variety of plants, as they are generalist herbivores. They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, larkspur, and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in cinquefoil, cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in their diet. In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of their diet. They also like to feed on alfalfa and clover. They drink less water, as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements.  Status and conservation  Since 1996, it has been listed in the least concern category of the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. As there are no major threats to this species and it is protected in several areas throughout its range, there is not much concern for serious conservation efforts to be put in place.

He was a companion of the Eighth Doctor. He should not be confused with the Krotons, the villains of the 1968 serial The Krotons. Kroton is a Cyberman, a member of the cybernetically augmented race that is one of the most persistent enemies of the Doctor. However, unlike other Cybermen, Kroton still retains human feelings despite undergoing cyber-conversion. Kroton first appeared in the comic strip Throwback -- The Soul of a Cyberman, published in Doctor Who Weekly #5-#7 (as it then was), written by Steve Moore and drawn by Steve Dillon. Character history In Throwback, the Cybermen invade the planet Mondaran, but continue to encounter heavy human resistance. Among the reinforcements from the Cyberman colony world Telos is Junior Cyberleader Kroton, who discovers that he sympathises with the rebels. He helps the surviving rebels escape the planet, even to the point of killing his fellow Cybermen to defend the rebels. However, uncertain about the meaning of his own existence, he does not stay with the humans, but pilots his ship alone into space, planning to let his power supplies run down. Kroton, alone in his ship However, Kroton survives, encountering a pleasure cruiser that is caught in a time warp (Ship of Fools, DWW #23-#24). Despite the passengers' lack of concern, he manages to access the robot pilot of the ship and free it from its endless looping through time. Unfortunately the ship has been trapped in the time warp for 628 years, and when time catches up with the passengers, they all instantly age and die, leaving Kroton alone with only the robot pilot for company. Kroton did not reappear until nearly 19 years later, in Unnatural Born Killers (DWM #277), where he fights off a Sontaran raid on a primitive human village; in the time since his last appearances, he has become more proactive and physical as well as speaking more colloquially. The story set up his appearance less than a year later in The Company of Thieves (DWM #284-#286) where he meets the Eighth Doctor and his companion Izzy on a freighter that has been captured by space pirates. After initially mistaking him for a typical Cyberman and trying to kill him, the Doctor realises that Kroton is different. Together, they deal with the pirates who are attempting to capture an intelligent super-weapon. At the conclusion of that story, the Doctor welcomes Kroton aboard the TARDIS. The TARDIS next takes the Doctor, Izzy and Kroton to the museum planet Paradost, where memories can be accessed and enhanced by means of mnemonic crystals. However, Kroton refuses to use them, believing that to remember his life before cyber-conversion would be too painful. The travellers' visit coincides with the launch of a jihad by the planet Dhakan's Church of the Glorious Dead. The wholesale slaughter turns out to be the work of the renegade Time Lord known as the Master, who had survived his last encounter with the Doctor and had been contacted by Esterath, a cosmic being that controls the Glory, the focal point of the Omniversal spectrum which underlies all existence. Esterath is dying and needs to pass control of the Glory over to the worthier of two adversaries, and tells the Master that he and the Doctor had been chosen. While the Doctor and the Master grapple in the Omniversal spectrum, Izzy and Kroton deal with the person who led the massacre on Paradost: Cardinal Morningstar, actually an immortal samurai named Sato who had found eternal life without meaning much as Kroton had. The Master had found Sato and used him to alter Earth's history and make it Dhakan. Sato and Kroton fight, but Kroton is unable to defeat Sato physically. In the spectrum, the Doctor loses his battle with the Master. As Sato is also about to prove victorious over Kroton, Izzy uses a mnemonic crystal to make Sato realise the full import of his part in the slaughter on Paradost, and Sato falls unconscious. Izzy also makes Kroton use the crystal, causing him to remember his pre-conversion life and finally come to terms with it. As the Glory arrives to acknowledge its new controller, the Master steps forward to claim it, but is rejected. It is then revealed that the true adversaries chosen by the Glory were not the Master and the Doctor, but Sato and Kroton. Both of them were made immortal by technology, but Kroton won by choosing hope over despair. Kroton takes his place as the new controller of the Glory, restoring the proper timeline, banishing the Master to parts unknown and granting Sato his wish of an honourable death. The Doctor and Izzy continue their journeys without him (The Glorious Dead, DWM #287-#296). Other appearances In the Eighth Doctor novel The Scarlet Empress, Time Lady Iris Wildthyme mentions that at some point during her travels, she encountered and befriended Kroton. The Doctor, however, gives no response, which may imply that the events of the novel take place before his own meeting with Kroton. However, Throwback is \\"narrated\\" by the Fourth Doctor, who describes it as a recounting of an incident in the Time Lord archives.

According to Adam Osborne's book An Introduction to Microprocessors Vol 2: Some Real Products, it was \\"the most minicomputer-like\\" of the microprocessors available at the time. A combination of missing features and odd memory access limited its appeal, and the system saw little use in the market. Signetics became better known as a second-source supplier for the MOS 6502. Description The chip contained seven 8-bit general-purpose registers, although only four were visible at any time. It was limited to a 15-bit address space (thereby addressing a maximum of 32 KB of memory), since the upper bit of a 16-bit memory reference was reserved to indicate that the indirect memory addressing mode was to be used (a minicomputer-like feature). The address space was further limited by the use of another two bits of the address to indicate the indexing mode for all logical and arithmetic (i.e. non branch) instructions. This divided the address space into four 8 KB 'pages', only the current (i.e. the page the program was running in) could be addressed directly, the others only by indirect addressing. While there were nine different addressing modes, the lack of any 16-bit registers and the 13‚Äì15-bit address space prevented widespread use. Despite this, an operating system (\\"2650 DOS\\") was available, along with 8 KB and 12 KB BASIC interpreters (sold by Central Data Corporation USA), and many games of the Hunt the Wumpus style. Most programs were written in assembly language. Uses Signetics sold development boards e.g. the PC1001Signetics Technical Note SP50; 2650 evaluation printed circuit board level system PC1001Signetics Technical Note SS50; PC1001 monitor program \\"PIPBUG\\" and its successor, the PC1500 \\"Adaptable Board Computer\\", ranging in price from A$165 to A$400. The chip by itself sold for around A$20. Several hardware construction projects and programming articles were published in magazines such as Electronics Australia and Elektor and related kits were sold by electronics stores. These factors led to its use by a number of hobbyists in many countries such as Australia, U.S.A.,Build a 2650 Microcomputer system, Radio Electronics magazine: April, May, June 1977 United Kingdom, the NetherlandsHobby Computer Club (HCC) 2650 user group and Germany.Programmierbeispiele mit dem Mikroprozessor 2650, Johann Hatzenbichler, 1978 Two types of video game console used the Signetics 2650 or 2650A. The first group of consoles are based on the video display controller 2636 Programmable Video Interface; the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System and the closely related Interton Video Computer 4000 belong to this group. Those were released in Germany in 1976 and 1978 respectively. The second group of consoles were based on the Signetics 2637 as a video display controller; Emerson Arcadia 2001 which was released in 1982 and which used a Signetics 2650 running at 3.58 MHz as a CPU belong to this group together with many other ones software-compatible (Leonardo, Hanimex MPT-03 etc.). At least five coin-operated video games were released in the 1970s which used the 2650 CPU Atari Quiz Show, Meadows Games 3D Bowling, Meadows Games Gypsy Juggler, Cinematronics Embargo, and a version of Taito Space Invaders (1978). At least two coin-operated video games were released in the 1980's using the 2650. Hunchback, and Hunchback Olympic. The processor was also used in the Signetics Instructor 50, which was a small computer designed to teach the use and programming of the Signetics 2650 CPU. The 2650 was also used in some large items of equipment such as the Tektronix 8540, a microprocessor software development system which supported various in-circuit emulator, trace memory and logic analyser cards for real-time debugging of microprocessor systems, as practiced in the 1980s. The 2650 provided the base operating system functions, data transfer, and interface to a host computer or serial computer terminal. The processor was most suited as a microcontroller, due to its extensive I/O support: * Single bit i/o pins on the processor (sense/flag bits) * Signals to directly address two 8-bit I/O ports (control and data ports) using single byte instructions (port i/o). This circumvented the elaborate hardware other systems needed for memory-mapped I/O * Signals to address another 256 I/O ports using an 8-bit address and two byte instructions, again, limiting the amount of hardware (address decoding) required. Philips emphasized this use as a micro-controller with a demonstration program showing the 2650 controlling an intelligent elevator system. Also, at trade fairs they showed the 2650 controlling a miniature 'sort and stack' robot Industrial Microcomputer System ‚Äì IMS Philips IMS 2650 Eurocard computer system For a short time starting 1979, Philips sold a modular 2650 computer called the 'IMS' Industrial Microcomputer System,Industrial Microcomputer System; System Specification, Philips Electronic Components and materials, 1980 based on the Eurocard format in a 19\\" rack. It included CPU, PROM, RAM, input, output and teletype modules. This system was meant as a more intelligent programmable logic controller. For development, they later added DEBUG, DISPLAY, INTERRUPT and MODEST ((E)PROM programmer) modules. Architecture The 2650 was supplied in a 40 pin plastic or ceramic DIL enclosure. An external single phase clock signal and a single 5V supply were needed. The 2650 had many unusual features when compared to other microprocessors of the time: *It was a fully static NMOS 8-bit microprocessor. The static nature was unusual for the time, and meant that the processor could be halted simply by stopping the clock signal. Programmers made grateful use of this feature to \\"single step' through a program using a push-button switch to generate the clock pulses. *Unique was the 8-level 15-bit wide stack for the subroutine and interrupt return addresses which was integrated into the processor. The stack pointer used 3 bits of the upper status register. This meant subroutines and interrupts could only be nested 8 levels deep. *The processor had only 13 real address lines, a further 2 address lines were connected to a 2-bit 'page register', resulting in a 32 KB address space. The page register was set when an absolute (direct) branch instruction, which used a full 15-bit address, was executed. All logical and arithmetic instructions used a 13-bit address augmented by the contents of the page register, thereby limiting their scope to an 8 KB page. These 2 upper address lines were also used (multiplexed) to select the appropriate I/O port during I/O operations (Control port, Data port or Extended port). *Although the 2650 had only one interrupt input, this was a 'vectored' interrupt ‚Äì the interrupting device needed to put a zero-relative displacement on the data bus, that would be used as the operand of a ZBSR (zero branch to subroutine relative) instruction to branch to the specified interrupt routine. Therefore, using indirect addressing, a maximum of 30 interrupt vectors could be stored in the first 64 bytes of memory. (The first three bytes were needed to hold an unconditional branch to the 'reset' routine). This vectored interrupt is also reminiscent of the PDP-11 minicomputer. Instruction set Although the 2650 is basically an 8-bit microprocessor, 64 opcodes are actually 9-bit, and another 32 opcodes are 11-bit (using bits in the address field). Of the remaining 128 8-bit opcodes, 124 (126 in the 2650B) are implemented, giving a total of 444 (446) instructions. Many more instructions are available as the behavior of the standard instructions can be modified by setting or clearing status bits: WC (with or without carry) and COM (logical or arithmetic compare). This doubled the number of rotate, add, subtract and compare instructions. The instruction set is strongly orthogonal: all logic and arithmetic instructions can use all nine addressing modes: * register * immediate * PC relative and PC relative indirect * absolute and absolute indirect * absolute indexed, absolute indexed with auto-increment, and absolute indexed with auto-decrement, both direct and indirect The most significant bit of all relative and absolute addresses is used to indicate indirection. The only exceptions are where the opcodes of meaningless operations are used for other purposes: * the opcode for AND register zero with register zero is used for the HALT instruction. * the opcode for STORE register zero into register zero is used for the NOP instruction. Although the instruction LOAD register zero with register zero would appear meaningless, and was officially unsupported, it did set the condition code and was often used to determine the status of this register. =Indexing= With all arithmetic and logical instructions using absolute (direct) addressing, bits 14 and 13 of the address field are used to indicate the indexing mode as follows: * 00 no indexing * 01 indexing with auto increment * 10 indexing with auto decrement * 11 indexing only When indexing is specified, the register defined in the instruction becomes the index register, and the source/destination is implicitly Register zero. For indirect indexing, Post indexing is used, i.e. the indirect address is first fetched from memory and then the index is added to it. =Branching= Probably the most mini-computer like aspect of the 2650 is the enormous number (62) of branch (jump) instructions; all these instructions could also use indirection: * BIRR and BIRA: Increment register and branch if non-zero (R0, R1, R2 or R3) with relative or absolute addressing * BDRR and BDRA: Decrement register and branch if non-zero (R0, R1, R2 or R3) with relative or absolute addressing * BRNR and BRNA: branch if register non-zero (R0, R1, R2 or R3) with relative or absolute addressing * BCTR and BCTA: branch on condition True (zero, greater- than, less-than or unconditional) with relative or absolute addressing * BCFR and BCFA: branch on condition False (zero, greater-than or less-than) with relative or absolute addressing. * ZBRR: branch relative to address zero * BXA: branch indexed Like the Intel 8080, the 2650 had instructions to conditionally branch to, and return from, a subroutine: * BSTR and BSTA: branch to subroutine on condition True (zero, greater-than, less-than or unconditional) with relative or absolute addressing * BSFR and BSFA: branch to subroutine on condition False (zero, greater-than or less-than) with relative or absolute addressing * BSNR and BSNA: branch to subroutine if register non- zero (R0, R1, R2 or R3) with relative or absolute addressing * RETC: return from subroutine on condition True (zero, greater-than, less-than or unconditional) * RETE: return from interrupt on condition True (zero, greater- than, less-than or unconditional) * ZBSR: branch to subroutine relative to address zero * BSXA: branch to subroutine indexed Only the branch instructions using absolute addressing used all 15 bits of the address field as address. Using such a branch instruction was, therefore, the only way to set the two bits in the page register (controlling bits 14 and 13 of the address bus) and changing the current 8 KB page. Versions * 2650 original version with 1.25 MHz maximum clock frequency * 2650A improved version (minor fabrication changes to improve stability) 1.25 MHz maximum clock frequency * 2650A-1 as 2650A with 2 MHz maximum clock frequency * 2650B * 2650B-1 as 2650B with 2 MHz maximum clock frequency The 2650B had the following changes and improvements over the 2650A:Philips 2650 Series microprocessor short-form manual 02-1979; 9398 209 50011 * Two new signals \\"Bus Enable\\" on pin 15 and \\"Cycle Last\\" on pin 25. * Program Status Word Upper bits 3 and 4 are setable and testable user flags (unused on the 2650A). * Two new instructions to save and restore the lower status register in order to simplify interrupt processing. * Single byte register R0 instructions execute faster (one cycle rather than two). Second sources Synertek 2650-P-02 die Philips MAB2650A In 1975, Signetics was sold to Philips and the 2650 was later incorporated into the Philips Semiconductors line. They made a version of the 2650 called the MAB2650A. Valvo, a subsidiary of Philips, sold the 2650 in Germany. Valvo also sold the VA200 single board (Eurocard) 2650 computer with 4 KB PROM/EPROM, 1 KB RAM and four I/O ports.VALVO VA 200 Mikrocomputer im Europa-Format: VALVO Applikationslaboratorium M√§rz 1978 Other producers of licensed copies of the chip were Harris and Intersil. Peripheral chips The 2650 came with a full complement of peripheral chips: * 2621 Video Encoder (PAL) * 2622 Video Encoder (NTSC) * 2636 Programmable Video Interface * 2637 Universal Video Interface * 2651 Programmable Communication Interface * 2652 Multi-Protocol Communications Circuit (incl.

Philips Technical Note 083 describes how to interface the 2651 PCI to various other microprocessors, such as the 8080, 8085, Z80, 8048 and 6800 Descendants of the 2651/2661 serial communications chips are still sold as the Philips SC26 series. 2656 System Memory Interface2650PC-4000 memory interface emulator using PROM's and FPLA's The 2656 was specifically designed to augment, and interface with, the 2650 and make a 2-chip computer possible. It contained everything the 2650 lacked to make a complete computer: * 2 KB 8-bit mask-programmed ROM program memory * 128 bytes 8-bit RAM memory * Clock generator with crystal or RC network * Power-on reset * Eight general purpose I/O pins The I/O pins could be used as an 8-bit I/O port or programmed to generate enable signals for extra RAM, ROM or I/O ports. This was achieved by mask-programming a Programmable Logic Array in the 2656. To develop and test the design before committing it to production, Philips sold the PC4000, a 2656 emulator board using PROM'S and FPLA's to emulate the ROM and PLA in the 2656.

Originally portrayed by actress Colleen Dion-Scotti, the role has been portrayed by Lesli Kay since November 2005. Felicia is known as the black sheep of the Forrester family. The youngest daughter of Stephanie (Susan Flannery) and Eric Forrester (John McCook), Felicia has one brother, Thorne (Winsor Harmon), and one sister, Kristen Forrester (Terri Ann Linn, Tracy Melchior). She had another sister, Angela who is deceased. She also has three half-siblings: Ridge (Thorsten Kaye), Rick (Jacob Young), and Bridget (Ashley Jones). She is affectionately known as Fifi, a name bestowed on her by her mother's friend, Sally Spectra (Darlene Conley). Kay's performance in the role earned her a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2007. In March and April 2008, the character made her first crossover to the series' sister series, The Young and the Restless.  Casting and conception  The role of Felicia Forrester was originally cast with actress Colleen Dion-Scotti in 1989. She first appeared on the series on January 11, 1990. Dion-Scotti remained with the series until 1992, when she departed the series. The actress briefly returned in 1997, for a recurring spot with the series. In May 2004, it was announced that Dion- Scotti would return to the series in an attempt to \\"reinvent\\" the Forresters. In September of the same year, it was announced that Dion-Scotti had been taken off of her contract with the series, due to the actress' commute between the east coast and the west coast, where the series films, while the actress remained in talks with the series about the future with the series. In October, the actress announced that she would be exiting the series once again. She made her on-screen exit on December 4, 2004. In October 2005, it was announced that former daytime veteran actress Lesli Kay had been hired into the role of Felicia. Kay was best known for her roles as Molly Conlan on As the World Turns, and also known as Lois Cerullo on General Hospital. Kay made her first on-screen appearance as Felicia on November 30, 2005 opposite Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo). In 2008, it was announced that Kay would crossover to The Young and the Restless, in what was considered to be a semi-permanent basis. Kay's crossover to Y&R; was short-lived and she returned to her home series. In 2009, it was announced that Kay would make history in becoming the first actress to hold two roles on two separate coasts, when she was announced to be returning to the role of Molly on As the World Turns, while maintaining her role as Felicia on a recurring status. Following the cancellation of As the World Turns, Kay has remained with B&B; on a recurring stature, appearing when the series calls for her appearance. In August 2014, Kay reprised her role as Felicia for one episode of The Bold and the Beautiful. A TV Soap reporter said that Kay had no more upcoming appearances scheduled. On September 2, 2016, it was announced that Kay would again reprise her portrayal of Felicia on September 22, 23 and 26.  Storylines  =1990s= Soon after Felicia's arrival in Los Angeles in 1990, she forged ill-fated relationships with Jake MacClaine (Todd McKee) and Zach Hamilton (Michael Watson). She left town in 1992, but returned in 1994 but left town again. Felicia returned in 1997 for her parents' wedding (which was called off when Eric's affair with Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman) was exposed). After Ridge was arrested for shooting Grant Chambers (Charles Grant), Felicia tried to help exonerate him and then attempted to help him reunite with his wife, Dr. Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo). She was unsuccessful on both counts, and soon left town again. =2000s= After seven years overseas, Felicia returned in July 2004. She quickly began an affair with Nick Marone (Jack Wagner), who soon discovered that Felicia had colon cancer. She had medical tests run and was given the all clear. Felicia then realized that she and Nick weren't going to work out and left for Paris in January 2005. Felicia returned one year later with a baby son in tow. She believed the baby was Nick's, and hence named him Dominick. However, it was soon revealed that Dominick was, in fact, the product of a one-night stand with Dante Damiano (Antonio Sab√†to, Jr.) in Paris, leaving Nick devastated. Felicia's cancer returned and she eventually \\"died\\" in her mother's arms. However, a faint heartbeat was detected in the ambulance and her mother Stephanie had Felicia secretly transferred to a private clinic, where she eventually had a liver transplant. Felicia fought to survive for her child's sake. Meanwhile, Dante and Bridget, believing that Felicia had indeed died, had begun raising Dominick (who they nicknamed \\"Dino\\") as a family. Stephanie eventually revealed to the rest of the family that Felicia was alive. Though ecstatic to have her back, Bridget and Dante prepared to fight Felicia for custody of Dino. Over the next number of weeks, the child bonded together Dante and Felicia instead, and Bridget gave up on Dante. Dante eventually proposed to Felicia, although he was still in love with Bridget. On their wedding day, Felicia saw Bridget staring at Dante and a heated confrontation ensued. Bridget then admitted her love for Dante and they temporarily reunited. When Dante and Bridget eventually split again because of her reluctance to have kids right away, Felicia and Dante were back on. Several weeks later, Bridget found out she was pregnant. At first, she thought that the baby was the result of a one-night stand with her ex-husband Nick Marone, but further tests concluded that the pregnancy was further along than previously thought, making the unborn baby Dante's child. Dante and Bridget suffered a loss when she revealed she miscarried the child a few weeks later. This didn't stop Dante and Felicia from rallying to her side. Despite Bridget stepping aside for Felicia to reunite with Dante, an act which solidified the sisters once more; she now has feelings of animosity towards her son's father, who now lives in Italy, calling him a loser. She is somewhat allied with Katie Logan (Heather Tom), hoping to end the long-time war that had ensued between their families. However, relations between her and Eric have suffered because of his relationship with Katie's sister, Donna, and the imminent end of her parents' marriage. Eric explained to Felicia why he was divorcing her mother, but she still doesn't believe that her mother could do what Eric had said she had. Recently, she's been traveling to Genoa City to assist Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) in the launch of Restless Style magazine. While working on the joint campaign, Felicia started flirting with Nick, and recently even joined forces with Nick's half-brother Adam Wilson (Chris Engen) to break up Nick and his wife Phyllis (Michelle Stafford), which proved to be very unsuccessful. Felicia later went back to Los Angeles. Of late, Felicia has allied herself with her brothers, Thorne and Ridge, to eliminate Donna out of Forrester Creations, because of the supposed bad publicity that the company had received since Eric married Donna (of whom none of them approve of). Their efforts had been not too well received by Eric, who is angry that his children aren't willing to give Donna a chance. Even their mother Stephanie‚Äîwhom at one time had no liking for Donna or her sister Brooke‚Äîhas pleaded with them to drop their animosity toward her and give her a chance, if anything, for their father's sake. During a business meeting, it was revealed that Marcus Walton (Texas Battle) was indeed Donna's son, and they attempted to use said information to try to drive Donna out of the company, but they were shocked when Eric not only accepted Marcus into the family, but did so because the siblings were only trying to dredge up some scandal, real or fictitious, to get rid of Donna. Donna has since fired her. After Eric suffered a heart attack, and was revealed to be poisoned, Felicia continued to ally with her brothers in eliminating Donna's presence from their lives. When Eric awoke from his coma, Felicia helped to reunite him with Stephanie; though this reunion proved short-lived as he eventually returned to Donna much to Felicia and her brothers chagrin. Felicia was ultimately reinstated at Forrester Creations. Felicia was particularly frustrated with her father's choice to name Rick president of the company even though she loves her brother. She saw the Logan family as having far too much influence over her family's business, and came to feel her father didn't even notice her anymore. When it came time for the company to debut its new line, Felicia openly expressed that she partially wished it would fail so that Eric would see the error in allowing the Logan family to have so much power over Forrester Creations. Before either Forrester Creations or Jackie M had revealed their new lines, Felicia contacted Nick Marone expressing a wish to leave her father's company in favor of Jackie M and even offered to rekindle their romance, despite him being engaged to Katie Logan. It did not happen because Nick was committed to Katie at the time. She returned in 2010 and learned her mother had cancer, and stayed to support the family until Christmas. She again returns in July of the following year for the wedding of Ridge and Taylor‚Äîwhich does not end up happening. Felicia returns in November 2012 for her mother's farewell party, she stays for the funeral and leaves again after spending Christmas with her family. In August 2014, Wyatt Spencer (Darin Brooks), Hope Logan (Kim Matula) and Rick Forrester (Jacob Young) visit Felicia at Forrester Creations Paris, ahead of shooting a new promotion in the city. In September 2016, Felicia returns to help her family to stop Eric and Quinn Fuller (Rena Sofer)'s wedding.

He is known for his appearances on the BBC TV programme That's Life! from 1982 to 1992 and for four albums of humorous, smutty songs. Currently resident in Suffolk, he is active in several pub bands, including the Trembling Wheelbarrows.  Education  Cox was educated at the King Edward VI Grammar School in Retford, Nottinghamshire, becoming at one point a prefect. He wrote and performed songs such as \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\" while at the school, and performed during the mid-1960s as the lead singer of Nurk Wildebeest and the Mutations. Their performances were mostly at local village hall dances, and their risqu√© lyrics were quite bold for the time.  That's Life!  After some years as a teacher, Cox became a sound engineer with the BBC in 1969. Later he became a warm-up man for That's Life!; he recalled that one day \\"Someone didn't turn up for one of the auditions or something, and I was sort of pushed in\\". It has been reported that the nickname \\"Doc\\" was acquired as a result of Cox habitually using a black doctor's bag to carry his packed lunches when working on location. In October 2008, Cox was part of a That‚Äôs Life! reunion broadcast on BBC London 94.9. Cox said of the impending reunion: \\"It'll be lovely to chat to Esther again. Somebody once asked me who my greatest influences were, and I had to reply 'Buddy Holly, George Formby, my dad, Martin Luther King and Esther Rantzen'.\\"  Ivor Biggun Under the Biggun name, Cox fronts a humorous band that is sometimes billed simply as \\"Ivor Biggun\\", or variously \\"Ivor Biggun and the Red-nosed Burglars\\" or \\"Ivor Biggun and the Left-handed Wankers\\", also ‚ÄúIvor‚Äôs Jivers‚Äù (less rude), or Ivor Biggun‚Äôs Vulgar Band. He specialises in double entendre-laden smutty songs. Ivor Biggun has released four albums of bawdy songs (and recorded with Judge Dread and David \\"Screaming Lord\\" Sutch), the most recent being 2005's Handling Swollen Goods. The name Ivor Biggun is a double entendre, realised when Ivor is pronounced non-rhotically (as in many British accents) as ; this means the full name is a homophone for \\"I've a big 'un\\". Johnny Rotten selected \\"The Winker's Song (Misprint)\\" as his single of the week in 1978 when he was a guest reviewer for New Musical Express. The single sold well, reaching number 22 in the UK Singles Chart thanks to Rotten's support. However, it was banned by nearly all radio stations due to its explicit lyrics. The single \\"Bras on 45 (Family Version)\\", credited to \\"Ivor Biggun and the D Cups\\", reached number 50 in the UK Singles Chart in 1981 and remained in the charts for three weeks. Both a frequent contributor and occasional guest on The Dr. Demento Show, he composed a song as an homage which includes references to several of Dr. Demento's featured artists and songs from the show within its lyrics. Ivor Biggun is sometimes compared to or even confused with George Formby. Biggun's 1987 song \\"Nobody Does It Like The Ukulele Man\\" pays homage to Formby.

The film was completed in 1959 under the working title The Black Door but was not theatrically released until May 3, 1962, when it was released under its new title as a double feature with Invasion of the Star Creatures. The film focuses upon a mad doctor who develops a means to keep human body parts alive. He keeps his fianc√©e's severed head alive for days, and also keeps a lumbering, malformed brute (one of his earlier failed experiments) imprisoned in a closet. The specific plot device of a mad doctor who discovers a way to keep a human head alive had been used in fiction earlier (such as Professor Dowell's Head from 1925), as well as other variants on this theme.  Plot  The Brain That Wouldn't Die Dr. Bill Cortner (Jason Evers) saves a patient who had been pronounced dead, but the senior surgeon, Cortner's father (Bruce Brighton), condemns his son's unorthodox methods and transplant theories. While driving to his family's country house, Cortner and his beautiful fianc√©e Jan Compton (Virginia Leith) become involved in a car accident that decapitates her. Cortner recovers her severed head and rushes to his country house basement laboratory. He and his crippled assistant Kurt (Anthony La Penna) revive the head in a liquid-filled tray. But Jan's new existence is agony, and she begs Cortner to let her die. He ignores her pleas, and she grows to resent him. Cortner decides to commit murder to obtain a body for Jan. He hunts for a suitable specimen at a burlesque nightclub, on the streets, and at a beauty contest. Jan begins communicating telepathically with a hideous mutant, an experiment gone wrong, locked in a laboratory cell. When Kurt leaves a hatch in the cell door unlocked, the monster grabs and tears off Kurt's arm. Kurt dies from his injuries. Cortner lures an old girlfriend, figure model Doris Powell (Adele Lamont), to his house, promising to study her scarred face for plastic surgery. He drugs her and carries her to the laboratory. Jan protests Cortner's plan to transplant her head onto Doris's body. He tapes Jan's mouth shut. When Cortner goes to quiet the monster, it grabs Cortner through the hatch and breaks the door from its hinges. Their struggles set the laboratory ablaze. The monster (Eddie Carmel), a seven-foot giant with a horribly deformed head, bites a chunk from Cortner's neck. Cortner dies, and the monster carries the unconscious Doris to safety. As the lab goes up in flames, Jan says, \\"I told you to let me die.\\" The screen goes black, followed by a maniacal cackle.

Some prints of the film use both the opening title The Brain That Wouldn't Die and the closing title The Head That Wouldn't Die. The monster in the closet was played, in his first cinematic role, by Eddie Carmel, a well-known Mandatory Palestine-born circus performer, who worked under the name \\"The Jewish Giant\\". He was the subject of a photograph by Diane Arbus, titled \\"The Jewish Giant at Home with His Parents in the Bronx, N.Y., 1970\\". The score, titled \\"The Web\\", was composed by Abe Baker and Tony Restaino and was noted for creating a sinister mood.

Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on , with a weighted average rating of 4.63/10. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"poorly produced\\". Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews gave the film a C+ grade. In his review, Schwartz criticized the film's acting, dialogue, and \\"awkward\\" direction, summarizing, \\"Though others might find it risible and in bad taste, it's hard to completely dislike a film that is so perversely entertaining and has no redeeming social values but is funny in all the wrong ways\\". On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar gave the film a mostly negative review, noting that, although it managed to work up a certain amount of tension and featured some good gore effects, it was ruined by its lack of likable and intelligent characters and its \\"inability to decide just how it wants to be taken\\". Brian J. Dillard from AllMovie said of the film, \\"Hokey, overwrought, and poorly paced, this venerable creature feature still commands a sizable following on the basis of its campy, low-grade special effects, its T&A; exploitation, and its many pseudo-philosophical soliloquies\\". TV Guide awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"one of the most genuinely bizarre 'brain' movies\\". Legacy =Adaptations= The movie was first adapted as a stage musical in October 2009 with The Brain That Wouldn't Die: A New Musical, produced at the Overtime Theater in San Antonio, Texas. The world premiere musical comedy was a collaboration between composer Phillip Luna and writer/lyricist Jon Gillespie. The movie also inspired the musical stage production The Brain That Wouldn't Die! In 3D!!! by Tom Sivak and Elizabeth Gelman, that premiered at the New York Musical Theatre Festival in October 2011. In 2015, Pug Bujeaud's musical theatrical production The HEAD! That Wouldn't Die was mounted in Olympia, Washington by Theater Artists Olympia. Lyrics and music were written by the ensemble cast and the TAO collective. Soon thereafter, Hollywood screenwriter Bruce Bernhard adapted the script as a staged musical comedy, creating a completely new score for it with songwriter Chris Cassone. The official world premiere for The Brain That Wouldn‚Äôt Die!‚Ä¶the Musical was at the Footlight Players Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina on October 13, 2016.http://thebrainthatwouldntdie.net/about- us/http://www.postandcourier.com/features/arts_and_travel/brain-that-wouldn-t- die-makes-local- premiere/article_fcf31f99-0793-53c2-9c86-1024f3892d71.htmlhttp://charlestonarts.org/event/the- brain-that-wouldnt-die-the-musical-4/ A satirical feature film adaptation of the same title was filmed on location in Portland, Oregon.

Males have significantly larger horns with rings around them. Females will also have horns, but they will be thinner and shorter. Along with the horns, mountain gazelles are sexually dimorphic, meaning that males are larger than females. A wild male can range from 17-29.5 kg, while females are 16‚Äì25 kg in weight. Mountain gazelles can reach running speeds up to . Population and range Mountain gazelles are most abundant in Israel, the West Bank and the Golan Heights, but are also found in parts of Jordan and Turkey. While there are not accurate estimates of the number of individuals in the wild, Israel estimated there to be only 3,100 endangered gazelles in their country. Less than 3,000 mountain gazelles are left within their natural range. = Habitat = Gazelles have adapted to live in dry, desert-like conditions. They spend most of their time at the top of mountains and hills. Living in an annual average temperature of 21-23 ¬∞C, gazelles prefer to bed on the tops of the hills/mountains to avoid the heat during the day. Around dawn and dusk, these mammals will be found traversing the hills to eat in light forests, fields, or desert plateaus. It is less well adapted to hot, dry conditions than the Dorcas gazelle, which appears to have replaced the mountain gazelle through some of its range during the late Holocene in a period of climatic warming.  Ecology  The mountain gazelle is a diurnal species, they are awake during the day and sleep at night. They are also very territorial and with their herds, but typically stay in herds of three to eight individuals. There are three main groups in the mountain gazelle community: maternity herds, bachelor male herds, or territorial solitary males. = Survival and reproduction = In the wild, mountain gazelles rarely survive past the age of eight but can live up to 15 years in captivity when taken care of. By 12 months, a female gazelle can begin breeding. For males, 18 months is when they will start breeding. Being polygamous, not spending their lives with one other individual, mountain gazelles' typical breeding season is during the early winter months. Females will give birth to one offspring per year mostly between the months of April and May. A few days prior to giving birth the mother will leave her herd and live in solitary. For up to two months, the mother and her offspring will stay by themselves while the mother watches out for predators. Common predators include foxes, jackals, and wolves that will try to attack the fawn. While young males will stay with their mother for only six months before departing to a herd of young males, young females will sometimes join their mother with a herd. = Food = Its range coincides closely with that of the acacia trees that grow in these areas. It is mainly a grazing species, though this varies with food availability. They can survive for long periods of time without a water source. Instead, they acquire freshwater from succulents and dew droplets from plants. History In 1985, a large population of mountain gazelles built up through game conservation in two Israeli reserves, in the southern Golan Heights and Ramat Yissachar, was decimated by foot and mouth disease. To prevent such occurrences, a plan was drawn up to stabilize the female population at 1,000 in the Golan and 700 in Ramat Yissachar.Mountain gazelle management in northern Israel in relation to wildlife disease control. (PDF) . oie.int.  Threats and conservation  Mountain gazelles were hunted throughout Israel because they were thought of as a pest until 1993. Their numbers are still low for multiple reasons. In some areas, they face predation from feral dogs and jackals. They also face poachers for their skin, meat, and horns. As with other animals, mountain gazelles are harmed by road accidents, habitat degradation, and habitat fragmentation. Mountain gazelles are now a legally protected species, but often there is not enough enforcement to protect the species. Although the range of the gazelle was once extensive, Israel is now the only country where the gazelle is now extant, but even in Israel the future is grim without more conservation efforts. In 1985, the gazelle population was approximately 10,000, and in 2016 the population has declined to 2,500. Subspecies The Hatay mountain gazelle lives on the northern Syrian border and a population has been discovered in the Hatay Province of Turkey. Historically, some others such as the Cuvier's gazelle (G. cuvieri) were included as a subspecies,ADW: Gazella gazella: INFORMATION. Animaldiversity.org. Retrieved on 2015-09-25. but recent authorities consistently treat them as separate species.

Civil Affairs in United Nations Peace Operations Civil affairs officers in UN peace operations are civilian staff members who are often at the forefront of a mission's interaction with local government officials, civil society, and other civilian partners in the international community. \\"Civil Affairs components work at the social, administrative and sub-national political levels to facilitate the countrywide implementation of peacekeeping mandates and to support the population and government in strengthening conditions and structures conducive to sustainable peace.\\",DPKO/DFS Policy Directive on Civil Affairs (April 2008)http://www.peacekeepingbestpractices.unlb.org/pbps/Library/DPKO- DFS%20Policy%20Directive%20on%20Civil%20Affairs.pdf Civil affairs components are deployed in most peacekeeping missions led by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations and are also a feature of many special political missions led by the Department of Political Affairs. Civil Affairs Officers are usually deployed at the local level, where they serve as the link between the UN mission and local authorities and communities. Civil affairs components work countrywide to strengthen the social and civic conditions necessary to consolidate peace processes and are a core function of multi-dimensional peacekeeping operations. As of mid-2013, there were approximately 700 Civil Affairs Officers in 13 UN Peacekeeping Operations worldwide. Civil Affairs components perform one or more of three core roles, depending on the UN Security Council mandate given to a particular peacekeeping mission. In each role the work of Civil Affairs intersects with, supports and draws upon the work of a variety of other actors. Depending on the mandate, the three core roles are 1) Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation at the local level; 2) Confidence-building, conflict management and support to reconciliation; and 3) Support to the restoration and extension of state authority. =The roots of Civil Affairs in UN Peace Operations= There were precursors for what was later termed civil affairs in Central America and in Cambodia during the 1991 to 1993 period. For example, the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)‚Äôs civil administration component was responsible for the supervision of administrative structures in Cambodia, ranging from public security to finance and information.William J. Durch, UN Peacekeeping, American Policy and the Uncivil Wars of the 1990s (Henry L. Stimson Center, 1996) and Steven R. Ratner, The New UN Peacekeeping: Building Peace in Lands of Conflict after the Cold War (St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 1995), p. 149. However, the first component known officially as ‚Äùcivil affairs‚Äù was formed in 1992, with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)‚Äôs mandate in the former Yugoslavia. The development and growth of civil affairs work has been a critical element of the development and growth of multidimensional peace operations. With the end of the cold war and the increase in peace operations required to respond to intra-state conflict, the UN was increasingly asked to tackle complex civilian tasks. These went beyond the quite limited role of liaising with political actors and the ‚Äúgood offices‚Äù work that had characterized civilian peacekeepers until that point. Cedric Thornberry, the first Director of Civil Affairs in a UN mission (UNPROFOR in 1992), described this new broader role as follows: To fully understand the UN‚Äôs meaning of ‚Äúcivil affairs‚Äù it is first important to appreciate that most of the missions created between 1989 and 1992, especially, were qualitatively different from those which had preceded. It is not just that most were a lot bigger ‚Ä¶ they were to fulfil many roles additional to the archetypal ones of the 1947-1988 period. The task of the UN became, not merely to observe, but actively, itself, to bring about peace [‚Ä¶] In a rapid sequence of major operations ‚Äì principally in Namibia, Central America and Cambodia ‚Äì the UN was required not only to make peace, but to conduct nationwide processes of reconstruction and national reconciliation. Their task was, in broad terms, to harmonize or unify deeply divided societies, long racked by war, and to establish democracy where previously there had been tyranny.Cedric Thornberry, ‚ÄùCivil affairs in the development ofUNpeacekeeping‚Äù, International Peacekeeping, vol. 1, No. 4 (1994), pp. 471‚Äì 484. These key themes of helping to unify divided societies and helping states to exert legitimate authority are central to the continuing role of civil affairs today. During the 1990s small civil affairs components were included in a number of missions, including those in Cyprus, Tajikistan and Georgia. At the end of that decade, major civil affairs components were deployed to Kosovo and East Timor, to implement the executive mandates that were given to peacekeeping operations at that time. In these cases civil affairs components found themselves mandated to establish effective administrations and to support capacity-building for self-government. The start of the 2000s saw a surge in the deployment of large civil affairs components to peacekeeping missions. Each one had its own unique focus and contribution to make in implementing peace mandates at the local level, but each was there to strengthen links to ordinary citizens, as well as to support the development of social conditions conducive to peace and provide an overall facilitation role locally. =Civil Affairs into the Next Decade= In 2008, for the first time, the UN Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support developed and disseminated a policy directive that defines and conceptualizes the diverse work of civil affairs. This has provided the foundation for the development of this Handbook, as well as training and recruitment profiles to ensure that civil affairs components are strong, well- trained and well planned, ready to address the challenges ahead. This institutional framework will need to continue to evolve and develop in response to analysis of the ongoing shifts in the global security environment. The World Bank's World Development Report 2011, for example, found that many countries are caught in a mutually reinforcing cycle of violence and poverty. It also found that more and more people are suffering from violence that is linked to lack of governance and rule of law, rather than to outright war. These changes in the global security environment have resulted in mandates increasingly requiring higher levels of civilian engagement on a wide variety of thematic and cross-cutting issues, ranging from governance, rule of law and institution-building through to early peacebuilding and protection of civilians from threats of violence. For peacekeeping, of particular note among these emerging issues is the protection of civilians, which has increasingly become a major part of the international discourse around intervention. This was demonstrated in the international dialogue on both Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and C√¥te d'Ivoire in early 2011 and earlier in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Darfur. Protection of civilians has also increasingly become a specific mandated task, after inclusion in eight UN peacekeeping mandates by the Security Council. It can be expected that civil affairs will be at the forefront of an integrated and coordinated approach to mandate delivery on this issue, in terms of civilian and government engagement on the ground. Meanwhile, as many peacekeeping operations mandated as part of a surge during the 2000s are starting to draw down their military presence, the UN continues to evolve, transitioning towards an increased focus on the civilian dimension of ‚Äùpeacebuilding‚Äù and its role in avoidance of a return to conflict. Here, civil affairs has a key role to play ‚Äì within both peacekeeping and political missions ‚Äì by ensuring that efforts to mitigate conflict drivers and to engage and support local government and communities have meaning on the ground outside the capitals in which the UN is deployed. A continued focus on local presence in these contexts is key if the UN is to ensure that its work genuinely responds to the priorities and concerns of ordinary citizens within postconflict countries, thereby helping to ensure their consent and to create durable conditions for peace. These evolving roles, and the range of partners working in related fields and capacities, all create the need ‚Äì and potential ‚Äì for increased partnership and cooperation, to ensure that mandate aims progress effectively. Similarly, as these complex and multidimensional trends for the UN response to conflict emerge, the identification and provision of appropriate and available resources to respond to them effectively must also evolve. As indicated in the report of the Senior Advisory Group on Civilian capacity in the aftermath of conflict,(A/65/747‚ÄîS/2011/85); http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/reports.shtml these challenges will require a nimble, harmonized and, where necessary, specialized civilian response, as well as a focus on partnership across organizations such as the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and regional organizations such as the African Union (AU). One of the major issues identified in the review of civilian capacities is the need to be able to better identify and support national capacities. As the review states: ‚ÄúThe United Nations has seen success in humanitarian operations and peacekeeping, built on a strong partnership with Member States. But the international community has had less success in supporting and enabling the national capacities that are essential for an enduring peace.‚Äù19 Civil affairs components have a key role to play in identifying and supporting national capacities, within civil society and local government, including through helping to ensure that voices from the local level are heard in nationally led peacebuilding processes. Overall, in the evolving environment of international peace and security, a key asset of civil affairs components is their agility and their capacity to respond flexibly to the wide range of demands and expectations within Security Council mandates. One aspect of this flexibility is their ability to direct their focus depending on the availability and presence of other international partners at the local level, particularly those with expertise in highly specialized areas. Civil affairs can play an important role in mobilizing these partners in places and at times where they are most needed. This is a cost-efficient model, given the prohibitive and unnecessary expense of having a full complement of specialized expertise available in each locality around the country at all times. It also helps to ensure that local-level support is need-driven, rather than simply provided because a particular service or resource happens to be available. Civil affairs can be expected to remain at the forefront of the UN response to conflict, and to building the processes, structures, relationships and trust required to assist countries and communities to break the cycle of violence. =Core Role 1: Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation at the local level= Cross-mission representation, monitoring and facilitation are performed in most missions and usually throughout the life cycle of the mission. In many situations civil affairs is the most important interface between the UN mission and the community, not just in terms of the local/regional authorities but also civil society in its broadest sense. Through its multiple interactions with the local population, civil affairs provides the mission with the pulse of the nation beyond the high-level contacts with government and political party leadership. This helps to nuance the mission's understanding of the sociopolitical climate, allowing analysis to move beyond the carefully articulated positions of national spokespeople and representatives, and to ensure that regional and local considerations are integrated into national negotiations or priority-setting processes. In return, local communities and groups have an opportunity through civil affairs to access the mission, which they may perceive as distant and militarized. Civil affairs can be a bridge, which means that groups who previously would not have dared to approach the heavily guarded mission gates and ask for a discussion with the mission field leadership, civilian or military, can now approach the UN as guests rather than supplicants. The mission is inevitably enriched by this kind of dialogue and Civil Affairs Officers are often the best facilitators of it. =Core Role 2: Conflict management, confidence- building and support to the development of political space= Conflict management, confidence-building and supporting the development of political space are integral to UN peacekeeping and central to civil affairs work. Through this role, civil affairs actively supports the development of social and civic conditions conducive to sustainable peace, and promotes popular engagement and confidence in the peace process. While often the lead component in this area of work, civil affairs usually undertakes these activities in partnership with other mission components, as well as UN agencies and local and international partners. Within the mission, police and military components and other civilian components, such as political affairs, public information and human rights, may all contribute in one way or another to objectives in this area. =Core Role 3: Support to the restoration and extension of state authority= Restoration of state authority is increasingly recognized as a key element of the stabilization of fragile states and a critical requirement for keeping and building peace. This is clearly reflected in many of the recent UN Security Council resolutions including, for example, Security Council resolution 1974 (2011), which calls for the Government of Afghanistan ‚Äúto improve governance‚Äù and ‚Äúto pursue continued legislative and public administration reform in order to ensure good governance‚Äù. In the case of Haiti, meanwhile, Security Council resolution 1892 (2009) ‚Äúcalls upon MINUSTAH, consistent with its mandate, to continue such support to strengthen self-sustaining state institutions, especially outside Port-au-Prince, including through the provision of specialized expertise to key ministries and institutions‚Äù. In exceptional circumstances, the Security Council has also authorized peacekeeping missions to temporarily assume the administrative and legislative functions of the state through provision of a transitional administration, as was the case in Kosovo and TimorLeste. However, it is important to emphasize the specificity of the circumstances under which these two missions were established and the fact that executive mandates are generally seen as a last resort in situations where a territory is virtually deprived of any functioning state institutions. U.S. Military Civil Affairs A civil affairs soldier with the 411th Civil Affairs Battalion assesses the reconstruction of sewage lines in Baghdad June 11, 2003. According to the U.S. Army, \\"The force that the Army employs to compete and win within the population is Civil Affairs.\\" With their knowledge of governance and diplomacy, Civil Affairs soldiers are the principal experts in assisting a commander on the conduct of civil-military operations, and the sole force trained and tasked to conduct Civil Affairs Operations. All Active Component Army Civil Affairs personnel are Special Operations Forces-qualified and as such undergo rigorous assessment and selection akin to Special Forces Assessment and Selection, followed by extensive training in foreign languages, advanced survivability skills, and negotiations techniques in order to operate autonomously as a small team, in any kind of environment, to achieve strategic end states. A Civil Affairs Team of 2 to 4 soldiers will often be the only U.S. military personnel in an entire country, working for the U.S. ambassador as well as their military chain of command. Reserve Component Civil Affairs personnel support the conventional military in post-conflict stabilization. The fundamental role of Civil Affairs forces is to build networks of formal and informal leaders to accomplish important missions in diplomatically or politically sensitive areas. SOF Civil Affairs operate as reconnaissance elements within the population, performing their core task of Civil Reconnaissance. They achieve effects by conducting Civil Engagements, applying knowledge of governance, economics, and politics to affect human behavior in the context of military operations or in support of strategic objectives. =History of US Military Civil Affairs= Throughout U.S. history the U.S. Army was involved in Civil Affairs and civic action. Civil Affairs has its organizational origins in military governments that were and are established when a country is occupied during war, but also encompasses the wide variety of mission sets focused on or leveraging the broader population of a given area in times of peace or war. =United States Army= Civil Affairs has a lineage that traces back to Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery. U.S. Army Civil Affairs forces are split between the Active and Reserve components. Active Component Civil Affairs Approximately 10% of Army Civil Affairs personnel are active component soldiers assigned to the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade, the 83rd Civil Affairs Battalion or a variety of Special Operations, Joint, diplomatic, or conventional Army staff, planning, and policy positions. Active Component Civil Affairs soldiers are assessed, selected, and trained to conduct Civil Affairs Operations in hostile or austere environments in any stage of conflict. Civil Affairs officer speaking with local inhabitants during Operation Enduring Freedom, in Afghanistan. The 95th Civil Affairs Brigade and its five subordinate battalions are all stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which is a rapidly deployable unit that only supports the Army Special Operations Command. Each of the five battalions is regionally aligned to one of the five U.S. combatant commands; SOUTHCOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, AFRICOM and INDOPACOM. The Civil Affairs soldiers in these units receive extensive language and regional instruction as part of their training pathway and are assigned to the battalion affiliated with the respective region they are trained for. Once these soldiers arrive to their assigned units they receive advanced training in a variety of fields, preparing them for the enhanced level of responsibility that they will have working on small, autonomous teams. The 83rd Civil Affairs Battalion is one of the few battalions in the Army with a global mission set. Falling under the command of the U.S.Army XVIII Airborne Corps and located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 83rd Civil Affairs Battalion provides support to special operations and conventional military missions in all five combatant commands, as well as diplomatic, interagency, and foreign partner organizations. As Active Component Civil Affairs soldiers, personnel assigned to the 83rd Civil Affairs Battalion undergo the same rigorous selection and advanced training as those in the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade, and individuals will often rotate between both units. =Reserve Component Civil Affairs= Approximately 70% of the Civil Affairs personnel come from the United States Army Reserve and usually support active duty Army units. Using reservists allows military commanders to utilize skills of soldiers with experience in professions needed to manage and restore civilian areas impacted by military operations. This includes lawyers, city managers, economists, veterinarians, teachers, policemen, and other occupations who have valuable skills in restoration of governance and essential services in a war torn area. As a result, they deploy with certifications and experiences that become difficult to duplicate by the active duty forces. Additionally, reserve civil affairs planners attend the stability, security, and development in complex operations course taught at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Reserve Civil Affairs units assigned to United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne) are task organized in four reserve Civil Affairs Commands (CACOMs) which integrate at the strategic and operational level with theater commands and joint/combined task forces. Civil Affairs brigades comprise these CACOMS and integrate at the corps. At the tactical level, maneuver divisions are augmented by the Civil Affairs battalions. The four CACOMs are the 350th CACOM, the 351st CACOM, the 352nd CACOM, and the 353rd CACOM. Two other Army Reserve Civil Affairs units are assigned to other theaters of operation. The 322nd Civil Affairs Brigade is based in Hawaii and falls under operational control of United States Army Pacific Command and the 9th Mission Support Command. The 361st Civil Affairs Brigade is based in Germany and falls under operational control of United States Army Europe and the 7th Civil Support Command. Within the United States Army, reserve civil affairs units are administered through United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne), or USACAPOC(A), a subordinate of U.S. Army Reserve Command. USACAPOC(A) contains Psychological Operations (PO) and Civil Affairs (CA) units, consisting of Army Reserve elements. USACAPOC(A) was founded in 1985. It is headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. On 1 October 2006, USACAPOC(A) realigned from the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) to the United States Army Reserve Command (USARC). Training and doctrine relating to USACAPOC(A) is provided by the United States Army John Fitzgerald Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS) at Fort Bragg, NC. =U.S. Army Civil Affairs training= * Reserve Civil Affairs **Initial Entry Training (IET) Upon completion of basic training, a Soldier slotted in a Civil Affairs Unit will attend the 10-week Civil Affairs Advanced Individual Training (AIT) course. The 3rd Battalion of the 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne) is responsible for the training. Both Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations trainees are assigned to Alpha Company. Upon completion of the 10-week course, (the original 13-week course was lengthened to 15 weeks in 2008, then shortened to 10 weeks in 2010) the student will be able to interpret U.S. and foreign maps; conduct civil, governmental, humanitarian, and defense assistance; apply organizational and leadership skills required in field operations; and conduct research on documents and other aspects of urban and regional studies. The instruction is conducted by lecture, discussion, and practical exercises such as map reading, land navigation, communications, and civil affairs planning. * Reserve enlisted soldiers who reclassify to Civil Affairs must attend the Civil Affairs Reclassification Course which is offered at several posts throughout the country. Currently, training for combat, combat support, and combat service support is organized through regional training commands. The six Civil Affairs schoolhouses report to the 3rd Brigade (CA/PO) 100th Division, located at Fort Totten, New York. These units are the 5th Battalion (CA), 95th Regiment, of Lubbock, Texas; 5th Battalion (CA), 98th Regiment of Fort Dix, New Jersey; the 12th Battalion (CA), 100th Regiment of Fort Knox, Kentucky; the 4th Battalion (CA), 104th Regiment, of Mountain View, California; 108th Regiment of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The American Council on Education recommends college credit be awarded in the lower-division baccalaureate or associate's degree category two semester hours in map-reading, three in public administration, and one in military science for this training. The soldier is awarded the Military Occupational Specialty designation of 38B10. All Active Component enlisted will attend airborne school and language school, while Reservists may attend these courses at a later date through their units. * Active Component Civil Affairs Civil Affairs candidate navigates an obstacle course at Civil Affairs Assessment and Selection. Active Component enlisted Soldiers and officers in the rank of specialist, sergeant, and staff sergeant or 1LT and CPT who have a valid security clearance must attend and pass a rigorous selection and assessment course at Camp MacKall, NC. Those soldiers selected for Civil Affairs must attend the 48-week Qualification Course. During this course, Soldiers received advanced training in reconnaissance, diplomacy, foreign languages, and survival, with the option of attending the Special Operations Medic Course, culminating in a large-scale training exercise that exposes students to realistic operational situations and environmental elements. Upon graduating into the operating force, Civil Affairs soldiers continue their advanced training between missions, advanced survival courses, higher-level planning courses, enhanced language training, non-standard weapons courses, off-road mobility and evasive driving courses, and many others from within the Special Operations community and across the interagency field of government. =United States Marine Corps= The Marine Corps currently has four permanent CA units: 1st Civil Affairs Group (1st CAG), 2nd CAG, 3d CAG and 4th CAG, all in the Force Headquarters Group of the Marine Forces Reserve. The 5th Civil Affairs Group and 6th CAG were created provisionally in 2005-06 for Operation Iraqi Freedom, but each were stood down after one deployment to Iraq.Marines magazine. \\"Unit Profile: 6th Civil Affairs Group, 2nd Marine Division\\", 34, no. 4, October‚ÄìDecember 2005. Marines magazine website, accessed September 3, 2007. Artillery units augmented by Marines from the CAGs also deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006-07 to serve in a civil affairs capacity.McCullough, Amy. \\"Civil affairs MOSs being developed for enlisted\\" , Marine Corps Times, February 2, 2010. Assessed April 23, 2010. In 2010, the Marine Corps added an active duty civil affairs detachment at each of the three Marine Expeditionary Forces. The Marine Corps assigns civil affairs as a primary military specialty for enlisted and additional specialty for officers. The Marine Corps uses its own civil affairs doctrine and runs the Marine Corps Civil-Military Operations School (MCCMOS) at Marine Corps Base Quantico to train civil affairs Marines. MCCMOS also has career progression courses and MOSs for CMO Planners (officers) and CMO Chiefs (SNCOs). Additionally MCCMOS has a Stability Assessment Framework Course and a Civil Affairs Integration Course. There is some history to the Corps and Civil Affairs. \\"During WWII the Civil Affairs people of the 2nd Marine Division were behind the construction of Camp Churo on Tinian. They had the 18th Seabees build the camp for the 11,000 Japanese and Korean civilians that were on the island when it was taken\\".VI Corps Engineers webpage,18TH N.C.B. SEABEES - PACIFIC, By Thurman, November 18, 2011, =United States Navy= The Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) officially established its newest command, Maritime Civil Affairs Group (MCAG) during a ceremony at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek on 30 March 2007. In an effort to consolidate staffs and resources, CNO Notice 5400 of 9 July 2009 redesignated MCAG and Expeditionary Training Groups as Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training (MCAST) Command and relocated the command to Virginia Beach. MCAST Command officially stood up 1 October 2009. Maritime Civil Affairs Teams (MCATs) lessen the impact of military operations imposed during peace and periods of declared war, and increase the impact of humanitarian civil assistance (HCA) and contingency operations in support of theater security cooperation plans. MCA forces provide assistance with the restoration of local infrastructure in the aftermath of military operations, natural and man-made disasters and regional engagement activities in order to achieve shared mutual interests. In order to maximize its effectiveness, each deployed MCAT is regionally focused and trained with the necessary language skills and cultural awareness. The teams are responsible for streamlining and coordinating the efforts of the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Each Maritime Civil Affairs sailor is responsible for shaping the regional perception of the U.S. and gaining the support of the local populace, preventing it from being influenced by forces of instability, such as terrorism, piracy, crime and natural disaster. MCASTC has been disestablished. =United States Air Force= The Air Force has deployed united in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom that have directly integrated into Army Civil Affairs Battalions. Such units include the 16th Squadron, 732nd Expeditionary Air Wing (Civil Affairs/Public Works) which was assigned to the 411th Civil Affairs Battalion. During the 402nd Civil Affairs BN deployment to Iraq in April 2006 to April 2007, members of the United States Air Force provided Airman for logistical support for HHC and for the Provincial Reconstruction Teams throughout their area of operations. =Other organizations= New York State Guard In the New York State Guard, one of approximately 25 states with state defense forces, (not to be confused with the New York Army National Guard), the term 'Civil Affairs' has a slightly different connotation. The Civil Affairs units include lawyers, judges, engineers, doctors and other professionals and paraprofessionals committed to voluntary, part-time military service in support of the New York National Guard and U.S. Military Reserve Units from all branches. When soldiers are called up for duty, the New York Guard makes sure their legal needs are attended to so that they can serve with the peace of mind of knowing that their affairs are in order. Civil Affairs soldiers draft their wills, prepare powers of attorney and other necessary documents, and advise them of their rights as soldiers under federal law and as citizens of the United States. There are five units, one in each brigade of the Guard, including the 5th Civil Affairs Regiment, Yonkers, New York; 7th Civil Affairs Regiment, New York City; 13th Civil Affairs Regiment, Garden City, New York; 23rd Civil Affairs Regiment, Latham, New York; and the 209th Civil Affairs Regiment, Buffalo, New York. Civil affairs worldwide =United Kingdom= The British Army has a Civil Affairs Group, formed in 1997 and consisting primarily of Territorial Army personnel. Most personnel are members of the Royal Engineers and the group is administered by the Central Volunteer Headquarters Royal Engineers (CVHQ RE), based at Gibraltar Barracks, in Minley, Surrey. Members of the group have been deployed operationally in Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq. In Afghanistan, the tactical level unit was called Military Stabilisation Support Team, and they usually worked for the Provincial Reconstruction Team. The British Army first formed CA units in 1943, and by August 1944 there were 3,600 CA personnel in France with the 21st Army Group. =The Netherlands= The Royal Netherlands Army's Civil Affairs unit is 1 CIMIC Battalion. The staff consist of regular soldiers. Other personnel are reservists with a civilian occupation. Members of the battalion have been deployed to Bosnia; Macedonia; Africa and Afghanistan. The unit is, as of early 2009, based in Apeldoorn.

It is considered an endangered species because fewer than 2500 are left in the wild. These gazelles are found in Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya and Sudan. Name According to Richard Lydekker, the name rhim is Algerian Arabic, while in Tunisian and Egyptian the animal is known as the ghazal abiad, \\"white gazelle\\", owing to its pale coat. The name rhim is cognate with and perhaps derived from the Hebrew term re'em found in the Bible, which may refer to an aurochs, oryx or perhaps a unicorn.. Although described and named by Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier in 1842, the rhim gazelle was rediscovered by Edmund Giles Loder later in the same century, hence the synonym Gazella loderi and the common name Loder's gazelle. Description Skull Horns of a rhim gazelle (below) and Dorcas gazelle (above) Growing to a length of , this is the palest of the gazelles, and well adapted to desert life in many ways. The upper parts are pale buff or cream and the limbs and under parts white or pale buff. The horns on the male are slender and slightly S-shaped; those of the female are even thinner, lighter and nearly straight. There are faint facial markings and an indistinct stripe along the side. The tail is brownish-black, about long, and contrasts with the pale rump.  Distribution and habitat  The rhim gazelle is known from Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. It has also been reported from Niger and Chad, but these sightings seem doubtful and its precise range is unclear. The rhim gazelle is found in isolated pockets across the central Sahara Desert. The extreme heat of this environment limits their feeding to the early morning and evening, and G. leptoceros gains most of its water requirements from dew and plant moisture, relying little on open water sources. The rhim gazelle is a nomadic species, moving across its desert range in search of vegetation, though it does not have a set migratory pattern. Its typical habitat is sand dunes and the depressions between them and other sandy areas, but also rocky areas. Status Endangered by the early 1970s, this species of gazelle was in serious decline. They were hunted firstly by mounted then by motorized hunters for sport, meat, or their horns, which were sold as ornaments in North African markets. The threats the animals face now include poaching, disturbance by humans and loss of suitable habitat. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there may only be 300 to 600 mature individuals in the wild, and has rated their conservation status as \\"endangered\\".

Her work appears on the websites Daily Kos, Splinter, The Nib, Politico, AlterNet, and Truthout; and has appeared in Ms. Magazine, The Progressive, and The Nation. It also appears in over 20 alternative newsweeklies throughout America. In 2014 she became the first woman to win the Herblock Prize, and in 2017 she was named a Pulitzer Finalist in Editorial Cartooning.  Career  Raised in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Sorensen enrolled in the University of Virginia, where she drew a daily comic strip, Li'l Gus, for its student newspaper, University Journal, from 1994 to 1995, as well as contributing to the satirical magazine The Yellow Journal. Sorensen soon became published in various comic anthologies, including Action Girl and the Big Book of the 70's. She published her own book, Slowpoke Comix #1, in 1998. In 1999, one year after the book was published, Slowpoke became a weekly comic strip. As of 2012 the strip goes simply by her own name, though a few alternative weekly papers continue to use the Slowpoke name. Sorensen has published three volumes of cartoons: Slowpoke: Caf√© Pompous from 2001, Slowpoke: America Gone Bonkers from 2004 and her latest book, Slowpoke: One Nation Oh My God! published in 2008. Besides her weekly political cartoon, she has produced illustrations for such periodicals as Nickelodeon Magazine, The American Prospect, The Dallas Observer, Women's Review of Books, and MAD Magazine. She has written and illustrated a number of long-form comics, most notably a piece on health care reform commissioned by Kaiser Health News, and a synopsis of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice for NPR. She currently serves as comics editor for Splinter (formerly Fusion). Sorensen is also a member of the National Advisory Council of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum at Ohio State University. She has been interviewed by Yahoo/ABC News (video), The Washington Post' as well as the University of Virginia Magazine; the latter web article has a video of Sorensen working.

Sorensen was awarded the prize based on her portfolio containing work from her local weekly newspaper The Austin Chronicle, her regular publications in The Nation, Ms. Magazine, Politico, MAD Magazine, as well as her political cartoon, Slowpoke. The Herblock Foundation judges felt that, \\"Jen Sorensen‚Äôs strong portfolio addresses issues that were important to Herblock, such as gun control, racism, income inequality, healthcare, and sexism. Her style allows her to incorporate information which backs up the arguments she presents. Her art is engaging and her humor is sharp and on target.‚Äù =Pulitzer Prize= Sorensen was named a 2017 Pulitzer Prize Finalist in Editorial Cartooning for a variety of her work featured in several U.S. publications. Her nominated work includes several cartoons on the current political climate, such as The Trump Supporting Union Member, Poverty Injection, Radical Cleric vs. Trump, and more. According to the Pulitzer Prize board, Sorensen's work is powerful and \\"often challenging the viewer to look beyond the obvious\\".  Books  Sorensen has written the following books, published by Alternative Comics, which are generally compilations of the weekly comic strip, although the first book contained entirely new material. The Slowpoke books contain cartoon strips concerning U.S. politics and social justice issues. These comics comment on the Trump administration, the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, healthcare, climate change, and more topics related to the current U.S. political climate. * Slowpoke Comix #1 - 1998 (Alternative Comics) () * Slowpoke: Caf√© Pompous - 2001 (Alternative Comics) () * Slowpoke: America Gone Bonkers - 2004 (Alternative Comics) () * Slowpoke: One Nation, Oh My God! - 2008 (Ig Publishing) () References External links American bloggers American comic strip cartoonists American female comics artists 1974 births Living people University of Virginia alumni Artists from Lancaster, Pennsylvania 20th-century American artists 21st-century American artists American women bloggers 20th-century American women artists 21st-century American women artists ","title":"Jen Sorensen"},{"id":"1771864","title":"Dorint Hotel Tower"},{"id":"1771870","text":"Dirt Rag was a mountain bike magazine based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In 1851 the Police Union of German States was set up by the police forces of Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, Baden, and W√ºrttemberg. It was specifically organised to suppress political dissent in the wake of the 1848 revolutions which spread across Germany. For the next fifteen years the Union held annual meetings to exchange information. Karl Ludwig Friedrich von Hinckeldey, the Police Commissioner of Berlin, was appointed by King Friedrich Wilhelm IV on November 16, 1848. He was to prove to be a key figure in the development of the secret police in Prussia as well as the whole union. By 1854, thanks to his close relationship with the king he was appointed Generalpolizeidirektor (General Director of Police). Effectively he was a minister of police independent from the minister of the interior. Von Hinckeldey founded the Berlin political police in Berlin and developed a Prussian information catalogue on political opponents, focusing on revolutionaries involved in the 1848 uprisings. But as he saw Paris and London as the centers of political intrigue he was keen to organize the policing of political opponents outside borders of national jurisdictions. The Prussian Secret Police has historically held a bad reputation, as it was the model upon which the Gestapo was later founded. The Prussian Secret Police, however, did not routinely engage in persecution or the abuse of police powers, and did not behave in the way that other secret police forces might. See Wilhelm Stieber. The Prussian Secret Police was renamed in 1933 as the Gestapo. Prussia itself was dissolved as an administrative entity following World War II.

It follows the story of a young woman, Tandia, who was brutally raped and then banished from her own home. Tandia later meets up with Peekay, the protagonist from The Power of One and their stories continue on together. Plot introduction In South Africa, during a time when apartheid was at its worst, Courtenay tells a story of how oppressed people worked together with those who sought justice against the inhumane dictators of the country and those who supported it. There are also storylines and themes involving boxing, which was predominant in Courtenay's earlier novel, The Power Of One. Plot summary Tandia, whose parents were a South African Indian man (Mr. Patel) and his house worker (a black woman), is raped by a police officer at her father's grave the day after his funeral. With Mr. Patel's death, Tandia knew things were going to be very hard for her. But after his wife (Mrs. Patel) kicks her out of the dark corrugated-iron shed in the back yard, her only house, her situation has been changed more drastically than she expected. She is arrested by the police and meets the policeman who witnessed the rape on her father's grave and becomes her lifelong enemy, Jannie Geldenhuis. Tandia finds a home in the brothel where Geldenhuis drops her. The brothel's owner and the other residents adopt her and she learns a lot of life lessons. Some of the clients of the brothel end up becoming her sponsors for her ambition to enter law school. While Peekay and Hymie (Morrie in the American version) go to Britain to read law at Oxford University, they want to conquer the world boxing field, Peekay as world welterweight champion and Hymie as Peekay's manager. They also want to pursue justice for the country they love, South Africa. When they arrive back in South Africa, their rivalry with Jannie Geldenhuis, which began in the school where they first met, extends to both boxing and politics. Tandia grows up to be an intelligent and very beautiful lawyer. She joins the law firm formed by Peekay and Hymie and is dedicated to providing counsel to the under-represented black and coloured population of South Africa. Her defense of a black terrorist causes her to again confront her lifelong enemy Jannie Geldenhuis who is now a powerful officer in the police force. Tandia and Peekay develop a romantic relationship, in a country where mixed relationships are outlawed. Their growing love is very dangerous and it leads them into the most fearful consequences.

When a particular judicial opinion is referenced, the law report series in which the opinion is printed will determine the case citation format. Historically, the term reporter was used to refer to the individual persons who actually compile, edit, and publish such opinions. For example, the Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States is the person authorized to publish the Court's cases in the bound volumes of the United States Reports. Today, in American English, reporter also denotes the books themselves. In Commonwealth English, these are described by the plural term law reports, the title that usually appears on the covers of the periodical parts and the individual volumes. In common law countries, court opinions are legally binding under the rule of ' (precedent). That rule requires a court to apply a legal principle that was set forth earlier by a court of a superior (sometimes, the same) jurisdiction dealing with a similar set of facts. Thus, the regular publication of such opinions is important so that everyone‚Äîlawyers, judges, and laymen can all find out what the law is, as declared by judges. Official and unofficial case law reporting Official law reports or reporters are those authorized for publication by statute or other governmental ruling. Governments designate law reports as official to provide an authoritative, consistent, and authentic statement of a jurisdiction's primary law. Official case law publishing may be carried out by a government agency, or by a commercial entity. Unofficial law reports, on the other hand, are not officially sanctioned and are published as a commercial enterprise. In Australia and New Zealand (see below), official reports are called authorised reports‚Äîunofficial reports are referred to as unauthorised reports. For the publishers of unofficial reports to maintain a competitive advantage over the official ones, unofficial reports usually provide helpful research aids (e.g., summaries, indexes), like the editorial enhancements used in the West American Digest System. Some commercial publishers also provide court opinions in searchable online databases that are part of larger fee-based, online legal research systems, such as Westlaw, Lexis-Nexis or Justis. Unofficially published court opinions are also often published before the official opinions, so lawyers and law journals must cite the unofficial report until the case comes out in the official report. But once a court opinion is officially published, case citation rules usually require a person to cite to the official reports. Contents of a good law report The headnote from the leading English case Wilkinson v. Downton [1897] 2 QB 57. A good printed law report in traditional form usually contains the following items: * The citation reference. * The name of the case (usually the parties' names). * Catchwords (for information retrieval purposes). * The headnote (a brief summary of the case, the holding, and any significant case law considered). However, a headnote is not part of the decision rendered. Headnotes occasionally contain misinterpretations of the law in judgments of lower courts, and are not regarded as part of an official judgment or precedent. * A recital of the facts of the case (unless appearing in the judgment). * A note of the arguments of counsel before the judge. (This is often omitted in modern reports.) * The judgment (a verbatim transcript of the words used by the judge to explain his or her reasoning). Open publication on the Internet The development of the Internet created the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on Web sites. This is a relatively low cost publication method compared to paper and makes court decisions more easily available to the public (particularly important in common law countries where court decisions are major sources of law). Because a court can post a decision on a Web site as soon as it is rendered, the need for a quickly printed case in an unofficial, commercial report becomes less crucial. However, the very ease of internet publication has raised new concerns about the ease with which internet-published decisions can be modified after publication, creating uncertainty about the validity of internet opinions. Decisions of courts from all over the world can now be found through the WorldLII Web site, and the sites of its member organizations. These projects have been strongly encouraged by the Free Access to Law Movement. Many law librarians and academics have commented on the changing system of legal information delivery brought about by the rapid growth of the World Wide Web. Professor Bob Berring writes that the \\"primacy of the old paper sets [print law reports] is fading, and a vortex of conflicting claims and products is spinning into place\\".. In theory, court decisions posted on the Web expand access to the law beyond the specialized law library collections used primarily by lawyers and judges. The general public can more readily find court opinions online, whether posted on Web-accessible databases (such as the Hong Kong Judiciary public access site, above), or through general Web search engines. Questions remain, however, on the need for a uniform and practical citation format for cases posted on the Web (versus the standard volume and page number used for print law reports). Furthermore, turning away from the traditional \\"official-commercial\\" print report model raises questions about the accuracy, authority, and reliability of case law found on the Web. The answer to these questions will be determined, in large part, through changing government information policies, and by the degree of influence exerted by commercial database providers on global legal information markets. Design and cultural references Reports usually come in the form of sturdy hardcover books with most of the design elements on the spine (the part that a lawyer would be most interested in when searching for a case). The volume number is usually printed in large type to make it easy to spot. Gold leaf is traditionally used on the spine for the name of the report and for some decorative lines and bars. In lawyer portraits and advertisements, the rows of books visible behind the lawyer are usually reports. History and case reporting (by country) =Canada= Each province in Canada has an official reporter series that publishes superior court and appellate court decisions of the respective province. The federal courts, such as the Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal, and Tax Court, each have their own reporter series. The Supreme Court of Canada has its own Reporter series, the Supreme Court Reports. There are also general reporters, such as the long-running Dominion Law Reports, that publishes cases of national significance. =United Kingdom= Supreme Court of the United Kingdom The UK Supreme Court publishes on its own website the court's judgments after they have been handed down, together with the ICLR summary (or \\"headnote\\"). England and Wales A few volumes of the English Reports at a law library In England and Wales, beginning with the reports of cases contained in the Year Books (Edward II to Henry VIII) there are various sets of reports of cases decided in the higher English courts down to the present time. Until the nineteenth century, both the quality of early reports, and the extent to which the judge explained the facts of the case and his judgment, are highly variable, and the weight of the precedent may depend on the reputations of both the judge and the reporter. Such reports are now largely of academic interest, having been overtaken by statutes and later developments, but binding precedents can still be found, often most cogently expressed.W. T. S. Daniel, History of the Origin of the Law Reports (London, 1884) In 1865, the nonprofit Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (ICLR) for England and Wales was founded, and it has gradually become the dominant publisher of reports in the UK. It has compiled most of the best available copies of pre-1866 cases into the English Reports. Post-1865 cases are contained in the ICLR's own Law Reports. Even today, the UK government does not publish an official report, but its courts have promulgated rules stating that the ICLR reports must be cited when available.Lord Judge CJ, Practice Direction (Citation of Authorities) [2012] 1 WLR 780 [6]. Historical practice, which may still apply where no other report is available, permitted parties to rely on any report 'with the name of a barrister annexed to it.' =English maritime law= While maritime cases often have a contract or tort element and are reported in the standard volumes, the standard source for maritime cases is the Lloyd's Law Reports, which covers matters including maritime matters such as carriage of goods by sea, international trade law, and admiralty law. Scotland The Session Cases report cases heard in the Court of Session and Scottish cases heard on appeal in the House of Lords. The Justiciary Cases report from the High Court of Justiciary. Those two series are the most authoritative and are cited in court in preference to other report series, such as the Scots Law Times, which reports sheriff court and lands tribunal cases in addition to the higher courts. The law reports service of Scotland is supplemented by other reports such as the Scottish Civil Case Reports and Green's Weekly Digest. =United States= The Pacific Reporter, a part of West's National Reporter System In each state of the United States, there are published reports of all cases decided by the courts having appellate jurisdiction going back to the date of their organization. There are also complete reports of the cases decided in the United States Supreme Court and the inferior federal courts having appellate jurisdiction since their creation under the United States Constitution. The early reporters were unofficial as they were published solely by private entrepreneurs, but in the middle of the 19th century, the U.S. Supreme Court and many state supreme courts began publishing their own official reporters. In the 1880s, the West Publishing Company started its National Reporter System (NRS), which is a family of regional reporters, each of which collects select state court opinions from a specific group of states. The National Reporter System is now the dominant unofficial reporter system in the U.S., and 21 states have discontinued their own official reporters and certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their official reporter. West and its rival, LexisNexis, both publish unofficial reporters of U.S. Supreme Court opinions. West also publishes the West American Digest System to help lawyers find cases in its reporters. West digests and reporters have always featured a \\"Key Numbering System\\" with a unique number for every conceivable legal topic. Map of the U.S., showing areas covered by the Thomson West National Reporter System state law reports. The U.S. federal government does not publish an official reporter for the federal courts at the circuit and district levels (the sole exception is the D.C. Circuit). However, just as the UK government uses the ICLR reporters by default, the U.S. courts use the unofficial West federal reporters for cases after 1880, which are the Federal Reporter (for courts of appeals) and the Federal Supplement (for district courts). For cases from federal circuit and district courts prior to 1880, U.S. courts use Federal Cases. The Federal Reporter, the Federal Supplement, and Federal Cases are all part of the NRS and include headnotes marked with West key numbers. West's NRS also includes several unofficial state-specific reporters for large states like California. The NRS now numbers well over 10,000 volumes; therefore, only the largest law libraries maintain a full hard copy set in their on-site collections. Some government agencies use (and require attorneys and agents practicing before them to cite to) certain unofficial reporters that specialize in the types of cases likely to be material to matters before the agency. For example, for both patent and trademark practice, the United States Patent and Trademark Office requires citation to the United States Patents Quarterly (USPQ).Citation of authority, 37 C.F.R. ¬ß 42.12(a)(2) Citation of Decisions and Office Publications, Trademark Manual of Examination Procedures ¬ß 705.05 Today, both Westlaw and LexisNexis also publish a variety of official and unofficial reporters covering the decisions of many federal and state administrative agencies which possess quasi-judicial powers. A recent trend in American states is for bar associations to join a consortium called Casemaker. Casemaker gives members of a state bar access to a computerized legal research system.

Soule, Lawyers' Reference Manual of Law Books and Citations (Boston, 1884) * Stephen Elias and Susan Levinkind, Legal Research: How To Find And Understand The Law (Berkeley: Nolo Press, 2004) =Australia= Volumes of the Commonwealth Law Reports The Commonwealth Law Reports are the authorised reports of decision of the High Court of Australia. The Federal Court Reports are the authorised reports of decisions of the Federal Court of Australia (including the Full Court). Each state and territory has a series of authorised reports, e.g. the Victorian Reports, of decisions of the superior courts of the state or territory. The Australian Law Reports are the largest series of unauthorised reports although there are several others general reports and reports relating to specific areas of the law, e.g. the Australian Torts Reports publish decisions from any state or federal court relating to tort law. The NSW Law Reports are published by the Council of Law Reporting for New South Wales and cover the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The Victorian Reports are published by Little William Bourke on behalf of the Council of Law Reporting in Victoria and cover the Supreme Court of Victoria. =New Zealand= The New Zealand Law Reports (NZLR) are the authorised reports of the New Zealand Council for Law Reporting and have been published continuously since 1883. The reports publish cases of significance from the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court of New Zealand. The reports, which were initially sorted by volume, are sorted by year. Three volumes per year are now published, with the number of volumes having increased over time from one, to two and now to three. The reports do not focus on any particular area of law, with subject specific reports filling this niche. There are approximately 20 privately published report series focusing on specialist areas of law. Some areas are covered by more than one report series‚Äîsuch as employment, tax and family law. =Ireland= Most Irish law reports are contained in The Irish Reports (IR), published by the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for Ireland. Other reports are contained in the Irish Law Reports Monthly (ILRM) and various online collections of court decisions. =Bangladesh= In Bangladesh, the law reports are published according to the provisions of the Law Reports Act, 1875. There are many law reports now in Bangladesh. Published monthly, the Apex Law Reports (ALR) provides timely treatment of significant developments in law through articles contributed by judges, leading scholars and practitioners.The Law Messenger is an internationally standard law report which started publication in 2016. It is the first law journal in Bangladesh which specifically publishes law decisions of Supreme Court of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan only. Mainstream Law Reports (MLR)http://www.mlrbd.com is the most-cited law journal and it ranks among the country's most-cited law reviews of any kind. Published monthly, the MLR provides timely treatment of significant developments in law through articles contributed by judges, leading scholars and practitioners. Another popular law report is the Dhaka Law Reports, which started publication in 1948. Bangladesh Legal Decisions is published under the authority of the Bangladesh Bar Council. The other law reports include Bangladesh Law Chronicles, Law Guardian, Bangladesh Law Times. The online law report in Bangladesh is Chancery Law Chronicles, which now publishes verdicts of Supreme Court of Bangladesh. After the Supreme Court of Bangladesh was established in 1972, its online law report is Supreme Court Online Bulletin and it initially published a law report, containing the judgments, orders and decisions of the Court. The decisions of the lower judiciary were not reported in any law report. =India= An issue of the Indian Supreme Court Law Reporter The Supreme Court Reports (SCR) is the official reporter for Supreme Court decisions. In addition, some private reporters have been authorised to publish the Court's decisions. =Pakistan= Pakistan inherited a common law system upon independence from Great Britain in 1947, and thus its legal system relies heavily on law reports. The most comprehensive law book is the \\"Pakistan Law Decisions\\" (PLD), which contains judgments from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the various provincial High Courts, the Service, Professional and Election Tribunals as well as the superior courts of territories such as Azad Kashmir. PLD is augmented by other books, most notably the \\"Yearly Law Reports\\" (YLR), and the \\"Monthly Law Digest\\" (MLD). The Supreme Court also has its own law book, the \\"Supreme Court Monthly Review\\" (SCMR), which lists more recent cases that the appex court heard. In addition, there are books dealing with specific areas of law, such as the \\"Civil Law Cases\\" (CLC), which as the name suggests deals with Civil cases; the \\"Pakistan Criminal Law Journal\\" (PCrLJ), which reports Criminal Cases; and the \\"Pakistan Tax Decisions\\" (PTD), on the Income Tax tribunal cases and their appeals. =Kenya= Kenya's first output of law reports was in the form of volumes under the citation E.A.L.R (East African Law Reports). They were first published between 1897 and 1905. Seven of these volumes were compiled by the Hon Mr Justice R. W. Hamilton, who was then the Chief Justice of the Protectorate and the reports covered all courts of different jurisdictions. The 1922‚Äì1956 period saw the emergence of some twenty-one volumes of the Kenya Law Reports (under the citation K.L.R). These reports included the decisions of the High Court only and were collated, compiled and edited by different puisne judges and magistrates. Then came the period covering 1934 to 1956 which saw the birth of the famous Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa Law Reports (E.A.L.R). These reports comprised twenty-three volumes altogether which were also compiled by puisne judges and magistrates, a Registrar of the High Court and a Registrar of the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa. These volumes reported the decisions of the then Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa and of the Privy Council. They covered only those appeals filed from the territories. The East Africa Law Reports (cited as E.A.) were introduced in 1957 and were published in nineteen consecutive volumes until 1975. These reports covered decisions of the Court of Appeal for East Africa and the superior courts of the constituent territories, namely, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Aden, Seychelles and Somaliland. They were published under an editorial board consisting of the Chief Justices of the Territories and the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa. Following the collapse of the East African Community, under whose auspices the reports were published, the reports went out of publication. The period before the resumption of the East Africa Law Reports saw sporadic and transitory attempts at law reporting. Firstly, with the authority of the then Attorney-General, six volumes named the New Kenya Law Reports covering the period between and including the years 1976 to 1980 were published by the East African Publishing House. These reports included the decisions of the High Court and Court of Appeal of Kenya and were compiled by the Late Hon Mr Justice S. K. Sachdeva and were edited by Mr Paul H Niekirk and the Hon Mr Justice Richard Kuloba, a judge of the High Court of Kenya. The publication of these reports ceased when the publishing house folded them up ostensibly on account of lack of funds. Later, two volumes of what were known as the Kenya Appeal Reports were published for the period 1982‚Äì1992 by Butterworths, a private entity, under the editorship of The Hon Chief Justice A.R.W. Hancox (hence the pseudonym ‚ÄúHancox Reports‚Äù) who had the assistance of an editorial board of seven persons. These reports, as their name suggested, included only the decisions of the Court of Appeal of Kenya selected over that period. Law reports relating to special topics have also been published. Ten volumes of the Court of Review Law Reports covering the period 1953 to 1962 and including the decisions on customary law by the African Court of Review were published by the Government Printer. There was no editorial board and it is not known who the compilers of these reports were. Their apocryphal origin notwithstanding, they were commonly cited by legal practitioners and scholars. In 1994, the Kenyan Parliament passed the National Council for Law Reporting Act, 1994 and gave the Council the exclusive mandate of: ‚Äúpublication of the reports to be known as the Kenya Law Reports which shall contain judgments, rulings and opinions of the superior courts of record and also undertake such other publications as in the opinion of the Council are reasonably related to or connected with the preparation and publication of the Kenya Law Reports‚Äù (section 3 of the Act). The Kenya Law Reports are the official law reports of the Republic of Kenya which may be cited in proceedings in all courts of Kenya (section 21 of the Act). =Hong Kong= Cases of Hong Kong are predominantly published in the authorised Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Reports (HKCFAR) and Hong Kong Law Reports and Digests (HKLRD), as well as the unauthorised but the oldest Hong Kong Cases (HKC). Some specialist series are available including the Hong Kong Family Law Reports (HKFLR), Hong Kong Public Law Reports (HKPLR) and Conveyancing and Property Reports (CPR). Chinese-language judgments are published in the Hong Kong Chinese Law Reports and Translation (HKCLRT). The Hong Kong Law Reports and Digests were published as the Hong Kong Law Reports (HKLR) until 1997.

Biography Curt Hugo Johannes Weibull was born in Lund, Sweden. He was a member of the noted Swedish Weibull family. He was the son of professor Martin Weibull (1835‚Äì1902) and brother of historian Lauritz Weibull (1873‚Äì1960). He and his brother both attended the University of Lund. Curt Weibull was a professor of history at the University of Gothenburg from 1927‚Äì1953 and its rector from 1936 to 1946. In 1928 he and his brother, Lauritz Weibull, initiated the periodical Scandia. Together they are known for having introduced a critical theory of history to Swedish historical research, inspired by German historian Leopold von Ranke (1795‚Äì1886). Weibull was an important mentor to noted Swedish historian Erik L√∂nnroth (1910‚Äì2002) who further developed the methods of evaluating sources. His most important and acclaimed work is a criticism regarding the interpretation and the ahistoricism of the Gesta Danorum by the 12th century Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus. This piece was named: Saxo. Kritiska unders√∂kningar i Danmarks historia fr√•n Sven Estridsens d√∂d till Canute VI (Saxo. Critical studies in Denmark's history from Sven Estriden's death to Canute VI), and was rather controversial at the time, as it revealed the vague basis of Denmark's older history of the time. In 1991, when he was 105, his last work was published: an article in a book celebrating the 100th anniversary of the University of Gothenburg. That probably makes him the oldest historian in the world to have a new study published while still alive. An anecdote tells that when a Danish historian was counter-criticizing parts of Weibull's Ph.D. thesis (from 1916) on Saxo Grammaticus in his own thesis (believing Weibull to be dead since this was after his 100th birthday) Weibull appeared in the public disputation angrily defending his work. During the late 1970s, while lecturing about his life and his research to younger students, he had humorously remarked about a Danish professor who had criticized his own thesis when it appeared: \\"I haven't replied in depth to the criticism of the professor. But it's not too late, now is it?\\" Weibull was married to Gunilla Lundstr√∂m and was the father of the Swedish historian and Liberal politician, Jorgen Weibull (1924‚Äì1998). Weibull was buried in Norra kyrkog√•rden in Lund. Selected works *Sverige och dess nordiska Grannmakter under den tidigare medeltiden (1921) *L√ºbeck och Sk√•nemarknaden.

The original baptism record, however, records the date as November 23. - March 14, 1918; also spelled Rubini) was an Italian anarchist who unsuccessfully tried to assassinate King Leopold II of Belgium. Early life Rubino was born in Bitonto, during the period of Italian unification. While serving in the Italian army as a young man, Rubino was condemned to five years' detention for writing a subversive newspaper article. In 1898, he was arrested again during bread riots in Milan.Milillo, 95. Rather than serving a lengthy prison sentence, Rubino fled the country. He first took up residence in Glasgow, Scotland and then moved to London.Milillo, 96. He was unable to find work, however, until offered assistance by the Italian Embassy. He was then employed by the Italian Secret Service to spy on anarchist organizations in London. He was dismissed from the job, however, once embassy officials discovered that he sympathized with the anarchists. In May 1902, Rubino's employment with the Italian Secret Service was uncovered, and he was denounced by the international anarchist press as a spy. Evidently, Rubino then resolved to commit an assassination in order to prove his allegiance to the anarchist cause. As he wrote in a letter to his former comrades, \\"perhaps tomorrow or after, I will be able to prove my rebellion in a manner more consistent with my and your aspirations.\\"Milillo, 97. Original Italian: \\"E forse domani o dopo, potr√≤ dimostrare la mia ribellione in un modo pi√π consono alle mie e vostre aspirazioni.\\" According to later police interrogations, he considered killing King Edward VII, but decided against it due to the strong feeling of the English people in favour of the monarchy. Instead he chose King Leopold II of Belgium. Assassination attempt In late October, 1902, Rubino relocated to Brussels. On the morning of November 15, 1902, King Leopold was returning from a ceremony in memory of his recently deceased wife, Marie Henriette. The royal cortege left the cathedral. In the first carriage Prince Albert was seated with the king, and in the second carriage princess Elisabeth was seated. Rubino took a revolver and waited for the King's procession among a crowd on the Rue Royale in front of the Bank of Brussels. After Leopold's carriage passed, Rubino drew his gun and fired three shots at the third carriage. In this carriage Count Charles John d'Oultremont, the Grand Marshal of the Royal court was seated, and he received broken glass in his face. The carriages didn't stop and continued to the palace. When he arrived in the royal palace, the Grand Marshal was questioned by officials. His uniform was covered in broken glass.Journal De Charleroi 16-11-1902 The king and members of the royal family were told that they had escaped an assassination attempt. The king asked if anybody had been hurt and then continued his day. All three shots missed, although one smashed the window of a carriage of Count Charles d'Oultremont, who was almost killed. The king was saved by M. J. Bernard from Bar-le-duc who successfully disarmed Rubino.Meuse (La) 25-07-1903 Paul van den Bosch, from Liege, caught Rubino by his throat and handed him to the police. The police put Rubino in a cab, which was immediately surrounded by an angry mob. The police had great difficulty in forcing their way through the crowd, which shouted alternately, \\"Kill him!\\" and \\"Long live the King!\\" At the police station, Rubino was searched and found to be carrying a package of ball cartridges and picture postcards bearing portraits of King Leopold, Prince Albert, and Princess Elisabeth. Rubino said he procured the cards so he would be able to recognize the members of the royal family. He also said he did not regret his act and would have fired \\"at the King of Italy as readily as at the King of Belgium, because monarchs are tyrants who cause the misery of their peoples.\\" He also asserted that he had no accomplices, although several people who were near Rubino when he fired the revolver asserted that he was accompanied by another man who escaped among the crowd. Following the attempted assassination, anarchists further condemned Rubino as an agent provocateur, with some even speculating that the entire event was staged in order to justify subsequent police crackdowns against European anarchists. This speculation was fueled by early reports that the unfired cartridges left in Rubino's revolver were blanks. This was contradicted by later reports that Rubino's revolver was never found by the police.Milillo, 87. Trial and imprisonment After the attempt he was sent to the prison of Saint Gilles, where he received three glasses of beer for dinner and some bread. He was questioned by the Examining magistrate M. J. Count d'Oultremont. Rubino chose √âmile Royer, a socialist who had previously defended the anarchist Jules Moineau, as his lawyer. There was an issue: because the grand Marshall of the royal Court count Charles d'Oultremont was related to Examining magistrate M. J. d'Oultremont, he had to be replaced by Mr. van Nerom to respect a neutral examination.Meuse (La) 19-11-1902 Rubino stood trial in Brussels in February 1903. At the trial Rubino was unrepentant and even boastful, declaring that he had hoped to be able to kill the King, Prince Albert, and a few of the clergy. During the trial Rubino often expounded anarchist doctrines which, he said, recognized neither laws nor judges. The jury found Rubino guilty and the court then sentenced him to life imprisonment. Death Rubino died on March 14, 1918 in Leuven Centraal, the main prison of Leuven, Belgium.Milillo, 97.

The figure on the right shows a domatic partition of a graph; here the dominating set V_1 consists of the yellow vertices, V_2 consists of the green vertices, and V_3 consists of the blue vertices. The domatic number is the maximum size of a domatic partition, that is, the maximum number of disjoint dominating sets. The graph in the figure has domatic number 3. It is easy to see that the domatic number is at least 3 because we have presented a domatic partition of size 3. To see that the domatic number is at most 3, we first review a simple upper bound. Upper bounds Let \\\\delta be the minimum degree of the graph G. The domatic number of G is at most \\\\delta + 1. To see this, consider a vertex v of degree \\\\delta. Let N consist of v and its neighbours. We know that (1) each dominating set V_i must contain at least one vertex in N (domination), and (2) each vertex in N is contained in at most one dominating set V_i (disjointness). Therefore there are at most N = \\\\delta + 1 disjoint dominating sets. The graph in the figure has minimum degree \\\\delta = 2, and therefore its domatic number is at most 3. Hence we have shown that its domatic number is exactly 3; the figure shows a maximum-size domatic partition. Lower bounds Weak 2-coloringIf there is no isolated vertex in the graph (that is, \\\\delta ‚â• 1), then the domatic number is at least 2. To see this, note that (1) a weak 2-coloring is a domatic partition if there is no isolated vertex, and (2) any graph has a weak 2-coloring. Alternatively, (1) a maximal independent set is a dominating set, and (2) the complement of a maximal independent set is also a dominating set if there are no isolated vertices. The figure on the right shows a weak 2-coloring, which is also a domatic partition of size 2: the dark nodes are a dominating set, and the light nodes are another dominating set (the light nodes form a maximal independent set). See weak coloring for more information. Computational complexity Finding a domatic partition of size 1 is trivial: let V_1 = V. Finding a domatic partition of size 2 (or determining that it does not exist) is easy: check if there are isolated nodes, and if not, find a weak 2-coloring. However, finding a maximum-size domatic partition is computationally hard. Specifically, the following decision problem, known as the domatic number problem, is NP-complete: given a graph G and an integer K, determine whether the domatic number of G is at least K. Therefore the problem of determining the domatic number of a given graph is NP-hard, and the problem of finding a maximum-size domatic partition is NP-hard as well. There is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a logarithmic approximation guarantee, that is, it is possible to find a domatic partition whose size is within a factor O(\\\\log V) of the optimum. However, under plausible complexity-theoretic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a sub-logarithmic approximation factor. More specifically, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for domatic partition with the approximation factor (1-\\\\epsilon) \\\\ln V for a constant \\\\epsilon > 0 would imply that all problems in NP can be solved in slightly super-polynomial time n^{O(\\\\log \\\\log n)}. Comparison with similar concepts ; Domatic partition : Partition of vertices into disjoint dominating sets. The domatic number is the maximum number of such sets. ; Vertex coloring : Partition of vertices into disjoint independent sets. The chromatic number is the minimum number of such sets. ; Clique partition : Partition of vertices into disjoint cliques. Equal to vertex coloring in the complement graph. ; Edge coloring : Partition of edges into disjoint matchings. The edge chromatic number is the minimum number of such sets. Let G = (U ‚à™ V, E) be a bipartite graph without isolated nodes; all edges are of the form {u, v} ‚àà E with u ‚àà U and v ‚àà V. Then {U, V} is both a vertex 2-coloring and a domatic partition of size 2; the sets U and V are independent dominating sets. The chromatic number of G is exactly 2; there is no vertex 1-coloring. The domatic number of G is at least 2. It is possible that there is a larger domatic partition; for example, the complete bipartite graph Kn,n for any n ‚â• 2 has domatic number n.

News satire has been around almost as long as journalism itself, but it is particularly popular on the web, with websites like The Onion, where it is relatively easy to mimic a legitimate news source. News satire relies heavily on irony and deadpan humor. Two slightly different types of news satire exist. One form uses satirical commentary and sketch comedy to comment on real-world news events, while the other presents wholly fictionalized news stories. In history Author Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) was employed as a newspaper reporter before becoming famous as a novelist, and in this position he published many satirical articles. He left two separate journalism positions, Nevada (1864) fleeing a challenge to duel and San Francisco fleeing outraged police officials because his satire and fiction were often taken for the truthful accounts they were presented as. Ironically, the accuracy of many newspaper and autobiographical accounts used to follow the early life of Samuel Clemens are in doubt. Newspapers still print occasional news satire features, in particular on April Fools' Day. This news is specifically identified somewhere in the paper or in the next day as a joke. In 1933 and 1934, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released a series of ten one-reel theatrical shorts called Goofy Movies, which included \\"Wotaphony Newsreel,\\" a newsreel parody that paired actual footage with a mocking, deadpan narration.Goofy Movies Number Ten (1934)Goofy Movies Number One (1933) Also in 1934, halfway through a Kraft Music Hall radio show, Dean Taylor (\\"Others collect the news, Dean makes it!\\") narrated a fake newsreel which began with a report on the New York Giants and Philadelphia Phillies being cancelled due to bad weather, and baseball season being rescheduled to when farmers need rain. On television News satire has been prevalent on television since the 1960s, when it enjoyed a renaissance in the UK with the \\"Satire Boom\\", led by such luminaries as Peter Cook, Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller, David Frost, Eleanor Bron, and Dudley Moore, and the television program That Was The Week That Was. In the United States, the NBC network adapted this program and also produced its own content, from the \\"news\\" segment of Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, to the still-running Saturday Night Live mock newscast segment \\"Weekend Update\\". Cable television got into the cable news act with Home Box Office's Not Necessarily the News in the mid-1980s. In the 2000s, Comedy Central's The Daily Show became an icon of the American political satire genre, as Jon Stewart delved into opinionated political criticism. Its spinoff, Stephen Colbert's The Colbert Report, also enjoyed a high level of popularity during its 9-year run. The 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey found that Daily Show viewers were better informed than those who relied solely on conventional network news, and Steven Young of Los Angeles Daily News compares the trust and influence that long-time host Jon Stewart enjoyed to that of CBS anchor Walter Cronkite in the 1970s. However, a study published in the Journal of Communication suggests that news entertainment shows such as The Daily Show or The Colbert Report may not be as influential in teaching voters about political issues and candidates as was previously thought. Researchers from Ohio State University have found reasons to discount how effective these shows are in informing the general public. People watching television news learned more about a candidate's position on issues and about political procedures compared to those watching the news entertainment shows, while news entertainment shows primarily taught viewers about a candidate‚Äôs personal background.Just Laugh! You Don‚Äôt Need to Remember: The Effects of Entertainment Media on Political Information Acquisition and Information Processing in Political Judgment Wiley Online Library, Retrieved on September 15, 2018. After the success of The Daily Show, Fox News launched its own news satire program in February 2007 with the title of The 1/2 Hour News Hour. Its creator describes it as \\"The Daily Show for conservatives\\", but it was canceled within a few months. Fox News then launched the more successful series Red Eye which ran from February 6, 2007 to April 7, 2017. As of 2017, news satire in the United States remains popular, especially in late night television; late-night talk shows often incorporate elements of news satire. Current American programs known primarily for their news satire include those hosted by former correspondents for The Daily Show (John Oliver's Last Week Tonight, Samantha Bee's Full Frontal, and The Daily Show itself under Trevor Noah's tenure), as well as Bill Maher's Real Time. In Britain, several news satires have been created, most famously the works of Chris Morris. Shows such as the radio series On the Hour and its television version The Day Today parodied news programs very accurately, so they were almost believable and could have been confused with actual news programs, if it was not for the fake stories reported. Morris went on to continue this and several other themes in Brass Eye, one of the most controversial series on British television, especially after one episode broadcast mocked the way the news covered stories about pedophilia. Previous news satire shows in Britain include: The Late Edition with Marcus Brigstocke, on digital station BBC Four, which was heavily influenced by The Daily Show; News Knight with Sir Trevor McDonald, which parodied news differently by using an actual newsreader as the host; and Broken News, which featured several sketches of different news channels blending into each other. As of 2018, current British news-related programs that have been described as satire include: Have I Got News for You and Mock the Week on the BBC; Channel 4's The Last Leg; ITV's Newzoids; and Dave's Unspun with Matt Forde. Recent news satire television series in Australia include Working Dog Productions' Frontline, Shaun Micallef's Newstopia, and the many programs created by The Chaser since 2001. As of 2017, current programs of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation include Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell and The Weekly with Charlie Pickering. In Canada, This Hour Has 22 Minutes is an ensemble news satire show with four anchors on CBC. The Rick Mercer Report is a spinoff of 22 Minutes with former anchor Rick Mercer, and is also shown on CBC. CBC Radio One features This Is That, an improvised news satire program which mimics the style of actual CBC Radio public affairs programs. The 1960s series This Hour Has Seven Days, although primarily a real newsmagazine, included some satirical features in its format, such as political humor songs by actress and singer Dinah Christie. On French- language television networks in Quebec, noted news satire shows have included La Fin du monde est √† 7 heures, Et Dieu cr√©a... Laflaque and Infoman. On the Internet, noted satire sites include The Lapine and The Beaverton. In Germany, heute-show (ZDF), and formerly Wochenshow (on SAT.1) and Freitag Nacht News (on RTL) are popular news satires on TV. The Egyptian show El Bernameg, hosted by Bassem Youssef (on Capital Broadcast Center 2011-13 and MBC MASR from 2014 on), is modeled on The Daily Show. Launched in the wake of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, it has been quite popular, but also a source of tremendous controversy, as Youssef has repeatedly been under investigation by the authorities for his willingness to poke fun at powerful people. In France, Rendez-Vous avec Kevin Razy on Canal+ hosted by the comedian K√©vin Razy between 2017 and 2019 was modeled on Last Week Tonight and 'The Tonight Show' with a band. Online News satire has been posted on the web almost since its inception, with The Onion foremost among recognized news satire sites due to its enduring and profitable business model. The content of the website, which started in 1996, is syndicated through mainstream media sites such as CNN and CNET. Today there are hundreds of news satire sites online. Sites such as Hollywood Leek specialize in satirical articles about celebrities and Hollywood entertainment news. Sometimes fake news reporters influence real world politics, like Citizen Kate whose 90 episodes covered the 2008 presidential campaign trail, she commissioned a butter bust of Obama presented to him by the Butter Cow Lady of Iowa, making international headlines. El Koshary Today is an Egyptian website that carries fake international news stories. Other satire sites attempt to emulate a genuine news source of some sort; however, these sites now take a variety of forms. Because interesting stories are often emailed and can quickly become separated from their point of origin, it is not uncommon for news satire stories to be picked up as real by the media, as happened with a Faking News story about a lawsuit against Axe by an Indian man after having failed to attract a girl. Additionally, a parody post on Al Sharpton's parody News Groper blog was quoted as if real by MSNBC. Another satire publication, The Giant Napkin, published an article about a man literally fighting his house fire with more fire, a story taken seriously by several social networking sites. That Google News accepts news satire sources helps contribute to this phenomenon; while Google News does mark such stories with a \\"satire\\" tag, not all readers notice the tag; moreover, sometimes satirical sources may not carry the tag. At least one site, thespoof.com, relies on user-generated content in a Web 2.0 manner. Some websites like Literally Unbelievable post the genuine and shocked reactions of individuals who believe the satirical articles are real. The reactions are taken from social media websites, such as Facebook, in which users can directly comment on links to the article's source. Multi-author Indian website News That Matters Not, launched in November 2009, won a Manthan South Asia Award for socially responsible e-content (Digital Inclusion for Development), organized by Digital Empowerment Foundation. In India, several community-based news satire websites have crept up in recent times. Their popularity on Facebook defines that they are popular amongst the masses. Very new websites such as The Scoop Times, Fakekhabar.com, Sunkey.co.in and The UnReal Times also claim to be run by students, and were covered in The Times of India in July 2011. A plethora of news satire sites participate in a hosted community site, which additionally runs its own satire news feed on HumorFeed. HumorFeed is notable for its relatively high standards of admission and active community involvement. At present, over 60 sites are contributing members, at least eight of which have published books and two of which publish regular hard-copy periodicals. Several HumorFeed members also run Check Please!, an online journal devoted to the serious examination of online satire, ranging from its role in relation to actual journalism to practical considerations of producing an online satire site. In July 2009, a satire piece about Kanye West published on the website ScrapeTV was picked up by numerous media outlets and reported as factual, despite disclaimers on the site. Satirical Twitter accounts of news sources are popular, and they are often mistaken as legitimate sources. Online publications have made quizzes challenging users to distinguish between the tweets of the real Vice and the tweets of their parodies. The @Salondotcom parody account confused so many Twitter users that the real Salon.com reported them for impersonation. In Pakistan, Khabaristan Times (KT) is a renowned satire and parody website with its commentary on Pakistani politics and the military. In 2015, a satirical piece by the website went viral and international media outlets including New York Times reported the story as if it were true. In 2017, KT was reportedly blocked in Pakistan, however, it appeared to be available to users outside Pakistan. In the Middle East, The Pan-Arabia Enquirer is the most widely read satirical news website. It gained notoriety in 2013 when an article about Emirates launching shisha lounges on its fleet of A380s was picked up as fact by news websites around the world. , another middle eastern satire news publisher, has gained publicity in the region when they published an article about the Jordanian police arresting Santa Claus and confiscating all of his gifts for not paying the customs before entering Jordan.\\"The Pan-Arabia Enquirer: home of Middle Eastern political satire\\". The Guardian, 2013-08-12. In Turkey, Zaytung has become a source of mass reading since the socio-political Gezi Park 2013 protests in Turkey. In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago-based website Wired868 has two satirical columnists under the pseudonyms Mr Live Wire and Filbert Street, who comment satirically on relevant political and news stories such as the fall from power of ex-FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, media issues, general news and the challenges faced by former Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar and her People's Partnership coalition Government. In Australia, there are numerous satirical news websites including The Damascus Dropbear (Christian satire), The Shovel, The Betoota Advocate, The (Un)Australian, The Fault Report, The Sauce and The Tunnel Presents. The Shovel mainly satirizes the Australian political and social culture and The Betoota Advocate satirizes the political right and Australian journalism. In February 2015, The Betoota Advocate shot to fame after the publication's editor's sneaked in to the media scrum outside Parliament House in Canberra during a leadership spill motion and managed to interview some of Australia's most high-profile media personalities and politicians, posing as legitimate journalists. The fallout from The Betoota Advocate stunt has led to a security increase surrounding parliamentary media and screening of all crew. The Fault Report was established in 2014 and also has a political editorial focus. British-born Australian author John Birmingham once described The Fault Report as, \\"Like The Onion. But with Vegemite\\", on his blog Cheeseburger Gothic. The Tunnel Presents, which has been online since June 2011, is by Brisbane-based satire writing team The Tunnel and has political and social satire stories with a Queensland focus. In Italy, the most famous website specialized in mock- journalism is Lercio. Born as a parody of the popular press, but in addition to the tabloid press, its goals are also the domestic and foreign politics. The website was created in the 2012 and the editorial staff is composed of authors who have contributed to La Palestra, a column wanted on his blog by the comedian and satirical author Daniele Luttazzi. In few years Lercio saw the publication of a book with a collection of 2014 best articles. From the same year Lercio it is present on the national radio with a daily strip. Thanks to the many fans the articles are shared on the social network with a good success and, mostly in the beginning of his history, some articles were taken as true by the national press. In Hungary, H√≠rCs√°rda is the number one news satire medium. The site, started in 2010, has drawn public attention after the Hungarian government demanded that an article should be emended that dealt with the then state secretary of education R√≥zsa Hoffmann. The page has since been threatened by various celebrities, but has remained active regardless. Also present in Hungary is K√∂zponti √öjs√°g (Central News), a news satire website of the joke party Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party.

In the game, players take the role of a slimy puddle of liquid and face off against various enemies and obstacles. Plot The game starts at a chemical plant known as \\"The Corporation,\\" with scientist Dr. Daniel Caine sneaking into the research lab where he worked, in order to find evidence that crimes were being committed using a toxic gas he created. Caine discovers that his colleagues are planning \\"Operation: Omega\\": a plan to release a plague upon the populace, and make a fortune because they hold the only cure. However, the Director of The Corporation discovers Caine in the lab. Caine is disposed of by means of chemical waste, but the chemicals do not kill him; instead, they alter him into the angry, sentient, formless creature known as \\"The Ooze\\". Swearing revenge, the doctor seeks two things: his former colleagues, and to assume his human form once again. He must now find the DNA helices scattered throughout the wasteland or else end up imprisoned in the Director's lava lamp. Gameplay Players control Dr. Caine as a puddle of ooze with a head, who can move around and use two attacks. One is stretching out a maneuverable sliver of ooze whose length is only limited by how much ooze he currently has to attack. Players can also spit gobs of ooze, which reduces the size of the ooze. Enemy attacks deplete the size of the ooze puddle as well, and the Ooze will die either if he becomes very small or if his head is attacked directly. He can also die by dropping off the edges of certain areas, or staying on a drain for too long. Numerous puzzles must be completed in order to progress from one level to another. An optional goal of the game is finding and collecting all 50 helices, in order to see the game's good ending. Development and releases Dave Sanner of Sega Technical Institute, who was also behind the game Sonic Spinball, came up with the concept for The Ooze and was its lead programmer.http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,130091/ The Ooze was originally intended to be bundled with the Sega Nomad, a handheld Mega Drive/Genesis. Instead, the game was released near the end of the Genesis's life cycle. The game was later included as a built-in game for the Arcade Legends Sega Genesis 2 and in the compilation game Sonic Mega Collection Plus. It is also unlockable in the Japanese version of Sonic Mega Collection. Reception The Ooze received mostly negative reviews. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game 3.875 out of 10, commenting that while The Ooze is highly original, the graphics are choppy and the increasing difficulty as the ooze grows makes the game frustrating, slow- paced, and generally not fun. A critic for Next Generation similarly said, \\"After the originality wears off, the game becomes quite blah.\\" Arguing that the game's attempt at an original approach should nonetheless be commended, he gave it three out of five stars. Johnny Ballgame of GamePro gave faint praise to the music and sound effects, but slammed the controls and graphics and concluded, \\"Oozing with mediocrity, this game never delivers anything worthwhile or worth buying.\\"  See also  *Snake (video game) References External links * 1995 video games Action video games Sega Genesis games Sega Technical Institute games Top-down video games Video games developed in the United States Single-player video games Fictional amorphous creatures Video games about revenge Video games with alternate endings ","title":"The Ooze"},{"id":"1771998","text":"Fake news is a type of hoax or deliberate spread of misinformation published in traditional news media or via social media to mislead in order to gain financially or politically.

The Castle of Loarre is a Romanesque Castle and Abbey located near the town of the same name, Huesca Province in the Aragon autonomous region of Spain. It is one of the oldest castles in Spain.  History  The castle was built largely during the 11th and 12th centuries, when its position on the frontier between Christian and Muslim lands gave it strategic importance. The first of the two major building programs began circa 1020, when Sancho el Mayor (r. 1063‚Äì94) reconquered the surrounding lands from the Muslims. A far view of the complex After 1070, Loarre became increasingly important. In 1073, King Sancho Ram√≠rez installed a community of Augustinian canons, and it was from Loarre that he prepared for the conquest of Huesca in 1094. In 1097, however, his successor, Peter I of Aragon and Navarre, donated all the goods of Loarre to a new royal monastery at Montearagon. This evidence suggests that the second major construction program was undertaken between 1073 and 1097, and much building evidently does date from this period. By comparison with other monuments, however, it is also clear that the building and decorative program continued into the 12th century. The location appears in the 2005 epic film Kingdom of Heaven.Cinemareview.com: \\"Kingdom of Heaven - Production Notes\\" Architecture The castle's location on a rocky outcrop affected the layout; it was not possible to have one unified structure, and like many castles, Loarre was a collection of buildings bounded by curtain walls. Originally the internal plan included two towers and a chapel behind several curtain walls. Towards the end of the 11th century, an additional chapel was built in Romanesque style just outside the castle walls. The outermost walls of the castle and their eight towers were erected in the 13th or 14th century. The church and castle have been the subject of numerous restorations, a major one in 1913 and subsequent ones, particularly during the 1970s, have resulted in the rebuilding of many walls and towers that had fallen into disrepair. At least three towers, two of which survive, the keep (Torre del Homenaje) and the \\"Tower of the Queen\\" (Torre de la Reina), as well as a chapel dedicated to Saint Mary of Valverde and connecting walls are attributed to this campaign. The keep was built in an isolated position in front of the fortifications, to which it was connected by a wooden bridge. It contained a basement and five floors. The Torre de la Reina, comprising a basement and three floors, is particularly noteworthy for three sets of twin- arched windows, with columns of exaggerated entasis and trapezoidal capitals that have been related to both Lombard and Mozarabic architectural forms. The chapel is composed of a single-cell nave with an eastern apse covered by a semicircular vault. The original timber roof of the nave was replaced by a vault at the end of the 11th century.

The Act was the first mandatory federal safety standards for motor vehicles. The Act created the National Highway Safety Bureau (now National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). The Act was one of a number of initiatives by the government in response to increasing number of cars and associated fatalities and injuries on the road following a period when the number of people killed on the road had increased 6-fold and the number of vehicles was up 11-fold since 1925. The reduction of the rate of death attributable to motor-vehicle crashes in the United States represents the successful public health response to a great technologic advance of the 20th century‚Äîthe motorization of America.  History  Systematic motor-vehicle safety efforts began during the 1960s. In 1960, unintentional injuries caused 93,803 deaths;National Safety Council. Accident facts, 1998 edition. Itasca, Illinois: National Safety Council, 1998. 41% were associated with motor-vehicle crashes. In 1966, after Congress and the general public had become thoroughly horrified by five years of skyrocketing motor-vehicle-related fatality rates, the enactment of the Highway Safety Act created the National Highway Safety Bureau (NHSB), which later became the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The systematic approach to motor-vehicle-related injury prevention began with NHSB's first director, William Haddon.Committee on Injury Prevention and Control, Institute of Medicine. Reducing the burden of injury: advancing prevention and treatment. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1999. Haddon, a public health physician, recognized that standard public health methods and epidemiology could be applied to preventing motor-vehicle-related and other injuries. He defined interactions between host (human), agent (motor vehicle), and environmental (highway) factors before, during, and after crashes resulting in injuries. Tackling problems identified with each factor during each phase of the crash, NHSB initiated a campaign to prevent motor- vehicle-related injuries. In 1966, passage of the Highway Safety Act and the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act authorized the federal government to set and regulate standards for motor vehicles and highways, a mechanism necessary for effective preventionTransportation Research Board. Safety research for a changing highway environment. Washington, D.C.: National Research Council, Transportation Research Board, 1990; special report no. 229. The Highway Safety Act resulted in the national adoption of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, while the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act led to the national adoption of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Many changes in both vehicle and highway design followed this mandate. Vehicles (agent of injury) were built with new safety features, including head rests, energy-absorbing steering wheels, shatter-resistant windshields, and safety beltsRice DP, MacKenzie EJ, Jones AS, et al. The cost of injury in the United States: a report to Congress. San Francisco, California: University of California, Institute of Health and Aging; Johns Hopkins University, Injury Prevention Center, 1989. Roads (environment) were improved by better delineation of curves (edge and center line stripes and reflectors), use of breakaway sign and utility poles, improved illumination, addition of barriers separating oncoming traffic lanes, and guardrails.CDC/National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Position papers from the Third National Injury Control Conference: setting the national agenda for injury control in the 1990s. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, CDC, 1992. The results were rapid. By 1970, motor-vehicle-related death rates were decreasing by both the public health measure (deaths per 100,000 population) and the traffic safety indicator (deaths per VMT). Changes in driver and passenger (host) behavior also have reduced motor-vehicle crashes and injuries. Enactment and enforcement of traffic safety laws, reinforced by public education, have led to safer behavior choices. Examples include enforcement of laws against driving while intoxicated (DWI) and underage drinking, and enforcement of seat belt, child safety seat, and motorcycle helmet use laws.Graham JD. Injuries from traffic crashes: meeting the challenge. Annu Rev Publ Health 1993;14:515-43. Government and community recognition of the need for motor- vehicle safety prompted initiation of programs by federal and state governments, academic institutions, community-based organizations, and industry. NHTSA and the Federal Highway Administration within the U.S. Department of Transportation have provided national leadership for traffic and highway safety efforts since the 1960s. The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, established at CDC in 1992, has contributed public health direction.Sleet DA, Bonzo S, Branche C. An overview of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Injury Prevention 1998;4:308-12.National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC. Prevention of motor vehicle-related injuries: a compendium of articles from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 1985-1996. Atlanta, Georgia: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, 1997. State and local governments have enacted and enforced laws that affect motor-vehicle and highway safety, driver licensing and testing, vehicle inspections, and traffic regulations. Preventing motor-vehicle-related injuries has required collaboration among many professional disciplines (such as biomechanics has been essential to vehicle design and highway safety features). Citizen and community-based advocacy groups have played important prevention roles in areas such as drinking and driving and child-occupant protection. Consistent with the public/ private partnerships that characterize motor-vehicle safety efforts, NHTSA sponsors \\"Buckle Up America\\" week, which focuses on the need to secure children in child-safety seats properly at all times. Specific public health concerns =High-Risk Populations= *Alcohol-impaired: From 1982 to 1997, the annual motor-vehicle crash-related fatalities involving alcohol decreased by 39% to approximately 16,000; these deaths accounted for 38.6% of all traffic deaths.National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Traffic safety facts, 1997. Washington, D.C.: Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1998.CDC. Alcohol involvement in fatal motor-vehicle crashes--United States, 1996-1997. MMWR 1998;47:1055-6,1063. Factors that may have contributed to this decline included increased public awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving; new and tougher state laws; stricter law enforcement; an increase in the minimum legal drinking age; prevention programs that offer alternatives such as safe rides (e.g., taxicabs and public transportation), designated drivers, responsible alcohol-serving practices and a decrease in per capita alcohol consumption. *Young drivers and passengers: From 1975 to 1997, motor- vehicle-related fatality rates had decreased 27% for young motor-vehicle occupants (ages 16‚Äì20 years). However, in 1997 the death rate was 28.3 per 100,000 population‚Äîmore than twice that of the U.S. population (13.3 per 100,000 population). Some teenagers are more likely than adult drivers to speed, run red lights, make illegal turns, ride with an intoxicated driver, and drive after drinking alcohol or using drugs.Hingson R, Howland J.

Strategies that had contributed to improved motor-vehicle safety among young drivers included laws restricting purchase of alcohol among underaged youths and some aspects of graduated licensing systems (e.g., nighttime driving restrictions).Foss RD, Evenson KR. Effectiveness of graduated driver licensing in reducing motor vehicle crashes. Am J Prev Med 1999;16(1 suppl):47-56. *Pedestrians: From 1975 to 1997, pedestrian fatality rates decreased 41%, from 4 per 100,000 population in 1975 to 2.3 in 1997 but still account for 13% of motor-vehicle- related deaths. Factors that may have reduced pedestrian fatalities included more and better sidewalks, pedestrian paths, playgrounds away from streets, one-way traffic flow, and restricted on-street parking. =Occupant-Protection Systems= Safety belts: In response to legislation, highly visible law enforcement, and public education, rates of safety belt use nationwide had increased from approximately 11% in 1981 to 68% in 1997 (8). Safety belt use began to increase following enactment of the first state mandatory-use laws in 1984. In 1997, all states except New Hampshire had safety-belt use laws. Primary laws (which allow police to stop vehicles simply because occupants are not wearing safety belts) are more effective than secondary laws (which require that a vehicle be stopped for some other traffic violation).Rivara FP, Thompson DC, Cummings P. Effectiveness of primary and secondary enforced seat belt laws. Am J Prev Med 1999;16(1 suppl):30-9. The prevalence of safety belt use after enactment of primary laws increased 1.5-4.3 times, and motor- vehicle-related fatality rates decreasd 13%-46%. Child-safety and booster seats: All states had passed child passenger protection laws, but these varied widely in age and size requirements and the penalties imposed for noncompliance. Child-restraint used in 1996 was 85% for children aged less than 1 year and 60% for children aged 1‚Äì4 years.National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Research note.

Roughly speaking, it shows that all such groups are similar to the general linear group over a field. They were introduced by the mathematician Jacques Tits, and are also sometimes known as Tits systems. Definition A (B, N) pair is a pair of subgroups B and N of a group G such that the following axioms hold: * G is generated by B and N. * The intersection, H, of B and N is a normal subgroup of N. *The group W = N/H is generated by a set S of elements wi of order 2, for i in some non-empty set I. *If wi is an element of S and w is any element of W, then wiBw is contained in the union of BwiwB and BwB. *No generator wi normalizes B. The idea of this definition is that B is an analogue of the upper triangular matrices of the general linear group GLn(K), H is an analogue of the diagonal matrices, and N is an analogue of the normalizer of H. The subgroup B is sometimes called the Borel subgroup, H is sometimes called the Cartan subgroup, and W is called the Weyl group. The pair (W,S) is a Coxeter system. The number of generators is called the rank. Examples *Suppose that G is any doubly transitive permutation group on a set X with more than 2 elements. We let B be the subgroup of G fixing a point x, and we let N be the subgroup fixing or exchanging 2 points x and y. The subgroup H is then the set of elements fixing both x and y, and W has order 2 and its nontrivial element is represented by anything exchanging x and y. *Conversely, if G has a (B, N) pair of rank 1, then the action of G on the cosets of B is doubly transitive. So BN pairs of rank 1 are more or less the same as doubly transitive actions on sets with more than 2 elements. *Suppose that G is the general linear group GLn(K) over a field K. We take B to be the upper triangular matrices, H to be the diagonal matrices, and N to be the monomial matrices, i.e. matrices with exactly one non-zero element in each row and column. There are n ‚àí 1 generators wi, represented by the matrices obtained by swapping two adjacent rows of a diagonal matrix. *More generally, any group of Lie type has the structure of a BN-pair. *A reductive algebraic group over a local field has a BN-pair where B is an Iwahori subgroup. Properties of groups with a BN pair The map taking w to BwB is an isomorphism from the set of elements of W to the set of double cosets of B; this is the Bruhat decomposition G = BWB. If T is a subset of S then let W(T) be the subgroup of W generated by T: we define and G(T) = BW(T)B to be the standard parabolic subgroup for T. The subgroups of G containing conjugates of B are the parabolic subgroups; conjugates of B are called Borel subgroups (or minimal parabolic subgroups). These are precisely the standard parabolic subgroups. Applications BN-pairs can be used to prove that many groups of Lie type are simple modulo their centers. More precisely, if G has a BN-pair such that B is a solvable group, the intersection of all conjugates of B is trivial, and the set of generators of W cannot be decomposed into two non-empty commuting sets, then G is simple whenever it is a perfect group. In practice all of these conditions except for G being perfect are easy to check. Checking that G is perfect needs some slightly messy calculations (and in fact there are a few small groups of Lie type which are not perfect). But showing that a group is perfect is usually far easier than showing it is simple.

The grape can have a pronounced musky or \\"foxy\\" flavor.J. Robinson, Vines, Grapes & Wines, pg 228, Mitchell Beazley, 1986, Grown predominantly on the East Coast of the United States, this purplish-red grape is a likely cross of the Native American Vitis labrusca and the Vitis vinifera cultivar Semillon. Its exact origins are unclear but it seems to have originated somewhere on the East coast from the Carolinas to Maryland. Catawba played an important role in the early history of American wine. During the early to mid-19th century, it was the most widely planted grape variety in the country and was the grape behind Nicholas Longworth's acclaimed Ohio sparkling wines that were distributed as far away as California and Europe. Catawba is a late-ripening variety, ripening often weeks after many other labrusca varieties and, like many vinifera varieties, it can be susceptible to fungal grape diseases such as powdery mildew.Growing Grapes in the Home Fruit Planting, Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet, accessed 2011-01-14 Origins John Adlum The exact origins and parentage of the Catawba grape are unclear.T. Pinney, A History of Wine in America from the Beginnings to Prohibition, Volume 1, pg 142, University of California Press, 1989, While most sources agree that Major John Adlum was growing the variety at his nursery in Georgetown, Washington, D.C by at least 1823, where he got the cuttings of the vine is unknown with two widowed Maryland women given attribution by different writers. Wine writer Bern Ramey and University of California-Davis viticulture professor Lloyd A. Lider credit Mrs. J. Johnston of Fredericktown, Maryland who wrote to Adlum and said while her late husband always called the grapes \\"Catawba\\", she did not know where he got the original vines from.B. Ramey, The Great Wine Grapes, Catawaba entry (no page numbers in book), University of California-Davis, 1977, ASIN B0006CZP4S Historian Thomas Pinney describes a similar story with Adlum receiving the cuttings in 1819 from a Mrs. Scholl of Clarksburg, Maryland whose late husband grew the grape. Again, the story goes that Mrs. Scholl told Adlum that while her husband always called the grape \\"Catawba\\", she could not recall where the vines came from. It is possible that the source of the Catawba grapes came from the Rose Hill property, in Rockville, Maryland, which was acquired early in the 19th century by Lewis and Eliza Wootton Beall, as part of Eliza's dowry from her father Richard Wootton. It is during their ownership of Rose Hill that grapes were first cultivated on their property. The remnants of these grapes are still evident in the sole surviving grapevine that runs eastward from the side of the barn towards the Rose Hill Mansion. According to J. Thomas Scharf, the presence of Catawba grapevines at Rose Hill can be traced back to the early decades of the 19th century.Scharf. J. Thomas, History of Western Maryland, pg 722, Baltimore: Regional Publishing Company, 1968 (reprint of 1882 edition) Cuttings of the Catawba grape, first discovered in western North Carolina around 1801, are believed to have been transported to Montgomery County before 1816, when they were left by a traveler with Jacob Scholl, an innkeeper in Clarksburg. They appeared at Rose Hill shortly thereafter when Eliza Beall obtained some cuttings from her brother Singleton Wootton, who had, in turn, gotten them from Scholl.Inventory of Historic Properties From Maryland Historical Trust, Addendum to Inventory No. M: 26/8, Rose Hill Farm/Bullard Mansion Historic District, pg 4, Maryland Historical Trust, 2003 The Catawba grape is one of the earliest Native American grapes used in wine production, but can also be eaten or made into grape juice, jam, or jelly. The Vitis International Variety Catalogue gives credit to the Scholls and describes Catawba as a crossing of the North American species Vitis labrusca with the European species Vitis vinifera and list 1819 as its likely introduction.Catawba , Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2011-01-14 The Oxford Companion to Wine states the vine was identified in North Carolina even earlier, in 1802, but does not state who discovered the variety.J. Robinson (ed.), The Oxford Companion to Wine, Third Edition, pg 144, Oxford University Press, 2006, British wine expert Oz Clarke also places the vine's origins in North Carolina but claims that it was first identified in 1801.Oz Clarke, Encyclopedia of Grapes, pg 59, Harcourt Books, 2001, The possible Carolina origins does correspond with circumstantial details about the name \\"Catawba\\". In the Carolinas there is the Catawba River that flows through the historical territory of the Catawba people who populated an area that extended from the western Piedmont of North Carolina across the South Carolina border. History Nicholas Longworth From its obscure origins, the Catawba grape began appearing on nursery inventory lists across the United States and soon became a major grape in the growing American wine industry. From 1825 to 1850, it was the most widely planted grape in the United States. One early adopter was Nicholas Longworth of Cincinnati, Ohio who founded America's first commercially successful winery.T. Baiocchi, \\"Vintage America: A Brief History of Wine in America\\", Eater magazine, Jan 3, 2011 After difficulties cultivating the Alexander, Longworth purchased Catawba cuttings from Major Adlum and planted a vineyard along the Ohio River. After accidentally stumbling upon sparkling wine production in his winery, Longworth began producing a sparkling Catawba modeled after the wines of Champagne.N. Barber, L. Hutchins, T. Dodd, A HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN WINE INDUSTRY, pg 25-28, Technical Report, No. 07-02, Texas Wine Marketing Research Institute, Texas Tech University, June 2007 From the 1830s through the 1850s, Longworth's still and sparkling Catawba were being distributed from California to Europe where it received numerous press accolades. In the 1850s, a journalist from The Illustrated London News noted that the still white Catawba compared favorably to the hock wines of the Rhine and the sparkling Catawba \\"transcends the Champagnes of France\\".K. Brewster, \\"Red White and Bubbly\\", The Pittsburgh Press, Dec. 15, 1991 The wines were also well received at home in the United States where Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published a poem dedicated to Nicholas Longworth titled Ode to Catawba Wine. The popularity of Longworth's wine encouraged a flurry of plantings along the Ohio River Valley and up north to Lake Erie and Finger Lakes region of New York. So influential was Longworth's Catawba wine that newspapers began referring to him as \\"the founder of wine culture in America, author of sparkling Catawba.\\"T. Kilman, The Wild Vine: A Forgotten Grape and the Untold Story of American Wine, pg 102, Clarkson Potter, 2010, Longworth was a fervent champion of Catawba, particularly grown in the Ohio River Valley, as a grape that he believed would lead the American wine industry for years to come. Prior to his sparkling Catawba, no other American wine had received the level of critical acclaim in Europe that his wines received. In the American journal Culture of the Grape and Manufacture of Wine, Longworth wrote in 1847, \\"The day is not distant, when the Ohio River will rival the Rhine, in the quantity and quality of its wine. I give the Catawba preference over all other grapes, for a general crop, for wine.\\" The year 1859 was Catawba's peak in the Ohio wine industry, with the state being the largest producer in the United States, producing more than of wine from acres of mostly Catawba vines. But the 1860s brought an end to the enthusiasm when powdery mildew decimated Catawba plantings and the economic turmoil of the American Civil War led to many vineyards being pulled up or abandoned. Another labrusca variety, the Concord developed in 1849 in Concord, Massachusetts by Ephraim Wales Bull soon eclipsed Catawba in plantings and ended its dominance of the American wine industry. Description and viticulture Like many Vitis labrusca varieties, the Catawba grapevine has large leaves that can be mono-lobed or moderately three-lobed with the slightly smaller leaves that are closer to the apical meristem of the vine shoot. The upper surface of the leaves have a medium green color with a leathery texture while the underside has dense white tomentum (wooly hairs). The vine produces moderate size clusters that are nearly cylindrical and fairly compact. The large berries have an oval shape with what Bern Ramey describes as'\\"a dull purplish-red with a lilac-colored bloom\\". The Catawba has the characteristic labrusca \\"slip-skin\\" which is thick but slides easily off between the fingers, leaving the pulp intact. Like many vinifera varieties, Catawba is susceptible to both downy and powdery mildew. The Catawba is a hardy vine that can handle the severe continental climate of the Eastern United States which includes hot, humid summers and cold winters. However, the vine is a late ripening variety, usually one to two weeks later than other labrusca varieties like Concord and Delaware which means that it is susceptible to harvest time hazards that can come in locations with short growing seasons before incremental winter weather sets in. The possible vinifera parentage also means that the Catawba has a higher susceptibility to various grape diseases, like powdery and downy mildew, than typical labrusca varieties. =Pink Catawba= In the 1940s, French-American viticulturalist Charles Fournier discovered a clonal mutation of Catawba in his Finger Lake vineyards that had less pigmentation in skin and could produce a lighter ros√© wine than the usual Catawba variety. Fournier decided to use this variety, named Pink Catawba, in his New York sparkling wine from Gold Seal Vineyards. In 1950, this sparkling pink Catawba was the first non-California wine to win a gold medal at the wine tasting competition of the California State Fair.A. Smith, The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, pg 629, Oxford University Press, USA, 1st Edition, 2007, Wine regions Photographic plate of Catawba grape from the book The Grapes of New York, 1908 by Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick The Catawba grape can still be found throughout the Midwest and Eastern United States, though its numbers are not very large due to the prevalence of more recent French-American hybrid varieties and increased plantings of Vitis vinifera in area suitable for its cultivation. The areas with the largest concentration of plantings are the Lake Erie and Finger Lakes wine region, but Catawba can also be found in Arkansas, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina and Washington. Winemaking and wine styles In favorable locations that can accommodate the grape's late ripening, Catawba can produce a medium bodied wine with moderate acidity and enough sugars to produce off-dry to dry styles of wine. Though the grape is technically considered a \\"red wine\\" grape, Catawba actually produces ros√©s of varying shades of pink and white wines because the concentration of anthocyanins in the grapes is very low and they contribute little color during maceration. Similarly, the low amount of phenols from the skins also means that Catawba wines are very low in tannins and extract. Winemakers wishing to produce a darker Catawba can use thermovinification, with heat breaking down some of the coloring compounds from the skin, but that can have an effect on the overall flavor profile of the wine. The flavor of Catawba can have varying degrees of \\"foxiness\\", which refers to the earthy and musky aromas commonly associated with Vitis labrusca varieties. While European tasters, such as Oz Clarke and Jancis Robinson,J. Robinson, Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes, pg 45, Oxford University Press, 1996, often describe the level of foxiness as \\"distinctive\\", American writers such as Ramey note that Catawba wines usually fall somewhere in the middle between Concord and vinifera when it comes to foxy aromas.

The couple immigrated to the United States from Europe and worked on books that focused on history such as Abraham Lincoln, which won the 1940 Caldecott Medal. They were part of the group of immigrant artists composed of Feodor Rojankovsky, Roger Duvoisin, Ludwig Bemelmans, Miska Petersham and Tibor Gergely, who helped shape the Golden Age of picture books in mid-twentieth-century America. Background Edgar Parin, originally of Swiss citizenship, was born in Munich, Germany to an Italian portrait painter Gino Parin and Ella Auler, a talented artist and musician who had moved from St. Louis to Paris. His parents separated when Parin was six years old and he grew up spending time with each, travelling around Europe with his father. Edgar Parin took his mother's maiden name when she changed it from Auler to d'Aulaire. After studying architecture for a year in Munich, he began art studies at its School of Arts and Crafts (German:Kunstgewerbeschule). Edgar, a pupil of Hans Hofmann and Henri Matisse,\\"D'Aulaires' Book of Trolls\\" (2006 edition). Random House Canada. studied fresco in Florence, painted murals in France and Norway, and exhibited in Paris, Berlin and Oslo. He illustrated many books in Germany from 1922 to 1926 and painted frescoes in Norway from 1926 to 1927. Ingri Mortenson was born in Kongsberg, Norway into an artistic family. Her uncle, for instance, was a clergyman and poet who translated the Icelandic Eddas into Norwegian and set his own poetry to music by Edvard Grieg. When she was 15, the Norwegian painter Harriet Backer encouraged her to pursue art as a career, and Ingri later studied at art schools in Norway, Germany and France. Ingri and Edgar met in Munich when Ingri was an art student.\\"Contributor biographical information for The two cars\\". New York Review Books. 2007. Hosted by the Library of Congress (LC) Online Catalog. They were married in 1925. A modest insurance settlement following a near-fatal bus‚Äìtrolley collision in Paris provided the seed money for Edgar's steerage-class voyage to the U.S. to scout for opportunities. He garnered enough commissions illustrating books to send for Ingri and they moved into a cold-water walk-up flat in Brooklyn in 1929. At first they pursued separate careers. Edgar concentrated on illustrating books using wood block engravings and stone lithography; Ingri garnered commissions to paint portraits of prominent businessmen. Their work caught the eye of the director of the New York Public Library. Acting on her suggestion, the d'Aulaires decided to turn their talents to children's books and collaborated to create The Magic Rug in 1931. Shortly thereafter they became U.S. citizens. They lived and worked in Wilton, Connecticut, from 1941 until their deaths in the 1980s. They also had a farm in Royalton, Vermont. Literary works Many of the d'Aulaires' early books depict the scenery and folktales of Norway: Ola, Children of the Northlights, East of the Sun and West of the Moon. Later their attention shifted to their adopted country and they produced books about American folk heroes such as Pocahontas, Benjamin Franklin, and Buffalo Bill. Using their research and travel experiences as inspiration, the husband-and-wife team produced 27 illustrated books for children including many picture books. Edgar illustrated Children of the Soil: A Story of Scandinavia by Nora Burglon, who was a 1932 Newbery Medal runner-up for that work. The d'Aulaires won the third annual Caldecott Medal in 1940 for Abraham Lincoln, a picture-book life of the 16th U.S. President. They won the 1953 Boy's Club award for their version of Buffalo Bill (1952). Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths, published by Doubleday in 1962, was an elaborately illustrated compendium of Greek mythology, 192 pages in 46 chapters.\\"Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire's Book of Greek myths\\" (first edition).

Most live in top 10 m of the ocean and are less than 1 cm long. The monophyly of Pteropoda is the subject of a lengthy debate; they have even been considered as paraphyletic with respect to cephalopods. Current consensus, guided by molecular studies, leans towards interpreting the group as monophyletic. Pteropoda encompasses the two clades Thecosomata, the sea butterflies, and Gymnosomata, the sea angels. The Thecosomata ( \\"case-body\\") have a shell, while the Gymnosomata (\\"naked body\\") do not. The two clades may or may not be sister taxa; if not, their similarity (in that they are both pelagic, small, and transparent, and both groups swim using wing-like flaps (parapodia) which protrude from their bodies) may reflect adaptation to their particular lifestyle.  Taxonomy  The group Pteropoda was established by Georges Cuvier as \\"'\\" in 1804.M√©moire sur l'Hyale et Ie Pneumoderme; Ann. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris., 4 p. 232) Fran√ßois P√©ron and Charles Alexandre Lesueur thought the group to be larger, and so they also included the opisthobranch taxa (Phyllirho√´ and Glaucus), the heteropoda taxa (Carinaria and Firola), and even the Ctenophora (Callianira). In 1810 these authors divided the whole group in two separate groups: those with a shell and those without a shell. In 1824 Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville named these two groups Gymnosomata and Thecosomata and named the combining order Aporobranchia instead of Pteropoda.Diet. d. Sci. Nat., t. xxxii. p. 271. He rejected the additional genera, except Phyllirho√´ which he upgraded to a third group that he called Psilosomata. Only much later was Phyllirho√´ classified within the order Nudibranchia. Other attempts were made to describe the Pteropoda. John Edward Gray divided the Pteropoda into Dactylobranchia (with just the genus Cavolinia) and Pterobranchia (including all the other genera).London Medical Repository, p. 235, 1821. Cuvier (and his followers) did not accept the classification by de Blainville; they preferred the original classification as described in '. In 1829 Paul Rang followed the Cuvierian classification, but tried to include the character of having a distinct head or not.Manuel de l‚Äôhistoire naturelle des mollusques et leurs coquilles The German naturalist Lorenz Oken went one step further and, for the sake of symmetry, wanted each order to contain four families and each family to contain four genera.Description d'un genre nouveau de la classe des Pt√©ropodes, Ann. d. &i.; Nat., ser. 1, t. V. p. 284, 1825. Pierre Andr√© Latreille divided the Pteropoda according to the size of their fins: \\"'\\" (including only Pneumonoderma) and \\"'\\" (including all the others). In 1851 William Bullock Clark treated the Pteropoda as a family and emended the spelling to Pteropodidae (a name now used for a family of fruit bats) Finally all these attempts were abandoned and, as more and more species were described as a result of several scientific expeditions, the classification of the Pteropoda into Thecosomata and Gymnosomata was generally adopted. Many of these new species were first described by French zoologists, for example Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard, Paul Rang, Alcide d'Orbigny and Louis Fran√ßois Auguste Souleyet. The relationship between these two clades is not unequivocally established, but it seems that they are sister taxa.  Phylogeny   Vulnerability to ocean acidification  Unhealthy pteropod showing effects of ocean acidification A study was conducted on the West Coast of the United States to see ocean acidification‚Äôs effects on pteropods. Limacina helicina was used to test the sensitivity to decreasing pH. This species of pteropod is potentially vulnerable to the corrosive waters associated with ocean acidification due to their calcium carbonate shell. The shell of a pteropod was immersed in ocean water with the projected pH level that the water will reach by the year 2100. After a month and a half in the water, the shell had almost completely dissolved. Distribution Pteropods are found in all major oceans, usually below the ocean surface and in all levels of latitude. Pteropods can be found lower than 10 meters, but in less amounts in terms of biomass, however pteropod distribution is more spread out deeper based on findings. This can be explained as Pteropods from tropical areas become more common in deeper areas. They are not found commonly in the deep sea, in fact, few live lower than 500 meters below sea level. Continental shelves, areas containing many opportunities for nutrients, and productivity are locations in which Pteropods are usually populous, according to patterns in data. Springtime is a peak season for pteropoda, as they reach higher populations, though data shows that pteropoda south of the equator are less abundant seasonally. In addition, current data suggests that, 93% of the world's pteropods are part of the Thecosomata family, while the 7% are Gymnosomata.

As of 2011, the population was 5,135. Geography New Minas borders the town of Kentville to the west and the unincorporated community of Greenwich to the east. The town of Wolfville is further east on the other side of Greenwich. New Minas is approximately 100 km northwest of Halifax. The village is located along the south bank of the Cornwallis River occupying the lower slopes of the South Mountain. Nova Scotia's Highway No. 1 runs through the village forming the main street. History New Minas was founded in 1682 by Acadians from the Grand Pr√© area, the largest of the settlements known as Les Mines or Minas after the French copper mines explored at Cape d'Or at the entrance to the Minas Basin in the 1600s.C. Bruce Fergusson, \\"New Minas\\", Place-Names and Places of Nova Scotia Nova Scotia Archives (1967), p. 478 As the Minas settlement grew, families moved westward up the Cornwallis River led by Pierre Terriot and founded a new settlement which came to be known to English surveyors as \\"New Minas\\". The Acadians knew their settlement as St. Antoine.\\"New Minas Historic Signs St. Antoine 1682\\" Nova Scotia's Electronic Scrapbook It was built beside a tidal island in the bend of the river, later known as Oak Island. They repeated the pattern of the Grand Pr√© settlement by connecting dykes to Oak Island to turn tidal marshland into productive farmland. The settlement grew to include a mill, chapel and burial ground at Oak Island. However the Acadians were expelled and the settlement was destroyed during the Bay of Fundy Campaign of the Acadian Expulsion in 1755. New England Planters resettled the area in 1760s as part of Horton Township but built their farms further from the river along the Old Post Road, later Nova Scotia's Highway No. 1. New Minas was the site of one of the first accounts of a UFO sighting in North America on October 12, 1796. The diary of a merchant in Liverpool, Nova Scotia named Simeon Perkins reported that stories were circulating of ships flying in the air which \\"were said to be seen at one Mr. Ratchfords in New Minas\\" by a young woman and two men who at sunrise saw as many as fifteen ‚Äúships in the air ... and a man forward with his hand stretched out.‚Äù Perkins continued, \\"the story did not obtain universal credit but some people believed it.\\"Simeon Perkins, Diary of Simeon Perkins 1790-1796 Champlain Society, C.B. Ferguson ed, Vol. III, p. 431 New Minas remained a predominantly farming and agricultural community between the towns of Kentville and Wolfville. The Dominion Atlantic Railway operated a gravel quarry at Oak Island in New Minas and served a growing number of food and bulk feed plants at New Minas in the mid 19th Century.\\"New Minas\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Institute However development increased with the construction of the Highway 101 expressway in the 1970s. With the village's low tax rate and the location between the population centres of Kentville and Wolfville, New Minas soon saw a shopping centre and numerous big box retail outlets and fast food shops established to make the village the retail centre for the eastern Annapolis Valley. Recent history Over the past ten years, New Minas has been witness to a commercial boom which has seen many large retail outlets set up shop, while pre-existing retailers and many others have rebuilt into larger venues. One of the woes of the village is its heavy concentration of minimum-wage, service industry jobs. Other similarly sized communities nearby have a much wider range of income opportunities: Wolfville is an area supported by higher-education jobs with Acadia University, and Kentville is an area who supports itself with an industrial park, hospital and an orientation toward professional centers. Due to New Minas having no hospital of its own, citizens must travel to Kentville by way of public transit or by use of their own vehicles to go to the hospital. In recent years, New Minas has been lampooned by many of its citizens and tourists as having notoriously poor side-roads. However, in the last 2‚Äì3 years, the Village of New Minas has been working on coercing the Province of Nova Scotia to focus on repairing these roads. New Minas played host to the film crew of the popular television show Call Me Fitz. Where the filming took place used to be the old home of the local Kia Motors, but the local branch had moved to the other end of the town, so the showroom was converted into Fitzpatrick Motors. Recently, a rotary was installed in the middle of New Minas to accommodate the increasing number of businesses and the new highway off-ramp from the nearby Highway 101 which is still under construction as of December 2018.

Boston Directory. 1855 by activist Eli Thayer in the wake of the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act, which allowed the population of Kansas Territory to choose whether slavery would be legal. The Company's ultimate purpose was to transport anti-slavery immigrants into the Kansas Territory. The Company believed that if enough anti-slavery immigrants settled en masse in the newly-opened territory, they would be able to shift the balance of political power in the territory, which in turn would lead to Kansas becoming a free state (rather than a slave state) when it eventually joined the United States.Eli Thayer. The New England Emigrant Aid Company, and its influence, through the Kansas contest, upon national history. Worcester, Mass.: F. P. Rice, 1887 The New England Emigrant Aid Company is noted less for its direct impact than for the psychological impact it had on pro-slavery and anti-slavery elements. Thayer's prediction that the Company would eventually be able to send 20,000 immigrants a year never came to fruition, but it spurred Border Ruffians from nearby Missouri, where slavery was legal, to move to Kansas to ensure its admission to the Union as a slave state. That, in turn, further galvanized Free-Staters and enemies of Slave Power. Thayer's intention was to capitalize on anti-slavery sentiment in the Northern United States and to send settlers to Kansas to purchase land and build houses, shops, and mills. They could then sell the land at a significant profit and send the proceeds back to Thayer and his investors. At the behest of several investors, who found the notion of profiting from the anti-slavery cause distasteful, the company's model was shifted to that of a benevolent society, and it was renamed the New England Emigrant Aid Company in 1855. While the company achieved neither a profit nor a significant impact on the population of Kansas, it played an important role in the events that would later be termed Bleeding Kansas. Creation The Company was formed in the midst of the sectional crisis that preceded the American Civil War. To the Northern United States, the concept of popular sovereignty, which stated that the population of each new U.S. state should be allowed to decide if it allowed slavery, was an attempt by Southerners to gain power. When the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act threatened to extend popular sovereignty into the new Kansas Territory, Eli Thayer, a second-term Congressman from Massachusetts, hatched the idea of an Emigrant Aid Company in the winter of 1853‚Äì1854. His primary partners in the venture were Alexander H. Bullock and Edward Everett Hale, and together, they set Thayer's plans in motion on March 5, 1854. Thayer announced the Company at a rally against the impending passage of the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act in Worcester on March 11. Shortly thereafter, the Company's charter was approved by the Massachusetts Legislature for up to $5,000,000 in capital.Thayer (1889), pp. 15-25. Officially, the Company was a profit-making venture, and how the settlers voted was of no consequence to the company. For example, the company secretary, Thomas Webb released a pamphlet in 1855 stating that although the settlers sent to the territories would not be required to vote for one side or the other, they were expected to support the free-state movement. A number of abolitionists questioned the profit motive behind the company, and even many of Thayer's potential investors balked at the notion \\"that people might say we were influenced by pecuniary considerations in our patriotic work.\\" Although Thayer personally disagreed with such hesitations, in 1855 the Company reorganized as a benevolent society and changed its name to the New England Emigrant Aid Company.Davis (1984), pp. 40‚Äì41. Reaction The success of the endeavor prompted other aid assistance companies to form back East, in New York and Ohio, with new companies such as the Worchester Country Emigrant Aid Society. Impact The company was directly responsible for creating the Kansas towns of Lawrence and Manhattan, and it played a key role in founding Topeka and Osawatomie. Lawrence was named after the Company secretary, Amos Adams Lawrence. Multiple politicians were found in the emigrants who left for Kansas, such as Daniel Read Anthony, Charles L. Robinson, Samuel C. Pomeroy, and Martin F. Conway, who would later be Kansas's first US Representative. The exact number of people who left for Kansas is unknown. James Rawley puts the numbers somewhere around 2000, about a third of whom returned home,Rawley (1979), p. 85. but the Kansas Historical Society puts the number at around 900 for those who left for Kansas in 1855 alone. The Company's mission was ultimately successful, and Kansas entered the United States as a free state in 1861.

Playing career Whittaker was born at East Cavalry Barracks, Aldershot, Hampshire, but grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne from the age of three weeks. He spent his early football career in the North East of England as a youth player, whilst training as a marine engineer, later working in that role for Hawthorn Leslie & Co of Tyneside. He was called up to the British Army, signing up for the Royal Garrison Artillery, in 1917, moving to Lydd in Kent, before later switching to the Royal Navy. He was demobilised in 1919. In the meantime, he had continued playing football for his regiment, and after serving his country in World War I, Whittaker forwent his engineering career and joined Leslie Knighton's Arsenal in November 1919. He first played as centre-forward then as wing-half. He signed as a professional in January 1920 and made his debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat away to West Bromwich Albion on 6 April 1920 and became a regular in the side in the 1920s, playing 70 times for the club and scoring two goals. He toured Australia as part of the Football Association side in 1925, but during the tour, in a match in Wollongong he broke his knee cap and was forced to retire from playing. Resolving to carry on in football, he joined Arsenal's coaching staff and entered study as a physiotherapist. He became Arsenal's first team trainer under Herbert Chapman in 1927 (whilst still younger than many of the players on the pitch). Whittaker had an important role under Chapman in reforming the training and physiotherapy regime at the club, and played an essential part in the club's successes of the 1930s. Managerial career After Chapman's death in 1934, Whittaker continued to serve under his successor, George Allison, and also became a trainer for the England national team. The Second World War saw Whittaker work as an ARP warden, before becoming a pilot in the Royal Air Force, achieving the rank of squadron leader. For his service on missions on D-Day, he was awarded an MBE. With the end of the war, Whittaker resumed his role as trainer at Arsenal. After Allison's retirement in 1947, Whittaker became the club's new manager; under him the club won the League in 1947‚Äì48 and 1952‚Äì53 and the FA Cup in 1949‚Äì50. Whittaker sought to attract Blackpool's Stanley Matthews, whom was approached after the Tangerines visit to Highbury in 1954. Since Matthews was already receiving football's maximum wage at Bloomfield Road, he felt there was nothing to be gained by moving south.Matthews, Stanley. The Way It Was: My Autobiography, Headline, 2000 () Matthews, however, stated that he was \\"very happy\\" and politely turned down the offer. \\"Such an approach was against the rules at the time and, consequently, I couldn't tell anyone about it, and I never have until now.\\" Whittaker, while still at the helm of Arsenal, died of a heart attack at the University College Hospital, London in 1956, at the age of 58.

Due to the existence of another band called System Seven they were initially billed as 777 in North America. System 7 was also the name of the current version of the Macintosh operating system at the time, although this was not the reason for the temporary name change. Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy, both formerly of Gong, formed System 7 in 1989, after a period of several years becoming gradually immersed in the developments of electronic and dance in the UK while Steve was working mainly as a record producer for other artists. A key early collaborator was DJ Alex Paterson (of the Orb), whom Steve and Miquette heard playing Hillage's 1979 ambient record Rainbow Dome Musick in an ambient DJ set at the London club Heaven. They soon became part of the underground dance scene in London. While Hillage and Giraudy form the core of System 7, it is an extended collaborative project with artists such as A Guy Called Gerald, Paul Oakenfold, Carl Craig, Laurent Garnier, Derrick May, Alex Paterson, and Youth. System 7 makes extensive use of Hillage's electric guitars. Hillage and Giraudy later launched a chill-out and downtempo sister project called Mirror System, and have also worked under the name Groovy Intent. The first System 7 album was released on Virgin's 10 Records dance music label, followed by the vinyl-only Derrick May collaboration Altitude (featuring Ultra Nat√©). In 1992, System 7 moved to Youth's Butterfly label, releasing four albums, until 1999 when they founded their own label A-Wave for all future releases, also re- releasing their Butterfly catalogue. In addition to the albums, System 7 have released a number of club singles with notable remixes from, among others, Richie Hawtin (aka Plastikman), Dubfire, James Holden, Liquid Soul, and Son Kite.

The first System 7 live show was in December 1990 at Linford Studios in Battersea, London, consisting of Steve playing guitar and Alex Paterson playing samples and DJing pre-release versions of the upcoming first System 7 and Orb albums. In 1991 there were some more shows and a tour to support the System 7 album release, with Miquette's synthesisers incorporated into the live sound. In 1993 System 7, now playing as a duo, developed a new live technical format and joined Orbital, The Drum Club, and Aphex Twin on the Midi Circus tour of the UK with Megadog party crew. = Festivals = Partly through their extended involvement with Megadog, by 1994 System 7 had become an established live act, in particular playing at many music festivals. In 1995, through his previous association with Michael Eavis, Steve Hillage was asked to oversee the putting together of the first official dance music stage at Glastonbury Festival. In subsequent years System 7 played at Glastonbury a further 15 times, often at the open-air Glade stage, a further dance music development at the festival that started in 2000. The crew from the Glastonbury Glade stage created their own spin-off festival, the Glade Festival, starting in 2004, with System 7 playing there 5 times. Other major festivals where they have played include Phoenix Festival, Beach Festival, Wickerman, Willowman, Womad, Sunrise Celebration, Waveform, Whirl-Y-Gig, Guilfest, and Eden Festival (UK); Printemps de Bourges, Borealis and Francofolies (France); Lovefield and Burg Herzberg (Germany); Pink Pop and Lowlands (Netherlands); Dour Festival and I Love Techno (Belgium); Sonica (Italy); Open Air Field (Czech Republic); Odinstown and Roskilde (Denmark); Hultsfred and Arvika (Sweden); Konemetsa (Finland); Indigo Festival (Israel); Ozora (Hungary); Reverence Valada and Boom Festival (Portugal). Outside of Europe they have played at Juggernaut Festival and the Big Top tour (USA); Fuji Rock, Summersonic, Star Festival, Amami Eclipse 2009, Hotaka, Asagiri Jam, Nagisa Festival, Solstice Music Festival and the World Festival of Sacred Music (Japan); Earthcore (Australia); Universo Paralello (Brazil); Tribal Gathering (Panama). = Recent shows = System 7 co-headlined at Matsuri Digital's Timeless event at AgeHa, Tokyo on 14 March 2015, and at the Megadog 30th anniversary event at Manchester Academy on 21 November 2015. They continue to play their own club shows and at parties and festivals, including Glastonbury, Ozora and Boom. They have also been involved in some notable live collaborations with The Orb, Japanese progressive space rock jam band Rovo (Phoenix Rising), Japanese rock guitarist and Juno Reactor collaborator Sugizo, leading psy-trance artist Ajja (Novelty Engine), and Merv Pepler of Eat Static (System Static). = Mirror System Live = System 7's chill-out and downtempo sister project Mirror System made its live debut on the ID Spiral chill-out stage at the UK Sunrise Celebration festival in 2006, followed closely by a set also with ID Spiral at the Glade Festival of that year. In 2007 ID Spiral opened the InSpiral Lounge in Camden. London, and Mirror System played at the opening party on 16 December 2007. They became one of the resident artists at the InSpiral Lounge playing there 2 or 3 times a year, including most of the inSpiral New Year's Eve parties. Mirror System live also became popular in Japan, and at European trance festivals where they have been booked as the chill-out stage closing act at Sonica (twice), Ozora (three times) and Boom Festival, where in 2016 they followed their closing set with a full-length live rendition of Rainbow Dome Musick. With the Reflector DJ mix album (release in 2009) the Mirror System sound expanded to incorporate a soft techno dance groove element, and this element has been further developed in their most recent album N-Port. This ability to seamlessly move from deep chill to danceable grooves that still retain the chill element has been an important factor in the Mirror System live approach. System 7 in Japan Since their first show, at the closing party for Tokyo's On Air club on 4 May 1994 with Orbital and Alex Paterson, System 7 have toured in Japan on twenty-eight further occasions. In addition Steve Hillage went to Japan to play with Manuel G√∂ttsching at Metamorphose Festival (2010) and to play with Tomita at Free Dommune Festival in 2013, plus an additional visit to mix the Phoenix Rising album in February 2013. System 7 have a special relationship with Japan, and have been closely associated with the development of live dance music there. As an extension to this special spiritual connection, System 7 played as the only electronic dance music act at the World Festival of Sacred Music at Itsukujima shrine on Miyajima in 2001, and also offered a h≈çn≈ç (dedicatory) performance at Tenkawa-Daibenzaiten-sha (Tenkawa shrine) in Nara in 2013. In 2006 they were approached by Rumiko Tezuka, the daughter of famed manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka, to see if they were interested in making musical interpretations of her father's seminal Phoenix manga graphic novels. Rumiko had first become interested in System 7 after seeing them perform at the Miyajima festival. This project excited System 7 and it led directly to their album Phoenix (released in Japan in 2007), which became their biggest selling album in Japan and also produced their successful Japanese single Hinotori (which means bird of fire). The phoenix theme, with Rumiko Tezuka's endorsement, continued with System 7's album and tour collaboration with Japanese band Rovo, which was titled Phoenix Rising, and also featured Rovo's live rock re-interpretation of the track Hinotori. Other System 7 recording and remixing collaborations in Japan have been with Mito (of the group Clammbon), Sugizo, and Joujouka, the group founded by noted Japanese psychedelic trance DJ Tsuyoshi Suzuki.

It is a major east‚Äìwest route in the city's Northwest and Northeast quadrants and connects downtown with points east and north of the city via Cheverly, Maryland, the John Hanson Highway, the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway, and eventually Interstate 95. History New York Avenue was planned as one of the original streets in the L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C. It was intended to begin at the Potomac River and extend northeast toward the White House, then continue past the Executive Residence northeast to the boundary of the Federal City. The portion of the street southwest of the White House was to give the President of the United States an uninterrupted view of the river. Construction of the State, War, and Navy Building from 1871 to 1888 blocked this view, and it remains blocked to this day. Originally, it extended to the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, but the construction of Rawlins Park in 1873 destroyed a block of New York Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets NW. Its consolidation with Triangle Park and three other \\"parklets\\" into a \\"Little Mall\\" (in apparent imitation of the nearby National Mall) in 1937 consumed another block between 20th and 21st Streets NW. Construction of the United States Department of War Building (now the Harry S Truman Building, housing the United States Department of State), and an associated park (since January 1959, known as Edward J. Kelly Park) from 1940 to 1941 destroyed the lower three blocks of New York Avenue. Construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Building (which now houses the United States Office of Personnel Management) in 1963 eliminated another block between 19th and 20th Streets NW. This left a single block of New York Avenue NW, between 17th and 18th Streets NW, southeast of the White House. New York Avenue northeast of the White House retains its uninterrupted character. It originally terminated at Boundary Avenue (now Florida Avenue NE, as all city streets did in the L'Enfant Plan. Extensive development occurred beyond Boundary Avenue from 1870 to 1900. Extension of New York Avenue to Bladensburg Road was considered as early as 1899. But no action was taken. The McMillan Plan, a master plan for the capital published in 1901, strongly endorsed extension of the street. But although many portions of the plan were acted on, no road construction occurred. Plans were drawn up in 1903 to extend the street about beyond the \\"city limits\\" to reach the Ivy City development, but these, too, fell through. In 1907, as construction of Union Station was under way, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) created a diversion track (beginning at Ivy City) so that its passenger trains could reach the new station. As part of this effort, the B&O; was required to build a bridge to carry New York Avenue over its new track route, extending New York Avenue to Fourth Street NE. The B&O; built the bridge and extension, but the bridge remained unused for decades. Extensions to Bladensburg Road were debated again in 1908,\\"Three District Bills\\". The Washington Post. February 14, 1908. p. 4. and failed. The right of way was purchased in 1914, and property owners along the street route assessed for construction. But no construction occurred. An extension was proposed to South Dakota Avenue NE in 1925 (after land was purchased to found the United States National Arboretum), but these proposals were not acted on. Construction on New York Avenue Extended finally began in September 1930. The $231,000 ($ in dollars) project created a roadway long from Florida Avenue NE to Bladensburg Road NE. There were no intersections with side streets, and only 4th Street NE merged with it. New York Avenue Extended opened on November 2, 1931. The final section of New York Avenue NE (known as New York Avenue Extended), from Bladensburg Road to the District- Maryland border and the connection with U.S. Route 50, opened in October 1954. The construction of Route 50 was a joint effort of the state of Maryland (which built the northern half) and the federal government (which constructed the southern half). The District of Columbia paid to have New York Avenue extended to the connection. A \\"gateway\\" to the city was proposed at this time, but no gateway was built. This section of the avenue was not well-planned. At the bridge over South Dakota Avenue and the railroad track just a few hundred feet westward, New York Avenue narrowed from three lanes to two, creating major back-ups. View southwest along New York Avenue at Bladensburg Road =Major reconstructions= New York Avenue NW and NE within the boundary of the old Federal City has generally remained in good to excellent condition. The city rebuilt New York Avenue between 9th and 15th Streets NW from 1992 to 1994. New York Avenue NE beyond Florida Avenue NE, however, has had serious degradation issues. This section of the roadway saw only minor repairs until the mid 1980s, when major portions of the road began to fail. In 1987, a complete reconstruction of New York Avenue NE from Bladensburg Road to South Dakota Avenue occurred. The lower portion of the street did not receive major repairs, and by 1990 was listed by the city (along with South Capitol Street) as one of the worst for potholes. In 1995, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) estimated that New York Avenue Extended carried 107,000 vehicles each day. By 1997, this had risen to 135,000 vehicles every day. The road was D.C.'s most heavily trafficked; only the 14th Street Bridge and the Southeast-Southwest Freeway (I-395) were more traveled. It was also the city's most-used commercial corridor, as semi-trailer trucks were twice as likely to use New York Avenue to enter the city than any other street. In the spring of 1998, the city announced a two-year, $24.7 million ($ in dollars) project reconstructed New York Avenue from South Dakota Avenue to the District line. The two bridges which created two-lane traffic jams were replaced and the roadway widened to three lanes in each direction. The ramps connecting South Dakota Avenue with New York Avenue were also replaced. A new roadway design, which incorporated a reinforced concrete road surface, was used on this section of the street. The project also installed new street and traffic lighting and improved storm water drainage. Design and delays in obtaining federal funding kept the project on the ground until March 1999. Traffic barriers were used to create reversible lanes, to alleviate rush hour problems. The work proved more difficult than planned, and was not complete until June 2002. For reasons which remain unclear, the bridge over the railroad tracks near South Dakota Avenue NE was not replaced, and the two-lane bottleneck continued. As the 1999 reconstruction project continued, the section of New York Avenue from South Dakota Avenue to Bladensburg Road was repaved to remove bumpy asphalt. All three inbound lanes were closed at the same time, as the city experimented with what it called a \\"full-bore approach\\" in repaving. Fort Myer Construction handled the $700,000 ($ in dollars) job. The new construction method worked, and the avenue reopened on time three days later. According to a study released in 2005 by the government of the District of Columbia, five of the ten most crash-prone intersections in the city are along New York Avenue. The most crash-prone intersection in the city is at New York Avenue NE and Bladensburg Road NE. Another major bridge, carrying 9th Street NE over New York Avenue, began replacement in April 2009. The 70-year- old structure carried 26,000 vehicles a day. The two-year, $40 million ($ in dollars) project replaced two-lane, wide span with a four-lane, wide structure. Sidewalks were widened from to in width, a median was added, and new crash-resistant railings installed. Delays in other New York Avenue projects allowed the 9th Street NE bridge to begin replacement sooner than expected, and to proceed faster toward completion. Work on New York Avenue occurred again in the spring of 2010. Single lane closures in both directions occurred as repaving occurred from Bladensburg Road to Florida Avenue. A far more major repair effort began 2011, when the 1907 bridge over the railroad tracks between Florida Avenue NE and Penn Street NE was replaced. The job was a complex one, as the bridge also carried electricity, telecommunication cables, and mechanical equipment critical for railroad operations. The project was ready to begin in 2010, but the complexity of the replacement led to a new replace plan which delayed work a year. Lanes closures in 2011 consisted of a single lane in one direction during rush hour, but expanded to two lanes in each direction in 2012. Corridor redevelopment efforts Originally, New York Avenue Extended passed through relatively rural areas, where farms and small, isolated developments were common. But during the road's first 30 years, the area around it transformed into a major industrial corridor. The economic dislocations of the 1970s, however, led to rapid deindustrialization along New York Avenue. By the late 1970s, many industrial businesses along the route were closed or abandoned, and retail was relatively nonexistent. The residents in the surrounding neighborhoods were very poor, unemployment was high, and environmental problems were severe. In 1980, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry announced a major effort to redevelop the New York Avenue Extended industrial and retail corridor. Little action was taken to implement the plan's goals. Barry's successor, Sharon Pratt Dixon, announced another redevelopment effort in late 1993. Once more, redevelopment efforts failed to materialize. Barry defeated Dixon in her attempt to win renomination for mayor, and Barry won the general elected held in November 1994. Barry announced his second effort to redevelop the New York Avenue Extended corridor in July 1995. A more thorough analysis of the corridor found several problems: The roadway was poorly maintained and traffic was far too heavy; the intersection of New York Avenue and Bladensburg Road was a confusing mass of exit and on ramps, medians, and underpasses; poor zoning laws had allowed businesses to erect bright, visually distracting signs; and an excessive number of curb cuts permitted too many motorists to access the road and slow traffic. Barry's plan for the street included plans to induce light manufacturing and blue-collar service businesses to return to the area, adding hundreds of trees to the streetscape to make it more appealing, and reducing traffic congestion. DDOT officials said they were ready to replace the bridge over the railroad tracks near South Dakota Avenue NE but that the city lacked the $16 million ($ in dollars) for the project because federal highway funding had not been forthcoming. DDOT also said it planned to widen the street to four lanes between Bladensburg Road and the District line, and reduce the steepness of the approaches to the overpass over the railroad tracks near Florida Avenue. Business executives said reducing congestion on the road was the key to reviving retail and industry. But once more, little revitalization occurred. In 2002, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams announced yet another New York Avenue Extended redevelopment initiative. Transportation and economic development officials announced that they were studying plans to reduced congestion on New York Avenue by adding more public transit, such as light rail. They also said they would improve the streetscape by adding bicycle paths, widening sidewalks, and planting more trees and shrubs. The city hired six consulting firms, and paid them $900,000 ($ in dollars) to identify additional problems, survey residents, and propose solutions. The 18-month effort was intended to create a New York Avenue master plan that would guide development in the area for the next 30 to 50 years. The most significant issue immediately identifiable facing the street was the anticipated rise in heavy trucks using the road, due to the presence of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms headquarters, and several anticipated big-box stores on the street. Route The Art Deco 1100 New York Avenue building was once a bus depot. Treasury Building and the White House. New York Avenue is U.S. Route 50 from the border with Maryland and into northwest as far west as 6th Street NW. In addition, it is U.S. Route 1 Alternate from Bladensburg Road NE to 6th Street NW. The northern terminus of Interstate 395 is at a signaled intersection with New York Avenue and 4th Street NW. At that intersection, traffic from New York Avenue in either direction may turn south onto Interstate 395, but traffic on northbound Interstate 395 may turn only right (east) onto New York Avenue. At its eastern end, New York Avenue NE becomes the John Hanson Highway (U.S. Route 50 in Maryland). On the east side of Mount Vernon Square, New York Avenue crosses 7th Street NW. At Mount Vernon Square, traffic on New York Avenue mixes with traffic on Massachusetts Avenue NW and K Street NW. East of Mount Vernon Square, New York Avenue is part of the National Highway System. While the main line of New York Avenue extends northeast of the White House, the avenue resumes southwest of the White House to run one block between 17th and 18th Streets NW. At 18th Street NW, New York Avenue joins E Street NW, which leads to the E Street Expressway. That one- block segment of New York Avenue is also part of the National Highway System. =Places of interest= New York Avenue NE is served by the NoMa ‚Äì Gallaudet U Station on the Washington Metro. The $103.7 million ($ in dollars) subway stop opened in 2004 as the New York Ave-Florida Ave-Gallaudet U station. Seven years later, Metro gave the stop a new name, NoMa-Gallaudet U, in an effort to broaden the subway station's appeal. (NoMa stands for \\"North of Massachusetts\\", an area city officials hoped to transform into a hip arts and retail area.) Locations of interest on or near New York Avenue include Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms at 99 New York Avenue NE (which opened in 2008), the main entrance of the National Arboretum (including four relocated U.S. Capitol Gateposts and the National Capitol Columns), the Walter E. Washington Convention Center at New York Avenue and 7th Street NW (which opened in 2003), the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art.

Early life  Bexley was born in either Jamestown, Virginia or Detroit, Michigan to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Bexley. His father was a Bible scholar and teacher, and his mother a classical vocalist. \\"I was born with a flair for the stage, as I had always been a clown ‚Äì even during early adolescence,\\" Bexley wrote in 1983.  Career  In his career, Don Bexley has been an orchestra director, singer, dancer, stand-up comedian, and actor. = Early career = In the early 1940s, Bexley started doing comedy in upstate New York. He worked with Milton Berle, Danny Kaye, and Henny Youngman, and danced with Sammy Davis Jr. Bexley was the first black stand-up comedian to do the hotel circuit in the Borscht Belt. During his travels, he met many black entertainers, including Redd Foxx. They worked in New York City, Philadelphia, and New Jersey. He was also a singer and dancer. Early in his career, he performed with a dance group called Three Shades of Rhythm. Before his television debut, he did theater in Los Angeles and New York City. = Redd Foxx and Sanford and Son = When Bexley returned from Europe in 1969, he and Foxx were cast together in Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970). Upon Bexley's arrival from Asia in 1971, Foxx sent for him to join the sitcom Sanford and Son. Foxx convinced Bud Yorkin and Aaron Ruben to hire Bexley to play one of Fred G. Sanford's friends. At the time, Bexley was 62 years old and never had appeared on television before. Bexley gained popularity for his portrayal as Bubba on the series, a very successful \\"rerun sitcom\\" today. pg. 146 Sanford and Son was an instant hit and remained in the top 10 programs for its entire run from 1972 to 1977. Bexley reprised Bubba in the short-lived sequel Sanford Arms, which had many of the same characters but not Foxx and Demond Wilson. = Later career = He appeared in many television shows such as Cheers, Hunter and Laverne & Shirley as well as the 1976 film Sparkle. One of his later appearances on television was in an episode of Foxx's The Royal Family. In the episode, \\"New Beginnings\\", Bexley made a special guest appearance as an old friend of Al Royal's (Foxx) who attends his funeral. pg. 286 In 1989, Bexley had a sitcom in the works that he had written and would have starred, titled Cee Cashman and 'Yul Stay Broke. It was a story about a Black Jew who owns a pawnshop. Just before his death, Bexley was still writing for stage and television. Clarence Williams, Sr., a friend of Bexley, said the actor had completed several scripts, but he knew of no current plans to produce them.  Later life  In 1989, Bexley was awarded the Outstanding Senior Citizen of the Year award by the Support the Artists of America (STAA) in Orlando, Florida. Since moving to Hampton, Virginia (before that, he resided in the San Fernando Valley) during the 1990s, Bexley was still quite active, always working on new ideas for shows and live performances. Bexley made personal appearances and signed autographs on many occasions, including the Newmarket Fair Day-Talent Show in September 1996, and the Aberdeen Athletic Association in June 1996. One of Bexley's later signings was during his attendance at the NASA Langley Research Center's Black History Program in February 1997. These types of activities added to his longevity.  Personal life and death  Bexley had a close friendship with Redd Foxx until Foxx's death in October 1991. He was an honorary pallbearer at Foxx's funeral in Las Vegas. pg. 284 Their friendship lasted for nearly 50 years. Bexley lived much of his life in Los Angeles, but after injuring his hip, moved to Hampton, Virginia, in 1996 to live with a friend, who served as his caregiver. Bexley died of heart and kidney failure on April 15, 1997 at Hampton Sentara Hospital. He was 87 years old. He is survived by his wife Sally Bexley, daughters Donna and Stacies Marie, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. Filmography * Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970) * What's Up, Doc?

In the course of the war, Hube led the 16th Infantry Division, XIV Panzer Corps, and the 1st Panzer Army rising to the rank of Generaloberst. He died in an air crash on 21 April 1944.  Early career  Hans-Valentin Hube was born on 29 October 1890, in Naumburg an der Saale, German Empire. Hube volunteered for military service in the Prussian Army in 1909, and served during World War I where he saw action during the Race to the Sea, and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and the Knight's Cross of the House Order of Hohenzollern. He had an arm amputated as a result of injuries sustained at the battle of Verdun.http://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2017/11/hans-hube-greatest-german- general.html In 1918, following the end of the war which ended with the German Empire's defeat and subsequent collapse, Hube briefly served with the right- wing Freikorps paramilitary during the instability. Hube joined the Reichswehr, the successor of the Imperial German Army after the establishment of the Weimar Republic, and continued his army service in the Wehrmacht after the founding of Nazi Germany, reaching the rank of Oberst in 1936.  World War II  Hube took part in the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France as a regimental commander. During the war with France he issued a pamphlet to his soldiers stating the deployment of black and colored troops against the German army contradicts the conception of the white race's master role towards the colored people and that it is a shame and dishonor, all the more so because our division has had to wage the hardest fights against the Negroes‚Äù 1The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 2010 John H. Morrow, Jr. Black Africans in World War II: The Soldiers' StoriesHitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers, by Raffael Scheck, page 70 Hube was appointed commander of 16th Infantry Division in June 1940. As commander of the 16th Panzer Division, he took part in Operation Barbarossa as part of Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South. For this action during the campaign, Hube received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. On 16 January 1942, he was awarded the Oak leaves to the Knight's Cross for his actions in the Battle of Kiev. Hube then led the division during Fall Blau and the Battle of Stalingrad. On 16 September 1942, Hube was given command of XIV Panzer Corps, the parent formation of the 16th Panzer Division.Bjorkman, James, \\"Hans Hube, Greatest German General?,\\" Filminspector.com, Retrieved 17 February 2019. Hube commanded the XIVth Corps during the Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Uranus. He was promoted to General der Panzertruppe and received the Swords to the Knight's Cross with Oak leaves from Adolf Hitler personally on 21 December 1942. During his time at the F√ºhrer-Headquarters in Rastenburg, Hube argued strongly, but to no avail, for Hitler to allow the 6th Army to attempt a breakout. Instead, Hitler promised a new relief attack beginning in the middle of February. After the destruction of the 6th Army, Hube was sent to the Mediterranean front. He created Gruppe Hube in Sicily, a four-division force whose task was to defend the island. With the advent of Operation Husky on 10 July, Hube commanded the overall German defence. On 17 July 1943 Hube was given command of all army and Flak troops on the island. Hube organised the evacuation to the Italian peninsula. He had prepared a strong defensive line, the 'Etna Line' around Messina, that would enable the Germans to make a progressive retreat while evacuating large parts of his army to the mainland. George S. Patton began his assault on the line at Troina, but it was a linchpin of the defense and stubbornly held. Despite three 'end run' amphibious landings the Germans managed to keep the bulk of their forces beyond reach of capture, and maintain their evacuation plans. Withdrawing a large number of troops from the threat of capture on Sicily represented a major success for the Axis. Hube later took part in the battles defending positions at Salerno during the Allied Operation Avalanche. Afterwards Hube was moved back to Germany and transferred to the F√ºhrer-Reserve. On 23 October 1943, Hube was designated commander of the 200,000 man 1st Panzer Army, then serving with Army Group South under Field Marshal Erich von Manstein. In February 1944, Hube was officially confirmed as commander of the 1st Panzer Army. Shortly after, III Panzer Corps, one of Hube's units, was required to assist German forces breaking out of the Korsun- Cherkassy pocket. Soon after this, Hube's force was encircled in a pocket near Kamenets-Podolsky. Hube led the breakout which lasted from 27 March 1944 until 15 April 1944.  Death  G√ºnther von Kluge, Heinrich Himmler, Karl D√∂nitz and Wilhelm Keitel (from left to right) at Hube's funeral On 20 April 1944, Hube returned to Germany where Adolf Hitler personally awarded him the Diamonds to the Knight's Cross, one of just 27 recipients, and promoted him to Generaloberst for his actions in Sicily, Salerno, and in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. Hube was killed when the aircraft that was transporting him crashed after takeoff in Salzburg on 21 April 1944. Hube was given a state funeral in Berlin on 26 April 1944. His coffin was laid out in the Reich Chancellery and the eulogy was delivered by Heinz Guderian.

Most women have no symptoms while others may have painful or heavy periods. If large enough, they may push on the bladder causing a frequent need to urinate. They may also cause pain during sex or lower back pain. A woman can have one uterine fibroid or many. Occasionally, fibroids may make it difficult to become pregnant, although this is uncommon. The exact cause of uterine fibroids is unclear. However, fibroids run in families and appear to be partly determined by hormone levels. Risk factors include obesity and eating red meat. Diagnosis can be performed by pelvic examination or medical imaging. Treatment is typically not needed if there are no symptoms. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may help with pain and bleeding while paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with pain. Iron supplements may be needed in those with heavy periods. Medications of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist class may decrease the size of the fibroids but are expensive and associated with side effects. If greater symptoms are present, surgery to remove the fibroid or uterus may help. Uterine artery embolization may also help. Cancerous versions of fibroids are very rare and are known as leiomyosarcomas. They do not appear to develop from benign fibroids. About 20% to 80% of women develop fibroids by the age of 50. In 2013, it was estimated that 171 million women were affected worldwide. They are typically found during the middle and later reproductive years. After menopause, they usually decrease in size. In the United States, uterine fibroids are a common reason for surgical removal of the uterus. Signs and symptoms Some women with uterine fibroids do not have symptoms. Abdominal pain, anemia and increased bleeding can indicate the presence of fibroids. There may also be pain during intercourse, depending on the location of the fibroid. During pregnancy, they may also be the cause of miscarriage, bleeding, premature labor, or interference with the position of the fetus. A uterine fibroid can cause rectal pressure. The abdomen can grow larger mimicking the appearance of pregnancy. Some large fibroids can extend out through the cervix and vagina. While fibroids are common, they are not a typical cause for infertility, accounting for about 3% of reasons why a woman may not be able to have a child.American Society of Reproductive Medicine Patient Booklet: Uterine Fibroids, 2003 The majority of women with uterine fibroids will have normal pregnancy outcomes. In cases of intercurrent uterine fibroids in infertility, a fibroid is typically located in a submucosal position and it is thought that this location may interfere with the function of the lining and the ability of the embryo to implant. Risk factors Some risk factors associated with the development of uterine fibroids are modifiable. Fibroids are more common in obese women. Fibroids are dependent on estrogen and progesterone to grow and therefore relevant only during the reproductive years. =Diet= Diets high in fruits and vegetables tend to lower the risk of developing fibroids. Fibers, vitamin A, C and E, phytoestrogens, carotenoids, meat, fish, and dairy products are of unclear effect. Normal dietary levels of vitamin D may reduce the risk of developing fibroids. =Genetics= Fifty percent of uterine fibroids demonstrate a genetic abnormality. Often a translocation is found on some chromosomes. Fibroids are partly genetic. If a mother had fibroids, risk in the daughter is about three times higher than average. Black women have a 3-9 times increased chance of developing uterine fibroids than white women. Only a few specific genes or cytogenetic deviations are associated with fibroids. 80-85% of fibroids have a mutation in the mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12) gene. =Familial leiomyomata= A syndrome (Reed's syndrome) that causes uterine leiomyomata along with cutaneous leiomyomata and renal cell cancer has been reported. This is associated with a mutation in the gene that produces the enzyme fumarate hydratase, located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42.3-43). Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Pathophysiology An enucleated uterine leiomyoma ‚Äì external surface on left, cut surface on right. Fibroids are a type of uterine leiomyoma. Fibroids grossly appear as round, well circumscribed (but not encapsulated), solid nodules that are white or tan, and show whorled appearance on histological section. The size varies, from microscopic to lesions of considerable size. Typically lesions the size of a grapefruit or bigger are felt by the patient herself through the abdominal wall.

Microscopically, tumor cells resemble normal cells (elongated, spindle- shaped, with a cigar-shaped nucleus) and form bundles with different directions (whorled). These cells are uniform in size and shape, with scarce mitoses. There are three benign variants: bizarre (atypical); cellular; and mitotically active. The appearance of prominent nucleoli with perinucleolar halos should alert the pathologist to investigate the possibility of the extremely rare hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (Reed) syndrome. =Location and classification= Schematic drawing of various types of uterine fibroids: a=subserosal fibroids, b=intramural fibroids, c=submucosal fibroid, d=pedunculated submucosal fibroid, e=cervical fibroid, f=fibroid of the broad ligament Growth and location are the main factors that determine if a fibroid leads to symptoms and problems. A small lesion can be symptomatic if located within the uterine cavity while a large lesion on the outside of the uterus may go unnoticed. Different locations are classified as follows: * Intramural fibroids are located within the muscular wall of the uterus. Unless they are large, they may be asymptomatic. Intramural fibroids begin as small nodules in the muscular wall of the uterus. With time, intramural fibroids may expand inwards, causing distortion and elongation of the uterine cavity. * Subserosal fibroids are located on the surface of the uterus. They can also grow outward from the surface and remain attached by a small piece of tissue and then are called pedunculated fibroids. * Submucosal fibroids are most common type, located in the muscle beneath the endometrium of the uterus and distort the uterine cavity; even small lesions in this location may lead to bleeding and infertility. A pedunculated lesion within the cavity is termed an intracavitary fibroid and can be passed through the cervix. * Cervical fibroids are located in the wall of the cervix (neck of the uterus). Rarely, fibroids are found in the supporting structures (round ligament, broad ligament, or uterosacral ligament) of the uterus that also contain smooth muscle tissue. Fibroids may be single or multiple. Most fibroids start in the muscular wall of the uterus. With further growth, some lesions may develop towards the outside of the uterus or towards the internal cavity. Secondary changes that may develop within fibroids are hemorrhage, necrosis, calcification, and cystic changes. They tend to calcify after menopause. If the uterus contains too many to count, it is referred to as diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis. Extrauterine fibroids of uterine origin, metastatic fibroids Fibroids of uterine origin located in other parts of the body, sometimes also called parasitic myomas have been historically extremely rare, but are now diagnosed with increasing frequency. They may be related or identical to metastasizing leiomyoma. They are in most cases still hormone dependent but may cause life-threatening complications when they appear in distant organs. Some sources suggest that a substantial share of the cases may be late complications of surgeries such as myomectomy or hysterectomy. Particularly laparoscopic myomectomy using a morcellator has been associated with an increased risk of this complication. There are a number of rare conditions in which fibroids metastasize. They still grow in a benign fashion, but can be dangerous depending on their location. *In leiomyoma with vascular invasion, an ordinary-appearing fibroid invades into a vessel but there is no risk of recurrence. *In intravenous leiomyomatosis, leiomyomata grow in veins with uterine fibroids as their source. Involvement of the heart can be fatal. *In benign metastasizing leiomyoma, leiomyomata grow in more distant sites such as the lungs and lymph nodes. The source is not entirely clear. Pulmonary involvement can be fatal. *In disseminated intraperitoneal leiomyomatosis, leiomyomata grow diffusely on the peritoneal and omental surfaces, with uterine fibroids as their source. This can simulate a malignant tumor but behaves benignly. =Pathogenesis= Multiple uterine leiomyoma Large subserosal fibroid Multiple uterine leiomyoma with calcification Fibroids are monoclonal tumors and approximately 40 to 50% show karyotypically detectable chromosomal abnormalities. When multiple fibroids are present they frequently have unrelated genetic defects. Specific mutations of the MED12 protein have been noted in 70 percent of fibroids. The exact cause of fibroids is not clearly understood, but the current working hypothesis is that genetic predispositions, prenatal hormone exposure and the effects of hormones, growth factors and xenoestrogens cause fibroid growth. Known risk factors are African descent, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetes, hypertension, and never having given birth. It is believed that estrogen and progesterone have a mitogenic effect on leiomyoma cells and also act by influencing (directly and indirectly) a large number of growth factors, cytokines and apoptotic factors as well as other hormones. Furthermore, the actions of estrogen and progesterone are modulated by the cross-talk between estrogen, progesterone and prolactin signaling which controls the expression of the respective nuclear receptors. It is believed that estrogen promotes growth by up-regulating IGF-1, EGFR, TGF-beta1, TGF-beta3 and PDGF, and promotes aberrant survival of leiomyoma cells by down-regulating p53, increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic factor PCP4 and antagonizing PPAR- gamma signaling. Progesterone is thought to promote the growth of leiomyoma through up-regulating EGF, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, and promotes survival through up-regulating Bcl-2 expression and down-regulating TNF-alpha. Progesterone is believed to counteract growth by downregulating IGF-1. Expression of transforming growth interacting factor (TGIF) is increased in leiomyoma compared with myometrium. TGIF is a potential repressor of TGF-Œ≤ pathways in myometrial cells. Aromatase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase are aberrantly expressed in fibroids, indicating that fibroids can convert circulating androstenedione into estradiol. Similar mechanism of action has been elucidated in endometriosis and other endometrial diseases. Aromatase inhibitors are currently considered for treatment, at certain doses they would completely inhibit estrogen production in the fibroid while not largely affecting ovarian production of estrogen (and thus systemic levels of it). Aromatase overexpression is particularly pronounced in African-American women. Genetic and hereditary causes are being considered and several epidemiologic findings indicate considerable genetic influence especially for early onset cases. First degree relatives have a 2.5-fold risk, and nearly 6-fold risk when considering early onset cases. Monozygotic twins have double concordance rate for hysterectomy compared to dizygotic twins. Expansion of uterine fibroids occurs by a slow rate of cell proliferation combined with the production of copious amounts of extracellular matrix. A small population of the cells in a uterine fibroid have properties of stem cells or progenitor cells, and contribute significantly to ovarian steroid-dependent growth of fibroids. These stem-progenitor cells are deficient in estrogen receptor Œ± and progesterone receptor and instead rely on substantially higher levels of these receptors in surrounding differentiated cells to mediate estrogen and progesterone actions via paracrine signaling. Diagnosis The presence of a uterine fibroid versus an adnexal tumor is made. Fibroids can be mistaken for ovarian neoplasms. An uncommon tumor which may be mistaken for a fibroid is Sarcoma botryoides. It is more common in children and adolescents. Like a fibroid, it can also protrude from the vagina and is distinguished from fibroids. While palpation used in a pelvic examination can typically identify the presence of larger fibroids, gynecologic ultrasonography (ultrasound) has evolved as the standard tool to evaluate the uterus for fibroids. Sonography will depict the fibroids as focal masses with a heterogeneous texture, which usually cause shadowing of the ultrasound beam. The location can be determined and dimensions of the lesion measured. Also, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to define the depiction of the size and location of the fibroids within the uterus. Imaging modalities cannot clearly distinguish between the benign uterine leiomyoma and the malignant uterine leiomyosarcoma, however, the latter is quite rare. Fast growth or unexpected growth, such as enlargement of a lesion after menopause, raise the level of suspicion that the lesion might be a sarcoma. Also, with advanced malignant lesions, there may be evidence of local invasion. A biopsy is rarely performed and if performed, is rarely diagnostic. Should there be an uncertain diagnosis after ultrasounds and MRI imaging, surgery is generally indicated. Other imaging techniques that may be helpful specifically in the evaluation of lesions that affect the uterine cavity are hysterosalpingography or sonohysterography.

Due to pressure effects gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and bloatedness are possible. Compression of the ureter may lead to hydronephrosis. Fibroids may also present alongside endometriosis, which itself may cause infertility. Adenomyosis may be mistaken for or coexist with fibroids. In very rare cases, malignant (cancerous) growths, leiomyosarcoma, of the myometrium can develop. In extremely rare cases uterine fibroids may present as part or early symptom of the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. Treatment Most fibroids do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. After menopause, fibroids shrink, and it is unusual for them to cause problems. Symptomatic uterine fibroids can be treated by: * medication to control symptoms (i.e., symptomatic management) * medication aimed at shrinking tumors * ultrasound fibroid destruction * myomectomy or radiofrequency ablation * hysterectomy * uterine artery embolization In those who have symptoms, uterine artery embolization and surgical options have similar outcomes with respect to satisfaction. =Medication= A number of medications may be used to control symptoms. NSAIDs can be used to reduce painful menstrual periods. Oral contraceptive pills may be prescribed to reduce uterine bleeding and cramps. Anemia may be treated with iron supplementation. Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices are effective in limiting menstrual blood flow and improving other symptoms. Side effects are typically few as the levonorgestrel (a progestin) is released in low concentration locally. While most levongestrel-IUD studies concentrated on treatment of women without fibroids a few reported good results specifically for women with fibroids including a substantial regression of fibroids. Cabergoline in a moderate and well-tolerated dose has been shown in two studies to shrink fibroids effectively. The mechanism of action responsible for how cabergoline shrinks fibroids is unclear. Ulipristal acetate is a synthetic selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) that has tentative evidence to support its use for presurgical treatment of fibroids with low side-effects. Long-term UPA-treated fibroids have shown volume reduction of about 70%. In some cases UPA alone is used to relieve symptoms without surgery. Danazol is an effective treatment to shrink fibroids and control symptoms. Its use is limited by unpleasant side effects. Mechanism of action is thought to be antiestrogenic effects. Recent experience indicates that safety and side effect profile can be improved by more cautious dosing. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs cause temporary regression of fibroids by decreasing estrogen levels. Because of the limitations and side effects of this medication, it is rarely recommended other than for preoperative use to shrink the size of the fibroids and uterus before surgery. It is typically used for a maximum of 6 months or less because after longer use they could cause osteoporosis and other typically postmenopausal complications. The main side effects are transient postmenopausal symptoms. In many cases the fibroids will regrow after cessation of treatment, however, significant benefits may persist for much longer in some cases. Several variations are possible, such as GnRH agonists with add-back regimens intended to decrease the adverse effects of estrogen deficiency. Several add-back regimes are possible, tibolone, raloxifene, progestogens alone, estrogen alone, and combined estrogens and progestogens. Progesterone antagonists such as mifepristone have been tested, there is evidence that it relieves some symptoms and improves quality of life but because of adverse histological changes that have been observed in several trials it can not be currently recommended outside of research setting. Fibroid growth has recurred after antiprogestin treatment was stopped. Aromatase inhibitors have been used experimentally to reduce fibroids. The effect is believed to be due partially by lowering systemic estrogen levels and partially by inhibiting locally overexpressed aromatase in fibroids. However, fibroid growth has recurred after treatment was stopped. Experience from experimental aromatase inhibitor treatment of endometriosis indicates that aromatase inhibitors might be particularly useful in combination with a progestogenic ovulation inhibitor. =Uterine artery= Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a noninvasive procedure that blocks blood flow to fibroids, causing them to shrink. Long-term outcomes with respect to how happy people are with the procedure are similar to that of surgery. There is tentative evidence that traditional surgery may result in better fertility. One review found that UAE doubles the future risk of miscarriage. UAE also appears to require more repeat procedures than if surgery was done initially. A person will usually recover from the procedure within a few days. Uterine artery ligation, sometimes also laparoscopic occlusion of uterine arteries are minimally invasive methods to limit blood supply of the uterus by a small surgery that can be performed transvaginally or laparoscopically. The principal mechanism of action may be similar like in UAE but is easier to perform and fewer side effects are expected. The 2016 NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence ‚Äì the non governmental public body that publishes guidelines in the use of health technologies and good clinical practice in the United Kingdom) guidelines state UAE/UFE can be offered to women with symptomatic fibroids (fibroids being usually >30mm in size). Women should be informed that UAE and myomectomy (the surgical removal of fibroids) may potentially allow them to retain their fertility. =Myomectomy= Submucosal fibroid in hysteroscopy Treatment of an intramural fibroid by laparoscopic surgeryAfter treatment of an intramural fibroid by laparoscopic surgery Myomectomy is a surgery to remove one or more fibroids. It is usually recommended when more conservative treatment options fail for women who want fertility preserving surgery or who want to retain the uterus. There are three types of myomectomy: * In a hysteroscopic myomectomy (also called transcervical resection), the fibroid can be removed by either the use of a resectoscope, an endoscopic instrument inserted through the vagina and cervix that can use high-frequency electrical energy to cut tissue, or a similar device. * A laparoscopic myomectomy is done through a small incision near the navel. The physician uses a laparoscope and surgical instruments to remove the fibroids. Studies have suggested that laparoscopic myomectomy leads to lower morbidity rates and faster recovery than does laparotomic myomectomy. * A laparotomic myomectomy (also known as an open or abdominal myomectomy) is the most invasive surgical procedure to remove fibroids. The physician makes an incision in the abdominal wall and removes the fibroids from the uterus. Laparoscopic myomectomy has less pain and shorter time in hospital than open surgery. =Hysterectomy= Hysterectomy was the classical method of treating fibroids. Although it is now recommended only as last option, fibroids are still the leading cause of hysterectomies in the US. =Endometrial ablation= Endometrial ablation can be used if the fibroids are only within the uterus and not intramural and relatively small. High failure and recurrence rates are expected in the presence of larger or intramural fibroids. =Other procedures= Radiofrequency ablation is a minimally invasive treatments for fibroids. In this technique the fibroid is shrunk by inserting a needle-like device into the fibroid through the abdomen and heating it with radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy to cause necrosis of cells. The treatment is a potential option for women who have fibroids, have completed child-bearing and want to avoid a hysterectomy. Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound, is a non-invasive intervention (requiring no incision) that uses high intensity focused ultrasound waves to destroy tissue in combination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which guides and monitors the treatment. During the procedure, delivery of focused ultrasound energy is guided and controlled using MR thermal imaging. Patients who have symptomatic fibroids, who desire a non-invasive treatment option and who do not have contraindications for MRI are candidates for MRgFUS. About 60% of patients qualify. It is an outpatient procedure and takes one to three hours depending on the size of the fibroids. It is safe and about 75% effective. Symptomatic improvement is sustained for two plus years. Need for additional treatment varies from 16-20% and is largely dependent on the amount of fibroid that can be safely ablated; the higher the ablated volume, the lower the re- treatment rate. There are currently no randomized trial between MRgFUS and UAE. A multi-center trial is underway to investigate the efficacy of MRgFUS vs. UAE. Prognosis About 1 out of 1000 lesions are or become malignant, typically as a leiomyosarcoma on histology. A sign that a lesion may be malignant is growth after menopause. There is no consensus among pathologists regarding the transformation of leiomyoma into a sarcoma. =Metastasis= There are a number of rare conditions in which fibroids metastasize. They still grow in a benign fashion, but can be dangerous depending on their location. See extrauterine fibroids. Epidemiology About 20% to 80% of women develop fibroids by the age of 50. Globally in 2013 it was estimated that 171 million women were affected. They are typically found during the middle and later reproductive years. After menopause they usually decrease in size. Surgery to remove uterine fibroids occurs more frequently in women in \\"higher social classes\\". Adolescents develop uterine fibroids much less frequently than older women. Up to 50% of women with uterine fibroids have no symptoms. The prevalence of uterine fibroids among teenagers is 0.4%. =Europe= The incidence of uterine fibroids in Europe is thought to be lower than the incidence in the US. =United States= Eighty percent of African-American women will develop benign uterine fibroid tumors by their late 40s, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. African-American women are two to three times more likely to get fibroids than Caucasian women. In African-American women fibroids seem to occur at a younger age, grow more quickly, and are more likely to cause symptoms. This leads to higher rates of surgery for African Americans, both myomectomy, and hysterectomy. Increased risk of fibroids in African- Americans causes them to fare worse in in-vitro fertility treatments and raises their risk of premature births and delivery by Cesarean section. It is unclear why fibroids are more common in African American women. Some studies suggest that black women who are obese and who have high blood pressure are more likely to have fibroids. Other suggested causes include the tendency of African American women to consume food with less than the daily requirements for vitamin D. Related legislation =United States= The 2005 S.1289 bill was read twice and referred to the committee on Health, Labor, and Pensions but never passed for a Senate or House vote; the proposed Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2005 mentioned that $5 billion is spent annually on hysterectomy surgeries each year, which affect 22% of African Americans and 7% of Caucasian women. The bill also called for more funding for research and educational purposes. It also states that of the $28 billion issued to NIH, $5 million was allocated for uterine fibroids in 2004.Office of Budget (PDF) Other animals Uterine fibroids are rare in other mammals, although they have been observed in certain dogs and Baltic grey seals. Research Selective progesterone receptor modulators, such as progenta, have been under investigation. Another selective progesterone receptor modulator asoprisnil is being tested with promising results as a possible use as a treatment for fibroids, intended to provide the advantages of progesterone antagonists without their adverse effects. Low dietary intake of vitamin D is associated with the development of uterine fibroids.

The IIS was primarily concerned with international intelligence collection and analysis but also performed many activities inside Iraq in conjunction with the Directorate of General Security as a secret police organization. The most important section of the IIS was Directorate 4: the Secret Service. One of the well known Directors was Rafi' Dahham Mejwel Al-Tikriti () the former Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey and the last Chief of the Iraqi Intelligence Service. The Secret Service was tasked with infiltrating both foreign and domestic governments, unions, embassies, and opposition groups. IIS often worked closely with the Iraqi General Security Directorate (the Iraqi equivalent of the FBI) when conducting domestic activities. IIS is alleged to be responsible for a number of assassinations and attempted assassinations abroad. These include the assassinations of Sheikh Talib al-Suhail al-Tamimi in Beirut (April 1994), Ayatollah Mehdi al-Hakim in Sudan (January 1988) and Ayad Habashi in Rome (October 1986), as well as the attempted assassinations of President George H.W.

It was established after the defection of Hussein Kamel al-Majid in August 1995.  History  Following an unsuccessful assassination attempt by the Ba'ath Party on Iraq's ruler Abdul Karim Qasim in October 1959, Saddam Hussein was placed in charge of Jihaz al Khas (Special Apparatus), sometime between 1964 and 1966. Codenamed Jihaz al-Haneen (Instrument of Yearning), the organisation concentrated on security and intelligence work. After the Ba'ath Party seized power on 17 July 1968, Saddam expanded the Special Apparatus and took control of the Amn (State Internal Security Department). Following the failed coup attempt led by Director of Internal Security Nadhim Kzar in 1973, Jihaz was transformed into Da'irat al Mukhabarat al Amah (The General Intelligence Department or the GID). In 1983, under the leadership of Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, the GID organized the massacres of the villagers of Dujail and Jezan Al Chol, the disappearance of the Barzanis from the Qushtapa camp, and the assassination of 18 members of Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim's family. As a result of the Gulf War (1991), the department dealing with external affairs was reduced to less than half of its pre-1990 size, while the department dealing with internal affairs was enlarged to deal with increasing anti-Saddam activities within Iraq. In 13 April 1993, the IIS planned and executed an assassination attempt against former US President George H. W. Bush and the Emir of Kuwait through the use of a large car bomb driven by two Iraqis. However the plan was foiled and Kuwaiti officials arrested 16 persons suspected of carrying out the plot after a car bomb was found. Two Iraqi nationals, during the FBI interviews in Kuwait, admitted to attempting to carry out an attack under direction of the IIS. On 26 June of that year, in response to an attempted assassination by IIS on former US President George H. W. Bush, US President Bill Clinton ordered two U.S. warships, namely USS Peterson and USS Chancellorsville, to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles on the IIS principal command and control complex in Baghdad. 16 of the 23 missiles hit their target; three struck a residential area, killing nine civilians and wounding 12. Four of the missiles were unaccounted for. In June 1995, Saddam Hussein dismissed his stepbrother Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti from his role as head of the IIS, due to his failure to increase domestic security within Iraq.

NML is located in several sites across the country including the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (CSCHAH) in Winnipeg, Manitoba. NML has a second site in Winnipeg, the Wilt Infectious Disease Research Centre on Logan Avenue which serves as a hub for HIV research and diagnostics in Canada. The three other primary sites include locations in Guelph, St. Hyacinthe and Lethbridge. The CSCHAH is a biosafety level 4 infectious disease laboratory facility, the only one of its kind in Canada. With maximum containment, scientists are able to work with pathogens including Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever. The NML's CSCHAH is also home to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease, and thus the scientists at the NML share their premises with animal virologists.  History  The National Microbiology Laboratory was preceded by the Bureau of Microbiology which was originally part of the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control of Health Canada in Ottawa. In the 1980s, Health Canada identified both the need to replace existing laboratory space that was reaching the end of its lifespan and the need for Containment Level 4 space in the country. Around the same time, Agriculture Canada (prior to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency being formed) also identified the need for new laboratory space including high-containment. Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building and Winnipeg was chosen as the site; an announcement to that effect was made in October 1987. After some debate, the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the Health Sciences Centre (a major teaching hospital), the University of Manitoba's medical school, and other life science organizations. Construction of the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (often referred to locally as \\"the Virology Lab\\") began with an official ground-breaking in December 1992. The joint venture design team of Toronto- based Dunlop Architects and Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers visited 30 laboratories to seek best practices in containment and design. Construction was largely complete by the end of 1997 with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 and all laboratories coming on line after that. The official opening took place in June 1999.News Release. Following the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Public Health Agency of Canada was formed in 2004News Release to provide a stronger focus on public health and emergency preparedness in the country. It is a member of the federal Health Portfolio (along with Health Canada, the Canadian Institute of Health Research, and other organizations).  Containment  Human pathogens are classified into risk groups.Canadian Biosafety Handbook, Second Edition 2016 . The criteria to determine the group includes the level of risk to the health of a person or to public health, as well as the likelihood that the human pathogen will actually cause disease in a human, and whether treatment and preventative measures are available. It can depend on the type of work being done as to which level of containment is needed for pathogens from specific risk groups; as an example, culturing (or growing) a virus or bacterium requires higher containment than some diagnostic tests. NML operates Containment Level 2, 3 and 4 laboratories. In human health infectious disease laboratories, the design and construction of the facility, the engineering controls, and the training and techniques of staff are all focused on protecting lab workers, containing the pathogens, and preventing contamination of materials to ensure accurate diagnosis and research. All of these factors vary depending on the level of containment. The vast majority (87.7%) of NML's lab space is Containment Level 2 (CL2). This is the same type of laboratory found in doctors' offices, hospitals and universities. In a Level 2 lab, work with infectious materials is done inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC) and appropriate personal protective gear is worn relative to activities (gloves, eye protection, lab coats, gowns, etc.). Risk Group 2 pathogens worked with in Level 2 can cause disease but are not a serious hazard and they are often circulating in the community. Environmental contamination must be minimized by the use of hand washing sinks and decontamination facilities such as autoclaves. Examples include E-coli; whooping cough; and seasonal influenza. NML also has Containment Level 3 (CL3) laboratories (8.6% of lab space). Risk Group 3 pathogens may be transmitted by the airborne route, often need only a low infectious dose to produce effects, and can cause serious or life- threatening disease. CL3 emphasizes additional primary and secondary barriers to minimize the release of infectious organisms into the immediate laboratory and the environment. Additional features to prevent transmission of CL3 organisms are appropriate respiratory protection, HEPA filtration of exhausted laboratory air, and strictly controlled laboratory access. Examples include tuberculosis; West Nile virus; and pandemic H1N1 influenza. A small percentage of laboratory space (3.6%) is devoted to Containment Level 4 (CL4) at NML. These agents have the potential for aerosol transmission, often have a low infectious dose and produce very serious and often fatal disease; there is no licensed treatment or vaccine available. This level of containment represents an isolated unit independent of other areas. CL4 emphasizes maximum containment of the infectious agent by completely sealing the facility perimeter with confirmation by negative pressure testing, isolation of the researcher from the pathogen by an enclosed positive pressure suit, and decontamination of air and all other materials. Examples include Ebola, Nipah, Marburg, and 1918 pandemic influenza.  Structure  NML programs are housed in several facilities across the country. Two of these facilities are in proximity to each other in Winnipeg: The Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health on Arlington Street and the J.C. Wilt Infectious Diseases Research Centre on Logan Avenue. The other facilities are located in Guelph, ON; St. Hyacinthe, QC and Lethbridge, AB. NML is divided into five main laboratory divisions which are supported by scientific and administrative services. The primary NML divisions are: Bacterial Pathogens - focussing on bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis and antibiotic resistant organisms. Enteric Diseases - focussing on food and water-borne pathogens including E.coli and Salmonella. Viral Diseases - addressing a range of viral diseases, including hepatitis and other blood-borne pathogens, respiratory viruses and viral exanthemata, such as measles. Zoonotic Diseases and Special Pathogens - dealing with viral, bacterial and rickettsial zoonoses (diseases transmitted to humans from other species), such as West Nile Virus and Lyme disease, along with risk group 4 agents such as Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses. HIV and Retrovirology - providing laboratory services and scientific expertise relating to HIV and emerging retroviruses. The Science Technology Core and Services Division works with these divisions to provide technological approaches, including genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics. There is also the Public Health Risk Sciences Division, which is a specialized resource that provides scientific knowledge and solutions to better assess public health risks and enable decisions, with specific attention to infectious disease threats transmitted from food, the animals, or the physical environment. These science-based divisions are complemented and supported by numerous other units that ensure their ongoing operations such as the Office of Science Planning, Program Support and Services, Scientific Informatic Services, Science Support and Client Services, Surveillance and References Services, the Facility and Property Management Division, and the Biorisk and Occupational Safety Services Division. NML also funds the National Reference Centre for Parasitology in Montreal and has a Laboratory Liaison Technical Officer in most provincial labs.  Workforce  NML employs scientists (MD, PhD, and DVM), biologists, and laboratory technicians, but it also includes informatics specialists, biosafety experts, specialized operations and maintenance staff, and administrative staff, among others. In total, there are approximately 600 staff members as of 2016.  Accomplishments  NML is renowned for its work on a broad spectrum of infectious diseases from seasonal influenza to Ebola and its accomplishments are too many to detail. Some recent examples of the work done by NML include their involvement in the response to the West African Ebola outbreak. For a period of about 18 months, teams from NML travelled to West Africa to aid in the diagnostics during the outbreak. They worked closely with the World Health Organization and M√©decins sans fronti√®res to ensure people were properly diagnosed so that they could be properly cared for and isolated from others to stop the spread. Also during this outbreak, a promising vaccine and treatment for Ebola that were developed at NML, in conjunction with collaborators, were fast tracked into clinical trials so that they could get to the people that needed it as soon as possible. Another accomplishment was the response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In April 2009, the Mexican national lab approached NML for assistance with identifying a respiratory virus that was causing outbreaks in Mexico. NML was able to quickly identify the new virus and recognize that it matched the virus that was beginning to circulate in the U.S. As the lead laboratory in Canada, NML rapidly developed diagnostic tests and equipped provincial labs to be able to test for the new virus. NML also assisted Mexico by providing additional testing and sent staff to their national laboratory to enable to help them set up their own testing protocols. In the international laboratory sector, NML has developed different types of mobile labs: a lab-truck, a lab-trailer, and a \\"lab in a suitcase\\". The lab-truck is generally used for in-country deployments at high-profile events such as the 2010 Olympics, the lab-trailer is used for international large-scale events where there may be a threat of bioterrorism or other deliberate acts involving infectious agents, and the lab in a suitcase is frequently used in remote areas of the world with little available infrastructure. An example would be the multiple deployments over the years to combat outbreaks of Ebola in Africa. This model was adopted by many other countries during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. NML houses the secretariats for both the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network (CPHLN) and the Global Health Security Action Group ‚Äì Laboratory Network (GHSAG-LN). The role of CPHLN is to provide a forum for public health laboratory leaders to share knowledge. The GHSAG-LN network's goals are to coordinate the diagnostic capabilities of all participants and contribute to disease surveillance around the world. The Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence (CNPHI) is an innovation developed by NML staff. It is a secure web-based system that compiles information from various surveillance systems and issues alerts to users. More than 4,000 public health officials across Canada now subscribe to it. CNPHI tools assist in determining the existence or extent of an outbreak through the recognition of related cases across jurisdictions.  Directors  From 2000 to 2014, Dr. Frank Plummer was the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory. Under Dr. Plummer's guidance, the NML developed into one of the world's premier institutions in the research, detection, and response to global infectious disease and bio-security threats. Dr. Plummer received his medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1976. Between 1984 and 2001, Dr. Plummer lived in Nairobi, Kenya where he spearheaded the development of the world renowned \\"Kenya AIDS Control Program,\\" established by the Universities of Manitoba and Nairobi. This HIV epidemiological work was central to global understanding of the risk factors for HIV transmission and how to prevent its spread. Dr. Plummer was the first to reveal that heterosexual women could also be infected with HIV/AIDS and that a cohort of Nairobi sex workers had a natural immunity to HIV/AIDS. This latter discovery suggested the possibility that a vaccine could eventually be developed. Dr. Plummer stepped down as the NML's Scientific Director General to take the position as senior adviser to the Agency's Chief Public Health Officer in 2014. He continues to be a distinguished professor at the University of Manitoba and a Canada Research Chair. In 2015, Dr. Matthew Gilmour became the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory and the Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses. Dr. Gilmour spearheaded the partnership that brought these two laboratories together under the National Microbiology Laboratory umbrella. He was previously the Chief, Enteric Diseases and subsequently the Program Director, Bacteriology and Enteric Diseases at the NML. Dr. Gilmour has won a number of scientific awards including Canadian Society of Microbiologists' Canadian Graduate Student Microbiologist of the Year Award; the Public Health Agency of Canada's Most Promising Researcher Merit Award and Dr. Andr√©s Petrasovits Public Health Merit Award; and Health Canada's Excellence Award in Collaborative Leadership and Award for Excellence in Science. Dr. Gilmour continues to be an Assistant Professor at the University of Manitoba's Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases as well as the Secretary Treasurer of the Canadian Association for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (CACMID).

Close to 150,000 motorcycles were produced within that time. Prior to 1964 Hodaka made engines for the Yamaguchi motorcycle brand. The worldwide distributor of Hodakas was PABATCO, for Pacific Basin Trading Company. Its headquarters were in the rural town of Athena, Oregon. PABATCO designed and engineered a majority of the motorcycles, and Hodaka in Japan was responsible for the engine and manufacture and assembly. Pabatco was owned by Shell Oil Company from 1965 to 1978. The name Hodaka comes from a mountain near the factory and means \\"To grow taller\\". The Oishi brothers, owners of Hodaka, had taken an extended trip to Europe in the late '50s and during that time they purchased close to 50 European and English motorcycles to take back to Japan to study. It is also rumored Hodaka might have indeed designed the complete Yamaguchi SPB50, not just the engine. Hodaka was also a producer of machine tools and it has been said they borrowed the concept of one of their quick-change gear clusters in one of their metalworking lathes to construct the shift mechanism in the Hodaka gearbox, with the resulting spring-loaded shifting mechanism being patented. Starting to manufacture complete motorcycles in 1964, Hodaka/PABATCO is credited by some with starting the trail bike craze in the United States. This was due mainly to the design by the off-road motorcycle enthusiasts at PABATCO. On the second year of production Hodaka experimented with reed valves and almost brought them to market. But for some unknown reason they dropped the idea. And subsequently Yamaha is credited with being the first to produce this power enhancing feature. Hodaka models are listed below. In the late 1970s, a combination of events led to the demise of Hodaka. Falling US dollar exchange rates against the Japanese yen, a shift in demand from dirt bikes to larger road bikes, and general economic weakness fatally wounded the company. Shell attempted to purchase the Hodaka company at one point but the offer was rebuffed by Hodaka in Japan. Some of the tooling was later sold to the Korean company Daelim after Hodaka closed in 1978. In 2014, a complete history including in house notes, blueprints, photos etc. was published. The book is called \\"Hodaka: The Complete Story of America's Favorite Trailbike\\". The book is authored by Ken Smith from Australia and has the most comprehensive history of the Hodaka motorcycle brand ever written. Every year the town of Athena, Oregon, holds an event in June entitled Hodaka Days which includes a parade of Hodaka motorcycles, a bike show, observed trials and motocross competition.http://hodakadays.org/ Hodaka Motorcycles List of Hodaka motorcycles *Hodaka Ace 90 model 90 *Hodaka Ace 100 model 92 *Hodaka Ace 100 model 92A *Hodaka Ace 100B model 92B *Hodaka Ace 100B+ Model 92B+ *Hodaka Ace 100 Super Rat model 93,93A and 93B *Hodaka 100 Dirt Squirt chrome tank model 96 *Hodaka 100 Road Toad model 99 *Hodaka 100 Super Rat model 98 *Hodaka 125 Super Combat model 97 *Hodaka 125 Combat Wombat model 95 *Hodaka 125 Wombat chrome tank model 94 and 94A *Hodaka 175SL model 61 *Hodaka Road Toad model 02 *Hodaka Dirt Squirt model 01 *Hodaka 250SL model 70 and 70A *Hodaka 250ED model 71 *Hodaka Dirt Squirt 80 model 82 References External links *Motorcycle Classics article on Hodaka Motorcycles Defunct motorcycle manufacturers of the United States Motorcycle manufacturers of Japan Motorcycles introduced in the 1960s Defunct companies based in Oregon Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1964 Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1978 1964 establishments in Oregon 1978 disestablishments in Oregon ","title":"Hodaka"},{"id":"1772673","text":"Entertainers such as Village People (Eric Anzalone pictured) profit by featuring stereotypical gay fantasy personae. Gay-for-pay describes male or female actors, pornographic stars, or sex workers who identify as heterosexual but who are paid to act or perform as homosexual professionally. The term has also applied to other professions and even companies trying to appeal to a gay demographic. The stigma of being gay or labeled as such has steadily eroded since the Stonewall riots began the modern American gay rights movement in 1969. Through the 1990s, mainstream movie and television actors have been more willing to portray homosexuality, as the threat of any backlash against their careers has lessened and society's acceptance of gay and lesbian people has increased.Full report (126 pages) In the gay pornography industry, that uses amateurs as well as professional actors, the term gay-for-pay refers to actors who identify as straight but who engage in same-sex sexual activities for money or sexual gain. Some actors who are actually gay or bisexual will be marketed as straight to appeal to the \\"allure of the unattainable,\\" because straight men (or those newly coming out) are virgins to sex with other men; scholar Camille Paglia declared that \\"Seduction of straight studs is a highly erotic motif in gay porn\\"\\"No Law in the Arena: A Pagan Theory of Sexuality,\\" in Paglia's Vamps and Tramps (1994, Vintage ), p.87 and anthropologist William Leap has similarly written, \\"as in most gay male settings, the young, the muscular, and the unfamiliar are more sought.\\"William L. Leap. Public Sex/Gay Space. Columbia University Press; 1999 [cited December 30, 2011]. . p. 62. Pornography In gay pornographic movies, actors who identify as straight, but who perform explicit sexual acts with other males, do not face the same stigma as their mainstream acting counterparts and indeed can rise quickly to being featured porn actors. These actors often play the \\"top\\" roles but this is not always the case, such as with Kristen Bjorn and some Bel Ami models. In some cases, a straight porn actor will shift between gay and straight porn to expand opportunities to work. Because some gay men consider heterosexual men to be objects of fantasy, some gay porn producers have almost certainly described some actors as heterosexual to increase sales and publicity for their product. Moreover, many gay or bisexual men who star in gay porn films may wish to be identified publicly as heterosexual for personal or professional reasons. Some straight actors have started acting in gay porn only to be accused of being gay while others' first step was to strictly do solo masturbation or muscle exhibition scenes. The higher pay scale and profile within a production often leads to group scenes where a straight actor only \\"tops.\\" Many times a \\"top\\" actor will then be sought as a bottom and the debut is often treated as a notable event or even its own release. =Motivation= Male pornographic actors are commonly paid more for homosexual work than heterosexual. There are also more opportunities to become a \\"star\\" in gay porn than in straight porn, where the attention is on female performers. Sex workers In the sex worker industry, the term may also be applied to straight people of either gender (including \\"male escorts\\") who have sexual contact or scenes with a client or another sex worker of the same gender. Although sexual contact is often involved, sex scenes or solo scenes (like masturbating to climax) or even a BDSM scene for the client's stimulation can take place. Sexual arousal without direct sexual contact may also occur in such niche trade like muscle worship. As in porn work, a gay identity is not necessary to make money from gay clients and consumers. Go- go dancers Go-go dancing originated in the 1960s and was eventually appropriated by burlesque and striptease establishments, which in turn became known as \\"go-go bars\\" but many gay clubs had male go-go dancers (called go-go boys) during the period 1965‚Äì1968. After that, few gay clubs had go-go dancers until a resurgence in the late 1980s when go-go dancing again became fashionable (and has remained so ever since). \\"Go-go dancers\\" that perform at night clubs, special parties, circuit parties or rave dances in colorful bright costumes (which may include battery operated lights), with fire sticks, or with a snake can also be called performance art dancers or box dancers. Large circuit parties and gay clubs often have very attractive go-go boys of all sexualities who will allow patrons to touch and rub them but only for tips. This is typical in Thai venues, such as in Sunee Plaza, Pattaya. Some criticize the practice of employing straight dancers to perform erotically for gay audiences when gay performers are available. Film and television The gay community has expressed concerns about the use of straight actors to play gay characters, a practice also nicknamed \\"gay for pay\\" in the acting industry. This occurs in films and shows such as Call Me By Your Name (straight actors Armie Hammer and Timoth√©e Chalamet), Brokeback Mountain (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), Modern Family (starring Eric Stonestreet), Philadelphia (starring Tom Hanks), Capote (starring Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Milk (with Sean Penn playing the role of the real-life gay rights activist-political leader Harvey Milk). In film and TV, \\"pinkface\\" is the use of straight actors to play LGB roles or characters. Anna King of Time Out likens \\"pinkface\\" to blackface. The LGB community raised concerns about the film Br√ºno, in which a straight actor (Sacha Baron Cohen) plays the role of a gay man to \\"...mak[e] fun of the queer community.\\" Dennis Lim states that the depictions of gays in mainstream film typically include the \\"gay joke\\" (in which LGB people are depicted to create humor); depicting gay men pejoratively as a \\"daisy, a fairy, a nonce, a pansy, a swish\\" or showing lesbian woman as \\"butch\\"; and to create a homosexual panic that plays on heterosexual people's fears of experiencing sexual advances from LGB people (the \\"most notorious of all gay-panic movies, William Friedkin's Cruising (1980)\\" links gay men to homicide). Pinkface differs from straightwashing, the erasing of gay characters and themes in film and TV stories. Pinkface in television advertising has also been compared to blackface; similarly to the way 19th century blackface performances created and affirmed a hierarchical system that presented certain identities as \\"preferred and privileged\\", with pinkface ads, LGBT people are portrayed to create \\"humorous stigmatization\\" which is \\"insidious,\\" as \\"like blackface, pinkface advertisements create a culture that posits the identities of GLBT persons [to a mainly non-GLBT audience] as inferior, inappropriate and ludicrous.\\"Farr, Daniel and Guenther, Gretchen. \\"Seeking the Rainbow Dollar: Gay and Lesbian Marketing and Consumption.\\" In The Globetrotting Shopaholic: Consumer Spaces, Products, and their Cultural Places.

PBCore v1.2.1 used 61 elements organized into 15 containers and 4 sub-containers. 1.3 ‚Äì August 2010 PBCore version 1.3 added a new top-level element, a new attribute of string values, and removed the previous requirement to describe one or more instantiations of any asset. Its new element, \\"pbcoreAssetType,\\" could be used to explicitly declare the asset's broad business purpose, and its new attribute \\"source\\" could help clarify the text value of an element, much like the attribute \\"version\\" has done. PBCore v1.3 used 62 elements organized into 15 containers and 4 sub- containers. 2.0 - November 2011 PBCore version 2.0 was released at the annual conference of the Association of Moving Image Archivists in November 2011. This was a major revision of the schema, with the addition of two new top- level elements: *The \\"\\"pbcoreCollection\\"\\" element allows for wrapping any number of pbcoreDescriptionDocuments in a collection or feed for exchanging any number of asset records between systems. *The \\"\\"pbcoreInstantiationDocument\\" provides a metadata container for physical or digital instantiations for which no descriptive metadata exists, which was disallowed in previous versions of PBCore. Another significant change in PBCore 2.0 was the addition of optional attributes for many elements, including source, ref, version, annotation, startTime, endTime, and timeAnnotation. The source attribute allows for the specification of a source of subject terms and other values, while the ref attribute may contain a URI for the subject term itself. The version and annotation attributes allow for the inclusion of versioning for the value, and narrative information intended to clarify the nature of the data used in the element. The startTime, endTime, and timeAnnotation attributes allow for the inclusion of time-based metadata, for example the location in the media timeline when a subject, name, or location was relevant. A third major change to the schema was the addition of pbcorePart as an optional element of the root element pbcoreDescriptionDocument, and recursively another pbcorePart element, which allows for defining segments, stories, or episodes of a larger media work. Current developments As part of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting initiative, PBCore entered a new phase of development in 2014. The American Archive team established a PBCore Advisory Subcommittee of the Association of Moving Image Archivists to reassess the schema, continue outreach to users and potential adopters, create resources for the PBCore community and improve the website. Content classes The PBCore standard is built on the foundation of the Dublin Core (ISO 15836), an international standard for resource discovery, and has been reviewed, though not endorsed, by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Usage Board. PBCore extends Dublin Core by adding a number of elements specific to audiovisual (AV) assets. These AV assets can be physical analog media items, or digital media objects. PBCore provides a standard for cataloging and describing media objects in three general ways: * Intellectual Content provides descriptive metadata including Title, Subject, Description, and Genre. The Intellectual Content for the asset contains no metadata concerning the physical or digital representation of the asset. * Intellectual Property provides metadata concerning the creator, distributor, and publisher of the AV asset, along with rights information about its use. * Instantiation contains all technical metadata about the physical or digital representation of the AV asset. This can include format, media type, duration, file size, data rate, aspect ratio, frame rate, and many other aspects of the media object. The Instantiation metadata includes the location of the physical or digital media object, which in the case of a streaming media file can be its full URL. In PBCore there can be many Instantiations for the same AV asset, all of which share the same Intellectual Content metadata. * Extension allows for the integration of data from other metadata schema, such as EAD and PREMIS. PBCore provides an XSD allowing validation of PBCore XML records. PBCore XML can be used to exchange detailed metadata about media assets, and optionally the media assets themselves, among systems configured for the PBCore standard. The schema is used by organizations within the public media community as well as in archives and libraries across the world.  Elements  Although a PBCore record potentially contains a great many elements, the only required elements are any one of the root elements, pbcoreIdentifier, and pbcoreTitle Root Elements *pbcoreDescriptionDocument *pbcoreCollection *pbcoreInstantiationDocument Intellectual Content *pbcoreAssetType *pbcoreAssetDate *pbcoreIdentifier *pbcoreTitle *pbcoreSubject *pbcoreDescription *pbcoreGenre *pbcoreRelation *pbcoreRelationType *pbcoreRelationIdentifier *pbcoreCoverage *coverage *coverageType *pbcoreAudienceLevel *pbcoreAudienceRating *pbcoreAnnotation Intellectual Property *pbcoreCreator *creator *creatorRole *pbcoreContributor *contributor *contributorRole *pbcorePublisher *publisher *publisherRole *pbcoreRightsSummary *rightsSummary *rightsLink *rightsEmbedded Extensions *pbcoreExtension *extensionWrap *extensionElement *extensionValue *extensionAuthorityUsed *extensionEmbedded *pbcorePart Instantiation *pbcoreInstantiation *instantiationIdentifier *instantiationDate *instantiationDimensions *instantiationPhysical *instantiationDigital *instantiationStandard *instantiationLocation *instantiationMediaType *instantiationGenerations *instantiationFileSize *instantiationTimeStart *instantiationDuration *instantiationDataRate *instantiationColors *instantiationTracks *instantiationChannelConfiguration *instantiationLanguage *instantiationAlternativeModes *instantiationEssenceTrack *essenceTrackType *essenceTrackIdentifier *essenceTrackStandard *essenceTrackEncoding *essenceTrackDataRate *essenceTrackFrameRate *essenceTrackPlaybackSpeed *essenceTrackSamplingRate *essenceTrackBitDepth *essenceTrackFrameSize *essenceTrackAspectRatio *essenceTrackTimeStart *essenceTrackDuration *essenceTrackLanguage *essenceTrackAnnotation *essenceTrackExtension *instantiationRelation *instantiationRelationType *instantiationRelationIdentifier *instantiationRights *rightsSummary *rightsLink *rightsEmbedded *instantiationAnnotation *instantiationPart *instantiationExtension See also * American Archive of Public Broadcasting * Dublin Core * Metadata standards References External links * Official website * User community website * Dublin Core website Library science Metadata standards Public broadcasting ","title":"PBCore"},{"id":"1772690","text":"Photo and broadcast journalists interviewing government official after a building collapse Broadcast journalism is the field of news and journals which are \\"broadcast\\", that is, published by electronic methods instead of the older methods, such as printed newspapers and posters. Broadcast methods include radio (via air, cable, and Internet), television (via air, cable, and Internet) and the World Wide Web. Such media disperse pictures (static and moving), visual text and sounds. Description Broadcast articles can be written as \\"packages\\", \\"readers\\", \\"voice-overs\\" (VO) and \\"sound on tape\\" (SOT). A \\"sack\\" is an edited set of video clips for a news story and is common on television. It is typically narrated by a reporter. It is a story with audio, video, graphics and video effects. The news anchor, or presenter, usually reads a \\"lead-in\\" (introduction) before the package is aired and may conclude the story with additional information, called a \\"tag\\". A \\"reader\\" is an article read without accompanying video or sound. Sometimes an \\"over the shoulder digital on-screen graphic\\" is added. A voice-over, or VO, is a video article narrated by the anchor. Sound on tape, or SOT, is sound or video usually recorded in the field. It is usually an interview or soundbite. Radio was the first medium for broadcast journalism. Many of the first radio stations were co-operative community radio ventures not making a profit. Later, radio advertising to pay for programs was pioneered in radio. Later still, television displaced radio and newspapers as the main news sources for most of the public in industrialized countries. Some of the programming on radio is locally produced and some is broadcast by a radio network, for example, by syndication. The \\"talent\\" (professional voices) talk to the audience, including reading the news. People tune in to hear engaging radio personalities, music, and information. In radio news, stories include speech soundbites, the recorded sounds of events themselves, and the anchor or host. Some radio news might run for just four minutes, but contain 12‚Äì15 stories. These new bulletins must balance the desire for a broad overview of current events with the audience's limited capacity to focus on a large number of different stories. The radio industry has undergone a radical consolidation of ownership, with fewer companies owning the thousands of stations. Large media conglomerates such as Clear Channel Communications own most of the radio stations in the United States. That has resulted in more \\"niche\\" formats and the sharing of resources within clusters of stations, de-emphasizing local news and information. There has been concern over whether this concentration serves the public. The opposition says that the range of political views expressed is greatly narrowed and that local concerns are neglected, including local emergencies, for which communication is critical. Automation has resulted in many stations broadcasting for many hours a day with no one on the station premises.  History  When radio first became popular, it was not used as a source of information; rather, people listened to the radio solely for entertainment purposes. This began to change with a man named Edward R. Murrow. Edward Murrow was an American who traveled to England in order to broadcast news about World War II. He stayed in London throughout the war and was the first to report on events such as bombings in London and updated the people on Hitler's reign. Murrow gained his fame mainly after reporting on Hitler's German army annexing Austria. Many Americans relied on his broadcasts throughout the war to gain information about the war. More people also began to rely on radio for information after the attacks on Pearl Harbor. People found out about the bombing through President Roosevelt's broadcast interrupting their daily programming. It set Americans on edge, and people began to rely more heavily on the radio for major announcements throughout World War II. World War II was a time where radio broadcasting became a much larger industry because it was the easiest and quickest way for people to get updates on what was going on throughout the world. Informative radio continued while television reporting also began to take flight. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s television news sources grew, but radio still dominated. It wasn't until John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963 that television newscasting took off. Radio could only capture the sound of the event, but television showed people the true horror of the assassination. This was one of the first major events in which news companies competed with each other to get the news out to the public first. CBS News was the first to report that Kennedy had been shot and was killed. News crews spent the next several days covering everything happening in Washington, including Kennedy's funeral. This set the standard for news stations to have to cover major events quicker and get them out to the public as they were happening. The JFK assassination helped to transform television journalism to how it is today, with instantaneous coverage and live coverages at major events. Television offered faster coverage than radio and allowed viewers to feel more as if they were experiencing the event because they could visualize exactly what was going on. NBC (National Broadcasting Company) and CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System) were the two competing forces of news broadcasting in the early years of broadcast journalism. NBC was established in 1926 and CBS in 1927. There was a divide in the industry because they were not only competing against each other, but radio news that had already been established. Women had a hard time immersing themselves into radio news seeing as most of the radio broadcasts were men. There was a small number of women who hosted programs that were for homemakers and were on entertainment broadcast. After World War II, the doors for women in broadcasting opened up. This was also due to the shortage of men that were home during the war, so news outlets looked to women to fill those gaps of times. In the 1960s and 1970s larger numbers of women began to enter into broadcast news field. Both radio and television are major sources for broadcast journalism today, even with rapidly expanding technology. Television still focuses on covering major events, but radio broadcasts focus more on analyzing stories rather than reporting breaking news. Although the history of broadcast journalism has its origins in the early days of radio transmission, it is television with its attractive visuals and rapid dissemination that has empowered broadcast journalism to emerge as the most influential form of journalism until the rise of the Internet and the new forms of journalism associated with digital technologies. The internet often beats out broadcast journalism in terms of reporting breaking news, and the field of broadcast journalism is constantly having to adapt to the changing technology of today. Television Television (TV) news is considered by many to be the most influential medium for journalism. For most of the American public, local news and national TV newscasts are the primary news sources. Not only the numbers of audience viewers, but the effect on each viewer is considered more persuasive (\\"The medium is the message\\"). Television is dominated by attractive visuals (including beauty, action, and shock), with short soundbites and fast \\"cuts\\" (changes of camera angle). Television viewing numbers have become fragmented, with the introduction of cable news channels, such as Cable News Network (CNN), Fox News Channel and MSNBC. A journalist works on location at the Loma Prieta Earthquake in San Francisco's Marina District October 1989. =Local television= The industry divides local television in North America into media markets. These television markets are defined by viewing area and are ranked by the number of audience viewers. New broadcast journalists generally start in the smaller markets with fewer viewers and move up to larger television stations and television networks after gaining experience. The larger stations usually have more resources and better pay. United States stations typically broadcast local news three or four times a day: around 4:30‚Äì6 am, 11:30 or noon, 5 or 6 pm, and 10 or 11 at night. Most of the nightly local newscasts are 30 minutes, and include sports television and weather. News anchors are shown sitting at a desk in a television studio. The news anchors read teleprompters that contain local interest stories and breaking news. Reporters frequently tell their stories outside the formal television studio in the field, in a remote broadcast setting where Electronic news-gathering (ENG) techniques are used with production trucks. Daytime television or morning shows include more \\"soft\\" news and feature pieces, while the evening news emphasizes \\"hard\\" news.  Education  Many young journalists start out by learning about broadcast journalism through high school courses. They learn how to navigate the newsroom and equipment, and they learn the ethics and standards of journalism. Although learning the responsibilities of a journalist is important, education is required to work in broadcast journalism. A bachelor's degree in, \\"...journalism, broadcast journalism or interactive media,\\"can lead to a career in broadcast production. However, a heavy amount of the education they receive is hands-on activity through internships and working for on-campus broadcasting stations. This real world view of the field combined with classes that teach students the ins and outs of writing, capturing video, interviewing and editing creates a developed and prepared journalist. Finding a job in the broadcasting field can be tough due to the decreased viewing and limited number of stations in each location, but the online media presence is causing employment to be, \\"...predicted to decline by 8% from 2014 to 2024.\\" News jobs News anchors (formerly \\"anchormen\\") serve as masters-of-ceremonies and are usually shown facing a professional video camera in a television studio while reading unseen teleprompters. The anchors are often in pairs (co- anchors), who sit side by side and often alternate their reading. Meteorologists stand in front of chroma key backgrounds to describe weather forecasting and show maps, charts and pictures. Reporters research and write the stories and sometimes use video editing to prepare the story for air into a \\"package\\". Reporters are usually engaged in electronic field production (EFP) and are accompanied by a videographer at the scenes of the news; the latter holds the camera. The videographer or assistants manage the audio and lighting; they are in charge of setting up live television shots and might edit using a non-linear editing system (NLE). Segment producers choose, research and write stories, as well as deciding the timing and arrangement of the newscast. Associate producer, if any, specialize in other elements of the show such as graphics. Production jobs A newscast director is in charge of television show preparation, including assigning camera and talent (cast) positions on the set, as well as selecting the camera shots and other elements for either recorded or live television video production. The technical director (TD) operates the video switcher, which controls and mixes all the elements of the show. At smaller stations, the Director and Technical Director are the same person. A graphics operator operates a character generator (CG) that produces the lower third on-screen titles and full-page digital on-screen graphics. The audio technician operates the audio mixing console. The technician is in charge of the microphones, music and audio tape. Often, production assistants operate the teleprompters and professional video cameras and serve as lighting and rigging technicians (grips).  Business Changes  Broadcast journalism is changing rapidly, causing issues within the business as well. Many people can no longer find jobs in broadcast journalism because much more is online and does not even need to be broadcast by a person. Others are being laid off to invest more money into new technologies. Other changes include innovations allowing TV stations to better alert viewers in emergencies and have higher quality services. Online convergence Convergence is the sharing and cross-promoting of content from a variety of media, all of which, in theory, converge and become one medium. In broadcast news, the internet is a key to convergence. Frequently, broadcast journalists also write text stories for the Web, usually accompanied by the graphics and sound of the original story. Websites offer the audience an interactive form where they can learn more about a story, can be referred to related articles, can offer comments for publication and can print stories at home. Technological convergence also lets newsrooms collaborate with other media, broadcast outlets sometimes have partnerships with their print counterparts.  Citizen broadcast journalism  Citizen broadcast journalism is a new form of technology that has allowed regular civilians to post stories they see through outlets such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter. It has become a new trend that some allegedly fear will take over broadcast journalism as it is known. News companies, like Fox News, are employing citizen journalists, which is a new phenomenon in journalism.  Fake news  The term \\"fake news\\" or Yellow journalism has taken over broadcast journalism throughout the past and current years. Its impact on broadcast journalism played a role in how news about the election was spread. Fake news defines how viewers see news that may be misleading or false. The main aim of Yellow Journalism is to gather the attention of people in the society. Many of these false or misleading stories came out during the 2016 election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape Vitis vinifera are its \\"slip- skin\\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European vinifera is the characteristic \\"foxy\\" musk of V. labrusca, best known to most people through the Concord grape.Jancis Robinson (ed.) The Oxford Companion to Wine (Oxford University Press, third edition 2006, ), pp 19-20 This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the strong, earthy aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early European-American settlers in the New World. The term \\"foxy\\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines.B. Ramey The Great Wine Grapes Concord, Catawaba and Delaware entries (no page numbers in book) University of California-Davis, 1977 ASIN B0006CZP4S History Concord grapes. According to wine historian Edward Hyams and wine expert Jancis Robinson, Vitis labrusca was probably the species seen by Leif Ericsson growing wild along the coast of Vinland in the 11th century. There is ample evidence that the labrusca was growing wild in North America before Europeans arrived. The vine was not officially identified and recorded until Carl Linnaeus and his peers started cataloging American vine species in the mid-18th century. In the 19th century, Vitis labrusca was among the American vines transported to Europe that were carrying the phylloxera louse that caused widespread devastation to the European vineyards planted with Vitis vinifera.Jancis Robinson, Vines, Grapes & Wines (Mitchell Beazley, 1986, ), pp 8, 18, 228 Also in the 19th century, Ephraim Bull of Concord, Massachusetts, cultivated seeds from wild labrusca vines to create the Concord grape which would become an important agricultural crop in the United States. Vine characteristics The majority of Vitis labrusca grape varieties are red, although white varieties such as Niagara and \\"pink-skinned\\" varieties such as Catawba have dark colored berries high in phenolic compounds that produced strongly flavored wines. As the berries near harvest and become fully ripe, they separate easily from the pedicel (berry stem). If the berry is squeezed gently between two fingers, the thick skin will slip easily off leaving the pulp intact as a ball. This trait gives Vitis labrusca the name of \\"slip skin\\" grapes. Another trait of labrusca that aids ampelographers in identification of vines and hybrid varieties descended from the species is the large, thick leaves of the vines that have a hairy underside with dense brown or white hairs. Like many other American vine species, Vitis labrusca has some natural resistance to many grape diseases, including phylloxera. However, its resistance and grafting compatibility is not as high as that of other species, such as Vitis aestivalis, Vitis rupestris and Vitis berlandieri, and it is not often used for commercial rootstock. It is a robust plant, and in many states can be considered weedy or invasive. Wine regions Botanical features of Vitis labrusca. Vitis labrusca can be found along the eastern seaboard of North America from Nova Scotia down to Georgia and westward to the Mississippi river. Among American Viticultural Areas (AVA)s that produce wine from labrusca or hybrids derived from labrusca include Upper Mississippi Valley, Mississippi Delta, Ohio River Valley, Southeastern New England, Lake Erie as well as several AVAs in the states of New York, Virginia, Ohio and Michigan.Winkler A J, Cook J A, Kliere W M and Lider L A, General Viticulture (University of California Press, 2nd edition 1974, ), pp 17-20, 59, 166-167 In the Canadian Province of Ontario, the use of Vitis labrusca varieties is not permitted by the VQA regulatory and appellation system, except for Vidal, a hybrid grape varietal. Unlike vinifera, hybrids and Vitis labrusca varieties can better withstand the severe continental conditions of eastern North America with severely cold winters and hot, humid summers. (However, labrusca doesn't do quite as well as varieties like Vitis rotundifolia in the humidity of southeastern US). In fact, in areas of the United States where vinifera does flourish in the west, the conditions during the growing season are often too arid for labrusca vines. \\"Foxy\\" musk According to University of California, Davis viticulture expert A. J. Winkler, outside of the vinifera Muscat family of grapes, Vitis labrusca varieties have the most pronounced aromas among wine grape varieties. The description of \\"foxy\\", not derived from the animal, serves as a catch-all term to describe the unique, earthy and sweet muskiness that can be perceived in fresh Concord grapes as well as grape juice made from Concord and other labrusca varieties like Niagara. In the 1920s, scientists were able to isolate the aroma compound responsible for the \\"foxy\\" musk as methyl anthranilate.

Twenty-three people were killed in a collision between a Canadian National Railway freight train and a Via Rail passenger train called the Super Continental. It was the deadliest rail disaster in Canada at this time, since the Dugald accident of 1947 which had thirty-one fatalities, and would not be surpassed until the Lac-M√©gantic rail disaster in 2013 which resulted in forty-seven fatalities. It was surmised that the accident was a result of the crew of the freight train becoming incapacitated, and the resulting investigations revealed serious flaws in CN's employee practices. Vicinity of the accident The accident took place on a stretch of Canadian National Railway's transcontinental main line west of Edmonton, near the town of Hinton, Alberta. Nearby towns are Jasper to the west and Edson to the east. Passenger service on the line was provided by Via Rail Canada. Slightly over half of the stretch of track between Jasper and Edson was double-tracked, including of trackage from Hargwen control point west to Dalehurst control point. Traffic on this line was controlled with Centralized Traffic Control (CTC). Prelude On the morning of 8 February 1986, Via Rail's No. 4 train, the combined Super Continental and Skeena, was travelling from Jasper east to Edmonton on its transcontinental journey. It consisted of 14 units in the following order: #FP7 Diesel locomotive number 6566 #F9B Diesel locomotive number 6633 #Baggage-Dormitory 617 #Coach-Snack Bar 3229 #Skyline Dome car number 513 #4-8-4Sleeping car fitted with 4 sections, 8 duplex roomettes and 4 double bedrooms Sleeping car 1139 Ennishore #4-8-4 Sleeping car 1120 Elcott #FP9 Diesel locomotive number 6300 (inoperative) #Steam generator car 15445 #Baggage car 9653 #Daynighter Coach 5703 #Cafe-Lounge 757 #4-8-4 Sleeping car 1150 Estcourt #Steam generator car 15404 The unusual composition of the train was the result of 2 separate trains being coupled together in Jasper. The first 2 locomotives and 5 cars had originated in Vancouver, and the second section consisting of 1 locomotive and 5 cars had originated in Prince Rupert. The last car, a steam generator, was added in Jasper on its way to Edmonton for maintenance. 115 people were on board the train; 94 passengers, 14 stewards and 7 crew. The lead locomotive was occupied by engineers Mike Peleshaty, age 57, and Emil Miller, age 53. Canadian National Railway's westbound train No. 413 consisted of 3 locomotives, EMD GP38-2W number 5586, and 2 EMD SD40 numbers 5104 and 5062, followed by a high-speed spreader, 35 cylindrical hoppers loaded with grain, 7 bulkhead flat cars loaded with large pipes, 45 hoppers loaded with sulfur, 20 loaded tank cars, 6 more grain cars, and a caboose; a total consist of 3 locomotives and 115 cars. It was long and weighed . On the lead locomotive were engineer John Edward \\"Jack\\" Hudson, aged 48, and brakeman Mark Edwards, aged 25. On the caboose, conductor Wayne \\"Smitty\\" Smith, aged 33.\\"Head-On Collision\\" (Also \\"Train Collision\\" and \\"Impact on the Rails.\\" Mayday (Crash Scene Investigation) The freight train left Edson at 6:40 am, and took the siding at Medicine Lodge to allow two eastbound trains to pass. It departed Medicine Lodge at 8:02 am and reached Hargwen at 8:20 am, where a section of double track started. The train dispatcher at Edmonton had lined the dual-control switch (DCS) so that the freight train was lined up onto the north track. At the same time, the Super Continental stopped at Hinton, and left five minutes late. At 8:29 am, the dispatcher lined the dual-control switch at Dalehurst, where the section of double track beginning from Hargwen ended, to allow the Super Continental to take the south track. This turnout setting would have caused the absolute signal at the Dalehurst control point to display a stop indication for the freight train. The crew of the freight train would have received a warning of the upcoming stop signal indication when they passed a double-aspect approach signal east of Dalehurst. The signal in question showed an approach indication, yellow over red, meaning that the crew was required to prepare to stop at the next signal while reducing speed to . As the freight train approached this signal, the throttle was in the 8th notch with the train speed at , faster than the speed limit on this stretch of track. The engineer made no attempt to slow down after passing the approach signal.Case No. 1677 - Canadian National Railways and United Transportation Union (16 July 1987) Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration Further west at the Dalehurst control point, there was an absolute three-aspect signal, east of the switch at the end of double-track. That signal showed three solid red lights, indicating stop. The freight train still did not slow down, instead it ran through the switch and entered the section of single track now occupied by the Super Continental. Had the Super Continental been even a minute early, it would have been past the switch at this point, but it was not. Approximately 18 seconds after the lead locomotive of the freight train ran through the switch, at 8:40 am, the two trains collided. Aftermath After the derailment, diesel fuel spilled from the locomotives and ignited, and the locomotives, the baggage car, and the day coach were engulfed in flames. The two crew members in each of the locomotives were killed. Eighteen of the 36 occupants of the day coach were killed. The observation dome car behind the day coach suffered serious damage, and was also hit by a freight car, which was thrown into the air by the force of the collision. One of its occupants was killed. The others were able to escape either through a window in the dome that had been broken by passengers, or through the hole left by the freight car. The two sleepers following the dome car derailed and were thrown on their sides. There were no deaths in these cars, but there were several injuries. The mid train locomotive (6300) was severely damaged (It was repaired with a new cab section from a KCS EMD F7). The three passenger cars at the rear of the train did not derail, but there were many injuries. As the accident unfolded, the cars on the freight train piled up on each other, resulting in a large pile of rolling stock. The three freight locomotives and the first 76 cars of the train were either destroyed or severely damaged. After the rear of the freight train came to a halt, Smith, the sole surviving member of the freight train's crew, attempted to contact the front of the train to no avail; he then contacted the emergency services after witnessing the growing fire. Cause There was no evidence of braking action from either train prior to the collision. An analysis suggested that both trains would have been visible to one another for the final 19 seconds leading up to the collision. Though no conclusive reason would be found for the failure of the passenger train to react to the incursion, there was no evidence that the crew otherwise made any errors leading up to the accident. The focus shifted to the freight train and its failure to stop at the north track before it rejoined the main line. Why the freight train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error as the only possible cause. However, since the head-end crew of the freight train did not survive, it was not clear why they had erred. Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out drugs or alcohol as the cause, though it was revealed that the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at risk for a heart attack or stroke. A Commission of Inquiry investigated the crash. Justice Ren√© P. Foisy, Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, held 56 days of public hearings and received evidence from 150 parties. The inquiry report was published on 22 January 1987. Instead of condemning any one individual, it instead condemned what Foisy described as a \\"railroader culture\\" that prized loyalty and productivity at the expense of safety. As an example of this disregard of safety, it was noted that the crew of that train had boarded the locomotive at Edson \\"on the fly\\". While the locomotive was moving slowly through the yard, the new crew would jump on and the previous crew would jump off. While this method of changing crews saved time and fuel, it was a flagrant violation of safety regulations requiring a stationary brake test after a crew change. Management claimed to be unaware of this practice, even though it was quite common. In regards to engineer Hudson, the Foisy Commission concluded it was a possibility that engineer Hudson had either fallen asleep at the controls or had suffered a heart attack or stroke in light of his extremely poor health, leading to the collision. The commission further criticized CN's ineffective monitoring of Hudson's health condition: > The serious nature of Hudson's medical condition...raises a strong > possibility that it was a factor contributing to the collision of February > 8...The Commission therefore concludes that engineer Hudson's medical > condition possibly contributed to his failure to control Train 413. The > Commission also concludes that there are serious deficiencies in the manner > in which CN monitored and reacted to that condition. The Commission finds > that both the policies and procedures that permitted a man in Hudson's > medical state to be responsible for the operation of a freight train on the > CN main line to be unacceptable. Another frequently ignored safety regulation mentioned in the report was the \\"deadman's pedal\\", which a locomotive engineer had to keep depressed for the train to remain underway. Were he to fall asleep or pass out, his foot would slip from the pedal, triggering an alarm and engaging the train's brakes automatically a few seconds later. However, many engineers found this tiresome and bypassed the pedal by placing a heavy weight (often a worn out brake shoe) on it. It was uncertain whether the pedal had been bypassed in this case because the lead locomotive of the train had been destroyed. A more advanced safety device was available, the reset safety control (RSC), which required crew members to take an action such as pushing a button at regular intervals, or else automatic braking would occur, but neither lead locomotive was equipped with this safety feature. While the second locomotive in the freight train was equipped with RSC, it was not assigned as the lead locomotive because it lacked a \\"comfort cab\\". Management and union practice was to place more comfortable locomotives at the front of trains, even at the expense of safety. The report also noted that although the front-end and rear-end crews should have been in regular communication, that did not appear to be the case in this accident. As the freight train reached Hargwen, Engineer Hudson radioed back to Conductor Smith that the signals were green, a communication that was heard by a following freight. As it ran towards Dalehurst there was no evidence of further communication. The conductor is in charge of the train, so if Smith felt that the train was out of control or there were serious problems, he should have activated the emergency brake in the caboose to stop the train. However, Smith, who appeared to be nervous while testifying, said that he did not feel that the freight was ever out of control, misjudging its speed. He also testified that he attempted to radio Hudson on two radios and several channels, but neither seemed to be working, even though immediately after the crash Smith was able to contact the dispatcher by radio. Despite Smith's testimony, he apparently decided not to stop the train. Dramatization The disaster was featured in \\"Head-on Collision\\", a Season 3 (2005) Crash Scene Investigation episode of the Canadian TV series Mayday For broadcasters that do not use the series name Mayday, this is one of three Season 3 episodes labeled as Crash Scene Investigation spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1959 to 1966, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of Dufferin Roblin. The son of Albert George Smellie and Jessie May Cummings, Smellie was born in Russell, was educated at Brandon College and the Manitoba Law School, and worked as a barrister at law before entering politics. He served in the Canadian Army with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles during World War II and was a member of the Canadian Legion and of the Manitoba Travel and Convention Association. In 1946, Smellie married Lois Evelyn Cochrane. He was originally a supporter of the Liberal- Progressives, but was drafted by Dufferin Roblin to join the Progressive Conservatives in the mid-1950s.Winnipeg Free Press, 13 February 1969, p. 15. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1958 provincial election, but lost to Liberal-Progressive incumbent Rodney Clement by 130 votes in the constituency of Birtle-Russell. He ran again in the 1959 election, and defeated Clement by 224 votes as the Progressive Conservatives won their first majority government in forty-five years. Smellie was re-elected by a greater margin in the 1962 election, and was named Minister of Municipal Affairs on February 27, 1963. He remained in this position until July 22, 1966, when he was demoted to minister without portfolio. He lost to Rod Clement by 145 votes in the 1966 provincial election. After his defeat, Smellie served chair of the Manitoba Local Boundaries Commission. This group produced a report on Winnipeg's internal boundaries in 1970, but its findings were superseded by the creation of a unicity the following year. After he retired from the practice of law, he served as chairman of the Municipal Board of Manitoba. Smellie died in 2005.

While all three uncompleted works had been posthumously published, only Tom Sawyer's Conspiracy displays a complete plot and nearly complete story. Twain abandoned the other two works after finishing only a few chapters. Tom Sawyer Thomas \\"Tom\\" Sawyer, based on the young Samuel Clemens, is a cunning and playful boy of about 12 years of age, and the protagonist of the story. His best friends include Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn. He has a half-brother, Sid Sawyer, a cousin, Mary, and an Aunt Polly, the sister of his dead mother. He lives with them in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri. Also, he has another aunt, Sally Phelps, who lives considerably farther down the Mississippi River, in the town of Pikesville. Tom loves to go on adventures and wants to become an Indian pirate. He fell in love with his classmate Becky Thatcher and was once \\"engaged\\" to Amy Lawrence. Tom is imaginative and obsessed with stories. Despite his mischief, Tom is good-hearted and has an active moral code as well. Thomas relatives =Sally and Silas Phelps= Tom and Sid's other aunt, Sally Phelps, lives considerably farther down the Mississippi River, in the town of Pikesville. She is married to Silas Phelps. =Aunt Polly= Mary's mother and Tom and Sid's aunt, the sister of their dead mother. Tom and Sid live with Aunt Polly and her daughter Mary. She does at first seem a bit controlling and abusive, but in spite of the relentless discipline and spiritual guidance she dispenses, she comes off as a caring, noble character. When Tom points out that nobody seems to care about Huck's being alive after they were both presumed dead, Aunt Polly generously gives her love to Huck as well, saying, \\"And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!\\" and the \\"loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before\\". In fact, the last impression we get of Aunt Polly is of a similar nature: \\"There was something about Aunt Polly's manner when she kissed Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again\\". She is a very bright woman and she cares about Tom, Sid, Mary and Huck. =Mary= Aunt Polly's daughter, and Tom and Sid's cousin. She is gentle and good-natured and has great patience with Tom despite his tricks. It is unsaid whether or not she is older than the siblings, but due to her mature personality we are led to believe so. =Sid Sawyer= Tom's whiny half-brother, who also lives with Aunt Polly and Mary. He behaves well but enjoys getting Tom into trouble and tattles on Tom. He appears to be around nine years old and lies; he also seems to annoy Tom frequently. Other characters =Huckleberry Finn= Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn is the protagonist and narrator of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer Abroad, and Tom Sawyer, Detective. Huck is one of Tom's best friends. After The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Huck describes his own adventure in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, including how he escapes from his drunken, abusive father, and how he met Jim, the runaway slave. =Pap Finn= Huck's abusive, drunken father. He had vanished prior to the beginning of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn but shows up at the beginning of that story and forcibly takes his son to live with him. He also tries to sue Judge Thatcher to get the six thousand dollars Huck had given the Judge for safekeeping, and confiscates whatever money Huck has in his pocket, using it to get drunk. He is infuriated that his son would try to amount to more than he did and live in better conditions. He demands that Huck quit school, threatening him with whipping. Soon after Huck escapes, Pap Finn leaves to search for him and doesn't return. At the end of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Jim reveals to Huck that the corpse they found in the abandoned house early in the book was actually that of Huck's father. Pap Finn's backstory is explored in Finn: A Novel (2007), by Jon Clinch. =Joe Harper= Joseph \\"Joe\\" Harper one of Tom's best friends. He joins Tom and Huck as a pirate when they run away from home to Jacksons Island. He makes a few other small appearances in the novel, including playing Robin Hood in the woods and getting caught not paying attention in class with Tom, but he gradually disappears as the plot of the novel ensues. His mother is Sereny Harper and his sisters are Susan and Faith Harper. He is the first to get homesick while on the island with Tom and Huck. =Injun Joe= Injun Joe is the primary antagonist in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. One night, Injun Joe, Dr. Robinson and Muff Potter are in the graveyard to steal a body from a grave for Dr. Robinson, but once Injun Joe and Muff Potter have exhumed the body, they demanded additional money from Dr. Robinson. Injun Joe reminds the doctor of an incident which he says he has not forgotten and then kills him. Injun Joe blames Muff Potter for the murder, but Tom and Huckleberry Finn witnesses the murder, and at Muff Potter's trial, Tom Sawyer testifies that Injun Joe was the killer. Injun Joe runs from the courtroom, leaving Tom in fear of retribution. Eventually, Injun Joe is found dead behind a newly sealed cave entrance, having starved to death. =The Ragged Man= He is an accomplice to Injun Joe while they both try to hide robbery loot and discover coins from John Murrell. About the time of Injun Joe's accidental death in the cave, the body of the \\"ragged man\\" is found near the town's water landing-after apparently drowning. His name was Emmett in Disney's 1995 film Tom and Huck. =Jim= Jim flees slavery with Huck, who was escaping his drunken father, but he may have chosen to accompany Huck out of mere boredom. Jim hopes to reach the free states and buy his family's freedom. He is polite and good-natured, and accompanies Huck throughout the story. At the end of the book, Tom reveals that his owner had died since they left home, and she had freed Jim in her will. Of Jim, Russell Baker wrote: :\\"The people whom Huck and Jim encounter on the Mississippi are drunkards, murderers, bullies, swindlers, lynchers, thieves, liars, mows, frauds, child abusers, numbskulls, hypocrites, windbags and traders in human flesh. All are white. The one man of honor in this phantasmagoria is 'Nigger Jim,' as Twain called him to emphasize the irony of a society in which the only true gentleman was held beneath contempt.\\" =The \\"King\\" and the \\"Duke\\"= Two con men whom Huck meets in his adventures down the Mississippi and the main antagonists of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. They join Huck and Jim on the raft to escape an angry mob that was chasing them out of a town. The younger one initially claims to be the true heir of the Duke of Bridgewater, and the older one the lost son of Louis XVI and the rightful king of France. Thus, Huck refers to them as \\"the king\\" and \\"the duke\\" throughout the narration of the book. During their time in the story, they collaborate to stage many shenanigans, including pretending to be the brothers of a deceased man so they can steal the money left to them in the will. They are later separated from Huck and Jim, tarred and feathered, and ridden out of town on a rail. =Amy Lawrence= Amy is Becky Thatcher's rival for most of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and dislikes Becky. Amy is Tom's first love, but is swept from his thoughts the moment he sees Becky. After a little slip-up from Tom, he returns to Amy to make Becky jealous. =Muff Potter= Muff Potter is a drunk friendly fisherman who loves children and is a close friend of Tom and Huck. He often mends the children's kites and helps them fish. Muff Potter is falsely accused of murdering Dr. Robinson at the beginning of the story. In fact, Injun Joe killed the Doctor and managed to convince Muff that he had committed the murder himself. =Dr. Robinson= The doctor who wanted the grave dug up. He was subsequently murdered by Injun Joe, who framed Muff Potter for the crime. A different character of the same name in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was the only man who recognized that the King and Duke were phonies when they tried to pretend to be British. He warned the townspeople, but they ignored him. =Ben (Benjamin) Rogers= Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Rogers is another child, Tom's age. In chapter 2, Tom convinces Ben to whitewash the fence for him. He gives Tom an apple to do so. Tom wants Ben to be in his crew of robbers. =Becky Thatcher= Becky is Judge Thatcher's daughter, known for being Tom Sawyer's love interest. Her long blonde hair is always worn in braids. She wins Tom's love from the first moment he sees her. When she first encounters Tom, she gives him a purple pansy to show her love. She soon becomes engaged to him by swearing to love only him and sealing their engagement with a kiss. When he mentions that he used to be with Amy Lawrence, Becky believes he still loves Amy and gets angry at him. Tom wins her back by telling a lie and takes the whipping for the breaking of their teacher's anatomy book, which she accidentally rips. In Huckleberry Finn she is also referred to as \\"Bessie\\". Becky was based on Laura Hawkins, an actual friend of Samuel Clemens. =Judge Thatcher= Although Judge Thatcher plays a minor role in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, he plays a substantial role in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Judge Thatcher shares responsibility for Huckleberry Finn with the Widow Douglas, and it is to Judge Thatcher that Huckleberry Finn signs over his fortune in order to keep it from his father. =Mr. Dobbins= The hated schoolmaster at Tom's school, who has taken the job after failing to become a doctor. He is easily angered and is described as \\"short-tempered.\\" References External links * The Adventures of Tom Sawyer - Full text in easy-to-read HTML format * Tom Sawyer Abroad - Full text * Tom Sawyer, Detective - Full text * Information about Huck Finn Tom Sawyer Fictional characters from Missouriu ","title":"List of Tom Sawyer characters"},{"id":"1772988","text":"Impetus is a reissue of the EP Passive Restraints by the band Clutch in 1997.

Blisters are generally one to two millimeters in size and heal over three weeks. However, they often recur. Redness is not usually present. Repeated attacks may result in fissures and skin thickening. The cause is unknown. Triggers may include allergens, physical or mental stress, frequent hand washing, or metals. Diagnosis is typically based on what it looks like and the symptoms. Allergy testing and culture may be done to rule out other problems. Other conditions that produce similar symptoms include pustular psoriasis and scabies. Avoiding triggers may be useful as may a barrier cream. Treatment is generally with steroid cream. High strength steroid creams may be required for the first week or two. Antihistamines may be used to help with the itch. If this is not effective steroid pills, tacrolimus, or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) may be tried. About 1 in 2,000 people are affected in Sweden. Males and females appear to be affected equally. It explains about one in five cases of hand dermatitis. The first description was in 1873. The name comes from the word \\"dyshidrotic\\", meaning \\"difficult sweating\\", as problems with sweating was once believed to be the cause. Signs and symptoms Dyshidrosis has been described as having the following characteristics: * Itchiness of the palms or soles, followed the a sudden development of intensely itchy small blisters on the sides of the fingers, the palms or the feet. * These blisters are often described as having a \\"tapioca pudding\\" appearance. * After a few weeks, the small blisters eventually disappear as the top layer of skin falls off. * These eruptions do not occur elsewhere on the body. * The eruptions may be symmetrical.

File:Rim of scale on plantar surface of thumb.jpgRim of scale on the palmar surface of the thumb from a resolving dyshidrotic flare Causes The exact causes of dyshidrosis are unknown. Food allergens may be involved in certain cases. Cases studies have implicated a wide range of foods including tuna, tomato, pineapple, chocolate, coffee, and spices among others. A number of studies have implicated balsam of Peru. A 2013 study found that dyshydrosis on the hands increased among those allergic to house dust mites, following inhalation of house dust mite allergen. Id reaction and irritant contact dermatitis are possible causes.  Diagnosis  Dyshidrosis is diagnosed clinically, by gathering a patient's history and making careful observations (see signs and symptoms section). Severity of symptoms can also be assessed using the dyshidrotic eczema area and severity index (DASI). The DASI has been designed for clinical trials and is not typically used in practice.  Treatment  There are many treatments available for dyshidrosis. However, few of them have been developed or tested specifically on the condition. * Barriers to moisture and irritants, including barrier creams and gloves. * Topical steroids ‚Äì while useful, can be dangerous long-term due to the skin-thinning side-effects, which are particularly troublesome in the context of hand dyshidrosis, due to the amount of toxins and bacteria the hands typically come in contact with. * Potassium permanganate dilute solution soaks ‚Äì also popular, and used to 'dry out' the vesicles, and kill off superficial Staphylococcus aureus, but it can also be very painful. Undiluted it may cause significant burning. * Dapsone (diamino-diphenyl sulfone), an antibacterial, has been recommended for the treatment of dyshidrosis in some chronic cases. * Antihistamines: Fexofenadine up to 180 mg per day. * Alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic acid) has been approved for prescription in the UK. It is specifically used for chronic hand and foot eczema. It is made by Basilea of Switzerland (BAL 4079). * Systemic steroids can be taken orally to treat especially acute and severe cases of dyshidrosis.  Epidemiology  About 1 in 2,000 people are affected in Sweden. Males and females appear to be affected equally. Synonyms Dyshidrosis is also known as pompholyx, a term originating from the Greek word for \\"bubble\\".

Album Information  The initial limited release contained 12 tracks in 1999 and was a European release only to begin with, and had to be an import for their home country USA, but in 2004 it was reissued by Megaforce Records with three additional tracks, \\"The Drifter,\\" \\"I Send Pictures,\\" and \\"Sink 'Em Low\\" added to the album's song list. The version of \\"Sink 'Em Low\\" found on the reissue is the demo version of the same track found on Pure Rock Fury, which is faster and heavier. The track \\"One Eye Dollar\\" was re-recorded in 2007 on the album From Beale Street to Oblivion. It was another example of the band releasing demo versions to songs that would later become something slightly different, as they did with Impetus, Pitchfork & Lost Needles and Slow Hole to China, the former being a reissue itself, the middle album a compilation of early material as well as unreleased, and the latter having its own reissue some years later with extra tracks, just like this album did. It captures the various styles of the band, with a very diverse mix of Punk / Heavy roots, through their more Stoner Rocker styles, it adds some Blues Rock to the mix finally with unaccredited Organ on some tracks (a style the band would embrace in the future much more prolifically) and continues with some of their Funk Metal efforts as well.

Late in life he worked to memorialize the Trail, repeatedly retracing the trip of his youth. Once known as the \\"Hop King of the World\\", he was the first mayor of Puyallup, Washington. Meeker was born in Butler County, Ohio, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family relocated to Indiana when he was a boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to profit from the gold rush. Meeker became convinced that the Oregon Trail was being forgotten, and he determined to bring it publicity so it could be marked and monuments erected. In 1906‚Äì1908, although in his late 70s, he retraced his steps along the Oregon Trail by wagon, seeking to build monuments in communities along the way. His trek reached New York, and in Washington, D.C. he met President Theodore Roosevelt. He traveled the Trail again several times in the final two decades of this life, including by oxcart in 1910‚Äì1912 and by airplane in 1924. During another such trip, in 1928, Meeker fell ill but was succored by Henry Ford. On his return to Washington state, Meeker became ill again and died there on December 3, 1928 at age 97. Meeker wrote several books; his work has continued through the activities of such groups as the Oregon-California Trails Association. Early life Drawing of Meeker delivering a newspaper to Henry Ward Beecher Ezra Manning Meeker was born in Butler County, Ohio, near Huntsville, on December 29, 1830, the son of Jacob (1804‚Äì1869) and Phoebe (Baker) Meeker (1801‚Äì1854). His paternal ancestors had been among the early settlers of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where their ancestral home was located. In the American Revolutionary War, about twenty Meekers fought for the new nation. Ezra was the fourth of the six children Jacob and Phoebe had together, with older brothers John, Manning (died at age one week) and Oliver, and a younger sister Hannah and brother Clark. Jacob was a miller and farmer. In 1839, the family moved from Ohio to Indiana, close to Indianapolis‚ÄîEzra and his older brother Oliver walked behind the family wagon for . Ezra had little formal education; he later estimated a total of six months. Phoebe, seeing that her son's mind was not well adapted to formal learning, allowed him to earn money through odd jobs. He obtained work as printer's devil at the Indianapolis Journal, where his duties involved delivering the newspaper to subscribers, among them local pastor Henry Ward Beecher. In 1845, Phoebe's father, a Cincinnati merchant, gave his daughter $1,000, enough to buy the family a farm. As both Jacob and Ezra Meeker realized the boy enjoyed the outdoor life more than inside work, Jacob placed Ezra in charge of the farm, allowing the elder Meeker to work as a miller. Migration to Oregon Territory (1852) Ezra Meeker married his childhood sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, and like the Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, he told her he wanted to farm, which she accepted as long as it was on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters‚Äîa prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail. The eastern half of Meeker's migration, as far as Fort Laramie That April, Ezra, Eliza Jane, Oliver, and Marion Meeker set out to journey to Oregon, some in all. With their wagon, they had two yokes of oxen, one of cows and an extra cow. They were accompanied by William Buck, who would remain with them much of the way before separating from them to go to California. Buck outfitted the wagon, Meeker selected the animals, and with his wife carefully prepared food supplies. The wagons of Meeker's grouping traveled together by informal agreement; there was no wagon master in overall charge. A number of Oliver Meeker's friends from Indianapolis joined the group before the party left Iowa. They crossed the Missouri River at the small Mormon settlement of Kanesville (today Council Bluffs, Iowa). Meeker recounted that, as he stood on the far side of the Missouri, he felt as if he had left the United States. As they journeyed westward along the Platte River in Nebraska Territory, there were such large numbers traveling that they were never out of sight of the tens of thousands of other pioneers journeying west that year. Sometimes several wagons advanced side by side. The Meekers chose a slow, steady pace, unlike many who sought to rush along as quickly as possible. Piles of abandoned possessions lined the way, cast aside to lighten loads. As the party went further west, they passed some of those who had hurried past them, and whose wagons had broken down or whose oxen had died as a result of failure to care for them properly. Disease was an ever-present risk; at the present site of Kearney, Nebraska, Oliver Meeker was stricken with illness. This led to a division of the group when most of Oliver's friends, including later Idaho Territory governor David W. Ballard, refused to wait. Oliver recovered after four days, and was one of the lucky ones‚Äîhis brother later estimated that one in ten of those who took the Trail perished during the journey. Ezra Meeker remembered meeting one wagon train, slowly moving east against the flow of traffic. That group had made it as far as Fort Laramie (today in Wyoming) before losing the last of its menfolk, and the women and children turned back, hoping to regain their homes in the East. He never learned if they made it. According to local historians Bert and Margie Webber, \\"all of these deaths made a great impression on the young man\\". The western half of Meeker's migration They encountered Native Americans, who would sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given and none of the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting bison, which roamed the Great Plains in huge numbers. Despite being a source of food, the bison were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the California Trail separated from the Oregon, and Buck and some of the rest of the party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths. Meeker found that the final stretch between Fort Boise (now Boise, Idaho) and The Dalles was the most difficult. The section is filled with mountains and deserts, and there was little chance of supplementing stores. Those who entered this segment with exhausted teams or minimal supplies often died along it. Others shed baggage brought across half a continent, saving only provisions. Parties who feared this part of the journey sometimes tried to float down the Snake and Columbia Rivers; many were wrecked in the rapids and died. At The Dalles, where river passage was available to Portland, the Meeker party found a motley crowd of emigrants. With the money earned at the ferry, they booked passage downriver. Oliver Meeker brought the livestock ahead overland, and met Ezra and his family on their arrival in Portland on October 1, 1852, where they slept inside a house for the first time since leaving Iowa. Ezra Meeker had lost and possessed $2.75 in cash. All of the party survived, although Jacob Davenport, one of Oliver Meeker's friends from Indiana, became ill on the final part of the trip and died some weeks after reaching Portland. All but one of the livestock completed the trip‚Äîa cow was lost while crossing the Missouri River. Ezra Meeker considered his journey over the Oregon Trail to have been the making of him as a man. Territorial pioneer =Early days= Meeker's cabin at Kalama Meeker's first employment in the Pacific Northwest was unloading a ship that had docked at Portland. He moved to the nearby town of St. Helens, where construction of a wharf in competition with Portland's was under way‚ÄîOliver rented a house to lodge workers in, and Ezra went to help his brother. By this time, Ezra Meeker and his wife were determined to fulfill their original plan to farm, and when work was abandoned on the wharf, he went to find land which could be cultivated. Meeker first made a claim in January 1853 about downriver from Portland, on the current site of Kalama, Washington. There, he built a log cabin and began his first farm. He did not build close to the water, which proved fortunate as there was a major flood on the Columbia soon after he claimed the land. Instead, he profited from the incident, selling logs the river left on his claim, together with trees he chopped down, for lumber. In April 1853, Meeker heard that the lands north of the Columbia would become a separate territory (named Washington Territory), with its capital on Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific. He decided to travel north with his brother to scout for lands to claim around the waterway. There were as yet only about 500 European-descended inhabitants in the Puget Sound region, of which 100 were in the village of Olympia, which would become the territorial (and later state) capital. Despite there only being a few settlers, there was considerable activity in the area‚Äîthe lumber of Puget Sound fueled San Francisco's building boom. The Meekers' first view of Puget Sound was unprepossessing; the tide was out, exposing mud flats. Nevertheless, they pressed on, building a skiff to travel by water. They were met by friendly Indians, who sold them clams and taught them how to cook the shellfish. Engaging one of the Native Americans as guide, they explored the area, looking for good, well-located farmland. At one point, they entered the Puyallup River, in a region where no white settlers lived, and camped on the present site of Puyallup, but were deterred by the large number of huge trees, which would make it difficult to clear land for farming. They decided on tracts on McNeil Island, not far from the thriving town of Steilacoom, where the farm's produce could be sold. Oliver remained on the island to build a cabin while his brother went back to fetch family and possessions, and sell their old claims at Kalama. He returned to a cabin in which they installed a glass window that looked over the water to Steilacoom, with a view of Mount Rainier. The Meeker claim was later the site of McNeil Island Corrections Center. Meeker at age 23 in 1854 Later in 1853, Ezra and Oliver Meeker received a three-month-old letter from their father, stating that he and other family members wanted to emigrate, and would do so if Oliver Meeker could return to assist them. They immediately responded that Oliver would return to Indiana by early the following year, and put their plans on hold to prepare for and finance his journey by steamship and rail. In August 1854, Ezra Meeker received word that his relatives were en route, but were delayed and short on provisions. He quickly went to their aid, intending to guide them through the Naches Pass into the Puget Sound area. When he found his family's party close to the first Fort Walla Walla (near Richland, Washington), he learned that his mother and a younger brother had died along the Trail. He guided the survivors through the pass and to his claim on McNeil Island. Jacob Meeker saw only limited prospects on the island, and the family took claims near Tacoma, where they operated a general store in Steilacoom. On November 5, 1855, Ezra Meeker claimed of land called Swamp Place, near Fern Hill, southeast of Tacoma. He began to improve the land, planting a garden and an orchard. Pursuant to the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, settlers purchased lands from the Indians. The agreement, signed under duress, restricted the Native Americans to inadequate reservations, and in 1855, the Puget Sound War broke out, bringing unrest to the region over the following two years. Ezra Meeker had maintained good relations with the Native Americans, and did not fight in the conflict, though he accompanied one expedition to recover possessions captured by the Indians. A controversial aspect of the war was the trials and hanging of Chief Leschi, deemed responsible for killing during the conflict. Meeker sat on the jury in the first trial, which resulted in a hung jury, with Meeker and another man holding out for acquittal on the grounds that Leschi was a combatant in wartime. A second trial convicted Leschi, and he was hanged. Meeker described the execution as wrongful, and in later years wrote of the incident. In 1895, Meeker chartered a special train to bring whites to Leschi's reburial on tribal land, and in 2004 the Washington State Senate passed a resolution that Leschi had been unjustly treated; a special historical tribunal made up of past and present justices of the Washington Supreme Court also exonerated Leschi as both he and the man he was said to have killed were combatants. =\\"Hop King of the World\\"= Ezra Meeker's farm at Swamp Place was not a success as the land was too poor to grow crops. The family continued to run the store in Steilacoom. On January 5, 1861, Oliver Meeker drowned while returning from a buying trip to San Francisco, when his ship, the Northerner, sank off the California coast. The Meekers had borrowed to finance the trip, and the losses from this disaster reduced Ezra Meeker to near penury. He secured the squatter's claim of Jerry Stilly on land in the Puyallup Valley, and moved his wife and children there in 1862. While clearing his own holdings, he earned money by helping to clear the land of others. His father and surviving brother, John Meeker, also had claims in the valley. John Meeker had come to Washington Territory by ship in 1859 and had settled in the Puyallup Valley. Ezra Meeker ran for the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1861, but was defeated. In 1869, Meeker ran for Pierce County Surveyor; he was defeated by James Gallagher, 138 votes to 116. In 1865, Olympia brewer Isaac Wood imported some hop roots from the United Kingdom, hopeful that they would do well in the Pacific Northwest. As hops, used to flavor beer, were not then grown locally, the cost of transport from Britain or New York made his beer expensive, and he hoped Puget Sound-area farmers would grow hops and supply him. He was a friend of Jacob Meeker, and gave him the roots to grow. Jacob passed some of them on to Ezra. The plants grew extremely well, and at the end of the season, the Meekers earned $185 from selling Wood the crop. Such a sum was rarely seen in the Puyallup Valley at that time, and a hop-growing boom promptly began. Ezra Meeker, with his head start, was able to repeatedly expand operations, he eventually had of hop-growing lands. He also built one of the first hop-drying kilns in the valley. For years Meeker supplied Portland brewer Henry Weinhard. Meeker, circa 1880 The fertile soil and temperate climate of the valley proved ideal for hops. Not only did the plants thrive, farmers were able to obtain four or five times the usual yield. Meeker, never one to miss an opportunity, formed his own hop brokerage business. In 1870, he penned an 80-page pamphlet, Washington Territory West of the Cascades, to promote investment in the region. He took ship for San Francisco, then journeyed east by the new transcontinental railroad, hoping to get the railroads to expand to his region. He met with newspaper editor Horace Greeley (known for his famous advice, \\"Go West, young man\\") and with railroad mogul Jay Cooke as part of his promotional blitz. Cooke, who was building the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the northern tier of the country, not only bought up Meeker's pamphlets to give away to potential investors, but hired Meeker to drum up interest in his railroad. While working from a Manhattan office, Meeker dressed like city dwellers, but did not entirely lose his frontier habits, often stirring a lump of butter into his coffee. In 1877, Meeker filed a plat for a townsite to surround his cabin. He named the town Puyallup, using the local Indian words for generous people, according to Meeker. The local post office had previously been called \\"Franklin\\", a common designation in the United States; Meeker, the town's first postmaster, stated that the new name was likely to remain unique. He later admitted that the pronunciation of Puyallup caused confusion when he visited England‚Äîit still remains difficult for non-locals. Meeker strove to improve life in the region, and donated land and money towards town buildings and parks, a theatre and a hotel while defraying the start-up costs of a wood products factory. The Ezra Meeker Historical Society, in their 1972 pamphlet on his life, wrote of his activities: The domain of the Hop King Hops made many farmers wealthy, including Meeker, who at one point claimed he had earned a half million dollars for his crop. In 1880, he wrote his first book, Hop Culture in the United States, and soon after became known as the \\"Hop King of the World\\". By the 1880s, he was the wealthiest man in the territory, and had formed a London branch of his hop brokerage. He served as Washington Territory's representative at the 1885‚Äì1886 North Central & South American Exposition in New Orleans; he also took exhibits to London's Colonial and Indian Exposition after the New Orleans fair closed. In 1886, Meeker sought the Republican nomination for territorial delegate to Congress, but was defeated after many ballots at the party convention. He became a supporter of women's suffrage, which was the subject of a long-running political battle in Washington Territory, a dispute which lasted well after statehood in 1889. Eliza Jane felt that the family should live in a better house than their original cabin, and between 1887 and 1890 built what became known as the Meeker Mansion in Puyallup. The cost was $26,000, a very large sum at the time. An Italian artist lived with the Meekers for a year, painting careful details on the ceilings. The Meekers moved in during 1890, the same year Puyallup was formally incorporated under state law‚Äîthey donated their old homesite to the town for a park. In 1890, Meeker served as first mayor of Puyallup. He was elected to a second, non-consecutive term for 1892. Ruin and Klondike Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker stand before their onetime cabin, Puyallup (c. 1890s). In 1891, a blight of hop aphids struck the hop-growing West Coast from British Columbia to California. Although sprays of various liquids were used in an attempt to defeat the insects, use of such pesticides damaged the hops. In 1892, the crop decreased to half of what it had been before the infestation. Meeker had advanced money to many growers, who were unable to repay him. The problems in the valley were made worse by the Panic of 1893, a severe worldwide depression. Business after business in which Meeker had invested failed, such as the Puyallup Electric Light Company. He was overextended, and lost much of his fortune, and eventually his lands to foreclosure. Meeker spent part of the winter of 1895‚Äì1896 in London, recouping what he could from his interests there. In 1896, gold was discovered both in Alaska and in Canada, and when Meeker returned from the United Kingdom, he found his sons, Marion and Fred, preparing to leave for Cook Inlet, Alaska. They found all the worthwhile claims had already been taken. Nevertheless, the Meeker family saw the finds as a possible road to financial recovery, and founded a company to buy and sell mining claims, though they knew little about the trade. In 1897, Meeker and his sons journeyed to the Kootenay country of southeastern British Columbia, where gold had been found. Despite the fact Meeker was aged 66, he undertook a full share of the labor. Both Meeker sons filed claims in Canada, but the mines required additional investment. Meeker raised money to travel to New York to speak with his old contacts, where he received more promises than cash. On the return leg he failed to raise money in visits in Illinois and Minneapolis and by July 1897, he was back in the Kootenays, working the claim. When the gold discovery in the Klondike in northwestern Canada was publicized that year, Meeker saw that as a better opportunity, and sent his son Fred to investigate. Fred Meeker returned with a report in November; the Meekers sought to finance a mining expedition to the Klondike, but failed to raise adequate money from investors. Meeker (far right) stands before his first Klondike grocery store, Dawson City, Yukon, November 19, 1898. Despite his inability to raise funds for mining, Meeker was certain there was a way to make money from the gold rush. He and Eliza Jane spent much of the winter of 1897‚Äì1898 drying vegetables, and Ezra Meeker departed for Skagway, Alaska, on March 20, 1898 with of dried produce‚ÄîFred Meeker and his wife Clara were already across the border in what would soon be designated as the Yukon Territory. The 67-year-old Meeker, with one business associate, climbed the steep Chilkoot Pass. With thousands of others in boats and on rafts, he floated down the Yukon River once the ice broke up in late May, and sold his vegetables in two weeks in Dawson City. He returned to Puyallup in July, only to set out again with more supplies the following month. This time, he and his son-in-law, Roderick McDonald, opened a store, the Log Cabin Grocery, in Dawson City, and remained through the winter. The Meeker Mansion (seen in 2008) Meeker returned to the Yukon twice more, in 1899 and 1900. Most of the money earned through groceries was invested in gold mining, and was lost. When he departed the Klondike for the last time in April 1901, he left behind him the body of his son Fred, dead of pneumonia in Dawson City on January 30, 1901. In his writings, Meeker ascribed his sudden departure from the Yukon in 1901 to mining losses and his upcoming 50th wedding anniversary. Meeker scholar Dennis M. Larsen in his book on the pioneer's Klondike adventure suggests that a more likely reason was attempts by those who had lost money in Meeker's enterprises in the 1890s to gain the family's remaining major asset, the Meeker Mansion. That property was sold by Eliza Jane Meeker to her daughter Caroline and son-in-law Eben Osborne for $10,000 in mid-1901 and later that year both Ezra and Eliza Jane executed documents stating that the house had been her separate property, paid for with funds not deriving from Ezra. The sale to the Osbornes included provisions that Ezra and Eliza Jane were to have lifetime residence and $50 per month. Ezra Meeker did not live there after his wife's death in 1909, and the Osbornes sold the house in 1915. Eben Osborne died in 1922, survived by his 91-year-old father in law. Promoting the Trail =Preparation for 1906 trip= Meeker spent the years after the Klondike in Puyallup, where he wrote and served as president of the Washington State Historical Society, which he had helped to found in 1891. The Ezra Meeker Historical Society described their namesake's situation after the Klondike expeditions: Meeker had long contemplated the idea of marking the Oregon Trail, over which he had traveled in 1852, with granite monuments. By the early 20th century, he was convinced that the Trail was in danger of being forgotten. Farmers were plowing up the Trail bit by bit, and as towns and cities grew along it, the Trail vanished under streets and buildings. Meeker viewed its preservation as an urgent matter because of this slow disappearance. He wanted the Trail properly marked, and monuments erected to honor the dead. Meeker came up with a scheme to travel along the Trail again by ox-drawn wagon, raising public awareness for his cause. He believed that public interest would provide enough money both to build markers and maintain himself along the way. Though many hucksters traveled by wagon, selling patent nostrums, Meeker felt that he would stand out, as an authentic pioneer able to tell real stories of the Trail‚Äîespecially if he used authentic gear. He felt that it was likely that once newspapers got wind of his travels, they would give him ample coverage. Ezra Meeker wagon, Washington State History Museum. Photographed during its temporary return to public view, in 2012. Meeker did not have much money, so he raised it from friends. Ox-drawn wagons were not a common sight in the Puyallup of 1906; Meeker was unable to find an authentic complete wagon, and eventually used metal parts from the remains of three different ones. The construction was done by Cline & McCoy of Puyallup. Meeker found a pair of oxen; even though one proved unsuitable, the owner insisted on him purchasing both. The one Meeker kept, named Twist, was lodged at the stockyards in Tacoma as he sought another. Meeker fixed on a herd of steers which had been brought in from Montana. He decided on one which was particularly heavy, which he named Dave. Although Dave gave Meeker much difficulty, beginning with the drive home to Puyallup after the purchase, the animal eventually helped pull the wagon over . Meeker's dog Jim Although Meeker had not had a dog in his wagon in 1852, he knew that people liked them, and sought to add one to his crew. Jim, a large, friendly collie who became an expedition member and Meeker's companion for the next six years, had belonged to one of Meeker's neighbors, a Mr. James. Meeker was impressed by the way Jim drove James' chickens out of the area where the family grew berries, by moving slowly. Five dollars to one of James' children secured the purchase. Some of Meeker's friends tried to talk him out of the trip; one local minister warned against this \\"impracticable project\\", stating that it was \\"cruel to let this aged man start on this journey only to perish by exposure in the mountains\\". Meeker had taken an ox team and wagon to Portland's Lewis and Clark Exposition in 1905; en route he had kept his eyes open for places to set up suitable monuments on the Cowlitz Trail, on which pioneers had journeyed from the Columbia River to Puget Sound. He made arrangements with locals in towns along that trail to raise money to build monuments there. He gave lectures as a fundraiser, but raised little money. He took his team and wagon for daylong shakedown trips, despite the mocking of some who remembered him as Hop King. After several days camped on his lawn as practice for the trip, and then in other nearby locales, Meeker set out from Olympia on February 19, 1906. =Return to the Trail (1906‚Äì1908)= First monument erected by Ezra Meeker on his trek, Tenino, Washington (seen in 2013) According to Larsen in his book on Meeker's journey east, The first stop after Olympia for \\"The Old Oregon Trail Monument Expedition\\" was Tenino, Washington, where Meeker went ahead by train on February 20, 1906, to make arrangements for the first monument of the trip. He still had no driver, and had his wagon pulled to Tenino by horses, with the oxen trailing behind. He appealed to a local quarry for a suitable stone, which was carved and was dedicated in Tenino at a ceremony on the 21st. He had less success as he journeyed south towards Portland; at none of the remaining Washington stops was a monument erected, and although Meeker placed wooden posts where monuments should go, most of the designated towns did not follow through. The lack of enthusiasm about Meeker's mission continued in Portland, where the Unitarian church elders voted against allowing Meeker the use of the building to give a fundraising lecture, pledging to do nothing to \\"encourage that old man to go out on the Plains to die\\". In Portland, Meeker lost his remaining helpers (one refused to take a pay cut, the others for personal reasons). One stayed on for the boat voyage up the Columbia before leaving at The Dalles, where Meeker hired a driver/cook, William Mardon, at $30 per month. He remained with Meeker for the next three years. Meeker also installed an odometer on his wagon, calling The Dalles \\"Mile Zero\\" of his expedition. In The Dalles, Meeker engaged in activities which would set the pattern for his progress along the Trail: He showed off himself, his wagon and animals, to the public, and sold tickets for a lecture (fifty cents for adults, half that for children) he would give about the Oregon Trail, including images shown with a stereopticon. He also met with members of civic committees to raise money for a local monument. Often these monuments were erected after Meeker passed: he would position a post to designate its location. According to reporter James Aldredge in his 1975 article on Meeker's trip, \\"for a septuagenarian he must have been blessed with remarkable health and endurance ... When the curious procession got underway, not the least impressive part of it was Meeker himself, with his face framed by his flowing white hair and his patriarchal beard.\\" According to reporter Bart Ripp in his 1993 article on Meeker, \\"the first expedition east in 1906 was supposed to be a speaking tour, but people were more interested in seeing the old coot in a covered wagon. It was the 20th century, and Americans wanted a show.\\" As he journeyed east from The Dalles, Meeker met with more enthusiasm than in his home state as he slowly passed through Oregon and Idaho. As word began to spread, he sometimes found the townsfolk prepared for him, or with a stone ordered or even ready. The monument in Boise, dedicated by Meeker on April 30, 1906, stands on the grounds of the Idaho State Capitol. On the road, he camped as he had a half century before, but in towns most often took a hotel room, though who paid for this is uncertain. Near Pacific Springs, at South Pass in Wyoming, Meeker had a stone inscribed to mark where the Trail passes through the Continental Divide. Meeker remembered in a memoir, Meeker in Omaha Nebraska proved resistant to Meeker's sales pitch, and near Brady, the ox Twist died, possibly after eating a poisonous plant. Meeker had to wire home to supporters for money. He hired teams of horses to pull the wagon on a temporary basis, and an attempt with two cows was not successful. He was able to temporarily yoke Dave with a cow which proved more suitable. At the Omaha Stockyards, Meeker found another ox, which he named Dandy, and broke him in on the way to Indianapolis, near where Meeker had once lived and by road from Puyallup. Beginning in Nebraska, Meeker began to sell postcards from photos taken on the way‚Äîthere was then a craze for postcards in the United States. He also arranged for the printing of a book about his 1852 trip, much of which he wrote during noontime halts on his 1906 trip. The funds from the sales of these items allowed him to meet expenses on the road. Meeker's exploits were closely followed in newspapers on the West Coast as eastern and midwestern stories about him were reprinted there‚Äîwhen westerners perceived any slights towards Meeker, indignant editorials followed. Meeker in Wall Street After a visit to Eddyville, Iowa, from where he had set out in 1852, Meeker spent several weeks in Indianapolis, leaving on March 1, 1907, when his permit to sell on the streets there expired. With the Oregon Trail run completed, he proceeded east through Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York State, seeking to both raise public awareness and earn some money for himself through sales of his merchandise. He often spent several days in a location, so long as sales of postcards and books flourished. When the expedition reached New York City, Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. was absent but the acting mayor told Meeker that, although he could not grant him a permit, he would instruct the police not to molest him. The message was apparently not well-communicated, as at 161st and Amsterdam Avenue a policeman arrested Meeker's helper, Mardon, for driving cattle upon the streets of New York in violation of a local ordinance. A stalemate followed as Meeker refused to move his oxen and the police had no means of doing so. The situation was resolved when higher authority ordered Mardon's release. Meeker wanted to drive the length of Broadway; it took a month to get the legal problems resolved. It took him six hours to drive the length of Manhattan. He had arranged with the press for photographers, who took shots of him at the New York Stock Exchange and the sub-Treasury building across Wall Street. Later in his stay, he drove across the Brooklyn Bridge. Meeker shows his wagon to President Theodore Roosevelt. After a small family reunion at the old Meeker homestead near Elizabeth, New Jersey, Meeker headed south towards Washington, D.C. He had hoped to meet President Theodore Roosevelt at his summer home in Oyster Bay, New York, but Roosevelt's staff declined, offering a meeting in Washington instead. Members of the Washington State congressional delegation cleared the way, and Meeker met Roosevelt on November 29, 1907. The President went outside the White House to view Meeker's wagon and team, and expressed support for Meeker's activities, and for a Meeker proposal for a cross-country highway (there were then none) in honor of the pioneers. After Washington, the tour wound down: Meeker went home to Puyallup from Pittsburgh by train to see his ailing wife. On his return to the East, he arranged for transport by riverboat and train, with a journey across Missouri by wagon. The expedition was offloaded from the train in Portland, and Meeker proceeded north across Washington State (receiving a much warmer reception) on a slow route, finishing in Seattle on July 18, 1908. =Advocate for the Oregon Trail (1909‚Äì1925)= Meeker with his wagon, team, and restaurant at Seattle's 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition Meeker ran a large pioneer exhibit and restaurant at the 1909 Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle; he later ruefully stated the Exposition had cost him his earnings from the book and card sales during his wagon tour. Later that year, he spent time in California, journeying with his wagon and team. Eliza Jane Meeker died in 1909 in Seattle‚Äîshe had been in poor health for some years. Ezra Meeker was in San Francisco, peddling his wares, when his wife died‚Äîit took three days to locate him, after which he journeyed north for the funeral before returning to his work. On New Year's Day 1910, Meeker and his wagon and team participated in the Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. In 1910, the Humphrey Bill, to appropriate money for monuments to mark the Trail, passed the House of Representatives and was introduced in the Senate, with a proviso that no money would be spent unless the Secretary of War could certify that the work would not require any further appropriations. Ezra Meeker set out that year on another two-year-long expedition, with the emphasis this time on locating and marking where the Trail had been, rather than on building monuments. Sometimes the ruts in the ground from the emigrants' wagons still existed and made it obvious, but other times he had to rely on the memories of old settlers. He journeyed to Texas, but had no success in interesting people in his project there. His tour was ended in 1912 in Denver when a flood struck the city, resulting in damage to his books. Nevertheless, according to Green, Meeker's two trips resulted in the placement of 150 monuments. A version of the Humphrey Bill passed the Senate in 1913, but died when the House of Representatives took no action. Despite this failure, groups began marking western trails: the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution put up plaques along the Cowlitz Trail in 1916. The ox-team pioneer tries an airplane, 1921. Beginning in 1913, Meeker began to plan his role in the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. He had donated his wagon and oxen to a park in Tacoma: when officials there expressed concern about the cost of building a proper pavilion for them, Meeker reclaimed them and set off with them to California. Deeming Dandy unfit for the road, Meeker had him slaughtered in Portland in June 1914 and had the hide shipped back to Tacoma for taxidermy; in November, the same fate met Dave in California. Meeker's wagon was exhibited at the Exposition in San Francisco. His tales of the Oregon Trail became one of the star attractions of the Exposition. Nevertheless, he quarreled with the administrators of the Washington State Building, feeling that it should be open on Sundays, when the largest crowds came to the grounds. On his return, the oxen and wagon were mounted as an exhibit at the Washington State History Museum until it closed for a move to new premises in 1995. The wagon was then deemed too fragile for display. In 1916, the 85-year-old Meeker made another trip, this time by Pathfinder automobile. The Pathfinder Company, of Indianapolis, lent Meeker a car with a covered-wagon-style top and a driver as a publicity stunt. Meeker also received a small stipend, and journeyed in the vehicle from Washington, D.C. to Olympia. Meeker saw the use of a motor vehicle as publicizing the need for a transcontinental highway. During this trip, he lectured on the need for a national highway; before he left he met with President Woodrow Wilson and discussed the topic with him. Bernard Sun, whose grandparents were Oregon Trail pioneers in Wyoming, remembered another side of Meeker: Meeker with President Calvin Coolidge, 1924 Although World War I distracted public attention from Meeker and his activities, he used the time to plan for the future. On December 29, 1919, his 89th birthday, he began work on another book, Seventy Years of Progress in Washington, which was published to favorable reviews. In association with Dr. Howard R. Driggs, a professor of English education at the University of Utah and later at New York University, he published a revised version of his memoirs, Ox-Team Days on the Oregon Trail. In 1922, he fell ill for one of the few times in his life. Newspapers reported that he refused to stay in bed, and his grandson, a physician, stated that he was going to put Meeker back to bed and \\"I am going to keep him there‚Äîif I can. If I can.\\" Recovered, the nonagenarian Meeker began making fresh travel plans. With the International Air Races to be held at Dayton, Ohio, in 1924, Meeker tried to get the War Department to allow him to fly there. He was successful, and flew with the Army pilot, Oakley G. Kelly. At a stop in Boise, Meeker quipped they were making better time than with his ox team, and in Dayton met aviation pioneer Orville Wright, to whom he commented, \\"You'd be surprised at the difference between riding in a Prairie Schooner and in an airplane.\\" The publicity was so favorable that the Army had Kelly fly Meeker the rest of the way to Washington, D.C., where the onetime pioneer met President Calvin Coolidge in October 1924. Meeker returned to Seattle by train. Wanting the government to build a road over Naches Pass, where he had guided his father's party seventy years before, Meeker ran for the Washington House of Representatives in 1924 from the 47th district but was defeated in the Republican primary by 35 votes. In 1925, Meeker drove an ox team for several months while touring in J.C. Miller's Wild West Show. =Meeker reaches the end of the trail (1925‚Äì1928)= One side of the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar By 1925, Congress had still not passed an appropriation to mark the Trail. One means of federally sponsored fundraising at that time was to get Congress to authorize a commemorative coin (usually a half dollar) and designate a sponsoring organization to buy the issue at face value from the government and sell it to the public at a premium. Meeker got the idea from a group of Idahoans seeking a coin to further their preservation work at Fort Hall; he arranged a merger of efforts. Beginning in 1925, Meeker pressed for such a half dollar to honor the pioneers and provide money for his efforts, and in April 1926 he appeared before a Senate committee, urging the passage of legislation. Congress obliged, and Coolidge signed the bill on May 17, 1926 at a ceremony which Meeker attended. Meeker (lower right) at the dedication of the statue to himself, September 14, 1926 Meeker had founded the Old Oregon Trail Association in 1922. In early 1926, it was incorporated in New York as the Oregon Trail Memorial Association (OTMA), and was given office space there by the National Highways Association. The legislation authorizing the new coin designated the OTMA as the organization which could purchase Oregon Trail Memorial half dollars from the government. The piece was designed by Laura Gardin Fraser and her husband, James Earle Fraser (who had designed the Buffalo nickel). Six million coins were authorized, and a beginning was made by the striking of 48,000 for the Association at the Philadelphia Mint; when those ran low, 100,000 more were coined at the San Francisco Mint. Meeker was less successful with the later issue, and many remained unsold. Although the Bureau of the Mint struck more in 1928, these remained impounded until after Meeker's death, with tens of thousands of the earlier issues unsold. Seattle had been Meeker's home since moving out of the mansion, but in the mid-1920s the citizens of Puyallup sought to honor him by the erection of a statue in Pioneer Park, the site of Meeker's one-time homestead. They also sought to preserve the home site, over which Eliza Jane Meeker had planted ivy a half-century before, building a pergola to support the plant. With the statue and pergola completed, Meeker returned to Puyallup for the dedication ceremony in 1926. The same year, at age 95, Meeker published his first and only novel, Kate Mulhall, a Romance of the Oregon Trail. Ezra Meeker's grave, Puyallup, Washington Meeker was again advocating better roads, and gained the support of Henry Ford, who built him a Model A car with a covered wagon-style top, dubbed the Oxmobile, to be used in another expedition over the Trail to publicize Meeker's highway proposals. In October 1928, Meeker was hospitalized with pneumonia in Detroit. He returned to Seattle, where he fell ill again. Meeker was taken to a room in the Frye Hotel, where he told his daughter Ella Meeker Templeton, \\"I can't go. I have not yet finished my work.\\" Ezra Meeker died there on December 3, 1928, just under a month short of his 98th birthday. His body was taken in procession back to Puyallup, where he was interred beside his wife Eliza Jane in Woodbine Cemetery. Under a plaque based on the Oregon Trail Memorial coin Ezra Meeker had inspired, their gravestone, erected by the OTMA in 1939, reads, \\"They came this way to win and hold the West\\". Legacy Dave and Dandy, on exhibit in 2013 at the Washington State Historical Society Museum in Tacoma Howard Driggs succeeded Meeker as president of the OTMA, and remained in that capacity at the association and its successor, the American Pioneer Trails Association (APTA), until his own death at age 89 in 1963. The year 1930, marking 100 years since both Meeker's birth and the first wagon train leaving St. Louis for the Oregon Country, was proclaimed the Covered Wagon Centennial. The largest event was at one of the landmarks along the Oregon Trail, Wyoming's Independence Rock, on July 3‚Äì5, 1930. This event included the dedication of a plaque depicting Meeker, embedded in the rock. For many years, the OTMA made it a practice to go out each summer and dedicate monuments along the Oregon Trail. Although the APTA no longer exists, that mission has been continued by state historical societies and organizations which share its purpose, such as the Oregon- California Trails Association. The commemorative half dollars were struck in small numbers in most years of the 1930s; after collectors complained about the lengthy series and high prices, Congress forbade further strikings in 1939. The first route across America, the Lincoln Highway, was completed in the 1920s, and others soon followed. Although Meeker's highway along the Trail was not built, U.S. 30 generally parallels the route of the Oregon Trail. A number of sites relating to Meeker remain in Puyallup. In addition to his gravesite, and the Meeker Mansion (now owned by and being restored by the Ezra Meeker Historical Society) there is Pioneer Park, where the ivy-covered pergola and the statue of Meeker may be found. The Oregon Trail Local historian Lori Price noted, \\"Throughout his long life of nearly 98 years, the word for Meeker was action.\\" Historian David Dary, in his book on the Oregon Trail, deems Meeker primarily responsible for re-awakening public interest in it. According to Bert Webber, \\"There would be no 'Oregon Trail' to enjoy today if Ezra Meeker had not set out, by himself, and without government subsidy, to preserve it.\\" Driggs stated of Meeker after his death: Books by Ezra Meeker    Notes and references Explanatory notes Citations Bibliography    Further reading  * External links * Meeker Mansion Website * Guide to the Photographs of Ezra Meeker ca. 1880‚Äì1928, from a University of Washington website  1830 births 1928 deaths American lobbyists Farmers from Washington (state) History of Washington (state) Mayors of places in Washington (state) Oregon pioneers Oregon Trail People from Butler County, Ohio People from Puyallup, Washington People of the Klondike Gold Rush Washington (state) pioneers Writers from Ohio Writers from Oregon Writers from Washington (state) People from Kalama, Washington People from Steilacoom, Washington ","title":"Ezra Meeker"},{"id":"1773048","text":"Claire Lawrence (born 1939) is a Canadian musician who was a founding member of the Canadian band The Collectors, and remained with the group when it transitioned to Chilliwack in 1970.

He sings of unrequited love, using a departing train as a metaphor for his loss. Johnson's performance ‚Äì vocal accompanied by his finger-style acoustic guitar playing ‚Äì has been described as \\"devastatingly bleak\\". He recorded the song in 1937 during his last recording session and in 1939 it was issued as the last of his original 78 rpm records. \\"Love in Vain\\" has elements of earlier Delta blues songs and for a while it was believed to be in the public domain. In 1969, the Rolling Stones recorded an updated rendition featuring an electric slide guitar solo. The popularity of their adaptation led to a lawsuit over the copyright, which was eventually resolved in favor of Johnson's estate. Various artists have recorded the song. Background In the late 1920s, Johnson began playing the guitar along with a rack-mounted harmonica. One of his influences was Leroy Carr, whose \\"How Long‚ÄìHow Long Blues\\" (1928) was an early favorite. Johnson later used the melody from Carr's \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" (1935) as the basis for \\"Love in Vain\\". Both songs express a yearning and sorrow for the loss of a lover. Johnson also used some lyrics from \\"Flying Crow Blues\\" (1932) by the Shreveport Home Wreckers (a duo of Oscar \\"Buddy\\" Woods and Ed Schaffer) for the final verse of \\"Love in Vain\\". Sonny Boy Williamson II recorded a song with a similar title, \\"All My Love in Vain\\", but different lyrics. Lyrics and composition AllMusic's Thomas Ward describes the song as \\"heartbreakingly potent coming from an artist of Johnson's calibre\\". He adds: During the final verses, Johnson calls out to his lover, Willie Mae. Years later, when she heard \\"Love in Vain\\" for the first time, she was visibly moved upon hearing her name. Releases In 1939, Vocalion Records issued \\"Love in Vain Blues\\", backed by \\"Preachin' Blues (Up Jumped the Devil)\\", on a ten-inch 78 rpm record. It was released after Johnson's death and was the last of his original singles. After the release of Johnson's first compilation album, King of the Delta Blues Singers (1961), bootleg albums containing more of Johnson's 1930s singles were circulated. This was the first appearance of the song since its original release. Columbia Records responded by issuing King of the Delta Blues Singers, Vol. II (1970), which included an alternate take of \\"Love in Vain\\". The original single version was finally reissued (along with the alternate) by Columbia on the box set The Complete Recordings (1990). A remastered version of the alternate take is also included on King of the Delta Blues: The Complete Recordings (1996). Rolling Stones adaptation The Rolling Stones recorded \\"Love in Vain\\" for their 1969 album, Let It Bleed. Critic Richie Unterberger describes it as \\"as close to the roots of acoustic down-home blues as the Stones ever got.\\" Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards recalled: In a 1995 interview with Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, Mick Jagger commented on the song's arrangement: Live performances of the song appear on Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out (1970) and Stripped (1995). Lawsuit over copyright \\"Love in Vain\\" (along with \\"Stop Breakin' Down Blues\\") was the subject of a lawsuit regarding the copyright for the song. In 2000, the court held that the songs were not in the public domain and that legal title belonged to the Estate of Robert Johnson and its successors. Recognition and influence Robert Johnson's original \\"Love in Vain\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame as part of the 2011 \\"Robert Johnson Centennial\\" celebrations. Eric Clapton recorded the song for Me and Mr. Johnson (2004), his album devoted to Johnson's songs. Clapton quotes one of Johnson's verses for the Derek and the Dominos' song \\"Layla\\": \\"Please don't say we'll never find a way, and tell me all my love's in vain\\". Jazz singer Madeleine Peyroux adapted it for her 2011 album Standing on the Rooftop. An album review in The Guardian noted, \\"A major highlight is the echoing, gothic account of Johnson's Love in Vain.\\" Walter Trout recorded it for Prisoner of a Dream (1990) and Keb' Mo' for Slow Down (1998). Todd Rundgren included the song on his Johnson tribute album, Todd Rundgren's Johnson (2011). Love in Vain: A Vision of Robert Johnson is the title of a 2012 screenplay by Alan Greenberg. In it, he explores both the known facts and the myth surrounding Johnson.

He served as the 52nd Mayor of Syracuse, New York from July 10, 2001, until December 31, 2009. Currently he serves as the Executive Director of the New York State Thruway. Biography Driscoll graduated in 1976 from West Genesee High School in Camillus, a suburb of Syracuse. He formerly owned \\"Rosie O'Grady's\\", a popular Irish pub in Syracuse. He became Syracuse's mayor on July 10, 2001, when former Republican Mayor Roy Bernardi was appointed as deputy secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in President Bush's administration. As President of the City of Syracuse Common Council, Driscoll automatically succeeded Bernardi and served the remainder of Bernardi's mayoral term. That fall, Driscoll defeated several other Democrats in a primary, including Kate O'Connell. He went on to be elected after defeating former common councilor Bernie Mahoney by a thirty-two percent margin. In 2005 he defeated Mahoney's daughter, Joanie Mahoney, by a 3% margin. Driscoll won in part by claiming that Mahoney's race was funded by developer Robert Congel, a Bush-Cheney fundraiser who was overseeing the proposed expansion of the Destiny USA shopping mall. Driscoll campaigned alongside Eliot Spitzer, who had already begun his campaign to win New York's governorship in 2006; Spitzer's then- widespread popularity among New York Democrats likely helped Driscoll cement support from the majority-Democrat city. He won re-election, again by a slim 3% margin (49% to 46%)Excerpted from news organ Soul of Syracuse Previously, he served as President of the Syracuse Common Council from 1998 to 2001, as Third District Councilor in 1995, and as Second District Councilor from 1987 to 1989. On April 26, 2007, Driscoll announced that he would not seek the office of the Onondaga County Executive, open due to the retirement of longtime Republican incumbent Nicholas J. Pirro.

Smerchanski (November 1, 1914 - September 21, 1989) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1962 to 1966, and a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 to 1972. Smerchanski was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada and the Manitoba Liberal Party. Born in Malonton, Manitoba, the son of Anton Smerchanski and Dora Huley, both of Ukrainian descent, Smerchanski was educated at the University of Manitoba and the Virginia Polytechnical Institute, graduating in 1938. In 1940, Smerchanski married Patricia N. Paget. He worked as a professor of Engineering before entering politics, and was a member of the Canadian Institute for Mining and Metallurgy, the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, the Pan-American Institute of Mining Engineers and the Society of Economic Geologists. In 1953, he was appointed to the inaugural Board of Commissioners of the Winnipeg Transit System. Smerchanski was a successful businessman, and was a leading organizer in the Manitoba Liberal Party long before he first ran for office himself. When Douglas Campbell resigned as Liberal leader in 1961, Smerchanski entered the race to succeed him and initially emerged as the frontrunner. He resigned on the weekend of the convention, however, and allowed Gildas Molgat to take his place as a candidate. Molgat won the contest on the first ballot, and it is likely that Smerchanski's last-minute withdrawal was arranged well in advance. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1962 provincial election, and defeated NDP incumbent John Hawryluk by 289 votes in the north-end Winnipeg constituency of Burrows. He served in the parliamentary opposition for the next four years, but lost his seat by almost 1,000 votes to NDP candidate Ben Hanuschak in the 1966 election. He was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the \\"Trudeaumania\\" election of 1968, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Warner Jorgenson by 1,230 votes in the rural, southeastern riding of Provencher. He served as a backbench supporter of Pierre Trudeau's government for four years, and lost to PC candidate Jake Epp in the federal election of 1972. He sought a return to the Manitoba legislature in the 1973 election, running in the rural constituency of Emerson. He did not win, but took enough votes away from the Progressive Conservative candidate to give the NDP a victory in the riding for the first and (to date) only time. He did not run again after this. Smerchanski died in Winnipeg at the age of 74. There is currently a Mark Smerchanski Memorial Prize in Women's Studies offered by the University of Manitoba, and the Mark G.

She was named for American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient John McFarland. McFarland was laid down on 31 July 1918 and launched on 30 March 1920 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation; sponsored by Miss Louisa Hughes; and commissioned on 30 September 1920, Lieutenant Commander Preston B. Haines in command. Service history McFarland, having served a month with the Atlantic Fleet, departed for European waters on 30 November 1920. For the next two months she operated in the English Channel, sailing for Gibraltar on 31 January 1921. On 9 March she arrived at Split for a four-month tour with the Adriatic Detachment. In July she continued eastward, and at Constantinople, on 31 July, joined ships of the Turkish Waters Detachment. Returning to the United States only once (8 July to 22 October 1922), McFarland remained in the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean area until spring 1923. During that period she performed quasi-diplomatic and humanitarian roles necessitated by the aftermath of World War I. She cruised regularly to Black Sea and Anatolian ports, distributing American relief supplies to Russian, Greek, and Turkish refugees and providing transportation, mail, and communications facilities. McFarland returned to New York and on 15 September 1923 joined the Scouting Fleet at Newport, Rhode Island. With only two interruptions, she operated along the East coast and in the Caribbean for the next 17 years. The first interruption came with a cruise to Hawaii for the 1925 fleet problem involving an attack on Oahu; the second, a year out of commission, in reserve, at Philadelphia, 1931. On 2 August 1940, McFarland, undergoing conversion, was redesignated AVD-14, seaplane tender (destroyer). On 5 October she was recommissioned in full and assigned to the Pacific Fleet. =1923 collision= McFarland was heavily damaged during the early morning of 19 September 1923 after being rammed on the port side forward of her bridge by the battleship during night maneuvers off of the Cape Cod Canal. The training exercise was being undertaken by Arkansas, the battleship , the auxiliary ship and a flotilla of a dozen destroyers. McFarland was towed to Boston Navy Yard by the destroyer .The News-Palladium from Benton Harbor, Michigan - Page 10, date September 20, 1923Rome Daily Sentinel =World War II= On 7 December 1941, McFarland, operating out of Pearl Harbor, was conducting antisubmarine maneuvers off Maui. Receiving word of the Japanese attack, she patrolled to the southwest, returning to Oahu on 9 December. For the next seven months she operated from Pearl Harbor, completing several voyages to Palmyra Atoll and Johnston Islands. On these missions she carried Marine reinforcements to the islands and returned with civilian personnel. McFarland sailed for the South Pacific 2 June 1942. She arrived at Noumea on 16 June and within a month she made her first contact with an enemy submarine in Bulari Pass, 15 July. In August, as the Guadalcanal offensive neared, she assumed tender duties in the Espiritu Santo - Santa Cruz Islands area. Assigned to keeping the supply lines open, McFarland carried supplies to the embattled island and evacuated wounded marine personnel while the planes she tendered performed scouting and fighting missions. On 16 October, McFarland was unloading cargo and embarking wounded personnel in Lunga Roads when she was attacked by nine dive bombers. While the first seven scored no hits, the eighth hit a gasoline barge in tow alongside the tender's starboard quarter. The blazing barge was cut loose as the ninth plane made its run. At least one bomb hit McFarlands stern, knocking out her rudder and steering engine. Her crew shot down one plane, but lost eleven of its members in the fight; five killed, six missing, with an additional 12 critically wounded. For this action, the ship was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. McFarland was towed to Florida Island, where she moored to the beach in the upper channel (later called McFarland Channel) of Tulagi harbor. She completed makeshift repairs to her hull by 26 November and sailed to Espiritu Santo, where further repairs increased her seaworthiness. On 17 December she began to make her way back to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 29 December. Repairs completed by 17 April 1943, McFarland sailed for the west coast. Redesignated DD-237 on 1 December 1943, and homeported at San Diego, California for the remainder of the war, she operated with aircraft carriers as they conducted training exercises and pilot qualification landings. On 30 September 1945, she sailed for the east coast. Decommissioned at Philadelphia on 8 November 1945, she was struck from the Navy Register on 19 December. Her hulk was sold for scrap on 29 October 1946 to the North American Smelting Company, Philadelphia. Awards McFarland received two battle stars for her World War II service.

Description Big bluestem is a perennial warm-season bunchgrass. It is tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions. The main roots are deep, and the plants send out strong, tough rhizomes, so it forms very strong sod. Depending on soil and moisture conditions, it grows to a height of . The stem base turns blue or purple as it matures. Big bluestem blooms in the summer and seeds into the fall. The inflorescence (flower cluster) is a raceme of two to six, most commonly three, narrow spike-like racemes alternately arranged along the top of the stem. It somewhat resembles a wild turkey's foot. Each raceme contains pairs of spikelets. Each pair has a stalked spikelet with another stalkless spikelet at the base of the stalk. The stalkless spikelet usually has a fertile, perfect floret (with both female and male parts) and an awn (bristle), and the stalked spikelet is awnless, and is sterile or has a staminate (male) flower.

Ecology Big bluestem is a mid-successional grass in prairie and other grassland ecosystems. It grows in tall, dense stands that can out-compete other plant species. The stands grow until disturbance interrupts their spread. It is shade intolerant and is adapted to fire. It is a larval host to the Arogos skipper, Byssus skipper, cobweb skipper, common wood nymph, Delaware skipper, and the dusted skipper.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. Uses =Agriculture= The grass and its variants are good forage for horses and cattle and can also be cut and used for hay. The grass is high in protein. While not considered the highest quality native forage found in the United States, it has long been considered a desirable and ecologically important grass by cattle ranchers and rangeland ecologists. =Landscaping= Big bluestem is cultivated by specialty plant nurseries for its drought tolerance and native status. It is often grown for wildlife gardens, natural landscaping, and grassland habitat restoration projects. =Biofuel= Due to its high biomass, big bluestem is being considered as a potential feedstock for ethanol production. Symbols Andropogon gerardi is the state grass of Illinois and Missouri and the official prairie grass of Manitoba. Nomenclatural notes USDA GRIN rejects the spelling gerardii and provides reasoning for gerardi as being the correct spelling for the specific epithet of this taxon.

Its headquarter is in the city of Bengaluru in the state of Karnataka, India. It strives to promote Kannada language through publishing books, organising literary seminars and promoting research projects. It also organises an annual conference on Kannada literature called Kannada Sahithya Sammelana (Kannada Literary Meet). The current president of the parishat is Manu Baligar. Origin Kannada Sahitya Parishat's building (with a modernized library) at Pampa Mahakavi Road, Chamrajpet, Bengaluru.During the British rule of India, Kannada speakers were spread across different provinces. Coming under the influence of different languages in those provinces, the pronunciation and grammar of Kannada language started to differ across provinces. This led to a gap in communication across the people in these provinces though they spoke the same language of Kannada.The origin of Kannada Sahitya Parishat is mentioned by Mokshagundam Vishweshwaraiah, who was the Diwan of the Mysore Kingdom felt the need to conserve and promote the Kannada language and literature. In this direction, he started the Mysore Economic Conference and created a study circle under H. V. Nanjundaiah. A sub-committee formed under the study circle came up with five different topics on which suggestions were invited: * To develop ideas to promote unity and co-operation among Kannada speakers spread across different regions. * To develop suggestions for a common written Kannada which had diversified across different regions * To ensure that students learning Kannada language use a common textbook * To improve the general knowledge among the Kannada speaking population by publishing appropriate books. * To produce appropriate Kannada translations for words used in other languages, especially the scientific words. The sub- committee received good responses from the public and it decided to organise a conference in Bangalore on 3 May 1915 to act upon these suggestions. The conference was held on the grounds of the Government High School and was attended by litt√©rateurs, newspaper editors and other dignitaries from different regions. The conference agreed to create the Karnataka Sahitya Parishat with a mandate to conserve and promote Kannada language and literature. H. V. Nanjundaiah was unanimously elected as the President of the Parishat. Apart from the Mysore province, the Karnataka Sahitya Parishat was simultaneously started in the Madras, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kodagu provinces. Growth H. V. Nanjundaiah remained as President of the Parishat for the first five years of its creation. In 1935, an annual event under the aegis of the Parishat called as Kannada Sahitya Sammelana commenced. The foundation ceremony of a separate building to house the Parishat was organised on 12 April 1937 under the Presidency of Karpura Srinivas Rao. The construction of this building was completed on 29 May 1938. B M Srikantaiah was the Vice President of the Parishat from 1938 till 1942. In 1938, the name of Karnataka Sahitya Parishat was changed to Kannada Sahitya Parishat. Under the guidance of B M Srikantaiah, the logo of the Parishat containing the map of the Mysore province with the phrase Sirigannadam gelge, Kannada Sahitya Parishat written inside it was created. Over the period of time; a women's wing, a publishing house, a Kannada journal and literature exams were also added to the repertoire of the Parishat. Kannada Sahitya Parishat branches at the district and taluk levels were also created. A new building is being constructed to replace the existing building of the Parishat at a cost of Rupees five crores.Proposal to construct a new building to house the Parishat is mentioned by During its existence, the Parishat has contributed to the growth of Kannada language by organising conferences and debates, publication and release of books, organising talks by eminent writers and also by holding the annual Kannada Sahitya Sammelana. Criticism The Parishat has reportedly lost focus on its goals due to various reasons including lack of funds and political interference.Unhealthy trends in the Parishat are mentioned by There were also reports of irregularities conducted within the Parishat in 1987, which prompted the Karnataka Government to nominate an Administrator to the Parishat.

Level 3 Judo gives the characters the ability to fly temporarily. Level 4 Judo unleashes a powerful repetitive attack. Most stages (known as \\"Warlock Zones\\") are separated into two sections. The first section is centered on town exploration where players gather information, buy items, learn special Judo attacks, play minigames, earn money, etc. One of the most notable mini-games available is a recreation of the first level in Gradius, but also includes games such as air hockey, trivia, dice games, and even a lottery. The second section of each stage is a platformer section where the players fight through minor enemies until they reach the end and defeat a boss. In two-player mode, the characters can work together by having one ride the other piggy-back style. The character riding controls the attacks, while the character being ridden controls the movement and jumping. This can simplify areas with large or awkward jumps as it only requires one player to land successfully. After each stage is completed, a small scene occurs furthering the mostly simple and lighthearted plot, and the next stage is revealed. Plot As with many action/platformer video games, the plot is minimal except for revealing future stages. In this game, the players control Goemon (loosely inspired by the historical Goemon) and Ebisumaru (the two are called Kid Ying and Dr. Yang respectively in all non-Japanese releases of this game). After noticing some odd occurrences in their hometown of Oedo, involving a Ghost Woman at the local temple and ghost animals that come from the temple at night, Goemon and Ebisumaru decide to investigate. After defeating the Ghost Woman, she reveals herself to be Kurobei, a ninja cat. She explains that she was looking for strong people to help her, then offers the duo money and tells them to search for her boss, Koban, on Shikoku Island. Upon arrival, they find Hyotoko dancers in town during a festival, of whom some of the townspeople are suspicious. After finding and defeating the Lantern Man, leader of the evil dancers, they rescue Koban, who informs them that Princess Yuki, daughter of the Emperor, is believed to have been kidnapped by an odd group of mimes and clowns counterfeiters known as the Otafu Army. His clan of ninja cats were unable to investigate further because of devices the army has that disable their shapeshifting powers. He then directs the duo to nearby Awaji Island, where Goemon and Ebisumaru find that the army has set up a bizarre, anachronistic amusement park. The pair then make their way across the park to the nearby town of Yamato, where they discover that the army has been recruiting the townspeople. Upon invading the Otafu HQ and defeating its leaders, they free Yae, the ninja. She tells them that the Otafu Army never had Yuki, but that a wise man in Iga may be able to help them. The Old Wise Man's palace in Iga is guarded by an army of robotic clockwork ninjas, and the pair fight through the palace and its leader, Sasuke, to get to the old man's chamber. The Old Wise Man tells them that the White Mirror in the Dragon Pond of faraway Izumo can find what they seek. He uses his \\"Miracle Transport Machine\\" (which is only a cannon) to shoot them there. To save the princess, the protagonists must travel through different regions of Japan to find clues about the army and the location of the princess. Reception The game was critically acclaimed. In 1992, Super Play stated: \\"Still one of the best games for the system (if you like this sort of thing), mixing RPG adventure-style wandering with side-on platform action. It's got some wonderful oriental music, beautifully drawn graphics and is a supremely addictive challenge.\\"Super Play 2 (December 1992) In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. GamesRadar ranked it as the 45th best SNES game for its \\"stellar ancient Japan-inspired soundtrack, beautiful graphics alive with color, and just enough challenge to make it a very addictive affair. It‚Äôs not breaking down any barriers for platforming or RPGs, but it‚Äôs definitely one of the top games on the SNES.\\"http://www.gamesradar.com/best-snes-games-all-time/ According to Electronic Gaming Monthly, the game \\"didn't catch on too much in the U.S.\\" but was popular in Japan.

Retrieved 19 April 2010 He was the first Roman Catholic Premier of Queensland and the first to die in office. Early life Byrnes was born in Spring Hill, Queensland, to Irish immigrants Patrick Byrnes and his wife Anna, n√©e Tighe. Byrnes was educated at Bowen State School, then, winning a scholarship where he topped the state, he studied at Brisbane Grammar School and then studied arts and law at the University of Melbourne, graduating with honours in both. During his time at the University of Melbourne he was Prelector of the Dialectic Society of Trinity College (University of Melbourne), winning the Society's inaugural Wigram Allen Prize in 1883, only months after it had been established by Sir George Wigram Allen. In 1882-83 Byrnes taught at Xavier College. Monument at the burial site of Thomas Joseph Byrnes at Brisbane's Toowong Cemetery. Career Byrnes was admitted as a barrister in Victoria on 8 July 1884 and returned for a Queensland admission on 5 August; he then began a successful career as a barrister. Byrnes' talent brought him to the attention of fellow barrister Sir Samuel Griffith, then Premier of Queensland, who had him appointed Solicitor-General with a seat in the Legislative Council. Byrnes stood down from the Legislative Council to successfully stand for Cairns in the Legislative Assembly in 1893. He represented Cairns until 1896, after which he represented Warwick in the Legislative Assembly from 1896 to his death in 1898. Byrnes continued his private law practice and participated in two major Supreme Court of Queensland cases. In the Queensland Investment Co. v. Grimley case, Byrnes successful conduct of the defence was praised widely. In the John Robb arbitration case of 1892, praise for Byrnes skill was accompanied by public objection to the high fees paid to Samuel Griffith as leading counsel and to Byrnes as one of his assistants. In 1895 and 1897, Byrnes represented Queensland at meetings of the Federal Council of Australasia. Sir Thomas McIlwraith appointed him as Attorney-General of Queensland in the Continuous Ministry, and when Hugh Nelson stepped down as Premier; Byrnes, the youngest member of the Ministry by a large margin, became Premier. Statue of Thomas Joseph Byrnes in Centenary Place, Brisbane Statue of Thomas Joseph Byrnes in Warwick Late life Byrnes' ability had led many to expect great things of him, but he contracted measles then pneumonia and died on 27 September 1898. Byrnes was accorded a state funeral which proceeded from St Stephen's Cathedral to the Toowong Cemetery. Never married, he was survived by several brothers and sisters. Legacy Byrnes is commemorated by two statues, one in Centenary Place in Brisbane and the heritage-listed T J Byrnes Monument in Warwick, both funded by public subscriptions. The commissioning of the Brisbane statue encountered a series of setbacks. The sculptor Achille Simonetti was approached by the committee to create the statue. However, Simonetti had never seen Byrnes during his life and produced a plaster cast from photographs for the committee's approval before commencing the statue. The committee did not think the cast was sufficiently like Byrnes and there were a number of iterations before they were satisfied. Then there was an argument of whether Byrnes should be depicted in a university gown or in an ordinary frock coat, deciding on a frock coat in order to depict Byrnes as the premier rather than as a lawyer. Then as Simonetti was tendering to provide a 9-foot-tall bronze statue for ¬£1,800, a local sculptor James Laurence Watts offered to provide the statue for only ¬£1,000, dividing the committee.Download However, after Byrnes' sisters indicated their strong preference for Simonetti's work and Simonetti offered a revised tender of ¬£1400, the committee went ahead and commissioned the statue from Simonetti. Early in 1900, the argument about the clothing erupted once more when Simonetti expressed an artistic preference for robes rather than a frock coat, and the committee reversed its decision in favour of robes. During this argument, Simonetti took ill and died. It was then announced in the newspaper that it had been Simonetti's wish that his former pupil, James White, should complete his unfinished commissions. The committee negotiated with White, but finally gave the commission to sculptor Bertram Mackennal. The township of Byrnestown in Queensland is named after him, as is its main street Byrnes Parade and its railway station. St Thomas's Catholic Church in Camp Hill, Brisbane (then known as East Coorparoo) built in 1923 is another memorial to Byrnes. He had owned the land on which the church was built, but it had passed to his sister Matilda Margaret Maloney after his death. In 1916 she agreed to sell the land to the Catholic Church and then, on her death in 1922, bequeathed ¬£300 towards the cost of erecting a church in memory of her brother.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1949 to 1966, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Douglas Campbell. Hryhorczuk was originally a Liberal-Progressive, and later became a Liberal after the party changed its name. His father, Nicholas Hryhorczuk, was also a member of the Legislative Assembly from 1920 to 1945. Hryhorczuk was educated at the University of Manitoba and the University of Saskatchewan, receiving Bachelor of Arts and law degrees. He worked as a barrister before entering political life, and served as chairman of the Ethelbert School Board and president of the Ethelbert Chamber of Commerce. He also served as reeve of Ethelbert for a time. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1949 provincial election, defeating CCF candidate Fred Zaplitny by over 700 votes in his father's old riding of Ethelbert. He served as a backbench supporter of Campbell's government in the parliament which followed, and was re-elected without difficulty in the 1953 election. On January 25, 1955, Hryhorczuk was named as the province's Attorney General. He retained this position until the 1958 provincial election, in which Campbell's Liberal-Progressive lost power to Dufferin Roblin's Progressive Conservatives.

He was the lead guitarist of Grammy Award-nominated power pop band Fountains of Wayne. The band released four major label albums, including Welcome Interstate Managers on Virgin Records in 2003, an RIAA-certified Gold LP. The album spawned the hugely popular U.S. Top 40 hit and number 1 music video \\"Stacy's Mom\\". The Belltower Known for his impressive virtuoso abilities and British guitar pop playing style, Jody first garnered attention fronting and writing the songs for London-based band The Belltower in the early 1990s. Although the band created a buzz for itself overseas, including Melody Maker and NME singles of the week and top chart positions, their major label debut Popdropper sold marginally. The band came back to the US and eventually broke up in 1996. Fountains of Wayne Porter was then asked by his friend Adam Schlesinger (who had already been brought into The Belltower briefly) to join his newly formed band Fountains of Wayne before their self-titled Atlantic debut. Porter continued with Fountains of Wayne through their 1999 release, Utopia Parkway. However, after the band was dropped from Atlantic Records in 2001, Fountains of Wayne went on hiatus. In 2003, the band reformed and entered the studio to do a spate of demos which would eventually become Welcome Interstate Managers on Virgin records. The band received two Grammy nominations in 2004 and released Out of State Plates, a collection of b sides and rarities the following year. They reassembled in 2007 for their next studio album Traffic and Weather which was said to have been recorded largely by Schlesinger and Porter. The AstroJet Jody Porter also once fronted the short-lived New York-based alternative band The Astrojet. In 2002, The Astrojet recorded a 6 track EP of Porter-penned songs entitled, The Mile Low Club. In early 2004, he disbanded the group to reassemble Fountains of Wayne and continue as a solo artist. Guest appearances Porter has played on albums with Albert Hammond Jr., Ivy, Jesse Malin, Brookville, David Mead and Juliana Hatfield. Porter has been credited on albums playing bass, keyboards and drums in addition to vocals and guitar. Solo In 2008 Porter finished work on his debut solo album, Close to the Sun. The 12-song album bridges the gap between the sonic atmospheric stylings of the Belltower and the guitar-driven power pop of Fountains of Wayne; it was coproduced by Michael Tudor and Gordon Raphael (Strokes, Regina Spektor). The album was first released in Japan by FAEC/Rough Trade on July 2, 2008, and was later picked up by Engine Room Recordings and slated for worldwide release on May 11, 2010. Porter's second solo album, Month of Mondays, was successfully funded via Kickstarter on July 24, 2013.  Musical equipment  Jody has used an arsenal of vintage guitars over the years, most notably a three pick-up Les Paul Custom, several early '60s Fender Jazzmasters, Fender Telecaster various vintage Gretsch models, and more recently a '57 Les Paul Junior that belonged to his father and a new signature guitar. His signature guitar is a SchoolHoused BeachBlaster which consists of a surf green finish and 3-Seymour Duncan Whole Lotta humbuckers. He has generally favored Vox amps.

Early life Hugh Nelson was born at Kilmarnock, Scotland, the son of William Lambie Nelson. Hugh was educated at the Edinburgh High School, and began a promising course under Sir William Hamilton at Edinburgh University. This was cut short when he went with his father to Queensland in 1853 and settled at Ipswich. Hugh Nelson obtained a position in a mercantile house, and then took up a pastoral life about six miles out of Ipswich. He then went to the Darling Downs to manage a station, and in 1870 married Janet, daughter of Duncan McIntyre. Afterwards Nelson took up Loudon station in the Dalby district. His father, William Lambie Nelson, was elected to the first Queensland parliament in 1860 but was unseated because he was a minister of religion.  Politics  Winton in 1895. Here he is seen at the town's artesian bore. In 1880, when the divisional boards act came in, Hugh Nelson was elected a member of the Wambo board. His strong personality and cultivated intellect soon led to his being appointed chairman of the board. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Northern Downs on 7 September 1883, and after the 1887/8 redistribution of seats, he was member for Murilla (28 April 1888 to 13 April 1898). In June 1888 he became secretary for railways in the McIlwraith ministry and held the same position when Morehead succeeded McIlwraith. When Griffith became premier, Nelson was elected leader of the opposition, but when Griffith resigned in March 1893 to become chief justice, Nelson formed a coalition with McIlwraith taking the portfolios of treasurer and vice-president of the executive council. In October he became premier in a ministry which lasted four and a half years, for the last three years of which he was also chief secretary. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1896 and was appointed to the privy council at the time of his visit to England during the diamond jubilee celebrations in 1897. Nelson did most valuable work as treasurer during the depression which followed the financial crisis of 1893. In April 1898 when the Byrnes ministry came in, Nelson became president of the Queensland Legislative Council, and in 1903 lieutenant-governor, for both of which positions his fine appearance, tact and grace of manner eminently fitted him. Nelson had an intimate knowledge of men, and was an excellent parliamentarian with a good grasp of constitutional matters and a keen understanding of financial questions. His genial nature made him personally popular and though scarcely an orator, his practical common sense always made him worthy of attention. He was opposed both to the separation movement in Queensland and to federation. He showed himself to be a strong man during the shearers' strike of 1894, but his best work was done as treasurer when he led the colony out of a state of financial chaos.  Later life  Nelson died at Toowoomba on 1 January 1906, survived by Lady Nelson, two sons and three daughters. He was accorded a State funeral, and was buried in Drayton and Toowoomba Cemetery.

First expressed in his campaign speeches and promises, Wilson later wrote a 1913 book of the same name. In terms of legislation, wartime policies are generally not considered part of the New Freedom. After the 1918 midterm elections, Republicans took control of Congress and were mostly hostile to the New Freedom. As president, Wilson focused on three types of reform:Woodrow Wilson, The Progressive. Socialstudieshelp.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15. # Tariff reform: This came through the passage of the Underwood Tariff Act of 1913, which lowered tariffs for the first time since 1857 and went against the protectionist lobby. # Business reform: This was established through the passage of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, which established the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and halt unfair and illegal business practices by issuing \\"cease and desist\\" orders, and the Clayton Antitrust Act. # Banking reform: This came in 1913 through the creation of the Federal Reserve System and in 1916 through the passage of the Federal Farm Loan Act, which set up Farm Loan Banks to support farmers. Campaign slogan in 1912 Wilson's position in 1912 stood in opposition to Progressive party candidate Theodore Roosevelt's ideas of New Nationalism, particularly on the issue of antitrust modification. According to Wilson, \\"If America is not to have free enterprise, he can have freedom of no sort whatever.\\" In presenting his policy, Wilson warned that New Nationalism represented collectivism, while New Freedom stood for political and economic liberty from such things as trusts (powerful monopolies). Wilson was strongly influenced by his chief economic advisor Louis D. Brandeis, an enemy of big business and monopoly.By: Strum, Philippa Strum, \\"Louis D. Brandeis, the New Freedom and the State,\\" Mid America, 1987, Vol. 69#3 pp 105-124 Although Wilson and Roosevelt agreed that economic power was being abused by trusts, Wilson and Roosevelt were split on how the government should handle the restraint of private power as in dismantling corporations that had too much economic power in a large society. Wilson wrote extensively on the meaning of \\"government\\" shortly after his election. Wilson in office Once elected, Wilson seemed to abandon his \\"New Freedom\\" and adopted policies that were more similar to those of Roosevelt's New Nationalism. Wilson appointed Brandeis to the US Supreme Court in 1916. He worked with Congress to give federal employees worker's compensation, outlawed child labor with the Keating‚ÄìOwen Act (the act was ruled unconstitutional in 1918) and passed the Adamson Act, which secured a maximum eight-hour workday for railroad employees. Most important was the Clayton Act of 1914, which largely put the trust issue to rest by spelling out the specific unfair practices that business were not allowed to engage in.Link,Woodrow Wilson and the Progressive Era pp. 69‚Äì72 By the end of the Wilson Administration, a significant amount of progressive legislation had been passed, affecting not only economic and constitutional affairs, but farmers, labor, veterans, the environment, and conservation as well. The reform agenda actually put into legislation by Wilson, however, did not extend as far as what Roosevelt had called for but had never actually passed, such as a standard 40-hour work week, minimum wage laws, and a federal system of social insurance. This was arguably a reflection of Wilson's own ideological convictions, who according to Elizabeth Warren and Herbert Hoover, was an adherent of Jeffersonian Democracy (although Wilson did champion reforms such as agricultural credits later in his presidency, and championed the right of Americans to earn a living wage and to live and work \\"in sanitary surroundings\\" in his 1919 State of the Union Address). While seemingly supportive of benefits for workers such as pensions, injury compensation, and profit-sharing plans (noting in his book \\"The New Freedom\\" how various companies had introduced such benefits \\"in good faith\\" to their employees), Wilson and his administration never pushed legislation through Congress extending these benefits to the entire workforce, while a national health insurance system of the kind advocated by Roosevelt was never established, despite the fact that Wilson, according to one study, ‚Äúpromoted Roosevelt‚Äôs policy of universal health insurance coverage when he was elected president.‚Äù Despite this, the New Freedom did much to extend the power of the federal government in social and economic affairs, and arguably paved the way for future reform programs such as the New Deal and the Great Society. Legislation and programs Note: This listing contains reforms drawn up by the Wilson Administration as part of its New Freedom program together with wartime reforms and reforms drawn up by individual Congressmen. The latter two have been included because it is arguable that the progressive nature of these reforms was compatible with the liberalism of the New Freedom. =Farmers= * The 1914 Smith‚ÄìLever Act tied vocational education in home economics and agriculture to the land-grant college system.

Japanese traditional medicine referred to as TOM, uses most of the Chinese therapies including acupuncture and moxibustion, and traditional Chinese herbology and traditional food therapy. Shennong (Japanese: Shinn≈ç) tasting herbs to ascertain their qualities (19th-century Japanese scroll) Manase D≈çsan (1507-94) who laid the foundations for a more independent Japanese medicine History =Origins= According to Chinese mythology, the origins of traditional Chinese medicine are traced back to the three legendary sovereigns Fuxi, Shennong and Yellow Emperor. Shennong is believed to have tasted hundreds of herbs to ascertain their medicinal value and effects on the human body and help relieve people of their sufferings. The oldest written record focussing solely on the medicinal use of plants was the Shennong Ben Cao Jing which was compiled around the end of the first century B.C. and is said to have classified 365 species of herbs or medicinal plants. Chinese medical practices were introduced to Japan during the 6th century A.D. In 608, Empress Suiko dispatched E-Nichi, Fuku-In and other young physicians to China. It is said that they studied medicine there for 15 years. Until 838, Japan sent 19 missions to Tang China. While the officials studied Chinese government structures, physicians and many of the Japanese monks absorbed Chinese medical knowledge. =Early Japanese adaptation= In 702 A.D., the Taih≈ç Code was promulgated as an adaptation of the governmental system of China's Tang Dynasty. One section called for the establishment of a university (daigaku) including a medical school with an elaborate training program, but due to incessant civil war this program never became effective. Empress K≈çmy≈ç (701‚Äì760) established the Hidenin and Seyakuin in the K≈çfuku-Temple (K≈çfuku-ji) in Nara, being two Buddhist institutions that provided free healthcare and medicine for the needy. For centuries to come Japanese Buddhist monks were essential in conveying Chinese medical know-how to Japan and in providing health care for both the elite and the general population. In 753 A.D., the Chinese priest Jianzhen (in Japanese Ganjin), who was well-versed in medicine, arrived in Japan after five failed attempts in 12 years to cross the East China Sea. As he was blind, he used his sense of smell to identify herbs. He brought medical texts and a large collection of materia medica to the imperial palace in Nara, which he dedicated to the Emperor Sh≈çmu in 756, 49 days after the emperor's death. They are kept in a log-cabin-style treasure house of the T≈çdai-Temple (T≈çdai-ji) known as Sh≈çs≈çin. In 787 A.D., the \\"Newly Revised Materia Medica\\" (Xinxiu Bencao, 659 A.D.), which had been sponsored by the Tang Imperial Court, became an obligatory text in the study of medicine at the Japanese Health Ministry, but many of the 844 medicinal substances described in this book were not available in Japan at the time. Around 918 A.D., a Japanese medical dictionary entitled \\"Japanese names of (Chinese) Materia Medica\\" (Honz≈ç-wamy≈ç) was compiled, quoting from 60 Chinese medical works. During the Heian Period, Tanba Yasuyori (912‚Äì995) compiled the first Japanese medical book, Ishinp≈ç (\\"Prescriptions from the Heart of Medicine\\"), drawing from numerous Chinese texts, some of which have perished later. During the period from 1200 to 1600, medicine in Japan became more practical. Most of the physicians were Buddhist monks who continued to use the formulas, theories and practices that had been introduced by the early envoys from Tang China. =Early revision= During the 15th and 16th centuries, Japanese physicians began to achieve a more independent view on Chinese medicine. After 12 years of studies in China Tashiro Sanki (1465‚Äì1537) became the leading figure of a movement called \\"Followers of Later Developments in Medicine\\" (Gosei-ha). This school propagated the teachings of Li Dongyuan and Zhu Tanxi that gradually superseded the older doctrines from the Song dynasty. Manase D≈çsan, one of his disciples, adapted Tashiro's teachings to Japanese conditions. Based on his own observation and experience, he compiled a book on internal medicine in 8 volumes (Keiteki-sh≈´) and established an influential private medical school (Keiteki-in) in Ky≈çto. His son Gensaku wrote a book of case studies (Igaku tensh≈ç-ki) and developed a considerable number of new herb formulas. From the second half of the 17th century, a new movement, the \\"Followers of Classic Methods\\" (Koh≈ç-ha), evolved, which emphasized the teachings and formulas of the Chinese classic \\"Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders\\" (Shanghan Lun, in Japanese Sh≈çkan-ron). While the etiological concepts of this school were as speculative as those of the Gosei-ha, the therapeutic approaches were based on empirical observations and practical experience. This return to \\"classic methods\\" was initiated by Nagoya Gen'i (1628‚Äì1696), and advocated by influential proponents such as Got≈ç Gonzan (1659‚Äì1733), Yamawaki T≈çy≈ç (1705‚Äì1762), and Yoshimasu T≈çd≈ç (1702‚Äì1773). Yoshimasu is considered to be the most influential figure. He accepted any effective technique, regardless of its particular philosophical background. Yoshimasu's abdominal diagnostics are commonly credited with differentiating early modern Traditional Japanese medicine (TJM) from Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). During the later part of the Edo period, many Japanese practitioners began to utilize elements of both schools. Some, such as Ogino Gengai (1737‚Äì1806), Ishizaka S≈çtetsu (1770‚Äì1841), or Honma S≈çken (1804‚Äì1872), even tried to incorporate Western concepts and therapies, which had made their way into the country through physicians at the Dutch trading-post Dejima (Nagasaki). Although Western medicine gained some ground in the field of surgery, there was not much competition between \\"Eastern\\" and \\"Western\\" schools until the 19th century, because even adherents of \\"Dutch-Studies\\" (Rangaku) were very eclectic in their actual practice. Traditional medicine never lost its popularity throughout the Edo period, but it entered a period of rapid decline shortly after the Meiji Restoration. In 1871, the new government decided to modernize medical education based on the German medical system. Starting in 1875, new medical examinations focused on natural sciences and Western medical disciplines. In October 1883, a law retracted the licenses of any existing traditional practitioner. Despite losing legal standing, a small number of traditional physicians continued to practice privately. Some of them, such as Yamada Gy≈çk≈ç (1808‚Äì1881), Asada S≈çhaku (1813‚Äì1894), and Mori Risshi (1807‚Äì1885), organized an \\"Association to Preserve [Traditional] Knowledge\\" (Onchi-sha) and started to set up small hospitals. However, by 1887, the organization was disbanded due to internal policy dissent and the death of leading figures. The \\"Imperial Medical Association\\" (Teikoku Ikai), founded in 1894, was short-lived too. In 1895, the 8th National Assembly of the Diet vetoed a request to continue the practice of Kamp≈ç. When Azai Kokkan (1848‚Äì1903), one of the main activists, died, the Kamp≈ç-movement was almost stamped out. =Era of Western influence= Any further attempt to save traditional practices had to take into account Western concepts and therapies. Therefore, it was graduates from medical faculties, trained in Western medicine, who began to set out to revive traditional practices. In 1910, Wada Keij≈´r≈ç (1872‚Äê1916) published \\"The Iron Hammer of the Medical World\\" (Ikai no tettsui). Yumoto Ky≈´shin (1876‚Äì1942), a graduate from Kanazawa Medical School, was so impressed by this book that he became a student of Dr. Wada. His \\"Japanese-Chinese Medicine\\" (K≈çkan igaku), published in 1927, was the first book on Kamp≈ç medicine in which Western medical findings were used to interpret classical Chinese texts. In 1927, Nakayama Tadanao (1895‚Äì1957) presented his \\"New Research on Kamp≈ç-Medicine\\" (Kamp≈ç-igaku no shin kenky≈´). Another \\"convert\\" was ≈åtsuka Keisetsu (1900‚Äì1980), who became one of the most famous Kamp≈ç practitioners of the 20th century. This gradual revival was supported by the modernization of the dosage form of herbal medicine. During the 1920s, the Nagakura Pharmaceutical Company in Osaka began developing dried decoctions in a granular form. At about the same time, Tsumura Juntend≈ç, a company founded by Tsumura J≈´sha (1871‚Äì1941) in 1893, established a research institute to promote the development of standardized Kamp≈ç medicine. Gradually, these \\"Japanese-Chinese remedies\\" (wakan-yaku) became a standard method of Kamp≈ç medicine administration. In 1937, new researchers such as Yakazu D≈çmei (1905‚Äì2002) started to promote Kamp≈ç at the so-called ‚ÄúTakushoku University Kampo Seminar‚Äù. More than 700 people attended these seminars that continued after the war. In 1938, following a proposal of Yakazu, the \\"Asia Medicine Association\\" was established. In 1941, Takeyama Shinichir≈ç published his \\"Theories on the Restoration of Kamp≈ç Medicine\\" (Kamp≈ç-ijutsu fukk≈ç no riron, 1941). In that same year, Yakazu, ≈åtsuka, Kimura Nagahisa, and Shimizu Fujitar≈ç (1886‚Äì1976) completed a book entitled \\"The Actual Practice of Kamp≈ç Medicine\\" (Kamp≈ç shinry≈ç no jissai). By including Western medical disease names he greatly expanded the usage of Kamp≈ç formulas. A new version of this influential manual was printed in 1954. This book was also translated into Chinese. A completely revised version was published in 1969 under the title \\"Medical Dictionary of Kamp≈ç Practice\\" (Kamp≈ç Shinry≈ç Iten). In 1950, ≈åtsuka Keisetsu, Yakazu D≈çmei, Hosono Shir≈ç (1899‚Äì1989), Okuda Kenz≈ç (1884‚Äì1961), and other leaders of the pre- and postwar Kamp≈ç revival movement established the \\"Japan Society for Oriental Medicine\\" (Nippon T≈çy≈ç Igakkai) with 89 members (2014: more than 9000 members). In 1960, raw materials for crude drugs listed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (Nippon Yakkyoku-h≈ç) received official drug prices under the National Health Insurance (NHI, Kokumin kenk≈ç hoken). Approved Kamp≈ç medicines Today in Japan, Kamp≈ç is integrated into the Japanese national health care system. In 1967, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved four Kamp≈ç medicines for reimbursement under the National Health Insurance (NHI) program. In 1976, 82 kampo medicines were approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. This number has increased to 148 Kampo formulation extracts, 241 crude drugs, and 5 crude drug preparations. Rather than modifying formulae as in Traditional Chinese medicine, the Japanese Kamp≈ç tradition uses fixed combinations of herbs in standardized proportions according to the classical literature of Chinese medicine. Kamp≈ç medicines are produced by various manufacturers. However, each medicine is composed of exactly the same ingredients under the Ministry's standardization methodology. The medicines are therefore prepared under strict manufacturing conditions that rival pharmaceutical companies. In October 2000, a nationwide study reported that 72% of registered physicians prescribe Kamp≈ç medicines. New Kamp≈ç medicines are being evaluated using modern techniques to evaluate their mechanism of action . Regulations, and likewise safety precautions, are much stronger and tighter for Japanese Kamp≈ç than Chinese traditional medicine due to strict enforcement of laws and standardization. Herbs The 14th edition of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP, Nihon yakkyokuh≈ç) lists 165 herbal ingredients that are used in Kamp≈ç medicines. cited in: Lots of the Kamp≈ç products are routinely tested for heavy metals, purity, and microbial content to eliminate any contamination. Kamp≈ç medicines are tested for the levels of key chemical constituents as markers for quality control on every formula. This is carried out from the blending of the raw herbs to the end product according to the Ministry's pharmaceutical standards. Medicinal mushrooms like Reishi and Shiitake are herbal products with a long history of use. In Japan, the Agaricus blazei mushroom is a highly popular herb, which is used by close to 500,000 people. In Japan, Agaricus blazei is also the most popular herb used by cancer patients. The second most used herb is an isolate from the Shiitake mushroom, known as Active Hexose Correlated Compound. Kamp≈ç outside Japan In the United States, Kamp≈ç is practiced mostly by acupuncturists, Chinese medicine practitioners, naturopath physicians, and other alternative medicine professionals. Kamp≈ç herbal formulae are studied under clinical trials, such as the clinical study of Honso Sho-saiko-to (H09) for treatment of hepatitis C at the New York Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C at the UCSD Liver Center. Both clinical trials are sponsored by Honso USA, Inc., a branch of Honso Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan.

A model describes how units of computations, memories, and communications are organized. The computational complexity of an algorithm can be measured given a model of computation. Using a model allows studying the performance of algorithms independently of the variations that are specific to particular implementations and specific technology. Models Models of computation can be classified in three categories: sequential models, functional models, and concurrent models. Sequential models include: * Finite state machines * Pushdown automata * Random access machines * Turing machines Functional models include: * Lambda calculus * General recursive functions * Combinatory logic * Abstract rewriting systems Concurrent models include: * Cellular automaton * Digital circuits * Kahn process networks * Petri nets * Synchronous Data Flow * Interaction nets * Actor model Models differ in their expressive power; for example, each function that can be computed by a Finite state machine can also be computed by a Turing machine, but not vice versa. A nondeterministic model of computation is associated with some of these models of computation. Nondeterministic models are not useful for practical computation; they are used in the study of computational complexity of algorithms. The unsolved problem P = NP is a well-known example. Uses In the field of runtime analysis of algorithms, it is common to specify a computational model in terms of primitive operations allowed which have unit cost, or simply unit-cost operations. A commonly used example is the random access machine, which has unit cost for read and write access to all of its memory cells. In this respect, it differs from the above-mentioned Turing machine model. Categories There are many models of computation, differing in the set of admissible operations and their computations cost. They fall into the following broad categories: * Abstract machine and models equivalent to it (e.g. lambda calculus is equivalent to the Turing machine) - used in proofs of computability and upper bounds on computational complexity of algorithms. * Decision tree models - used in proofs of lower bounds on computational complexity of algorithmic problems.

Geology Sugarloaf Mountain's geology is tied to the formation of Florida's sand ridges, specifically the Lake Wales Ridge. The mountain consists of relict sand ridges and dunes formed in a marine shoreline environment approximately 2 million years ago during the Pleistocene epoch. Since the Pleistocene, the sands comprising the mountain have probably been uplifted due to isostatic rebound of the crust beneath the Florida Platform. The uplift is attributed to the karstification/erosion of the platform, which is reducing the weight on the underlying basement rock, triggering a process similar to post glacial rebound.Adams, Peter N, Opdyke, Neil D., & Jaeger, John M.

Recreation Sugarloaf Mountain was recently recognized for its scenic, cultural, and historic value. The state of Florida designated the Green Mountain Scenic Byway, which primarily traverses the eastern side of the mountain. The route offers rare panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and access to newly acquired ecological preserves and historic sites. Biking along the Byway as well as on other roads on the mountain has become popular, due to the challenge imposed by the relatively rugged terrain of the mountain compared to the surrounding area. Sugarloaf Mountain also featured a golf course designed by the firm of Coore & Crenshaw.

A total of six units were built, with one prototype and five production units. They were among the last cars to be ordered by the BMT before the city takeover in 1940. The cars were designed to operate on both elevated and subway lines; its lightweight design allowed it to run on the oldest elevated lines without the need to upgrade them to handle heavier cars, while its aluminum alloy body also allowed it to run in the newer subway tunnels, where wooden cars were strictly prohibited. The prototype Bluebird entered service in 1939. While the BMT ordered 50 production Bluebirds, only five were built, due to the New York City Board of Transportation cancelling the order when it took over operations of the BMT in 1940. The cars were in service until being retired in 1957. None were preserved. Design The articulated unit, long, wide and high, consisted of three compartments placed on four trucks, connected by fully enclosed, hinged passageways. The Bluebird was an example of Art Deco industrial design, presenting a clean and mildly streamlined appearance. The Bluebird was designed during the Great Depression as a fast, physically attractive, and comfortable mass transit vehicle that would attract passengers, while instituting significant economies in production, operation, and maintenance. The car's lightweight body and running gear, combined with its short truckbase and segmented body, permitted it to operate on the oldest elevated structures, with their light loading tolerance and sharp curves, as well as in tunnel sections, where policy prohibited the use of the wooden cars typically used on elevated lines. A single Bluebird unit, numbered 8000, was purchased by the BMT as a prototype for a planned fleet of equipment that could operate universally on both standard subway lines and older elevated lines. The BMT expected the Bluebird to preserve its investment in its elevated railway lines without expensive upgrading for heavier subway equipment, while attracting passengers with its interior comforts. Tests demonstrated that its greatly improved operating parameters could have cut significant time from existing elevated train schedules. Bluebirds were the first PCC rapid transit cars utilizing the advanced running gear originally created for new-design streetcars. In addition to quick acceleration and braking (), the use of PCC technology meant that Bluebirds could share a significant part and maintenance base with the Brooklyn transit company's planned PCC trolley fleet, achieving economies of scale and efficiency. The Bluebirds were built by Clark Equipment Company of Battle Creek, Michigan, maker of PCC running gear. They were the only rapid transit cars ever built by Clark, and the only passenger rail equipment ever built by the company, other than one PCC streetcar. Fleet history Satisfied with tests on unit 8000, the BMT placed an order for an additional 50 units, which could replace 80 old elevated cars. However, the order was cancelled after the government of New York City purchased the BMT in June 1940. The City's Board of Transportation, already the operator of the Independent Subway System, was one of the most conservative transit operators in the United States, and had no interest in the former BMT's aggressive technology planning. Five more Bluebirds were in the process of construction at the time of cancellation, and the City decided to accept these, numbering them 8001‚Äì8005. They couldn't interoperate with unit 8000, which had no couplers or multiple unit trainline connections. Unit 8000 spent much of its service life on the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, home of many pieces of orphaned equipment, while units 8001‚Äì8005 operated regularly on the BMT Canarsie Line. On occasion, they also operated in Brighton‚ÄìFranklin Avenue Local service and on the Fourth Avenue Local. In those instances, it probably operated as an extra behind a regular interval. After delivery of the Bluebirds, New York City never again purchased any lightweight, articulated, or PCC technology rail equipment, nor did it purchase equipment to sustain the lines and portions of the elevated system incapable of operating subway cars. Most of the elevated lines were dismantled between 1940 and 1975. The Bluebirds were eventually retired and replaced by the R16s. Following their retirement, all of the Bluebirds were scrapped by 1957.

An optimal cache-oblivious algorithm is a cache-oblivious algorithm that uses the cache optimally (in an asymptotic sense, ignoring constant factors). Thus, a cache-oblivious algorithm is designed to perform well, without modification, on multiple machines with different cache sizes, or for a memory hierarchy with different levels of cache having different sizes. Cache-oblivious algorithms are contrasted with explicit blocking, as in loop nest optimization, which explicitly breaks a problem into blocks that are optimally sized for a given cache. Optimal cache-oblivious algorithms are known for matrix multiplication, matrix transposition, sorting, and several other problems. Some more general algorithms, such as Cooley‚ÄìTukey FFT, are optimally cache-oblivious under certain choices of parameters. Because these algorithms are only optimal in an asymptotic sense (ignoring constant factors), further machine-specific tuning may be required to obtain nearly optimal performance in an absolute sense. The goal of cache-oblivious algorithms is to reduce the amount of such tuning that is required. Typically, a cache-oblivious algorithm works by a recursive divide and conquer algorithm, where the problem is divided into smaller and smaller subproblems. Eventually, one reaches a subproblem size that fits into cache, regardless of the cache size. For example, an optimal cache-oblivious matrix multiplication is obtained by recursively dividing each matrix into four sub-matrices to be multiplied, multiplying the submatrices in a depth-first fashion. In tuning for a specific machine, one may use a hybrid algorithm which uses blocking tuned for the specific cache sizes at the bottom level, but otherwise uses the cache-oblivious algorithm. History The idea (and name) for cache-oblivious algorithms was conceived by Charles E. Leiserson as early as 1996 and first published by Harald Prokop in his master's thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1999.Harald Prokop. Cache-Oblivious Algorithms. Masters thesis, MIT. 1999. There were many predecessors, typically analyzing specific problems; these are discussed in detail in Frigo et al. 1999. Early examples cited include Singleton 1969 for a recursive Fast Fourier Transform, similar ideas in Aggarwal et al. 1987, Frigo 1996 for matrix multiplication and LU decomposition, and Todd Veldhuizen 1996 for matrix algorithms in the Blitz++ library. Idealized cache model Cache-oblivious algorithms are typically analyzed using an idealized model of the cache, sometimes called the cache-oblivious model. This model is much easier to analyze than a real cache's characteristics (which have complicated associativity, replacement policies, etc.), but in many cases is provably within a constant factor of a more realistic cache's performance. It is different than the external memory model because cache-oblivious algorithms do not know the block size or the cache size. In particular, the cache-oblivious model is an abstract machine (i.e. a theoretical model of computation). It is similar to the RAM machine model which replaces the Turing machine's infinite tape with an infinite array. Each location within the array can be accessed in O(1) time, similar to the random-access memory on a real computer. Unlike the RAM machine model, it also introduces a cache: a second level of storage between the RAM and the CPU. The other differences between the two models are listed below. In the cache-oblivious model: The cache on the left holds \\\\tfrac{M}{B} blocks of size B each, for a total of objects. The external memory on the right is unbounded. *Memory is broken into blocks of B objects each *A load or a store between main memory and a CPU register may now be serviced from the cache. *If a load or a store cannot be serviced from the cache, it is called a cache miss. *A cache miss results in one block being loaded from main memory into the cache. Namely, if the CPU tries to access word w and x is the line containing w, then x is loaded into the cache. If the cache was previously full, then a line will be evicted as well (see replacement policy below). *The cache holds M objects, where M = \\\\Omega(B^2). This is also known as the tall cache assumption. *The cache is fully associative: each line can be loaded into any location in the cache. *The replacement policy is optimal. In other words, the cache is assumed to be given the entire sequence of memory accesses during algorithm execution. If it needs to evict a line at time t, it will look into its sequence of future requests and evict the line that is accessed furthest in the future. This can be emulated in practice with the Least Recently Used policy, which is shown to be within a small constant factor of the offline optimal replacement strategyDaniel Sleator, Robert Tarjan. Amortized Efficiency of List Update and Paging Rules. In Communications of the ACM, Volume 28, Number 2, p.202-208. Feb 1985. To measure the complexity of an algorithm that executes within the cache-oblivious model, we measure the number of cache misses that the algorithm experiences. Because the model captures the fact that accessing elements in the cache is much faster than accessing things in main memory, the running time of the algorithm is defined only by the number of memory transfers between the cache and main memory. This is similar to the external memory model, which all of the features above, but cache-oblivious algorithms are independent of cache parameters (B and M).Erik Demaine. Cache-Oblivious Algorithms and Data Structures, in Lecture Notes from the EEF Summer School on Massive Data Sets, BRICS, University of Aarhus, Denmark, June 27‚ÄìJuly 1, 2002. The benefit of such an algorithm is that what is efficient on a cache-oblivious machine is likely to be efficient across many real machines without fine tuning for particular real machine parameters. For many problems, an optimal cache-oblivious algorithm will also be optimal for a machine with more than two memory hierarchy levels. Examples Illustration of row- and column-major order For example, it is possible to design a variant of unrolled linked lists which is cache-oblivious and allows list traversal of elements in \\\\tfrac{N}{B} time, where is the cache size in elements. For a fixed , this is O(N) time. However, the advantage of the algorithm is that it can scale to take advantage of larger cache line sizes (larger values of ). The simplest cache-oblivious algorithm presented in Frigo et al. is an out-of-place matrix transpose operation (in-place algorithms have also been devised for transposition, but are much more complicated for non- square matrices). Given m√ón array A and n√óm array B, we would like to store the transpose of in . The naive solution traverses one array in row-major order and another in column-major. The result is that when the matrices are large, we get a cache miss on every step of the column-wise traversal. The total number of cache misses is \\\\Theta(mn). Principle of cache-oblivious algorithm for matrix transposition using a divide and conquer-approach. The graphic shows the recursive step (a ‚Üí b) of dividing the matrix and transposing each part individually. The cache-oblivious algorithm has optimal work complexity O(mn) and optimal cache complexity O(1+mn/B). The basic idea is to reduce the transpose of two large matrices into the transpose of small (sub)matrices. We do this by dividing the matrices in half along their larger dimension until we just have to perform the transpose of a matrix that will fit into the cache. Because the cache size is not known to the algorithm, the matrices will continue to be divided recursively even after this point, but these further subdivisions will be in cache. Once the dimensions and are small enough so an input array of size m \\\\times n and an output array of size n \\\\times m fit into the cache, both row-major and column-major traversals result in O(mn) work and O(mn/B) cache misses. By using this divide and conquer approach we can achieve the same level of complexity for the overall matrix. (In principle, one could continue dividing the matrices until a base case of size 1√ó1 is reached, but in practice one uses a larger base case (e.g. 16√ó16) in order to amortize the overhead of the recursive subroutine calls.) Most cache-oblivious algorithms rely on a divide-and-conquer approach. They reduce the problem, so that it eventually fits in cache no matter how small the cache is, and end the recursion at some small size determined by the function-call overhead and similar cache-unrelated optimizations, and then use some cache- efficient access pattern to merge the results of these small, solved problems. Like external sorting in the external memory model, cache-oblivious sorting is possible in two variants: funnelsort, which resembles mergesort, and cache- oblivious distribution sort, which resembles quicksort. Like their external memory counterparts, both achieve a running time of O\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{N}{B} \\\\log_{\\\\tfrac{M}{B}} \\\\tfrac{N}{B}\\\\right), which matches a lower bound and is thus asymptotically optimal.

Discontinuation  In 2012/2013 the group announced that the \\"Toronto Dollar organization has had to suspend sales of Toronto Dollars due to lack of volunteers and the lack of infrastructure to support the work.\\"Toronto Dollar Community - http://www.torontodollar.com/ A current lack of an online presence of the Toronto dollar and its program indicates that the currency is most likely not poised for a revival. Several articles from various periods, as late as the 2013 downturn in the issuing and usage of the currency, seemingly confirm this theory. No update to the status of the program or the currency seems to be available via the internet at this time.

It was released in 2003 by Inpop Records. It is the most recent studio album released by Petra (excluding the Spanish version, released the following year). The music features a progressive metal sound that has drawn a comparison to Poison, Dio and Queensr√øche. The title of the album is based on Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde due to the similar issues of sin and temptation it deals with. Album background =Concept and songwriting= After the release of Revival, Petra's third praise album and their first album with Inpop Records, John Schlitt says fans started sending e-mails to the record company asking them for a more straightforward rock album. Inpop agreed to the idea and they started working on a second album together. Schlitt has said that the record company encouraged Petra founder, guitarist and main songwriter Bob Hartman to \\"write those songs that you're used to writing. Don't try to write like this or try to be like that. Just be you\\" which motivated Hartman.John Schlitt Interview on PetraRocksMyWorld; Renaud, Josh (September 11, 2003) New bassist Greg Bailey also collaborated in the writing of the song \\"Would'a, Could'a, Should'a\\", along with Hartman. The concept of the album, and its title track, is a reference to Robert Louis Stevenson novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. According to Hartman, it \\"is an intriguing look at the internal battle between right and wrong. It's about the fighting that goes on inside of us. It's like when Paul said, 'The things I want to do are the things I don't do, and the things I don't want to do are the things that I do.'\\"Petra Biography on Petraband.com According to Brent Handy, an industry insider that worked with singer John Schlitt on Project Damage Control, \\"the band thought that Jekyll & Hyde was a make-or-break album\\".Bob Hartman confirms that Petra plans to retire on PetraRocksMyWorld; Renaud, Josh =Recording= With Schlitt and Hartman as the only remaining members, Greg Bailey was hired as bassist. Bailey collaborated in the songwriting of one song and recorded background vocals. However, producer Peter Furler, one of Inpop's founders, decided to use session musicians Wade Jaynes and Phil Joel to play bass. The album also features Furler on drums replacing long-time member Louie Weaver for the recording. However, temporary drummer Justin Johnson is partially featured on the album booklet.

First published in 1970, the magazine is written for African-American women. History Edward Lewis, Clarence O. Smith, Cecil Hollingsworth and Jonathan Blount founded Essence Communications Inc. (ECI) in 1968. It began publishing Essence magazine in May 1970. Lewis and Smith called the publication a \\"lifestyle magazine directed at upscale African American women\\". They recognized that Black women were an overlooked demographic and saw Essence as an opportunity to capitalize on a virtually untouched market of Black women readers. Its initial circulation was approximately 50,000 copies per month, subsequently growing to roughly 1.6 million.Bynoe, Yvonne. Encyclopedia of Rap and Hip-hop Culture. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2006, p. 263, . Gordon Parks served as its editorial director during the first three years of its circulation. In 2000, Time Inc. purchased 49 percent of Essence Communications Inc. In 2005, Time Inc. made a deal with Essence Communications Inc. to purchase the remaining 51 percent. The deal placed the ownership of the 34-year-old Essence magazine, one of the United States' leading magazines for women of color, under widespread ownership, rather than black ownership.Carr, David. The New York Times, 2005. In January 2018, the magazine returned to a fully black-owned publication after its acquisition by Richelieu Dennis, the founder of Sundial Brands. As a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, Essence furloughed staff in 2020.

The magazine then began to include a greater number of models with darker skin complexions. In terms of hair types, long and wavy hairstyles were almost equally represented as short and curly styles. The sizes of the noses and lips of most of the models were considered average. The bodies of the models were not often displayed. When they were, thinner and average body types were more likely to be shown than fuller body types. These observations rose out of a study titled \\"Race and Gender in the Media: A Content Analysis of Advertisements in Two Mainstream Black Magazines.\\" They were then used to comment on what the image practices of Essence may say about how black media represents black people, chiefly black women, and how these representations may reflect and reveal larger truths about how black people themselves.

The bank was established by the Bank of Manchukuo Act at Hsinking (today Changchun) on 11 June 1932, as a joint stock company with a capital of 30,000,000 yuan, with the government holding at least 25% and at most 50% at any time.Manchukuo Government Notices Issue 13, 11 June Tatung 1 (1932). The bank officially opened its doors for business on July 1 as the amalgamation of the four note-issuing banks active in Manchuria prior to that time, namely: the Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, the Bank of Kirin, the Bank of Heilungkiang and the Frontier Bank controlled by local warlord Chang Tso-lin. It was later revealed by audits that acquiring the four previous banks of Manchuria to be financially irresponsible as the Central Bank of Manchou held a deficit of 30,000,000 yuan in combined liabilities, but the action was deemed necessary as it was the only way to get rid of the overabundant currency issued by those banks in Manchuria in order to create a better foundation for the new Manchukuo yuan. When the Central Bank of Manchou was created it had a sufficient number of gold reserves for the new currency and paid out a dividend of 6% to investors, the stable value of the Manchukuo yuan was a major contributing factor for the development of the economy of Manchukuo.The Currency Collector JAPANESE SPONSORED COIN AND BANK NOTE ISSUES FOR THE OCCUPIED REGIONS OF CHINA by John E. Sandrock. Retrieved: 11 April 2018. The principal functions of the Bank were to act as a repository for the funds of the Manchukuo State Treasury, control the money market, unify the monetary system of Manchukuo and stabilize its currency. However, the Bank also engaged in ordinary banking business such as granting agricultural, industrial and commercial credit. In addition, the Bank served as Japan's agent in Manchukuo with the withdrawal of the Korean Bank of Chosen from the region. With its head office in Hsinking, the Bank had nearly 140 branches throughout Manchukuo, China and Japan proper. Pursuant to the Currency Law of 1932 which authorized the creation of the Bank, Manchukuo adopted a unit of currency, the Manchukuo yuan, containing 23.91 grams of pure silver, the metal on which Chinese currencies traditionally were based. The Bank was required by its charter to hold as a reserve against its issued notes at least 30% of the value of such issue in gold and silver bullion, reliable foreign currencies and deposits with foreign banks in gold and silver accounts. The Bank's notes were not required to be redeemable in specie. Due to worldwide fluctuations in the price of silver during the 1930s, Manchukuo took the yuan off a silver standard in 1935 and subsequently pegged the yuan to, and later reached approximate exchange parity with, the Japanese yen. Central Bank of Manchou 1 yuan (1932) The Bank initially issued approximately 150 million yuan in notes in 1932. By 1936, their aggregate value exceeded 200 million yuan, rising to 300 million in 1937, 400 million in 1938 and 620 million by the end of 1939. Throughout this period about half the value of the issued notes was backed by specie reserves. The notes issued were in five denominations, one hundred, ten, five and one yuan and five chiao (one-half yuan). To keep up with the inflationary pressures typically experienced by Japanese controlled areas towards the end of World War II, a 1,000 yuan note was issued in 1944. In 1948, after the end of World War II, approximately 12 billion yuan of Central Bank of Manchou notes were redeemed by the Tung Pei Bank. As with Chinese coinage of the time, Manchukuo's coinage was based on the decimal system, one- tenth of the yuan being called the \\"chiao,\\" one-hundredth called a \\"fen\\" and one-thousandth, a \\"li.\\" Under the Currency Law the Central Bank of Manchukuo was authorized to mint 1 chiao and 5 fen coins of a nickel-copper alloy; and 1 fen and 5 li coins of a copper-tin-zinc alloy. Dating system Manchukuo was established in March 1932 with Puyi assuming the title of Chief Executive of the new state using the era name of Datong (Wade-Giles: Ta-tung; Â§ßÂêå). Following the traditional dating system based on the year of the ruler's reign, the year 1932 became the first year of Datong . Two years later, Manchukuo was changed into an empire, with Puyi ascending the throne as Emperor of Manchukuo under the reign title, Kangde (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Kang-te; Â∫∑Âæ∑). Accordingly, 1934 was designated the first year of Kangde (Kang-te), while 1942 was the ninth year of Kangde (Kang-te).

He was appointed to cabinet on June 12, 1963 as Provincial Secretary and Minister of Public Utilities. In 1964, Steinkopf was implicated in controversial a land assembly payment. Although Premier Roblin later referred to the matter as an innocent technical breach, it was considered serious enough for Steinkopf to resign his position and his seat in the legislature. He was re-elected in a by-election on September 30, and was re-appointed to cabinet on October 8. During the flag debates of the 1960s, Steinkopf favoured a design competition for a new provincial flag. Steinkopf did not run for re-election in 1966.

Cartwright (1793‚Äì1863) Drapetomania was a conjectural mental illness that, in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized as the cause of enslaved Africans fleeing captivity. Contemporarily reprinted in the South, Cartwright's article was widely mocked and satirized in the northern United States. The concept has since been debunked as pseudoscience and shown to be part of the edifice of scientific racism. The term derives from the Greek Œ¥œÅŒ±œÄŒ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ (drapetes, \\"a runaway [slave]\\") and ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ± (mania, \\"madness, frenzy\\"). As late as 1914, the third edition of Thomas Lathrop Stedman's Practical Medical Dictionary included an entry for drapetomania, defined as \\"Vagabondage, dromomania; an uncontrollable or insane impulsion to wander.\\" Also available from Internet Archive  Description  Cartwright described the disorder ‚Äì which, he said, was \\"unknown to our medical authorities, although its diagnostic symptom, the absconding from service, is well known to our planters and overseers\\" ‚Äì in a paper delivered before the Medical Association of Louisiana that was widely reprinted. He stated that the malady was a consequence of masters who \\"made themselves too familiar with [slaves], treating them as equals\\".Baynton, Douglas C. \\"Disability and the Justification of Inequality in American History\\". The New Disability History: American Perspectives, 2001. In Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race, Cartwright points out that the Bible calls for a slave to be submissive to his master, and by doing so, the slave will have no desire to run away. = Prevention and remedy = In addition to identifying drapetomania, Cartwright prescribed a remedy. His feeling was that with \\"proper medical advice, strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many Negroes have of running away can be almost entirely prevented\\". As a remedy for this \\"disease\\", doctors made running a physical impossibility by prescribing the removal of both big toes. In the case of slaves \\"sulky and dissatisfied without cause\\"‚Äìa warning sign of imminent flight‚ÄìCartwright prescribed \\"whipping the devil out of them\\" as a \\"preventative measure\\". =Contemporary criticism= While Cartwright's article was reprinted in the South, in the northern United States it was widely mocked. A satirical analysis of the article appeared in a Buffalo Medical Journal editorial in 1855. Renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, in A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States (1856), observed that white indentured servants had often been known to flee as well, so he satirically hypothesized that the supposed disease was actually of white European origin, and had been introduced to Africa by traders.

She was always a pleasure to spend time with both on and off the set. I still think of her often and I feel blessed to have experienced her friendship and her amazing sense of humor. I miss her beautiful smiling face.\\" The last thing she said about the times that she and Lee spent together, while not doing General Hospital, like fundraisers or primarily eating out was, \\"Yes, and I enjoyed every minute of the time Anna Lee and I spent together. She was such fun to be around and she had the best sense of humor. Very earthy.

Stavanger Offset AS. Page 131. . History Dating in 871, T√∏nsberg is commonly believed to have been the oldest Norwegian town and one of the oldest recorded fortified locations in Norway. According to Snorri Sturluson, T√∏nsberg was founded before the Battle of Hafrsfjord under which King Harald I of Norway united Norway under his rule. T√∏nsberg was an important trading center and site of the Haugating, the Thing (assembly) for Vestfold and one of Norway's most important places for the proclamation of kings. In the 13th century, King Haakon Haakonson built a castle, Tunsberghus, at the location of the modern T√∏nsberg municipality. It was located at what was formerly one of the most important harbors in Norway. The castle was greatly expanded during the reigns of H√•kon H√•konsson and Magnus Lagab√∏te, who added large walls, towers, residential halls and a church. The last king of a fully independent Norway, H√•kon V Magnusson, died at the castle in 1319. Only a few ruins of the fortress remain today. The modern-day tower (Slottsfjellet i T√∏nsberg) was raised in 1888 as a memorial of the historic fortress. In 1971, local authorities improved the insulation. At that time new plaques were mounted inside the tower. On the sides are the gilded signatures of three modern Kings of Norway: Haakon VII (1 August 1906), Olav V (1 July 1958) and Harald V (9 March 1992). The plaque over the entrance reads: A model displaying how the castle might have looked like during the Middle Ages Slottsfjellet i T√∏nsberg Chronology *871 - The commercial town of Tunsberg existed. It served as a stronghold for the Ynglings, who first came to power in Vestfold in this period. * 11th century - The commercial town and fortress at Tunsberg, on the Oslofjord outdistanced Skiringssal as a trading center. * 1201 - Sverre Sigurdsson, king of Norway from 1177‚Äì1202, was attacked in Oslo by combined forces from the Oppland, Viken, Telemark and Tunsberg. Although they outnumbered Sverre's forces, they were defeated by Sverre's superior tactics. One of their ablest leaders, Reidar Sendemann, took refuge in the heights of Tunsberg mountain. In September 1201, Sverre lay siege with a force of 1000 men, forcing their surrender after 5 months. Unfortunately for Sverre, he took ill in the siege and returned to Bergen only to die later in 1202. *1253 - Haakon Haakonsson, king 1217-1263, constructed a castellated wall around the mountain and provided support buildings within the fortification. *1253 - Successfully resisted attack by Danish forces. *1261 - Magnus Lagab√∏ter, king of Norway 1263-1280, brought his bride Ingeborg of Denmark to live in the castle. *1319 - Haakon V Magnusson, king 1299-1319, the last of the Harald- lineage (Haralds-√¶tten) lay ill and died at T√∏nsberghus. *1335 - Magnus Eriksson, king from 1319‚Äì1374, was wedded here to Blanche of Namur, who received the castle as a gift from her husband. *1387 - When the castles were no longer occupied by Norwegian royalty, the most important lords were the governors of the four chief Norwegian fortresses, T√∏nsberghus, Akershus, B√•hus, and Bergenhus. *1503 - As the Kalmar Union collapsed, Norwegian attempts to rebel were suppressed by Danish forces. Tunsberghus fortress was destroyed by Swedish soldiers and disloyal local peasants. *1856 - T√∏nsberg Maritime Club built a wooden watchtower which burnt down in 1874. *1888 - Tunsberg Slottsfjellet, the present tower was built.

Card ranking  *Ace of swords/spades (\\"Espada\\" in Southeast of Brazil, \\"Ancho de espadas\\" or \\"Macho\\" (male) in Argentina, \\"Espadilla\\" in Uruguay) *Ace of clubs (\\"Ancho de basto\\", \\"Bastillo\\" in Uruguay) *7 of swords (\\"Siete de espadas\\", \\"Siete Bravo\\" in Uruguay, \\"Manilha de Espada\\" in South of Brazil) *7 of gold (Siete de oro in Spanish or Sete Ouro, Sete belo or Maneca de Ouro in Portuguese, \\"Siete Bello\\" in Uruguay) *3s *2s *Ace of cup and ace of gold (Anchos falsos in Spanish, √Ås falso in Southeast of Brazil, Gueime in South of Brazil, \\"Copon\\" and \\"Huevo Frito\\" respectively in Uruguay ) *Kings (Reyes in Spanish and Reis in Portuguese) (12s) *Knights (Caballo, the King, Knight and Jack are called \\"Cartas Negras\\") (11s) *Jacks (\\"valetes\\" in Brazil, \\"Sota\\" in Argentina) (10s) *7 of clubs and 7 of cups (Sietes falsos in Spanish or Sete Copa in Portuguese, all cards from here down are considered \\"Cartas Blancas\\") *6s *5s *4s (zap in the southeast of Brazil) The Uruguayan version uses a \\"Muestra\\" each hand. The following cards of the same suit as the \\"Muestra\\" are ranked higher than the Ace of swords and are called \\"Piezas\\": 2, 4, 5, Knight, which in some regions is called Perico, worth 30 points, and the Jack, which in some regions is called Perica, worth 29 points. Finally, if any player has the King of the same suit as the \\"Muestra\\" and the \\"Muestra\\" is a \\"Pieza\\", the King becomes that card. The Venezuelan version is similar to the Uruguayan version, exception that the \\"Piezas\\" 2, 4, and 5 are not used. The \\"Muestra\\", or \\"vira\\" as it is known in Venezuela is designated by turning over the top card of the deck after shuffle or optionally, the top card following the deal. \\"La Vira\\" is then placed beneath the deck offset 90 degrees so that it is visible during the hand. The suit of La Vira designates the suit of El Perico (the Knight) and La Perica (the Jack) which become the highest two cards in the game. The remaining three Knights and Jacks are ranked as initially specified.  Mano (M√£o) and Pie (P√©)  In Truco, two concepts govern which player begins the round and who ends it. The mano in Spanish or m√£o in Portuguese (\\"hand\\") is the one that plays first and the pie in Spanish or p√© in Portuguese (\\"foot\\"), the dealer, is the last to play. The hand is always the player on the right of the foot. The turn to deal is then passed counterclockwise, so the hand of the first round is the foot of the second and so on. If playing in teams, partners sit opposite each other. They can also refer, when playing in teams of two, which player of the partnership plays before and which after. This has no significance in the game, as the playing is always done counterclockwise. But it has strategic significance since the foot of a team is traditionally considered the \\"captain\\" of the partnership that round. If the game is tied (for example, if two opponents have the same points for envido), the hand wins. That advantage is offset by the fact that, as the last one to play, the foot plays with all their opponent's cards in sight. Also, the foot and the one sitting to the foot's left call envido in a game of four or more. Then, the hand is the first one to call his points for envido.  Scoring  Players can earn points in three ways: *Truco - winning in the playing of the cards (the \\"tricks\\"). *Envido - having the best combination of two cards of the same suit or a single card. *Flor - having all three cards of the same suit. The points won by a player are added to their team's score (when playing in teams). Any bet, win, loss, or surrender by a player also affects their partners. For this reason, partnerships are usually formed by mutual arrangement. As in bridge, it is not rare for partners to share information using pre-established signs and gestures. Communication is usually performed by standard gestures. Arranging a secret set of gestures is frowned upon.  Gameplay  Each player is dealt three cards from a subset of the deck consisting of the numbers 1 to 7 and figures sota in Spanish or valete in Portuguese (jack, worth 10), caballo in Spanish or dama in Portuguese (equivalent to a queen, worth 11) and rey in Spanish or rei in Portuguese (king, worth 12). The most common form of the game is the four-player version, in which two teams of two players sit opposite each other. For six players, the two teams have three players, with every second player on the same team. The game is played until a team finishes a game with 30 points or more. The 30 points are commonly split into two halves, the lower half called malas in Spanish or ruins in Portuguese (bad) and the higher half called buenas in Spanish or boas in Portuguese (good). Therefore, a team with 8 points would be ocho malas or oito ruins (8 bad ones), and a team with 21 points would be seis buenas or seis boas (6 good ones). However, because both teams can score points in one round, it is possible (but rare) for both teams to go over 30 points in one round. Usually as soon as one team goes over 30 points, the game is ended, to prevent a tie. However, sometimes the winner is the one with more points, otherwise another hand is played, until the tie is broken. Each type of scoring can be bid on to score more points. Bids can be accepted, rejected or upped. Bluffing and deception are fundamental strategies. Each round has three tricks. The mano leads to the first trick by playing one card. Then, counterclockwise, each other player plays one card. The player with the highest card wins the trick. The cards remain face-up on the table during the round. Sometimes the highest cards tie. If these tied cards were played by the same team, that team wins the trick. Otherwise, the trick is called a draw, parda. The same mano then leads the next trick. Winning two of three tricks wins a round, equivalent to one point. If one team wins the first two tricks, the third is not played. But if one of the games ends in a parda, the team that won the earlier of the other two tricks wins the round (e.g. If trick 1 was won by A, trick 2 was won by B, and trick 3 was a draw, A wins the round for having won the earlier trick). That concept is often referred to as \\"primera vale doble\\" (first is worth double) If trick 1 is drawn and trick 2 is won by B, the winner of the round is B and a third trick is not played). In the case of two pardas, the winner of the remaining trick wins the round. In case of three pardas, the mano wins the round. The winner of each round is the first to play the next card. If a round is tied, or \\"parda\\", the hand plays first. During play, the teams have multiple opportunities to raise the stakes. *Truco - Any player can call truco at any stage to increase the value of the round to 2 points for the winner team. To accept the bet, the challenged team says quiero. If not, no quiero, and the round ends, so the challenger team wins one point and a new round begins. *Retruco - The team that answered quiero to the truco can call retruco to increase the value of the round to 3 points. It may be said immediately after truco or after having accepted the bet. The other team must answer with quiero or no quiero. If the answer is no quiero, the round ends and the team that called retruco wins 2 points. *Vale cuatro - The team that answered the retruco can say this immediately after the retruco or after accepting it. This makes the round worth 4 points and is the highest allowable bet. If the challenged team refuses the bet, the team that called vale cuatro wins the round and scores 3 points. Truco must be accepted explicitly: if truco is said, the only way to accept it is by saying quiero, but in a less competitive fashion it could be accepted to close the challenge saying veo, dale or another way of saying yes . To call retruco immediately, it is necessary first to say quiero (and the same is true when calling vale cuatro). Instead of saying explicitly quiero, a player can play a card and it is implied that they accepted. A player can play his card face up or face down, in which case it does not count towards the score. A card can be played face down in order to prevent opponents from deducing the value of a remaining card. In some cases (for example, when envido has been played), other players may be able to deduce the value of some of the remaining ones. If a player does not want his opponents to know his cards, which can be done in order to trick them into raising their bets, they can play their card face down. This should not be confused with irse al mazo (going to the deck), which means a whole team admits defeat without finishing the hand. = Envido = In games of two people, envido must be said before the player plays a card. In games of four or six, the foot and the player to the left of the foot are the ones who say envido (when they do, there are already cards played). Envido bets have precedence before Truco bets. If one team calls Truco, and then the other calls Envido, the last must be completed (accepting, increasing or declining it) before the Truco. When Envido is said, the challenged team/player can answer in any of these ways: *Quiero - accepts to take the bet. *Envido - accepts the 2 points of the first Envido and proposes to raise the bet by 2 points. *Real Envido - accepts the 2 points of the first Envido and proposes to raise the bet by 3 points. *Falta Envido - if both players score less than 15, the one with the highest score wins the game. If they score more than 15, the winner gets as many points as his opponent is short of reaching 30. *No quiero - refuses to take the last bet. Thus, the challenger team/player earns 1 point if no one raises, or the number of points that were accepted (e.g. Envido-Real Envido-No quiero is 2 worth points). For Real Envido, the answers are the same, excepting Envido (because it would \\"lower\\" the bet). For Falta Envido, the answers are also the same as in Envido, excepting Envido and Real Envido (that leaves only Quiero and No quiero). Quiero and No quiero close the bet and after one of that, no other Envido bet can be opened. In the cases where the bet is ended with Quiero, a comparison of the pairs (puntos de envido = \\"score of envido\\") is performed to see which team/player has the highest and wins the bet. The puntos de envido are calculated thusly: *The score of a pair of the same suit is the sum of the values of the cards + 20, but considering that the King (12s), the Knights (11s) and Sotas (10s) are worth 0. *If the player has no suit pair, then his puntos de envido is the value of his highest card, with Kings, Knights and Sotas worth 0. *If playing without Flor, in case of having three cards of the same suit, the puntos de envido are those of the highest pair of the hand. *A player is obliged to report his score correctly, even though that can be used later to deduce his cards. For example, if a player has already played a six of spades and they have 27 for envido, they are forced to report his correct score, even if doing that means they reveal their ace of spades to the rest of the players. If the winner reports his score wrong, the related points are assigned to the other team. The puntos de envido are told from the mano to the dealer player anticlockwise. In case of a tie, the earliest (i.e. the one most on the left among the tied players) has preference. Any player with a bad envido can fold without revealing his cards to the other team/player by saying Son buenas (\\"They're good\\"). To say this when playing in teams is to surrender on behalf of the team. It is usual that while telling the puntos de envido, the partner of the player that with the highest envido remains silent unless the other team says a higher envido. Then, the silent player either raises or folds. After finishing the truco, the winner of envido has to show his cards by placing them on the table and announcing \\"[the amount of the envido] en mesa\\", or, in Argentina \\"las [the amount of the envido] jugadas\\" meaning that the announced cards have been played. Failure to do so may be noted by the other team who then takes the points. The envido is also referred to as tanto, in order to talk about it without actually proposing it. = Flor = A Flor is three cards of the same suit in the hand. Any player with Flor must announce it or risk a penalty. The player with the best Flor wins 3 points for each Flor. A player without a Flor cannot announce one (on the contrary to Envido, where any player can announce it). The call for Flor can only be made before playing the first card, by simply saying Flor. Then, any other player having Flor must announce his/her own (play is suspended, so players without Flores wait until the bet is over), going anticlockwise and by saying any of: *Flor: A simple announcement. If nothing more is said, the team having the best Flor scores 3 points for each Flor announced this way or by an accepted ContraFlor (see below). *Con Flor me achico: A player announces that they have Flor, but surrenders on behalf of the team. The Flor bet is closed and the opponent team scores 3 points for their Flores and 1 for the player's surrender. *ContraFlor: A player announces Flor and challenges the opponent to answer (see below). *ContraFlor al resto: A player announces Flor and proposes to raise the bet to the number of points the leading team needs to win the game plus 3 for each Flor. After calling ContraFlor, the challenged team must answer: *Con Flor quiero: the challenged team confirms that each Flor will be three points. *Con Flor me achico: The same as above. *ContraFlor al resto: See above. After ContraFlor al resto, the answers are: *Con Flor quiero: Accepts raising the bet to the number of points the leading team needs to win plus 3 per each Flor. *Con Flor me achico: See above. After the bet has been closed by saying con Flor quiero or con Flor me achico, players announce the Flores. The comparison between Flores is done as in Envido: the values of the three cards are added up plus 20 (Aces to 7 are worth the face value and Sotas, Knights and Kings, 0). When two Flores have the same suit, the one of that player playing earlier (counting anticlockwise) has precedence. If an earlier player announces a better Flor, it is usual to say son buenas, admitting defeat but without revealing information about their cards. At the end of the hand, the Flores must be shown. As with all bets in Truco, each Flor (or surrender) is made on behalf of the team. In Argentina, Truco is sometimes played without Flor, called Sin Flor, or Sin Jardinera (without the gardenmaid).  Pedir Flor  This is a penalty for those players that, having a Flor, do not announce it. If a player suspects that another is hiding a Flor, he/she can challenge this player by saying Pido Flor. In the case that the player had actually a Flor, the challenger team earns three points. But, if the challenged player shows at least two different cards, his/her team earns one point.  Tricks  Truco players trick their opponents: * Playing fast and distracting them through constant conversation and jokes. *Raising the stakes and bluffing. *Asking questions with the words envido or truco while holding the cards (when holding cards, a player is active and can call a bet). For example, assuming players A and C form a team, and B and D the opposing team, Player A may bid envido and Player B may ask while being active -- \\"did he say envido?\\", which effectively raises the stakes. This may entice either A or C to quickly call \\"quiero\\", as they may have been fooled into thinking the raise was out of clumsiness and not really intended. *When holding both a high and a low card, the low is placed in front of the high a and allowing an opponent to glimpse it, to convince them a truco is possible.  Pica Pica  In a game of 6, sometimes Pica Pica is also played. Instead of two teams of three, opposing players pair up and play a game, adding the resulting points to their team's score. Usually Pica Pica is played every other game, but only if a team has 5 or more points, and no team has more than 20 (or 25). Pica Pica is also known as Punta y Hacha. This is a way of finishing the game more quickly, because each pair in a pica pica plays a complete hand, with corresponding scores. Therefore, it is possible to have, for example, three vale cuatro in the same hand, which quickly raises scores. However, envidos and its raises are usually capped (usually 6 points).  Truco in Brazil  Truco is popular in Brazil, with many regional variations. The most known versions (Truco Paulista and Truco Mineiro) use a French deck and different rules. Truco Paulista can be known as Ponta Acima in some regions. Truco in Brazil is mostly associated with college culture and lifestyle. Students typically sit on a table to play while drinking alcoholic beverages. This scene has been featured in advertising campaigns and it was included in the program of every University \\"Olympic\\" Games around the country, known as Jogos Universit√°rios. Truco can be played by two, three and even four people in each team, which makes is thought to make it more exciting. Brazilian Truco has a maximum score of 12 points, values hands and cards differently (depending on where the game is played). It is common to use a best-of-three games system. = Truco Paulista = Truco Paulista is played mostly in the state of S√£o Paulo and is usually played between two teams of two players each. The game is won by the first team to reach 12 points. Each regular round is worth 1 point. One player is the first to shuffle and deal. The dealer is allowed to look at the faces of the cards while shuffling so as to be able to place certain cards at certain spots within the deck (e.g. placing the highest-ranking cards together). They are not allowed, however, to browse freely through the deck. After shuffling, the deck must be handed to the player to the left (the cortador), who can either reshuffle (without looking at the faces of the cards). cut it or do nothing. The deck (or the part of it chosen by the cortador) is then returned to the dealer who deals the cards from the top or bottom of the deck (this is chosen by the cortador). The cards must be dealt counter-clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's right. They can be dealt one at a time or, most commonly, three at a time. If the cortador chooses not to reshuffle, they can deal their and their partner's cards in advance. The players each play one card, starting with the player to the right of the dealer, the m√£o (hand) and ending with the dealer, called the p√© (foot). The player who played the highest-ranked card wins the trick for the team and begins the subsequent trick. The rounds consist of a best-of-three tricks. The team that wins two tricks wins the round and gets the point. If the first trick (or first and second tricks) ends in a tie, the winner of the next trick wins the round. If the second or third tricks end in a tie, the winner of the first trick wins the hand. In the rare occasion that all three tricks end in ties, nobody is awarded the point. In the case of a tie, the following trick is started by the player who tied the last trick. At any point during the game any of the players can raise the stakes by saying truco. When a player asks for truco, the opposing team has three options: * Accept: the round is now worth three points; * Fold: the team that asked for truco gets one point; * Raise the stakes even further by asking for 6 (this can also be done later at any point if the team chooses to accept the truco). If the team chooses to ask for 6 the round is now worth three points. The opposing team (the one who asked for truco) has the same three options: * Accept: the round is now worth six points; * Fold: the team that asked for 6 gets three points; * Raise the stakes even further by asking for 9. This system goes on in this same pattern, with the players raising the stakes further to game and finally match. When one of the teams reaches 11 points, they play the m√£o-de-onze (round of eleven). In this round, the members of each team can see their partner's cards before the round begins and the team with eleven points may choose to play the round of run away. If they choose to play, the round is worth three points. If they choose to run away, the opposing team is awarded one point. If any of the players ask for truco during the round of eleven, the team loses the round. For this reason, if one of the players is dealt an unbeatable hand (having the two best cards at the same time) they may simply show the cards to the rest of the table and win the round without having to play. If both teams reach eleven points, the round must be played. If one of the players receives fewer or more than three cards dealt by a member of the opposing team, they can point out this error after the round has begun and win the round. If the error is pointed out before the hand begins the deck must be shuffled and the cards dealt again. In Truco Paulista the cards are ranked in the following order, from strongest to weakest: * Trump cards; * 3s * 2s * Aces * Kings * Jacks * Queens * 7s * 6; * 5s * 4s 8s, 9s and 10s are never included. Upon agreement, the 7s, 6s, 5s, and 4s can be removed from the deck, this is called playing with a clean deck (jogar com baralho limpo). After the cards are dealt, one card from the remainder of the deck is turned over to determine the trump cards (manilhas), which rank above all others. The trump cards are the cards directly above the one which was turned over (e.g. if the card revealed is a 7, the trump cards are the queens). The strength of a trump card when compared to the others is determined by its suit, with diamonds being the weakest, followed by spades, hearts and clubs being the strongest. = Truco Mineiro = Truco mineiro is a variety of Truco played mostly in the state of Minas Gerais. The rules are mostly the same as in Truco Paulista, except: * Regular rounds are worth 2 points instead of 1; * When a player asks for truco, they propose the round be worth 4 points; if refused, the team receives 2 points. * When a player asks for 6, they propose the round be worth 8 points; if refused, the team receives 4 points; * When a player asks for 9, they propose the round be worth 10 points; if refused, the team receives 8 points; The round of eleven is replaced by the roughly similar round of ten, except that only the team with ten points is allowed to see each other's cards and that the round is worth four points instead of three. If both teams reach ten points the round must be played and they are not allowed to see each other's cards. Truco mineiro uses a fixed set of trump cards, so there is no need to turn one card over after dealing to determine them (the order of the suits remain the same, however). The ranking of the cards is: * 4 of clubs (known as zap) * 7 of hearts * Ace of spades (known as espadilha) * 7 of diamonds (known as pica fumo or simply sete de ouros) * 3s * 2s * Aces (except the ace of spades) * Kings * Jacks * Queens * 7s (clubs and spades only) * 6s * 5s * 4s (except the 4 of clubs) The game can also be played with only the cards up to the Queens, removing 4 through 7.  Se√±as (signals)  Se√±as are gestures used between players of the same team to tell the pie (captain) their most valuables cards or if they have a good envido score. In some versions the official se√±as must be used, rather than private ones not generally understood. In the Argentine game the accepted se√±as are: *Ancho de Espadas (Ace of swords) - Both eyebrows up or wink with the right eye. *Ancho de Bastos (Ace of clubs) - Wink with the left eye. *Siete de Espadas (Seven of swords) - With lips closed, slightly move the right side to the right. *Siete de Oro (Seven of gold) - With lips closed, slightly move the left side to the left. *Tres (any three) - Slowly and gently move the lower lip inside and take it back out slightly biting it with the two front teeth. *Dos (any two) - With lips closed, move them to the outside as if they were simulating a kiss. The lips remain closed. *Ancho Falso (Ace of cups and ace of gold) - Mouth open for few seconds or inflate the cheeks. *High score for envido - Shrink the middle of the face in such a way that the skin of the nose shrinks too. Another usual gesture is to slightly (and quickly) tilt your head towards the shoulder. *Low or no score for truco - Blink both eyes. *12, 11 or 10 - Touch shoulder, chin, triceps of the arm or elbow. Se√±as take time to master. The player has to be careful to avoid detection by opposing players, although because of this the se√±as also can be used as a strategy to trick them (for example, show a gesture of a low valuable card and then play with an unexpected card).  Jargon (Spanish)  Many informal expressions have become part of the game, such as: *Siete bravo (brave seven) - the seven of spades and the seven of gold are sometimes referred to as brave sevens. *Estar cargado (to be loaded) - to have high score for a potential envido or to have a good hand for truco. *Ven√≠ (come) - this is said to a player by the pie in order to ask them to play their lowest card. *Ven√≠ ac√° (come here) - this is said to a player by the pie in order to ask them to play their lowest card because (the pie supposedly has a good card to win the hand. *And√° all√° (go there) - this is said to a player by the pie in order to ask them to play their lowest card because some other player has a good card to win the hand. Makes no sense in two-person team, so is usually used in 3-men team games. *Estoy seco (I'm dry) or Estoy ciego (I'm blind) - this specifies that they a player either has no points for envido or good cards to win the hand. *No ha venido - This is said in a rhyming response to an envido when the player wants to refuse it. *Va por las tuyas (Go on your own) - This is said by a player who does not have a good score when either truco or envido is proposed, to let other players know that they should accept or decline based on their cards solely. *Falta un vidrio - This is sometimes said humorously, because it sounds like falta envido. *Jugala callado (Play it quietly) - This is said so that the other player does not call truco or envido. *Son las tuyas (It's yours (your cards)) - This is said to indicate that the other player on a team should state their envido because the speaker's hand is too poor. *A cara de perro - Literally dog-faced. Players require of each other perfect compliance with the rules, especially regarding the displaying of envido. When playing among friends, often a player is excused if they forget to show their cards for envido. However, when playing with strangers or for money, people tend to play a cara de perro, meaning that they do not accept any error on the opponent's part. Another example would be interpreting any word as a call, even when it's obvious by context that it is not so. *Est√° peluda - This is said either when a player can win the hand but it leaves them with no other cards or when a player has low cards. *Dormir adentro/ Dormir afuera (Sleep inside/ Sleep outside - This is said either when a team makes more than 15 points or less than 15 points respectively. = Jargon (Brazil) = *Baralho Vazio/Baralho Limpo (empty deck/clean deck) - used for the variations where the lowest cards 7s, 6s, 5s and 4s are not used. *Baralho cheio/Baralho sujo (full deck/ dirty deck) - uses all the 40 cards. *Melar/Cangar/Embuchar/Amarrar - to play a card of the same value as the highest card at the table. *M√£o de Onze (also m√£o de dez)- When a player (or team) or both players (or teams) has 11 (or 10) points. *M√£o de Ferro (also m√£o escondida)- When both teams have need one point to win so the last round is playable in the dark (no escuro) where no one sees the cards. (This option is chosen by the players when both teams agree. Usually played in Truco Paulista). *Cair (to fall) - To accept a Truco, Seis or Nove. *Correr (to run) - To quit when the other player (or team) calls Truco, Seis or Nove. *Manilhas - trump cards. In Truco Paulista, manilha are the cards of the next number of the one who was trumped at the beginning of the round. For example: if a 2 is trumped, the manilha are the 3s. Then, the strength of each manilha depends on the stamp, which follows (strongest to weakest): clubs (zap), hearts (copas), spades (espadilha), diamonds (pica-fumo). *M√£o (hand) - The first to play. *P√© (foot) - The last to play. *Marreco/Pato (duck) - During the game, the losers are called patos or marrecos. *Turco (Turk),T√∫lio (a male name),Suco (juice)... - words sounding similar to truco, used to joke (and scare team partners) during a M√£o de Onze, when it is not allowed to call truco (mostly the play that say truco lose the game). *Na testa (to the forehead) - The player with the strongest card in the game, the Zap, in order to show complete happiness for winning that round screams Na testa! and smashes the card directly to the opponent's forehead, often after licking it. *Meio Pau/Meio saco (half dick/half sack)- to call Seis (works like a retruco). Meio means half and Seis is 6 (half dozen). However, in many variations, Seis does not mean 6 points. *Morrer de pau duro (to die with a boner) - Losing the round despite holding hand the Zap. *Surra de pau mole (equivalent to \\"pig blapping\\") - This one has many similar meanings. Basically it means winning the game or round on a bluff. *Passar de baixo da mesa (to pass under the table) - When the opponents lose without making any points, they have to literally pass under the table as a punishment. It is used mainly in the southern like in the state of Santa Catarina. *A primeira vai √† missa (first hand is golden) - a way to indicate the importance of the first hand. Jargon is often used to fool the other team.

At that time, Brazil was in the peak of a military dictatorship, and the Brazilian Armed Forces were unwilling to allow even their civilian supporters to have any real share of power. Pedro Aleixo, Costa e Silva's civilian vice-president, should have become acting president under the Constitution of 1967, but was prevented from taking office. The Junta was composed of the three armed forces ministers: Army Minister General Aur√©lio de Lira Tavares, Navy Minister Admiral Augusto Hamann Rademaker Gr√ºnewald and Air Force Minister Brigadier M√°rcio de Souza e Mello. They ruled under the provisions of the highly repressive Fifth Institutional Act (AI-5). History In August 1969, President Costa e Silva suffered a debilitating episode of cerebral thrombosis. The president's condition was hidden from Vice-President Pedro Aleixo (who should have become acting president under the constitution), from the press and from the Brazilian people for a few days, as the upper echelons of the Armed Forces decided what to do about the crisis. On August 31, 1969, the three armed forces ministers seized executive power, with the approval of the rest of the military elite, and issued the Institutional Act number 12 (AI-12), to formalize the establishment of a Military Junta. The operative text of AI-12 was preceded by a proclamation to the Brazilian people. The three junta members announced that Costa e Silva was gravely ill, and that the High Command of the Armed Forces considered that the domestic situation (especially in view of the recess of the National Congress and other measures imposed by AI-5) was incompatible with the transfer of executive authority to a civilian. Accordingly, the leadership of the Government and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces should be discharged by the armed forces ministers themselves, jointly, until the recovery of the President. Accordingly, the AI-12 declared Costa e Silva under \\"temporary impediment\\" and established that, during that impediment, the three armed forces ministers would jointly discharge all the powers and duties of the presidency. Therefore, during the initial stage of the existence of the Military Junta, Costa e Silva legally remained President of the Republic, with the Junta discharging his powers and duties while he was incapacitated. This solution, however, was criticized even by civilian supporters of the regime, and the existence of a triumvirate was deemed potentially unstable. Also, the physicians attending the incapacitated President were of the opinion that he would never recover from the physical and mental consequences of the stroke and that accordingly he would never be able to resume the powers and duties of the office. It was also claimed that during intervals of lucidity, Costa e Silva had told military personnel and members of his family that he desired to be replaced president. The High Command of the Armed Forces also considered that a permanent replacement of Costa e Silva and Aleixo was in the interests of the regime. Those factors led the Military Junta to issue on October 14, 1969 the Institutional Act number 16 (AI-16). By that Act, Costa e Silva was formally removed from office. The vice presidency was declared vacant as well, thus removing Aleixo from the scene. The National Congress was called out of its two-year recess, and charged with the task of electing a new President and Vice-President. In reality, the role of the Legislature (which had been purged of several opposition members under the provisions of AI-5) was merely to rubber-stamp the names chosen by the military elites that controlled the regime. The military's party, the National Renewal Alliance (ARENA), had an overwhelming majority in both houses, meaning its candidate could not have possibly been defeated even if the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement had put forward a candidate. The elections were set to take place on October 25. AI-16 also established that the new President and Vice-President would be inaugurated on October 30, 1969, and that their term of office would last until March 1974. AI-16 further decreed that, until the election and inauguration of the new President and Vice-President, the Military Junta would remain in place discharging the fullness of the authority of the presidency. Accordingly, the Military Junta remained in existence until the inauguration of General Em√≠lio M√©dici as President of the Republic on October 30, 1969. There was no chairman of the junta, and all official acts of the Junta were jointly signed by its three members. While General Lyra Tavares, as representative of the Army, the most powerful branch of the Armed Forces in the operation of the regime, is believed to have been the main decisionmaker within the Junta, no formal precedence was assigned to its members, so as to preserve the principle of equality of the branches of the Military. In official documents of the Junta, its members were always mentioned in the order of antiquity of each branch of the Armed Forces. Thus, the representative of the Navy was always mentioned first, followed by that of the Army, and then by that of the Air Force, which led some to believe that Admiral Rademaker was first among equals in the workings of the Junta. The junta's most important achievement was a series of amendments to the 1967 Constitution which made it even more authoritarian than before. The Three Stooges During the redemocratization process, the then president of the National Constituent Assembly (1987-1988), Ulysses Guimar√£es, a staunch opponent of the military regime, famously referred to the Military Junta of 1969 as The Three Stooges.

It was first produced in 1983 by Nestl√©, under the Libby's brand, for consumption in the United Kingdom, and was later licensed for production in Portugal. The trademark is currently held by Sumol + Compal, who produces and sells the drink in both countries. History Um Bongo was first created in 1983, originally in Milnthorpe, Cumbria. It was originally sold under the Libby's brand, which at the time belonged to Nestl√© who had acquired Libby's fruit juices. Nestl√© licensed the Um Bongo brand (still under the Libby's name) to Gerber Foods Soft Drinks Ltd in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Gerber packages the drink at their plant in Somerset. In 1986, Libby's removed all artificial colouring, sweeteners and preservatives from Um Bongo, replacing them with natural colouring. Citric acid was also taken out and replaced with lemon juice. Since 2011, citric acid has again been in use. Nestl√© launched the Um Bongo brand in Portugal in 1988, running a Portuguese version of the TV advertisement, using the slogan Um Bongo, O bom sabor da selva (\\"Um Bongo, The great flavour of the jungle\\"). Portuguese company Compal acquired the \\"Um Bongo\\" brand from Nestl√© by 2003. Compal merged with Sumol in 2009. The company launched Um Bongo 100% Fruit in 2010 and a themed toy collection named Um Bongo e o bom cora√ß√£o da selva (\\"Um Bongo and the great heart of the jungle\\") in 2011. In the United Kingdom, Gerber Juice Company Limited continues to package the drink. In 2013, after UK Independence Party MEP Godfrey Bloom made remarks about \\"Bongo Bongo Land\\", the Um Bongo website received a surge in traffic, despite the company stating that they had no political affiliations. =UK formula change= In the late 1990s parents complained about the amount of sugar and artificial flavourings in many children's fruit drinks, which resulted in new regulations. The Um Bongo formula was changed around 2003 or 2004 to comply with the new rules. Most of the original ingredients were removed, with the drink being re-branded as \\"Um Bongo-100% juice\\", containing only bananas, orange and pineapple. In comparison, the original also contained apple, lemon, orange, pineapple, passion fruit, mandarin, apricot, guava and mango. New packaging for the product was also introduced by 2007, removing much reference to the Congo. =Return of UK Original Um Bongo= \\"Original\\" 2011 version From the time Libby's changed the formula, the company received many complaints. This resulted in their deciding to bring back the original Um Bongo formula in 2009. \\"Classic\\" Um Bongo was originally renamed \\"Um Bongo Tropical\\" and was also repackaged in new plastic 500ml bottles and placed in the chilled section of supermarkets/consumer shops. Libby's set up a website along with Facebook and YouTube accounts, to help gather additional support. In May 2011, an \\"Original\\" flavour was introduced, with a 200 ml √ó 3 carton available. The 100% Tropical juice version has since been discontinued and replaced with Original. An \\"Orange\\" flavour was released in 2012, and a 1-litre size was sold beginning in 2013. Advert Um Bongo is particularly famous for its long running jingle of \\"Um Bongo Um Bongo They Drink It in the Congo\\", used with the accompanying animated television advert since 1985. The song was sung by Tony Jackson. The music and lyrics were composed by Andy Blackford. The advert itself was created by Oscar Grillo at Klacto Animations. Their earlier 1984 Kia-Ora advert established a new trend and led to them being commissioned to produce the Um Bongo spot for Leo Burnett. Cartons From 1983 to 2003, Um Bongo in the UK was sold in either 250 ml (√ó3) or (√ó9) cartons or 1 little carton. With the formula change, it was sold in 200 ml (√ó5) cartons. Since 2010 it has been sold in 200 ml cartons either in (√ó3) at Asda, (√ó5) at Home Bargains, or a 1-litre carton from Tesco.Ocado: Search Results for um bongo Other versions Libby's have created two other types of fruit juice drinks since the 1980s. Libby's Moonshine, which lasted until 1992, contained more domestic fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, apples, blackberries and cherries. The animated adverts contained the slogan \\"Moonshine, looks pretty weird but it tastes just fine\\". In 1999, Um Bongo gained a sister drink called \\"Um Ognob\\", where \\"Bongo\\" was spelled backwards.

It features Soumitra Chatterjee, Madhabi Mukherjee and Sailen Mukherjee. The film is considered one of Ray‚Äôs highest achievements. Both the first and the last scenes are critically acclaimed. The first scene, with almost no dialogues shows Charu's loneliness and how she looks at the outside world through the binoculars. In the last scene when Charu and her husband are about to come closer and hold their hands the screen freezes. This has been described as beautiful use of Freeze shot in early cinema. Plot Charulata is based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, Nastanirh (The Broken Nest) and set in Calcutta in the late nineteenth century. Bengal Renaissance is at its peak and India is under British rule. The film revolves around Charulata / Charu (Madhabi Mukherjee) the intelligent and beautiful wife of Bhupati (Sailen Mukherjee). He edits and publishes a political newspaper. Bhupati is an upper class Bengali intellectual with a keen interest in politics and the freedom movement. Charu is interested in the arts, literature and poetry. Though Bhupati loves his wife, he has no time for her. She has little to do in the house run by a fleet of servants. Sensing her boredom, Bhupati invites Charu's elder brother Umapada and wife Manda to live with them. Umapada helps in running of the magazine and the printing press. Manda with her silly and crude ways is no company for the sensitive and intelligent Charulata. Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee), Bhupati's younger cousin comes on a visit. Bhupati asks him to encourage Charu's cultural interests. Amal is young, handsome and is of the same age group as Charu. He has literary ambitions and shares her interests in poetry. He provides her with much needed intellectual companionship and attention. An intimate and teasing friendship develops between Charulata and Amal. There is a hint of rivalry when she publishes a short story on her own without his knowledge, following his publishing of a poem that she had forbidden him from getting published. He realizes that Charulata is in love with him but is reluctant to reciprocate due to the guilt involved. Meanwhile, Charu's brother and sister-in-law who were guests in the house swindle Bhupati of his money and run away. It destroys Bhupati's newspaper and the press. The episode shatters Bhupati who admits his hurt to Amal. He tells Amal that now Amal is the only one he can trust. Amal is overcome with guilt of betraying his cousin. He is also uncomfortable with Charu's higher intellect that he has helped nurture. He leaves unannounced, to marry and go away to England for higher studies. He leaves behind a letter to Charu. Charu is heartbroken but hides her disappointment. Bhupati accidentally enters her room and finds her crying over Amal. Bhupati realizes Charu's feelings for Amal. He is broken, shocked and bewildered by it. He rushes out of the house, wanders aimlessly in his carriage. On his return, Charu and Bhupati make a hesitant gesture to reach out, but their extended hands remain frozen in a tentative gesture.

Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye. Los Angeles: University of California Press. 1989. . pp. 159. Ray later said that he liked the novella because \\"it has a western quality to it and the film obviously shares that quality. That's why I can speak of Mozart in connection with Charulata quite validly.\\"Robinson. pp. 160. Ray decided to set the film in the 1880s instead of in 1901 and spent many months researching the historical background. For the first time in his career he worked without a deadline both during pre-production and during the shooting.Robinson. pp. 161. Ray worked closely with art director Bansi Chandragupta and no interior scene was shot on location. All sets were either built or remodeled to accurately portray India in the 1880s. Ray cast Indian actress Madhabi Mukherjee in the role of Charulata, but had difficulty with her owing to her addiction to chewing paan, which stained her teeth black. Because of this Ray had to be careful about what camera angles he used to film her.Robinson. pp. 162. Ray once called Charulata his favourite of his own films.Robinson. pp. 157. Reception Charulata holds one of the highest ratings for an Indian film in Rotten Tomatoes, a 96% 'fresh' rating based on 26 reviews with an average rating of 9.2/10. It also holds an 8.3/10 rating on IMDb. It has been widely regarded as one of the finest films made in Indian cinema history, and has won wide critical acclaim overseas as well. In Sight and Sound, Penelope Houston praised the film, stating that \\"the interplay of sophistication and simplicity is extraordinary\\".Robinson. pp. 156. A review in The New York Times said that the film \\"moved like a majestic snail, as do all Ray films\\". In 1965, The Times of London remarked upon the film's depiction of values that seemed influenced by the English, stating that \\"this stratum of Indian life was more English than England\\". Much to Ray's dismay, the film was rejected at Cannes, a move which was protested by the likes of David Lean and Ingmar Bergman. The film is, supposedly, also an all-time favourite of Jean-Luc Godard. It was shown as part of the Cannes Classics section of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival,. It was awarded Best Director by the Berlin Film Festival. On the occasion of birth centenary of Ray, senior journalist B.M.Hanif of Prajavani newspaper had reported on 21 May 2020 that speculations were rife at the time of release that the story was based on the life of Rabindranath Tagore , his brother Jyotirindranath Tagore (who was 12 years elder to him) and his sister in law Kadambari Devi (who was 2 years elder to him) considering the fact that the story takes place in 1879-80 when Rabindranath was 19 years old and that Kadambari Devi committed suicide four months after Rabindranath was married at the age of 23 in 1883 to the 9 or 11 year old Mrinalini Devi.http://epaper.prajavani.net Preservation The Academy Film Archive preserved Charulata in 1996.

Tribute Reversal of the gaze, Charulata (Madhabi Mukherjee), sitting on her swing and looking at Amal The film contains a famous scene in which Charu (Madhabi Mukherjee) sings Rabindranath Tagore's song \\"Fule Fule Dhole Dhole\\" on a swing, while looking at Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee). The scene is referenced in the Bollywood film Parineeta during the song sequence, Soona Man Ka Aangan. Indeed, Parineeta 's Lalita (Vidya Balan) is dressed to resemble Nastanirh/Charulata 's Charu. Furthermore, Parineeta is based upon the novel Parineeta by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay who was a noted contemporary of Tagore (and who also wrote novels concerned with social reform).

Harrison and Maria Wilkinson, Harrison was educated in Holmfield, and was the manager of Harrison Milling and Grain Co. before entering politics. He was also a member of the Killarney Lodge. In 1937, he married Amelia Sutherland. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election on July 22, 1943, in the constituency of Killarney. The Liberal-Progressives and Conservatives governed Manitoba in a grand coalition during this period, and Harrison served as a backbench supporter of Stuart Garson's ministry. Notwithstanding the coalition, some Liberal-Progressives ran against Progressive Conservative incumbents in the 1945 provincial election. Harrison narrowly fended off a challenge from LP candidate G.M. Harrison, winning by only 150 votes on the second count of a preferential ballot. He was re-elected again in the 1949 election, easily defeating an anti-coalition maverick from the Liberal-Progressives. The Progressive Conservatives left the coalition government in 1950. Harrison moved to the opposition benches, and was re- elected in the 1953 election. He appears to have supported Errick Willis against a leadership challenge from Dufferin Roblin in 1954. The Progressive Conservative Party formed a minority government under Dufferin Roblin following the 1958 election. Harrison defeated Liberal-Progressive candidate Walter E. Clark by 238 votes in the redistributed constituency of Rock Lake, and was appointed by Roblin as Speaker of the Manitoba legislature on October 23, 1958. The opposition Liberals opposed Harrison's appointment, on the grounds that Roblin should have consulted with opposition leaders before making his selection. He was nonetheless confirmed, and was regarded as a good if unspectacular office-holder. Harrison defeated Clark a second time in the 1959 election, and was retained in the Speaker's chair. Harrison defeated Liberal candidate Harry Parsonage by 429 votes in the 1962 election. He was replaced as Speaker on February 27, 1963, and formally entered Roblin's government as a minister without portfolio. He retained this position until May 15, 1966, and did not contest the 1966 election. He died at home in Holmfield at the age of 81. Family His grandson, Scott Newman, was the Liberal Party candidate for Radisson at the 2016 Manitoba provincial elections.

He received his PhD from the University of Basel in Switzerland. In 1958 he worked as a financial analyst for the European Coal and Steel Community. Between 1959 and 1961, he worked as an economist at the SRI International in Menlo Park, California. Banking career Erdman returned to Switzerland where, in 1965, he founded and was the president of the Salik Bank. In 1969, First Interstate Bancorp bought a majority stake and renamed it the United California Bank in Basel. The bank collapsed after taking large losses speculating in the cocoa market. Erdman and other board members were accused of fraud and mismanagement. Erdman spent 10 months in solitary confinement without being charged before being released on a $133,000 bail bond in 1971. Erdman skipped out on the bail and flew to England, later returning to the United States. Several officers of the bank were convicted and served prison terms.

Although a general practice law firm includes a variety of unrelated practice areas within a single firm, a boutique firm specializes in one or a select few practice areas. There may be some confusion as legal publications may refer to any small- or mid-sized firm as a boutique, though generally firms with fewer than 100 attorneys would count. Boutique should apply to those firms that focus on particular areas, regardless of size, though they are typically smaller, with exception to a few firms such as Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner or Fish & Richardson with over 400 attorneys.Fish & Richardson P.C., http://www.fr.com/about/index.cfm?child=about History =United States= In the 1980s, American mid-size law firms began losing ground due to consolidation in the legal market.Tamar Lewin, Business and the Law: Smaller Firms are Vanishing, The New York Times, March 9, 1987.

In his position he was credited with developing Russia's foreign policy immediately after the fall of the Soviet Union, although many in Russia have criticized him for being weak and not assertive enough in defending Russian interests in the face of the United States and NATO in places like Bosnia and Iraq. For this he took a lot of criticism from the nationalist politicians and parties. Kozyrev had graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) with a Ph.D. in history before joining the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1974, holding various positions in it before being appointed foreign minister. Early life and education Kozyrev was born in Brussels in 1951, the son of a Soviet engineer temporarily working there. He was educated at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, a school for diplomats operated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Before beginning his studies there in 1969, he spent a year as a fitter in the Kommunar machine-building factory in Moscow.Gale Encyclopedia of Biography: http://www.answers.com/topic/andrei-vladimirovich- kozyrev-1 He completed his studies in 1974. He then entered the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a speech writer and researcher in the Department of International Organizations, which was responsible for issues concerning the United Nations and arms control, including biological and chemical warfare issues. Over the next three years, he earned a post-graduate degree in historical science and published several books on the arms trade and the UN.Gale Encyclopedia of Biography: http://www.answers.com/topic/andrei- vladimirovich-kozyrev-1 Kozyrev's career in the Foreign Ministry marked him as a promising young Soviet diplomat. He became an attach√© in the Department of International Organizations in 1979 and third secretary the next year. Promotions came regularly: he became second secretary in 1982; first secretary in 1984; counselor in 1986. Following the reorganization of the ministry by Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, he became deputy chief of the renamed Administration of International Organizations in 1988. The next year Kozyrev became chief of the administration, replacing a man 20 years his senior.Gale Encyclopedia of Biography: http://www.answers.com/topic/andrei- vladimirovich-kozyrev-1 Career as a minister Seizing the opportunity opened by Gorbachev's glasnost in summer 1989, Kozyrev wrote an article repudiating the Leninist concept of the \\"international class struggle,\\" the very essence of Leninism.Arnold Beichman, The Long Pretense: Soviet Treaty Diplomacy from Lenin to Gorbachev; Firstly published in the Soviet press, the article was reproduced in the Washington Post and other major news sources all over the world,The Washington Post: \\"From Moscow: Why Soviet Foreign Policy Went Awry\\", 9 January 1989, Page 10; making him known as a political figure. In October 1990, a rebellious parliament of the Russian Federation voted to appoint Kozyrev the foreign minister. After the failed Soviet coup attempt of 1991, he found himself in Yeltsin's team of young reformers, which included Yegor Gaidar and Anatoly Chubais, and shared their Western liberal-democratic ideals. He became Russian foreign minister at the age of 39 and gained and kept the confidence of Boris Yeltsin as Russia became an independent state and, in many ways, the successor to the Soviet Union. Kozyrev tried to make Russia a partner with the West in the formation of the post-Cold War world.Peter Rutland and Gregory Dubinsky U.S. ‚Äì RUSSIAN RELATIONS: HOPES AND FEARS; http://prutland.web.wesleyan.edu/Documents/US-Russian%20relations.pdf He emphasized cooperation over conflict with the United States while insisting that Russia be treated as a great power in international politics rather than as a fallen superpower.

In December 1992, Kozyrev underlined his opposition to conservative, nationalistic forces in Russia with a dramatic and unprecedented diplomatic maneuver. He stunned the foreign ministers of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) with a speech that echoed many of the positions of the conservative opposition in Russia and seemed to threaten a return to anti-Western policies. The speech surprised even the Russian delegation. But an hour after giving the speech he retracted it, announcing that the speech was intended to draw attention to the dangers that would come if the opposition took power from President Yeltsin.The Los Angeles Times, Just Kidding, Russian Says After Cold War Blast Stuns Europeans, December 15, 1992; http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-15/news/mn-2214_1_foreign-ministers At the UN General Assembly Kozyrev declared in 1993, by the time of the end of the Abkhazian War: \\"Russia realizes that no international organization or group of states can replace our peacekeeping efforts in this specific post-Soviet space.\\"In Russia's Shadow, Time, October 11, 1993 In the December 1993 elections, Kozyrev ran for a seat in the lower house, the State Duma, as a candidate on the list of the liberal Russia's Choice bloc and as a candidate in the Murmansk region.

He was succeeded by Yevgeny Primakov. After being elected a second time to the State Duma in Murmansk in January 1996, Kozyrev left the ministry as from now on it was prohibited to occupy both positions.

Typically, it is mapped to a mount point named /proc at boot time. The proc file system acts as an interface to internal data structures in the kernel. It can be used to obtain information about the system and to change certain kernel parameters at runtime (sysctl). Many Unix-like operating systems support the proc filesystem, including Solaris, IRIX, Tru64 UNIX, BSD, Linux, IBM AIX, QNX, and Plan 9 from Bell Labs. OpenBSD dropped support in version 5.7, released in May 2015. The Linux kernel extends it to non‚Äìprocess-related data. The proc filesystem provides a method of communication between kernel space and user space. For example, the GNU version of the process reporting utility ps uses the proc file system to obtain its data, without using any specialized system calls.  History  = UNIX 8th Edition = Tom J. Killian implemented the UNIX 8th Edition (V8) version of /proc: he presented a paper titled \\"Processes as Files\\" at USENIX in June 1984. The design of procfs aimed to replace the ptrace system call used for process tracing. Detailed documentation can be found in the proc(4) manual page. = SVR4 = Roger Faulkner and Ron Gomes ported V8 /proc to SVR4, and published a paper called \\"The Process File System and Process Model in UNIX System V\\" at USENIX in January 1991. This kind of procfs supported the creation of ps, but the files could only be accessed with functions read(), write(), and ioctl(). Between 1995 and 1996, Roger Faulkner created the procfs-2 interface for Solaris-2.6 that offers a structured /proc filesystem with sub-directories. = Plan 9 = Plan 9 implemented a process file system, but went further than V8. V8's process file system implemented a single file per process. Plan 9 created a hierarchy of separate files to provide those functions, and made /proc a real part of the file system. = 4.4BSD = 4.4BSD cloned its implementation of from Plan 9\\\\. , procfs is gradually becoming phased out in FreeBSD. It was removed from OpenBSD in version 5.7, which was released in May 2015, because it \\"always suffered from race conditions and is now unused\\". = Solaris = /proc in Solaris was available from the beginning.

It occurs as a side-effect of kernel timer calibration and yields highly varying values depending on CPU type, even at equal clock speeds. On multi-core CPUs, /proc/cpuinfo contains the fields for \\"siblings\\" and \\"cpu cores\\" which represent the following calculation is applied: \\"siblings\\" = (HT per CPU package) * (# of cores per CPU package) \\"cpu cores\\" = (# of cores per CPU package) A CPU package means physical CPU which can have multiple cores (single core for one, dual core for two, quad core for four). This allows a distinction between hyper-threading and dual-core, i.e. the number of hyper-threads per CPU package can be calculated by siblings / CPU cores. If both values for a CPU package are the same, then hyper-threading is not supported. For instance, a CPU package with siblings=2 and \\"cpu cores\\"=2 is a dual-core CPU but does not support hyper-threading. * , a list of available cryptographic modules * , a list of character and block devices sorted by device ID but giving the major part of the name too * , giving some information (including device numbers) for each of the logical disk devices * , a list of the file systems supported by the kernel at the time of listing * , , and the directory , giving some self-explanatory details about the devices (physical or logical) using the various system resources * , holding messages output by the kernel * , containing a summary of how the kernel is managing its memory. * , one of the most important files in , containing a list of the kernel modules currently loaded .

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1959 to 1966, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Dufferin Roblin. The son of George Harrison Hutton and Anna Marie Isaacson, Hutton was educated at United College in Winnipeg, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree. He worked as a farmer before entering politics, and was president of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Association in 1958. In 1949, he married Elizabeth Sarah Briercliffe. He ran for the Progressive Conservatives in the constituency of Rockwood‚ÄîIberville in the 1958 provincial election, but lost to Liberal-Progressive incumbent Robert Bend by more than 700 votes. Hutton defeated Bend by 126 votes in the 1959 election, and was appointed to Roblin's cabinet as Minister of Agriculture and Conservation on August 7, 1959. He held his position until his resignation on June 30, 1966. Hutton was responsible for supervising floodway construction around the city of Winnipeg, and for introducing crop insurance to Manitoba. He was re-elected by a significant margin in the 1962 election, but did not run in 1966. Considered by many as Dufferin Roblin's heir apparent, Hutton left the government for personal reasons and took a United Nations assignment. He worked with the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization in Turkey and India before moving to Rome in 1973. He died there three years later.

Broadly, patent prosecution can be split into pre- grant prosecution, which involves arguing before, and sometimes negotiation with, a patent office for the grant of a patent, and post-grant prosecution, which involves issues such as post-grant amendment and opposition. Patent prosecution is distinct from patent litigation, which describes legal action relating to the infringement of patents. The rules and laws governing patent prosecution are often laid out in manuals released by the Patent Offices of various governments, such as the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) in the United States, or the Manual of Patent Office Practice (MOPOP) in Canada. Pre-grant prosecution =Preparation of an application= To obtain patent rights for an inventor, the practitioner typically first drafts an application by interviewing the inventor to understand the nature of the invention and help clarify its novel features. Practitioners need to ascertain what is already known to people familiar with the general field of the invention--such already-known material is termed the prior art, and to obtain drawings and written notes regarding the features of the invention and the background. During this initial phase, sometimes termed \\"patent preparation\\", the practitioner may also seek to determine precisely who contributed to the making of the invention. An incorrect listing of inventors may incurably invalidate any patent that might result from an application. This determination is particularly important in the United States, but may be considered less important in other jurisdictions. The practitioner may also seek to find out whether any publications, offers for sale, or other such public disclosures of the invention were made. Under the laws or regulations of some jurisdictions, public disclosures or offers to sell an invention prior to filing an application for a patent may prevent the issuance of the patent. In the U.S. these laws are laid out in Title 35 of the United States Code, ¬ß102. After drafting an application for patent, complying with any further rules (such as having the inventor or inventors review the application prior to filing), and obtaining the applicant's permission, the practitioner files the patent application with the patent office. Usually, the practitioner seeks to file the application as soon as possible, because in a majority of jurisdictions including Europe and Japan, if two or more applications on the same subject matter are filed, only the party who filed first will be entitled to a patent under the \\"first-to-file rule\\". Until the enactment of the America Invents Act, the United States followed a first-to-invent rule, under which early filing may prevent the use of certain materials from being applied against the patent application as prior art while the patent application is pending before the patent office. However, three consecutive congressional sessions in the United States from 2005-2009 have attempted to change the United States to the first-to-file rule with the Patent Reform Act of 2005, the Patent Reform Act of 2007, and the Patent Reform Act of 2009. Finally, on September 16, 2011, the United States shifted to the first-to-file rule with the enactment of the America Invents Act. =Filing an application= Most patent applications have at least two components, including a general, written description of the invention and at least one \\"embodiment\\" thereof, and a set of \\"claims,\\" written in a special style that defines exactly what the applicant regards as the particular features of his or her invention. These claims are used to distinguish the invention from the existing prior art, and are compared by the patent office to the prior art before issuing a patent. Patent applications in most jurisdictions also usually include (and may be required to include) a drawing or set of drawings, to facilitate the understanding of the invention. In some jurisdictions, patent models may also be submitted to demonstrate the operation of the invention. In applications involving genetics, samples of genetic material or DNA sequences may be required. =Search and examination= The search and examination phases constitute the main part of the prosecution of a patent application leading to grant or refusal. A search is conducted by the patent office for any prior art that is relevant to the application in question and the results of that search are notified to the applicant in a search report. Generally the examiner conducting the search indicates in what aspect the documents cited are relevant (novelty, inventive step, background) and to what claims they are relevant. The materials searched vary depending on the patent office conducting the search, but principally cover all published patent applications and technical publications. The patent office can provide a preliminary, non- binding, opinion on patentability, to indicate to the applicant its views on the patentability and let the applicant decide how to proceed at an early stage. The search report is typically published with the patent application, 18 months after the earliest priority date, or if it is not available at that time it is published once it is available. The examination of patent applications may either be conducted at the same time as the search (as in the US, where a search report is not issued), or at a later date after the Applicant has requested examination (as, for example, under the EPC). Examination is the process by which a patent office determines whether a patent application meets the requirements for granting a patent. The process involves considering whether the invention is novel and inventive, whether the invention is in an excluded area and whether the application complies with the various formalities of the relevant patent law. If the examiner finds that the application does not comply with requirements, an examination report (Office action in the US) is issued drawing the examiner's objections to the attention of the applicant and requesting that they be addressed. The applicant may respond to the objections by arguing in support of the application, or making amendments to the application to bring it in conformity. Alternatively, if the examiner's objections are valid and cannot be overcome, the application may be abandoned. The process of objection and response is repeated until the patent is in a form suitable for grant, the Applicant abandons the applications, or a hearing is arranged to resolve the matter. The rate at which patent applications are allowed can vary significantly from one technology to another. US patent applications in the field of electrical connectors, for example, get one allowance for every two rejections. Business method patent applications, however, only get one allowance for every 20 rejections.Nowotarski, Mark, ‚ÄúReducing Patent Backlog and Prosecution Costs Using PAIR Data‚Äù, IP watchdog blog, August 16, 2010 In some jurisdictions, substantive examination of patent applications is not routinely carried out. Instead, the validity of invention registrations is dealt with during any infringement action. The search and examination process is principally conducted between the patent office and the applicant. However, in some jurisdictions, it is possible for interested third parties to file opinions on the patentability of an application. Such opinions may take the form of a formal pre-grant opposition inter partes procedure or it may simply be an opportunity of filing observations as a third party. Reform legislation is set to create an opposition system in the United States. An applicant is free to abandon an application during the search and examination process. An application may be abandoned if, for example, prior art is revealed which will prevent the grant of a patent and the applicant decides to save cost by terminating the application. An application may be deemed abandoned by the patent office if the applicant fails to meet any of the requirements of the application process, for example replying to an examination report. =Deferred examination= In some jurisdictions (such as Japan and South Korea), after filing an application, examination is optional, and only on request, rather than automatic. For example, in Japan, an application is published at 18 months after the priority date, but otherwise the application lies fallow until the applicant demands examination, up to seven years after filing. This gives the applicant time to evaluate which applications are worth spending money on, and which should simply be abandoned. Only a portion of the total number of filed applications is selected for examination by the applicants. =Invention registration= Some jurisdictions including Bermuda, South Africa, China (in the case of Utility Models), Germany (in the case of Gebrauchsmusters (Utility Model)) and by option Spain, go one step further, in that an application is passed to issue and publication as an enforceable patent in short order, with no substantive examination. Questions of novelty and non-obviousness/inventive step are not reviewed until litigation may arise concerning the issues. Obviously, such a patent does not carry the same presumption of validity as a patent that has been fully examined. Such systems are known as \\"invention registration\\" regimes, and have the benefit of reduced costs, because applicants may postpone or completely forego the expensive process of examination for inventions that are of small or speculative value in the applicant's field of endeavor. Another advantage is that a patent is granted relatively fast. A patent in South Africa, for example, is granted approximately 8 months after the date of filing, whereas in examining countries, it is highly unusual for a patent to be granted in less than 3 years. At the same time, simply filing an application usually preserves the applicant's right to subsequently seek full examination and protection for his invention, if a competitor or a pirate is later discovered to infringe the invention. =Appeals= However, if the examiner and the applicant cannot reach agreement regarding the patentability of the application, the applicant may file an appeal to either the patent office or a court of law, asserting that his patent application was wrongly rejected. For such an appeal to be successful, the applicant must prove that the patent office was incorrect in applying the law, interpreting the claims on the patent application, or interpreting and applying of the prior art vis-√†-vis the patent application. If the appeal is successful, the patent office or court may order that a patent be issued based on the application, or that the patent office correct its examination of the application if the patent office is found to have been incorrect. Otherwise, if the applicant is not found convincing, the rejection of the patent application may be upheld. In the United States, appeals are fairly rare. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences adjudicates only about 1 - 2% of all issued patents. For controversial areas such as business method patents, however, the appeals rate is much higher. About 10% of the business method patents issued in 2006 were appealed. In some areas, such as insurance patents, the rate is as high as 30%.Source: Insurance IP Bulletin December 15, 2005 =Abandonment= Generally, an applicant is free to abandon his or her patent application at any time, and in many jurisdictions may \\"disclaim\\" his or her patent even after the patent is issued. Such abandonment may occur during the prosecution process, such as when the applicant is unable to convince the patent office to withdraw a rejection of his or her patent application. Further, abandonment is often held to have occurred if the applicant fails to respond within a certain time period to an office action issued by the patent office, or if the applicant specifically expresses his or her intention to abandon the application. The rate at which patent applications are abandoned can vary significantly from one technology to another. In the US, patent applications in the field of electrical connectors, for example, are abandoned at a low rate of only one abandonment for every 18 office actions (e.g. rejections). Business method patent applications, however, are abandoned at a much higher rate of one abandonment for every 5 office actions.Nowotarski, Mark, ‚ÄúBreakthroughs & Abandonment: Patent Abandon Rate is a Reliable Measure of Speculative Portfolios‚Äù, IP watchdog blog, September 27, 2010 Following abandonment, in most jurisdictions, an applicant is usually barred from later seeking patent protection for the same subject matter which was earlier abandoned by the applicant. Post-grant prosecution =Opposition= Opposition is a process provided by some patent law systems in which a third party can oppose the grant of a patent in an attempt to prevent (or revoke) the grant of a patent. In the European Patent Office, for example, any person may file opposition to the grant of a European patent within nine months from grant. In Israel, a third party may oppose an allowed application for three months after publication of the allowed application. =Reissue, reexamination and interference= In some jurisdictions, once a patent is issued, the patent holder may request a \\"reissue\\" of the patent to correct mistakes in the issued patent. Such \\"reissue applications\\" must typically be filed within a particular period of time following issuance of the original patent. In some jurisdictions, such as the United States, the patent holder may even seek to broaden the scope of the invention defined in the claims by filing a reissue application, although a broadening reissue in the USA must be filed within 2 years from grant. Also, in the United States, only the patent holder may file for reissue. The case of In Re TanakaIn Re Tanaka Court Decision established the principle that a patentee can add narrow dependent claims to an issued patent through the reissue process, because a patent with narrower dependent claims is less subject to invalidation when litigated. More usually, however, the patentee must identify errors in the original claims, thereby surrendering some claim scope in return.Justin Huddleson, \\"Narrowing Patent Claims in Reissue: Hedging Your Bets Against Invalidity Is Not An Acceptable Objective\\" , Sunstein IP Update (January, 2010) In the United States, \\"reexamination\\" refers to the process of requesting that the patent office once again subject an issued patent to further examination, accompanied by patents or printed publications showing that there is a substantial new question of patentability (\\"SNQ\\"), and/or an explanation of the relevance of the prior art to the claimed invention. Unlike other invalidity considerations, only patents and printed publications will be considered in re-examination; see 37 CFR 1.552.http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2258.html Unlike reissue, reexamination may be requested not only by the patent holder or inventor, but by anyone, including anonymously, although whoever requests reexamination must also submit a fee, which is substantially higher than filing a new patent application. A benefit of reexamination is that issued patents may be either invalidated or once again deemed valid, without the considerable cost and lengthy time required for a full infringement lawsuit or declaratory judgment action. Also, in the United States, prior to the America Invents Act going into force in 2012, if two patent applications are filed which set forth claims directed to the same subject matter, the patent office could declare an \\"interference\\" and require that each of the parties appear before the patent office to determine who was the earliest to discover the claimed invention. This \\"interference practice\\" is not followed in most other jurisdictions, because it is obviated by the \\"first-to-file\\" system used in most countries. During an interference, parties may submit evidence supporting their contention to be the earliest inventor, and the patent office issues a decision following the trial-like interference process. Interference practice does not apply to patents filed after September 12, 2012, because the U.S. moved to a first-to-disclose system which is in many ways similar to first-to- file. Patent agents and attorneys In some jurisdictions only authorized practitioners can act before the patent office, although applicants (e.g., inventors) can generally represent themselves. This is known as pro se representation. It is usually recommended that an applicant not represent him- or herself pro se. In the United States, for example, a patent examiner will issue the following form paragraph if it is apparent that an applicant is not familiar with patent office policies and procedures:MPEP 401 U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Cannot Aid in Selection of Attorney [R-5] \\\\- 400 Representative of Inventor or Owner ¬∂ 4.10 Employ Services of Attorney or Agent :An examination of this application reveals that applicant is unfamiliar with patent prosecution procedure. While an inventor may prosecute the application, lack of skill in this field usually acts as a liability in affording the maximum protection for the invention disclosed. Applicant is advised to secure the services of a registered patent attorney or agent to prosecute the application, since the value of a patent is largely dependent upon skilled preparation and prosecution. The Office cannot aid in selecting an attorney or agent. :A listing of registered patent attorneys and agents is available on the USPTO Internet web site http://www.uspto.gov in the Site Index under \\"Attorney and Agent Roster\\". Applicants may also obtain a list of registered patent attorneys and agents located in their area by writing to the Mail Stop OED, Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, VA 22313-1450.

Anderson (born November 4, 1968), is an American writer of children's books that range from picture books to young adult novels. He won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature in 2006 for The Pox Party, the first of two \\"Octavian Nothing\\" books, which are historical novels set in Revolution-era Boston. Anderson is known for using wit and sarcasm in his stories, as well as advocating that young adults are capable of mature comprehension. Biography Anderson was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father Will Anderson was an engineer, and his mother Juliana Anderson was an Episcopal priest. He attended St. Mark's School, Harvard College, the University of Cambridge (England), and Syracuse University. Anderson worked at Candlewick Press before his first novel Thirsty (1997) was accepted for publication there. \\"Profile: Author M.T. Anderson Challenges Young Adults With Complex Narratives\\", The Washington Post, November 29, 2008. He has also worked as a disc jockey for WCUW radio; as an instructor at Vermont College of Fine Arts, where he now serves on the Board; and as a music critic for The Improper Bostonian. He currently lives in Cambridge (Mass.) and is on the Board of the National Children's Book and Literacy Alliance, a national non-profit organization that advocates for literacy, literature, and libraries. The NCBLA Board: M. T. Anderson =Writing style= Anderson is known for challenging his readers, of varying ages, to look at the world in new ways. Anderson has also remarked \\"We write because we can't decipher things the first time around.\\" His novels directed at young adults, such as Thirsty and Feed, tend to direct their satire at society. He's also written children's picture books such as Handel, Who Knew What He Liked, and novels directed toward pre-teen readers such as The Game of Sunken Places. Anderson tends to write with sophisticated wit and storylines, making the point that young people are more intelligent than some might think. In response to the question of why he gives so much credit to his young audience, Anderson stated in an interview with Julie Prince: \\"Our survival as a nation rests upon the willingness of the young to become excited and engaged by new ideas we never considered as adults.\\" While he was writing Feed, Anderson took in younger, pop-culture oriented media, such as Seventeen, Maxim, and Teen Vogue. He used these media sources to convey an accurate teenage voice, but even more depleted and abbreviated. He's used this method many times, including reading 18th century novels during his writing of The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing. A shy person, Anderson has stated that he greatly prefers writing to public speaking. As a writer he does not shy from taking on difficult questions and deeper, more mature concepts and themes. Unlike many other young-adult writers, Anderson views the characters he creates simply as figures moving and acting on his terms. The only exception to this view of his characters has been his main character in The Astonishing Life, Octavian Nothing. Anderson faces unique challenges in writing for the young adult market, especially concerning the topics he chooses. He has heavily researched the time periods of his novels in order to accurately portray his characters. Similarly to Feed, Anderson had to put himself in the shoes of a young person from a different time period when he wrote The Astonishing Life. However, this novel challenged him to explore the dialect of a time period that had already happened, rather than a time period that has yet to come. Anderson pointed out that he actually tends to dislike his books after he's finished with them, a declaration that has been seen as modest; he feels distanced from the work and is usually eager to move on to another project. This is his reasoning behind writing in so many different genres. Anderson has also indicated that he hopes to not only continue writing for young adults and children, but also to write for an adult audience in the future. Feed Feed is a young-adult novel focusing on the lives of teenagers in a future America. Within this dystopian society, young people are implanted with \\"the feed\\", a computer chip that connects them to a global network of advertisements, images, audio messages, and text-based communication. The government uses the feed to profile everyone to show what their interests and dislikes are. Anyone who tries to 'beat' the feed can be denied later when they try to get information or help from the sources. The novel's themes are corporate power and consumerism. Feed has also been regarded as a literary source for young adults to not only expand their knowledge of citizenship outside of the everyday youth status, but also increase their capacity for social change. The novel also focuses on the dependent nature of the characters; everyone is so dependent on the feed's transmissions that everything else in society decays. Feed received praise for Anderson's imaginative wit. The unique use of \\"futuristic\\" language is noted as one of the novel's strong points. Feed won the Los Angeles Times Book Award and has been a finalist for both the National Book Award and the Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award. Feed was also named one of the ALA Best Books for Young Adults. The audio book version of Feed, narrated by David Aaron Baker, was an AudioFile Magazine Earphones Award Winner, and was also a finalist in Achievement in Production for the Audio Publishers Association 2004 Audie Awards¬Æ. =Feed in schools= Feed has been taught as a dystopian novel for young adults, exaggerating our modern society in an attempt to challenge it. The novel has been used as tool to show teenagers, who are generally familiar and even accepting of advertising, what the dangers of consumerism are without alarming them. Even the educational system in the novel has been compromised by corporations, which directly causes students to question the relation between consumerism and education. The novel not only addresses mindless consumerism, but powerful industry and marketing. Feed also tackles the importance of language, and the negative effect that occurs to the depletion of the English language. The general goal in teaching Feed is to show students what it means to be moral consumers. Thirsty Thirsty is the story of Chris, a teenage boy who is growing up to become a vampire while the people of his town (Boston) dedicate their time to fighting such dreaded creatures. His transformation is told through the similarities of growing up and going through adolescence. The plot is said to be startling, suspenseful and creepy, but also contains a captivating plot filled with humor. Thirsty was Anderson's first published novel and his debut in young adult literature. The novel has been held in high regard for being a particularly impressive first novel, having caused Anderson to be quickly noted as an author worth watching. The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing Taking readers back to the birth of the United States, The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing, Traitor to the Nation features the son of an African princess, raised in unique circumstances, having been brought to the American colonies. Octavian becomes part of a college study, attempting to gauge the intelligence and overall potential of African Americans. Octavian's mother dies from a college-mandated smallpox inoculation, and Octavian is forced to see the world for what it is. The Pox Party, part one, is told in Octavian's voice while The Kingdom on the Waves is told in a sequence of letters. The novel is praised for its creativity and chaotic storyline. Teenagers are able to understand and relate to the story without having to know all the historical details in the novel. This novel has also attained its prestigious reputation based on the effort Anderson dedicated to researching the historical aspects of the book. Anderson tried to make the language as accurate to the time period, the 18th century, as possible. Burger Wuss Burger Wuss is another young adult novel. The story focuses on the teenage narrator, Anthony. Anthony gets a job at a local burger joint in order to exact revenge upon another employee at the restaurant: Turner, the boy who stole Anthony's girlfriend. This novel is praised for its use of black humor, satirical tone, and overall witty sarcasm, similar to many of Anderson's other works. Burger Wuss stood out in the eyes of critics for its ability to show the darker aspects of day-to-day life. Children's books Anderson has also written picture books and books for pre-teens. His picture books include Handel, Who Knew What He Liked, and Strange Mr. Satie. Anderson utilized his knowledge and taste for music in Handel, Who Knew What He Liked, a story of the German-English composer, George Frideric Handel. Anderson's story has been praised for its simplicity and easy-to-read sentences. Strange Mr. Satie is the story of the less known Erik Satie, who influenced modern music. His choice to focus on Satie is noted as an \\"offbeat\\" choice, but the book also held in high regard for its unique style, and text that reflects Satie's own musical style. For pre-teens Anderson has written a whimsical chapter book, The Game of Sunken Places. The story involves two young boys, Gregory and Brian, who discover a game board in the woods and are pulled into an alternate reality in order to play the game. The boys have to overcome various fantasy-based obstacles including trolls, and monsters, while making their way through the rules and dimensions of the game. The book is said to contain climactic surprises, and is praised for its humor, creativity, and adventurous nature.

Although all students registered at Trinity College are considered students of St Hilda's College, it is not an independent body and today serves only an administrative function. St Hilda's College was named after St Hilda of Whitby. History The University of Trinity College admitted its first female student in 1884. In 1888, it was decided that a distinct college was required for Trinity's women students. St Hilda's College was initially opened in a building on Euclid Avenue, Toronto, with two resident students. The college was moved to a building on Shaw Street in 1889, then to a set of two larger houses on the same street in 1892, and in 1903 to a larger, purpose- built building on the main Trinity College grounds. In 1925, when Trinity College moved from its original location on Queen Street to the main University of Toronto campus, St Hilda's College was moved to 99 St. George Street. The final move took place in 1938, when the current St Hilda's building on Devonshire Place was opened. The former College building at Trinity Bellwoods Park (opened in 1899) is now John Gibson House, a seniors residence. In 2005, the administration of Trinity College elected to end the practice of same-sex residency; as a result, St Hilda's College now houses both men and women.

MT is the branch of mathematical logic which deals with the relation between a formal language (syntax) and its interpretations (semantics). FMT is a restriction of MT to interpretations on finite structures, which have a finite universe. * Since many central theorems of MT do not hold when restricted to finite structures, FMT is quite different from MT in its methods of proof. Central results of classical model theory that fail for finite structures under FMT include the compactness theorem, G√∂del's completeness theorem, and the method of ultraproducts for first-order logic (FO). * As MT is closely related to mathematical algebra, FMT became an \\"unusually effective\\" instrument in computer science. In other words: \\"In the history of mathematical logic most interest has concentrated on infinite structures....Yet, the objects computers have and hold are always finite. To study computation we need a theory of finite structures.\\" Thus the main application areas of FMT are: descriptive complexity theory, database theory and formal language theory. * FMT is mainly about discrimination of structures. The usual motivating question is whether a given class of structures can be described (up to isomorphism) in a given language. For instance, can all cyclic graphs be discriminated (from the non- cyclic ones) by a sentence of the first-order logic of graphs? This can also be phrased as: is the property \\"cyclic\\" FO expressible? Basic challenges A single finite structure can always be axiomatized in first-order logic, where axiomatized in a language L means described uniquely up to isomorphism by a single L-sentence. Similarly, any finite collection of finite structures can always be axiomatized in first-order logic. Some, but not all, infinite collections of finite structures can also be axiomatized by a single first- order sentence. =Characterisation of a single structure= Is a language L expressive enough to axiomatize a single finite structure S? Single graphs (1) and (1') having common properties. Problem A structure like (1) in the figure can be described by FO sentences in the logic of graphs like # Every node has an edge to another node: \\\\forall_x \\\\exists_y G(x, y). # No node has an edge to itself: \\\\forall_{x,y} (G(x, y) \\\\Rightarrow x eq y). # There is at least one node that is connected to all others: \\\\exists_x \\\\forall_y (x eq y \\\\Rightarrow G(x, y)). However, these properties do not axiomatize the structure, since for structure (1') the above properties hold as well, yet structures (1) and (1') are not isomorphic. Informally the question is whether by adding enough properties, these properties together describe exactly (1) and are valid (all together) for no other structure (up to isomorphism). Approach For a single finite structure it is always possible to precisely describe the structure by a single FO sentence. The principle is illustrated here for a structure with one binary relation R and without constants: # say that there are at least n elements: \\\\varphi_1 = \\\\bigwedge_{i e j} eg (x_i = x_j) # say that there are at most n elements: \\\\varphi_2 = \\\\forall_y \\\\bigvee_{i} (x_i = y) # state every element of the relation R: \\\\varphi_3 = \\\\bigwedge_{(a_i, a_j) \\\\in R} R(x_i, x_j) # state every non-element of the relation R: \\\\varphi_4 = \\\\bigwedge_{(a_i, a_j) otin R} eg R(x_i, x_j) all for the same tuple x_1 .. x_n, yielding the FO sentence \\\\exists_{x_1} \\\\dots \\\\exists_{x_n} (\\\\varphi_1 \\\\land \\\\varphi_2 \\\\land \\\\varphi_3 \\\\land \\\\varphi_4). Extension to a fixed number of structures The method of describing a single structure by means of a first-order sentence can easily be extended for any fixed number of structures. A unique description can be obtained by the disjunction of the descriptions for each structure. For instance, for two structures A and B with defining sentences \\\\varphi_A and \\\\varphi_B this would be :\\\\varphi_A \\\\lor \\\\varphi_B. Extension to an infinite structure By definition, a set containing an infinite structure falls outside the area that FMT deals with. Note that infinite structures can never be discriminated in FO, because of the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem, which implies that no first-order theory with an infinite model can have a unique model up to isomorphism. The most famous example is probably Skolem's theorem, that there is a countable non-standard model of arithmetic. =Characterisation of a class of structures= Is a language L expressive enough to describe exactly (up to isomorphism) those finite structures that have certain property P? Set of up to n structures. Problem The descriptions given so far all specify the number of elements of the universe. Unfortunately most interesting sets of structures are not restricted to a certain size, like all graphs that are trees, are connected or are acyclic. Thus to discriminate a finite number of structures is of special importance. Approach Instead of a general statement, the following is a sketch of a methodology to differentiate between structures that can and cannot be discriminated. 1\\\\. The core idea is that whenever one wants to see if a property P can be expressed in FO, one chooses structures A and B, where A does have P and B doesn't. If for A and B the same FO sentences hold, then P cannot be expressed in FO. In short: :A \\\\in P, B ot\\\\in P and A \\\\equiv B, where A \\\\equiv B is shorthand for A \\\\models \\\\alpha \\\\Leftrightarrow B \\\\models \\\\alpha for all FO-sentences Œ±, and P represents the class of structures with property P. 2\\\\. The methodology considers countably many subsets of the language, the union of which forms the language itself. For instance, for FO consider classes FO[m] for each m. For each m the above core idea then has to be shown. That is: :A \\\\in P, B ot\\\\in P and A \\\\equiv_m B with a pair A, B for each m and Œ± (in ‚â°) from FO[m]. It may be appropriate to choose the classes FO[m] to form a partition of the language. 3\\\\. One common way to define FO[m] is by means of the quantifier rank qr(Œ±) of a FO formula Œ±, which expresses the depth of quantifier nesting. For example, for a formula in prenex normal form, qr is simply the total number of its quantifiers. Then FO[m] can be defined as all FO formulas Œ± with qr(Œ±) ‚â§ m (or, if a partition is desired, as those FO formulas with quantifier rank equal to m). 4\\\\. Thus it all comes down to showing A \\\\models \\\\alpha \\\\Leftrightarrow B \\\\models \\\\alpha on the subsets FO[m]. The main approach here is to use the algebraic characterization provided by Ehrenfeucht‚ÄìFra√Øss√© games. Informally, these take a single partial isomorphism on A and B and extend it m times, in order to either prove or disprove A \\\\equiv_m B, dependent on who wins the game. Example We want to show that the property that the size of an ordered structure A = (A, ‚â§) is even, can not be expressed in FO. 1\\\\. The idea is to pick A ‚àà EVEN and B ‚àâ EVEN, where EVEN is the class of all structures of even size. 2\\\\. We start with two ordered structures A2 and B2 with universes A2 = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B2 = {1, 2, 3}. Obviously A2 ‚àà EVEN and B2 ‚àâ EVEN. 3\\\\. For m = 2, we can now show* that in a 2-move Ehrenfeucht‚ÄìFra√Øss√© game on A2 and B2 the duplicator always wins, and thus A2 and B2 cannot be discriminated in FO[2], i.e. A2 \\\\models Œ± ‚áî B2 \\\\models Œ± for every Œ± ‚àà FO[2]. 4\\\\. Next we have to scale the structures up by increasing m. For example, for m = 3 we must find an A3 and B3 such that the duplicator always wins the 3-move game. This can be achieved by A3 = {1, ..., 8} and B3 = {1, ..., 7}. More generally, we can choose Am = {1, ..., 2m} and Bm = {1, ..., 2m-1}; for any m the duplicator always wins the m-move game for this pair of structures*. 5\\\\. Thus EVEN on finite ordered structures cannot be expressed in FO. (*) Note that the proof of the result of the Ehrenfeucht‚ÄìFra√Øss√© game has been omitted, since it is not the main focus here. Applications =Database theory= A substantial fragment of SQL (namely that which is effectively relational algebra) is based on first-order logic (more precisely can be translated in domain relational calculus by means of Codd's theorem), as the following example illustrates: Think of a database table \\"GIRLS\\" with the columns \\"FIRST_NAME\\" and \\"LAST_NAME\\". This corresponds to a binary relation, say G(f, l) on FIRST_NAME X LAST_NAME. The FO query {l : G('Judy', l)}, which returns all the last names where the first name is 'Judy', would look in SQL like this: select LAST_NAME from GIRLS where FIRST_NAME = 'Judy' Notice, we assume here, that all last names appear only once (or we should use SELECT DISTINCT since we assume that relations and answers are sets, not bags). Next we want to make a more complex statement. Therefore, in addition to the \\"GIRLS\\" table we have a table \\"BOYS\\" also with the columns \\"FIRST_NAME\\" and \\"LAST_NAME\\". Now we want to query the last names of all the girls that have the same last name as at least one of the boys. The FO query is {(f,l) : ‚àÉh ( G(f, l) ‚àß B(h, l) )}, and the corresponding SQL statement is: select FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME from GIRLS where LAST_NAME IN ( select LAST_NAME from BOYS ); Notice that in order to express the \\"‚àß\\" we introduced the new language element \\"IN\\" with a subsequent select statement. This makes the language more expressive for the price of higher difficulty to learn and implement. This is a common trade-off in formal language design. The way shown above (\\"IN\\") is by far not the only one to extend the language. An alternative way is e.g. to introduce a \\"JOIN\\" operator, that is: select distinct g.FIRST_NAME, g.LAST_NAME from GIRLS g, BOYS b where g.LAST_NAME=b.LAST_NAME; First-order logic is too restrictive for some database applications, for instance because of its inability to express transitive closure. This has led to more powerful constructs being added to database query languages, such as recursive WITH in SQL:1999. More expressive logics, like fixpoint logics, have therefore been studied in finite model theory because of their relevance to database theory and applications. =Querying and search= Narrative data contains no defined relations. Thus the logical structure of text search queries can be expressed in propositional logic, like in: (\\"Java\\" AND NOT \\"island\\") OR (\\"C#\\" AND NOT \\"music\\") Note that the challenges in full text search are different from database querying, like ranking of results.

It is part of Township High School District 214, which also includes Buffalo Grove High School, John Hersey High School, Prospect High School, Rolling Meadows High School, and Wheeling High School. The school services most of Elk Grove Village, as well as small portions of Des Plaines, Mount Prospect and Arlington Heights. History Elk Grove High School opened in 1966, initially servicing students from the older Elk Grove Village area and the small Des Plaines area served by the school district. The Des Plaines students that were Juniors were allowed to stay at Forest View to graduate there. These Des Plaines students were again moved back to Forest View for a time before the closing of Forest View High School on June 13, 1986, some Des Plaines students from FVHS relocated to EGHS, while the other portion of FVHS' students began attending Prospect High School and Rolling Meadows High School. EGHS jumped in attendance from around 1300 in 1985-86 to just over 2200 for the 1987-88 year (freshman made up 400 students, sophomores 500, juniors 600, and seniors had a class size of 700). FVHS classes of 1987 and 1988 were allowed to decide between EGHS, PHS, and RMHS. FVHS class of 1989 were assigned to schools based on where they lived. In 2004, the EGHS natatorium was built, giving EGHS swimming teams their own pool. Boys' and girls' water polo teams were created as well. EGHS currently shares its pool with aquatic teams from Rolling Meadows High School. In 2006, EGHS started its annual Grenaissance, a day devoted to the arts that includes hands-on workshops and demonstrations in areas such as Computer Graphics, Music, Dance, Stage Acting/Performances, and others. During the first week of the 2007-2008 school year, EGHS was closed for one day due to the flooding of nearby Salt Creek. The flooding completely submerged the varsity baseball fields and partially covered the football/track and soccer areas. The back parking lots were also partially submerged, and power was temporarily lost. Elk Grove High School shares its original layout with Wheeling High School. The courtyard, lunchroom, and academic classrooms are located in the same places, although since the additions of the natatorium, the BTLS/Graphic Arts wing, the Fieldhouse, and the northwestern Science/Math wing to EGHS, considerable differences have been raised.

Fine arts At Elk Grove High School, there are plenty of opportunities for students to take part in Fine Arts. EGHS has three orchestras: Concert Orchestra, Symphony Orchestra, and Honors Chamber Orchestra. Concert Orchestra is for freshman and sophomores, and Symphony Orchestra is for juniors and seniors. Underclassman can, however, audition for Symphony Orchestra if they so choose. The Honors Chamber Orchestra is a smaller, more advanced group of student musicians that has private concerts outside of school several times a year. All of the Orchestras play a fall, winter, and spring concert. The school has several choirs: Beginning Men's Choir (male underclassmen), Beginning Women's Choir (female underclassmen), Advanced Mixed Choir, Treble Choir, Towne Criers, A Octave Higher, Grenadier Voices, and a Vocal Jazz Ensemble. All choirs perform a fall, winter, and spring concert. The Towne Criers perform several times a year around the community, including at elementary schools. The Vocal Jazz Ensemble was recently selected to perform at the 2014 IMEA All-State Music Festival. There are also several bands: Concert Band, Symphonic Band, Jazz Ensemble, Jazz Band, Pit Band (Musical), and House Band (Variety Show), and Marching Band. Only the Concert, Symphonic, Marching, and Jazz Bands perform regularly. Symphonic Band consists mainly of upperclassmen, but younger students can participate by audition. The Marching Band placed in state for the school year 2012-2013. Most recently, they performed at the 2013 Sugar Bowl. Advanced music students in either band, orchestra, or choir can audition for IMEA District VII ensembles; and, if they rank especially well, they also have a chance to be part of the Illinois All State Music Festival. Orchesis is the advanced dance group at Elk Grove High School. They perform several times a year for the school and at different venues. In the spring, the members put on two shows: The Orchesis Show and Miniconcert. The Art program at EGHS, along with its pupils, has won several awards. The Speech Team has also won several awards, including 1st in State. Elk Grove High School also has an excellent drama program that consists of a Fall Play, Winter Musical, and One- Act Plays. Nearly every year for the past ten years, every musical has had a sold-out night. Athletics Elk Grove competes in the Mid-Suburban League. It is also a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most interscholastic sports and competitive activities in Illinois. The teams are nicknamed the Grenadiers.

He was ordained a minister of the Congregational Church there. He returned to England in 1912 promoting immigration on behalf of the Canadian government. On his return to Canada, he received a degree in theology from Victoria College in Toronto, Ontario. He served as an assistant minister for the Methodist Church in Hamilton and then was a chaplain overseas during World War I. He returned to serve with the Congregational Church in Brantford. In 1935, Martin was historian for the Canadian expedition to the Eastern Arctic.

It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19631. Lyrics The lyrics to the rhyme are: :Pease porridge hot, pease porridge cold, :Pease porridge in the pot, nine days old; :Some like it hot, some like it cold, :Some like it in the pot, nine days old.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 345.Notes and queries - Google Books Origin The origins of this rhyme are unknown. The name refers to a type of porridge made from peas. Today it is known as pease pudding, and was also known in Middle English as pease pottage. (\\"Pease\\" was treated as a mass noun, similar to \\"oatmeal\\", and the singular \\"pea\\" and plural \\"peas\\" arose by back- formation.) The earliest recorded version of Pease Porridge Hot is a riddle found in John Newbery's Mother Goose's Melody (c. 1760): :Pease Porridge hot, ::Pease Porridge cold, :Pease Porridge in the Pot ::Nine Days old, :Spell me that in four Letters? ::I will, THAT.Whitmore, The Original Mother Goose's Melody, No. 41.

The Avon, forms an important part of the Latrobe sub-catchment, draining the south eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range, to form the Gippsland Lakes. Location and features The Avon River rises on the south eastern slopes of Mount Wellington, below Miller Spur, part of the Great Dividing Range within the Avon Wilderness Park. The rivers flows in a highly meandering course generally south, then east, then south by southeast, joined by ten tributaries including the Turton River and the Perry River, before reaching its mouth to form Lake Wellington east of and southeast of . Within Lake Wellington, the Avon forms its confluence with the Latrobe River, empties into Bass Strait via the Mitchell River south of . The river descends over its course. The upper reaches are contained in the rugged, heavily forested and largely inaccessible, Avon Wilderness Park. The river passes through forested hillsides, then cleared agricultural land. Around the river has dug a wide channel up to across, composed mainly of sand banks and pebble banks. The river then forms a boundary for the Macallister Irrigation District, with Nuntin Creek joining downstream of Stratford contributing a large amount of irrigation drainage to the river. Considerable demand is placed on the Latrobe and Thomson Rivers for supply of Melbourne's water, industrial use in Australia's largest pulp and paper mill and the power industry in the Latrobe Valley, and for irrigation. The Avon escapes any major impoundment or diversion. The river was important to the indigenous Gunai/Kurnai people, highlighted by Knob Reserve, south of Stratford, being part of the Gunai/Kurnai Bataluk Cultural Trail. The trail highlights the places of cultural significance to the first inhabitants across East Gippsland. Etymology In the Australian Aboriginal Brataualung language the river is given two names, Dooyeedang, with no defined meaning; and Kutbuntaura-wurk, meaning \\"fire carriers\\" and wurk, meaning \\"land\\" or \\"country\\". At one point named the Avoca River by Thomas Mitchell, the river was named the Avon by Angus McMillan in circa 1840.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1958 to 1966. Groves was educated at Daniel McIntyre College and the University of Manitoba. He worked as a chartered accountant before entering political life. He served as a member of the St. Vital council from 1951 to 1956, and became Chairman of Finance and Deputy Mayor in 1956. He was also provincial secretary of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba during this period. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1958 provincial election, defeating his Liberal- Progressive opponent by about 1,300 votes in the Winnipeg area riding of St. Vital. He was returned by comfortable margins in the general elections of 1959 and 1962, and was a backbench supporter of Dufferin Roblin's government throughout his time in the legislature. On one occasion, Groves voted against the Roblin government on an initiative to grant use of public school facilities and services to separate schools. Although many in the PC caucus opposed this measure, Groves was the only PC MLA to actually vote against it. Some caucus members saw this as disloyalty, and called for him to be expelled; Roblin did not act on this request. Groves's own community became involved in a school controversy in 1963-64, when six francophone families took their children out of school to protest bus fees for parochial (i.e. Catholic) school students. The matter was settled after three months. During the controversy, Groves declared his opposition to providing \\"any aid directly or indirectly to parochial schools\\", and said that he would \\"defend the rights of the majority\\". He complained of receiving \\"vicious, ignorant and crude, anonymous letters\\" from his opponents on the subject. Groves died in Winnipeg on his 71st birthday.

The area was originally settled by immigrants from Venezuela and Tobago who cultivated cacao and subsistence crops. After falling cocoa prices in the 1920s and expanding pest problems caused the collapse of the cocoa industry, Grande Riviere went into a decline which continued until the development of ecotourism. Between 1931 and 2000 the population of Grande Riviere fell from 718 to 334. Grande Riviere is one of the more remote settlement in Trinidad and Tobago. It is 60 kilometres from Sangre Grande and 100 km from the capital Port of Spain. It is accessible via a single paved road which runs from Toco to its east and is separated from the rest of the island by the hills of the Northern Range. History Grande Riviere was initially settled by immigrants from Venezuela in the 1860s. They planted cacao as a cash crop, together with various subsistence crops. They were joined by immigrants from Tobago only 35 km to the northeast. This was the beginning of the cocoa boom in Trinidad which lasted from 1866 to 1920. Economic life was dominated by the Grande Riviere estate, a cocoa plantation which was the major employer in the area. In addition to working as wage labourers on the estate, villagers also grew cocoa on small holdings which was either sold to the estate or to outside buyers. International cocoa markets suffered with the disruption of shipping associated with World War I, but recovered after the end of the war. A glut in production led to a collapse in the price in 1921. This was followed by the broader economic collapse caused by the Great Depression, and the outbreak of witch's broom. Coupled with higher prices for sugar (the other dominant crop in Trinidad and Tobago) and the rise of the petroleum industry, this led to a long gradual decline in cocoa production. As the cocoa industry collapsed, Grande Riviere went into decline. The population of the village declined from 718 in 1931 to 550 in 1946. The Masonic Lodge and police station were relocated out of the village, the Magistrates' Court ceased to visit the village, and Grande Riviere estate was sold. The new owner, while maintaining cocoa production, cut staff to a minimum. This decline continued through most of the remainder of the twentieth century. The economy was dominated by agriculture - cocoa and bananas were grown as cash crops, artisanal fishing and road construction and maintenance work by the government. Subsistence agriculture, hunting and the capture of nesting Leatherback turtles also contributed food and income. Ecotourism A leatherback turtle nesting on a beach in Grande Riviere. In 1992, following the success of Nature Seekers in Matura, the Grande Riviere Environmental Awareness Trust (GREAT) was established with the aim of protecting nesting Leatherback turtles on Grande Riviere beach. The following year Italian photographer Piero Guerrini rented the former cocoa estate headquarters and converted it into a 12-room beach front hotel, Mt. Plasir. The hotel was very successful and was eventually joined by three other hotels - Le Grande Almandier hotel, a 10-room hotel, McEachnie‚Äôs Haven, a six-room hotel, and Acajou, a 7-room ecological boutique-hotel. In addition, villagers started renting rooms to visitors. GREAT began training tour guides, but a subsequent split led to the formation of Grande Riviere Nature Tour Guides Association (GRNTGA) which focussed more on tour guides, while the remainder of GREAT focussed on protection of turtle hatchlings. In addition to sea turtles, there is an interest in nature tourism more broadly, including the critically endangered pawi (Trinidad piping-guan, the only bird species endemic to Trinidad).

The company was founded by Enos Gordon Goudey (1863‚Äì1946) of Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia. Formerly an employee of Beemans, he opened a factory in Boston, Massachusetts in 1919 and later in Allston. It operated there from 1924 until it closed in 1962. Goudey sold the business in 1932 but he retained an interest as a consultant. On his retirement in 1933, William Wrigley Jr. dubbed him the \\"penny gum king of America\\". Today the Goudey name is mainly associated with its collectible baseball cards which were introduced in 1933. Goudey was the first American company to issue baseball cards with each stick of gum (they had been available with cigarettes and certain lines of candy for many years).M. Fogel, \\"The History of Goudey Gum Company\\", July 8, 2003.J.

Today, cards in good condition command a premium, especially those authenticated and graded by respected third-party graders. Hank Greenberg and Lou Gehrig are prominently featured in the Goudey cards of the 1930s, colorful cards with hand drawn portraits of the players. Other baseball hall of fame and interesting players depicted on Goudey gum cards from 1933 to 1941 include: Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Jimmie Foxx, Bill Dickey, Carl Hubbell, Lefty Grove, Dizzy Dean, Mickey Cochrane, Charlie Gehringer, Tony Lazzeri, Mel Ott, Joe DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg, \\"Ducky\\" Joe Medwick and Moe Berg. =1933 set= In 1933, Goudey produced a 240 card set, also called \\"Big League Chewing Gum\\". These cards, issued with bubble gum in each pack, were the first baseball gum cards. The 1933 Goudey set is considered one of the \\"Big Three\\" classic baseball card sets, along with the T206 and 1952 Topps sets. One of the rarest baseball cards from a mainstream set is card #106 from the 1933 Goudey set. It was not originally issued with the set, so collectors could not complete the set from packs. In 1934, Goudey issued card #106 for the 1933 set with retired player Napoleon Lajoie. Collectors that sent letters to the Goudey Gum Company complaining about the lack of a #106 card received it in the mail. The 1933 Goudey #106 Napoleon Lajoie is known as one of the \\"Big Three\\" baseball cards along with two cards from the T206 set depicting Honus Wagner and Eddie Plank. =1934 set= In 1934, Goudey produced a 96 card set that was endorsed by two players, Lou Gehrig and Chuck Klein. The 1934 Goudey set is sometimes called the \\"Lou Gehrig\\" set. There are no Babe Ruth cards in the set. The Hank Greenberg rookie card is in this set. =1938 set= In 1938, Goudey produced a 48 card set, also known as the \\"Heads-Up\\" set. The cards were numbered from 241 to 288, thus looking like Goudey was trying to extend the 1933 Goudey set. The first 24 cards in the set depicts pictures of players heads attached to a cartoonish body in baseball action. The next 24 cards in the set depicts the same players and the same poses. The difference is the next 24 cards include small cartoonish characters playing baseball along with captions. Joe DiMaggio, Jimmie Foxx, Hank Greenberg and Bob Feller are the big stars in this set. =Canadian Goudey= Similar cards as the 1933 and 1934 Goudey sets were also released in Canada by the Goudey-owned World Wide Gum Co, of Granby, Quebec. They are sometimes known as Canadian Goudey sets. There were 94 and 96 cards in these sets, respectively.

The son of Arthur L. Wright and Mary Ruffles, Wright was born and educated in Winnipeg, and worked as a supervisor for the mechanical departure of the Canadian National Railway. In 1931, he married Pearl Rosina Clegg. Wright was chairman of the Public Works department in the city of West Kildonan from 1946 to 1954, and served as its mayor from 1954 to 1958. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1958 provincial election, winning an easy victory in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Seven Oaks. He was returned by an equally significant margin the 1959 election, and fended off a more serious challenge from Progressive Conservative candidate Jack Chapman in the election of 1962. He did not run again in 1966. Wright died in Winnipeg at the age of 69 of cancer. There are currently Arthur E. Wright schools in California and Winnipeg.

School principal Before his election to Parliament, Peachey was employed as the principal of Rangitoto College, the largest secondary school in New Zealand. He had previously been the president of the Secondary Principals Association of New Zealand, and was an outspoken commentator on educational issues. An example of such commentary is his book What's Up with Our Schools?, which was released in 2005. Member of Parliament Peachey was selected as a list candidate for the National Party in the 2002 elections, and was viewed by many as one of the party's brighter prospects. His ranking on the party's list (eighteenth, above several sitting MPs) was thought sufficient to guarantee him entry to Parliament, but the National Party's overall performance was poor enough that he narrowly missed out. Peachey stood for election again in the 2005 elections. He was ranked at thirty on National's party list, but was also selected as the National candidate for Tamaki, traditionally regarded as a safe National seat. This selection caused a certain amount of controversy, as the seat already had a sitting National MP. That MP, Clem Simich, was persuaded to withdraw, and was rewarded with a high list placing and the National Party candidacy in the electorate of Mangere. Peachey won the Tamaki electorate seat, receiving 20,956 votes of a total 36,946. The immediate runner-up in his electorate was Leila Boyle, a Labour Party candidate who received 11,446 votes. \\"Knife in Your Back\\" controversy Controversy arose when Peachey e-mailed Selwyn College co-principal Carol White declining an invitation to the school's prizegiving stating at the bottom: \\"Yes, I do have a knife in your back, so be careful.\\" \\"MP Peachey sent 'knife in back' email\\", The New Zealand Herald, 5 December 2005 Peachey quickly issued an apology.Peachey apologises for knife comment by Radio New Zealand, published on TVNZ, 5 December 2005 Retirement and death Although Peachey initially planned to seek re-election in the 2011 election, having been renominated for TƒÅmaki electorate and been ranked 48th on the party list, he subsequently announced his withdrawal \\"to focus on his treatment and recovery from his recent ill health\\". He had not previously disclosed the nature or extent of his ill health. His sudden withdrawal shortly before the elections forced the National Party to arrange a new candidate selection process.

The album entered the Billboard 200 chart at number 165, slightly higher than the band's following effort, Catch Thirtythree. A last- minute decision to join 2002's Ozzfest tour forced the band to mix the album in two days and to master it in one. As a result, the album had its guitars and drums re-recorded for a remastered re-release in 2006. Musical style The songs on this album consist of slower tempos and a heavy focus on groove instead of the thrash metal style of previous albums. This stylistic change led to mixed reviews from fans, though it received a warmer reception from mainstream critics than the band's previous efforts. Jazz fusion elements such as the interludes found in some songs on the band's Destroy Erase Improve album are still present in this release. This is also the first album on which guitarists Fredrik Thordendal and M√•rten Hagstr√∂m experimented with 8-string guitars by re-recording the guitar tracks, replacing the original performances made using detuned 7-string guitars, due in part to their custom Nevborn guitars not being ready. Release and reception The track \\"Rational Gaze\\" was promoted with three music videos. The first was a repetitive black-and- white sequence of pictures, and did not have much connection with the song structure; the second version, directed by Torbj√∂rn Oyesvold, featured a blue- greenish environment with the band performing, heavy post-processed by blurry video filters; the third version, entitled \\"Mr. Kidman Delirium Version\\", was not an official video, but rather a handicam of Jens Kidman performing as his bandmates, with the help of different wigs. In January 2018, Loudwire named Nothing their favorite djent album. Nothing has sold over 95,000 copies in the US. =Re-release= A re-recorded and remastered version of the album was released on 31 October 2006. The new version features new rhythm guitar tracks re-recorded with 8-string guitars. The drums were also re-recorded by using the original drum hits as triggers for new audio produced with virtual drum software. The vocals were not re-recorded, but were given a pitch alteration to match the newly recorded lower musical key. There are two songs significantly modified from their original version. These include the tempo of \\"Nebulous\\" which was lowered, and the track length of \\"Obsidian\\" was nearly doubled with the ending fadeout removed.

Earliest mails An extremely rare 6-kopeck stamp of 1863 The earliest mail service between St Petersburg and Constantinople consisted of diplomatic pouches carried from 1721 on. The Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca in 1774 provided for a regular mail service, for which a consular post office was established in Constantinople. It began using handstamped postal markings around 1830. Beginning in 1779 a mail boat circulated between Constantinople and Kherson, and 1781 saw the establishment of an overland route through Bucharest to Bratzlav. In 1856, the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company (Russkoe Obschchestvo Parokhodstva i Torgovli or –†–û–ü–∏–¢, ROPiT) took over postal operations. It handled mail service between the various offices, and funneled mail to the rest of Russia through Odessa. The ROPiT offices received a status equivalent to regular Russian post offices in 1863. First stamps The first postage stamp of the offices was a large square design issued in 1863 and valued at six kopecks. This type is today rare, as were the normal-sized 2k and 20k stamps issued in 1865, which included a sailing ship along with the imperial coat of arms, and \\"ROPiT\\" in the inscription. A similar but better-executed design appeared in 1866. Beginning in 1868, ROPiT switched to a design consisting of a large number of value in the center. As with the regular Russian stamps, they were originally printed on horizontally-laid paper, and on vertically-laid paper from 1872 on. Overprints for 8 kopeck and 7 kopeck values were used in 1876 and 1879. The colors were changed in 1879, and again in 1884, matching the contemporaneous stamps of Russia. Beginning in 1900, the printing of special stamps was abandoned, in conjunction with the use of the local Ottoman currency of paras and piastres. Instead, regular Russian stamps were surcharged. Anniversary stamps In 1909, a 50th-anniversary commemorative issue was produced by substituting the ROPiT sailing ship logo in the place of the imperial eagle. 1909 also saw the issuance of these stamps overprinted in French with the names of cities where the Russian post offices were located: \\"Beyrouth\\" - Beirut, \\"Constantinople\\" - Constantinople, \\"Dardanelles\\" - Dardanelles, \\"Jaffa\\" - Jaffa, \\"Jerusalem\\" - Jerusalem, \\"Kerassunde\\" - Giresun,\\"Mersine\\", \\"M√©telin\\" - Mytilene, \\"Mont Athos\\" - Mount Athos, \\"Rizeh\\" - Rize, \\"Salonique\\" - Salonica, \\"Smyrne\\" - Smyrna, \\"Trebizonde\\" - Trabzon.

At the , Stratford had a population of 1950. The town services the local regional community and travellers on the Princes Highway. Stratford's principal industries are dairying, sheep, cattle and horse breeding and vegetable crops. The town has numerous coffee shops and cafes, a cellar door for a local winery, Design Gallery, model railway shop, a pub, parks and playgrounds for car travellers to break their journey. On the Avon River by Stratford The origin of the town's name is unclear. Many believe it derives from Stratford-upon-Avon in England, William Shakespeare's birthplace, a view which is lent credence by the fact that it is located by the river Avon. Locals have embraced the connection with Shakespeare and a Shakespeare on the River Festival has been a successful annual event since 1989, incorporating works of Shakespeare and modern Australian plays. In 1998 the town formally became a member of the Stratford Sister Cities program to promote friendship and cultural exchange between participating countries. The River Avon has a local reputation as a source for river polished gemstones, particularly agate, and for rapidly rising during increased rainfall upstream. Three kilometres south-east of Stratford is a park called Knob Reserve (formerly known as the \\"Forest of Arden\\"), part of the Gunai/Kurnai Bataluk Cultural Trail, which winds its way through East Gippsland, highlighting the places of cultural significance to the first inhabitants. There are picnic facilities and an annual country music festival is held at Knob Reserve. Stratford has a railway station on the Bairnsdale railway line, which was reopened for passenger use in 2004. The Howitt Bicycle Trail passes through Stratford. The town has an Australian rules football team, nicknamed the Swans; who have been competing in the East Gippsland Football League since 2012. They had previously competed in the North Gippsland Football League from 2004-11. The town has a cricket team competing in the Sale-Maffra Cricket Association. They have won 4 A-Grade premierships since reforming in 1978. History A church and a memorial to Angus McMillan The land around the Avon River was occupied by the Brayakuloong people of the Gunai/Kurnai indigenous nation for thousands of years prior to European settlement. Angus McMillan named the Avon River after the river of the same name in his native Scotland. In 1840 he established a pastoral run at Bushy Park, north-west of the township. William Odell Raymond established a run in the area in 1842, and built his house, Strathfieldsaye, during 1848‚Äì54. European settlement did not take place without resistance, and in return, massacres were inflicted by Angus McMillan and others on Gunai people, especially between the years of 1840 and 1850. The township was established in the late 1850s and the Post Office opened on 1 May 1858. With the 1860s gold rush to the Omeo and Dargo goldfields, the town of Stratford prospered. Historic buildings include the RSL Hall (1866), the Church of Holy Trinity (1868), the Methodist Church (1873), and the Post Office (1884). In 1863 Reverend Friedrich Hagenauer established Ramahyuck Mission on the banks of the Avon River near Lake Wellington to house the Ganai survivors from west and central Gippsland. The name combines \\"Ramah\\", the home of Samuel in the First Book of Kings, with \\"yuck\\", an Aboriginal term reputedly meaning \\"our place\\". The mission sought to discourage all tribal ritual and culture, and replace it with Christian values and European customs. The Mission closed in 1908 and the few remaining residents were moved to Lake Tyers Mission.

Deiva Marina seashore in summer. Deiva Marina seafront (western side). It is a quiet touristic resort, with clean seawater and a seashore surrounded by green mountains. It is known as a fishing place all year long. Excursions to nearby Cinque Terre National Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, or to Portofino are very easy. Since 2018 Deiva Marina municipality is a partner of the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals. This implies a commitment to intensify the fight against any form of pollution, whether of maritime or land-based origin having or likely to have a direct or indirect impact on the marine mammal conservation status as well as to avoid any highspeed motorboat competition.  History  Although mentioned in documents since Carolingian period, the territory was hard to reach by land because of the high mountains surrounding it and by sea, because of the lack of a harbour. A number of small villages scattered the inland, while the seafront could not be inhabited because of the incursions of Muslim Barbary pirates. Local people were often fishermen, but at night would retreat inland to the historic center of Deiva near the church. Two watch towers, built in the 16th century, were the only fortifications, where the population could hide, and today are in the coat of arms of the municipality. The square tower, near the church, about one kilometer from the sea, has been preserved and restored. The round one, near the sea, was partially demolished by a flash flood in 1852. In 1874 the railway along the Ligurian coast was completed and Deiva became easier to access: a few houses were built near the railway station, including an inn called \\"Albergo Savoia\\". The rest of the coastal area was partially used by a factory and later also for military defense. The only remarkable building built near the seashore in the first half of the 20th century was a villa in style \\"art nouveau\\", called \\"Villa Schiaffino\\". The transformation of Deiva into a holiday resort became possible only in 1932, when the railways (including the railway station) were moved about 1 km inland, leaving a wide usable seafront, but really took place after World War II. Meanwhile, connection to the main Italian towns was greatly improved both by the construction of the motorway A12 and by the reuse of abandoned railway tunnels for local car traffic. This encouraged in the Sixties and Seventies the construction of many apartment buildings, to be used as second houses. Economy The most important economic resource is tourism. =Tourism= Deiva Marina offers its visitors a variety of sea and land attractions. It has wide sandy beaches, many rocky beaches and a large number of small bays accessible only by sea. Fishing is productive all year long. Moreover cruises for fishing or whale watching are possible. There are many nature trails in the hills surrounding Deiva Marina. The two trails leading to the nearby places of Framura and Moneglia develop parallel to the coast line among the maquis shrubland, vineyard terraces or chestnut or maritime pine woods and provide interesting viewpoints on the sea. Other trail lead inland, climbing the local Apennine mountains. Real climbing can be experienced on the Falesia della Sfinge. Deiva may also be the base for bicycle sport activity.

The party takes place on the night of, before, or after every full moon. It is mostly attended by tourists. As of 8 March 2020 it is cancelled until further notice due to the Covid-19 pandemic. History Full Moon Party, March 2015, view over Hat Rin Sunrise Beach The first Full Moon Party is said to have been improvised at a Paradise Bungalows on the beach in 1983 as a token of thanks to about 20‚Äì30 travelers, though the accuracy of this is disputed, as is the date of the original event. The parties gained fame through word of mouth, and the event now draws a crowd of about 5,000‚Äì30,000 every full moon evening. The party carries on until the sun rises the next day. The bars on Sunrise Beach of Hat Rin stay open and play music such as psychedelic trance, R&B;, drum and bass, house, dance, and reggae. The modern event has become a part of the itinerary of many travelers to Southeast Asia. The success of the Full Moon Party prompted the creation of \\"Half Moon\\", \\"Black (New) Moon\\", Oxa Beach, and other parties. The ruling military government in late 2014 banned all but the Full Moon Party, but the edict may not have been observed by local authorities given that, as of 5 April 2015, all parties except the Full Moon Party were again banned on Ko Pha-ngan. This was done to stop the noise pollution which has become a constant source of irritation for the islanders. The ban was ordered by Pha- ngan district chief officer Krirkkrai Songthani after a meeting with local leaders on 3 April to discuss complaints from many residents about the various parties which are held up to 25 times a month at one coconut plantation or another on the island. However, these bans are only ever short-lived, and lapse once they have served their unstated purpose, allowing the re- proliferation of parties. Given the junta's stated goal of attracting higher- class (wealthier) tourists, it is unclear how much longer the Full Moon Party will be permitted to continue. Already, the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) webpage for Ko Pha-ngan barely makes mention of the Full Moon Party. A police colonel summed up the attitude of the new government when he said, \\"The sort of tourist that comes here to drink too much and take drugs are not the type that Thailand wants.\\" Frequency The Full Moon Party takes place every month throughout the year. Its attractions include fire skipping ropes, alcohol \\"buckets\\", and drugs. There is a very wide spectrum of music ranging from trance, to drum and bass, to reggae. The party takes place in many clubs along the Hat Rin beach. The Full Moon Party in October 2017, and all other parties and music activities on Koh Pha-ngan, was canceled in respect for the cremation ceremony for the late king Bhumibol Adulyadej, October 25 to 29. Safety issues Although drugs are consumed by many partygoers, drug laws are strict and police enforcement is stepped up during the parties. There are undercover police on patrol and even the drug dealers themselves may report drug users to police. In recent years, there has been an increasing number of assaults and robberies at the party and in bars in the surrounding area, leading the British government to officially warn tourists to exercise caution at Full Moon Parties. Break-ins at hotel bungalows while partygoers are away from their rooms sometimes occur as well.Tips and tricks for the Full Moon Party On New Year's Eve 2012, British tourist Stephen Ashton was killed by a stray bullet. In popular culture The Full Moon Party has been featured in films such as The Beach, Last Stop for Paul, and the Thai film Hormones. It was also featured in the first episode of the Comedy Central TV show Gerhard Reinke's Wanderlust. In 2011, the island's parties featured on Tourism and the Truth: Stacey Dooley Investigates, a documentary investigating the negative impacts of tourism on local people and the economy. It was featured in episode 4 of E4's comedy-drama series Gap Year. Gallery File:Fullmoon-party- originator wDSC03487.jpgFull Moon Party creator Sutti Kursakul.

The habitat of this large thrush is dense forest. The nest is a lined bulky cup of twigs low in a tree or treefern. Two to three reddish-blotched greenish-blue eggs are laid and incubated by the female for about 13 days to hatching. The young then fledge in another 13‚Äì15 days. The cocoa thrush is 22‚Äì24 cm long. It is dark rufous brown above and paler rufous brown below. There are five poorly defined races, differing mainly in the brightness of the plumage. Sexes are similar, but young birds are duller, having the scalloped underparts common in immature thrushes. The cocoa thrush mainly feeds on or near the ground on insects, especially ants, other invertebrates and some berries. It is a shy species, but on Trinidad it is much tamer, and will come to feeders. The song is a musical warble, and it also produces a variety of typical thrush chuck and chak calls. Range In South America, besides the Amazon Basin, the Guianas and the Guiana Shield, the cocoa thrush ranges into two areas. A medium-sized disjunct population lives on southeast coastal Brazil; the narrow coastal range is 300 km wide and extends from Alagoas state in the north to southern Rio de Janeiro state, about 2300 km. Another range for the species is in northeast Colombia and southwest Venezuela. It covers parts of the headwaters of the Caribbean-flowing Orinoco River drainage, and adjacent Amazonian headwaters to the Rio Negro flowing southeast into the Amazon's northwest quadrant. This Colombian-Venezuelan range extends to the coast, and is coastal along northern Venezuela, as it is an extension of the range from the Guianas, (western Guyana). The cocoa thrush's range covers the downstream eastern half of the Amazon Basin; in the northeast Basin, it is in Par√° and Amap√° state with the Guianas. In the southeast Basin, it is in the Tapajos River and Xingu River drainages; also two thirds of the adjacent river system, the lower Araguaia-Tocantins River drainage.

He was a pioneer in his field and defied conventional forms of poetry that had been common for centuries. Biography He was born in Baghdad, near the shrine of the 12th century Sufi Abdel Qadir al-Jilani. In this respect, al-Bayati is unique among his peers, most of whom share pastoral roots. A man of the city, he lived close to the political heartbeat most of his life‚Äîone of his friends, Ahmed Abdel-Moeti Hegazi, said urban centers of \\"hotels and institutions, caf√©s and airports\\" were actually his temporary residences.Hegazi, Agmed Abdel-Moeti. \\"Points of Reference .\\" Al-Ahram Weekly Online Issue No. 442 (12‚Äì18 August 1999). Retrieved on 4 May 2005 London, Moscow, Madrid and Baghdad are all represented in his poetry. He attended Baghdad University, and became a teacher after graduating from Dar Al- Mu'allimin (the Teacher's College) in 1950, the same year that he released his first collection of poems, Mala'ika wa Shayatin (Angels and Devils). In addition to teaching in public schools, al-Bayati also edited the popular and widely circulated cultural magazine Al-Thaqafa A-Jadida (The New Culture). In 1954 he left Iraq after being dismissed from his positions because of his radical communist political views and anti-government activity, and moved to Damascus. Although he returned to Damascus at the end of his life, his early wanderings also took him to Cairo, Beirut and a number of Western capitals. Always involved in world affairs, some of al-Bayati's poems are in fact addressed to international figures such as T.S. Eliot and Che Guevara. Not much information is available about his personal life. Before his exile, he married, but his wife and four children are mentioned only in passing in the few available biographies. This may be because they remained in Iraq after his departure. After spending four years living in exile in Lebanon, Syria and Egypt, al-Bayyati returned to Iraq in 1958 after a military coup d'√©tat during which Crown Prince Abdul Illah and his nephew King Faisal were assassinated. The new republican government gave him a post in the Ministry of Education, after which he went to Moscow as a cultural attache representing the Iraqi embassy. Al-Bayati resigned from this post in 1961, but did not return to Iraq right away. He continued to live in Russia, teaching at the Asian and African People's Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He stayed in Eastern Europe, traveling often, and returned briefly to Iraq in 1964, only to move to Cairo within the year. In the mid-1970s Al-Bayati moved between Cairo, Paris, London, Madrid, Jeddah and Delphi, never staying in one place long but always returning to the Middle East. For the remainder of his life, Al-Bayati moved between his homeland and the rest of the world. \\"I've always searched for the sun's springs,\\" he said, \\"When a human being stays in one place, he's likely to die. People too stagnate like water and air. Therefore the death of nature, of words, of the spirit has prompted me to keep travelling, so as to encounter new suns, new springs, new horizons. A whole new world being born.\\" Although Al-Bayati was philosophical about his wandering, it was not solely a personal choice. His communist politics made trouble for him throughout his whole life. When the pan-Arab, socialist Ba'ath Party took control of Iraq from the 'Arif party in 1968, Al-Bayati returned home only to flee a brutal campaign against liberals a few years later. He returned in 1972 to receive honors from the new government, and in 1980 was again assigned as a cultural attach√© and was sent by Saddam Hussein to the embassy in Madrid. When Hussein's government invaded Kuwait in 1990, Al-Bayati left Spain and took refuge in Jordan and later Syria. In 1995, Hussein revoked his citizenship as punishment for Al-Bayati's participation in a Saudi Arabian cultural festival. Al-Bayati's difficulty with Iraq over the course of his life became the subject of much of his writing. There is a story that he once explained it by drawing comparisons between his relationship with Iraq and the story of Prometheus. \\"Of course,\\" Al-Bayati said, \\"my relations with Iraqi governments were never conciliatory. I belong to the Iraqi people. I cannot separate myself from the people.\\" He died in exile, apparently without any previously diagnosed illness, in Damascus on August 3, 1999.  Transliteration of the name Al-Bayati  Abd al-Wahhab's last name should not be spelled as \\"Al-Bayyati\\" (double yy), in Arabic or when being transliterated for another language, as the meaning would change and become one of \\"the boarder\\" or \\"the pupil of a boarding school.\\" This is a common mistake made with the last name Al-Bayati, even in Arabic, as it is assumed to be a name whose root (ba ya ta / ÿ® Ÿä ÿ™) has Arabic origins, and therefore is expected to follow the Arabic fa ø øaal / ŸÅÿπŸéŸëÿßŸÑ noun type, used to denote intensity, repetition or a profession. The name of Al-Bayati denotes one who comes from the Bayat tribe (ŸÇÿ®ŸäŸÑÿ© ÿ®Ÿäÿßÿ™), one of the largest Turcoman tribes in Iraq, entering the area with the Oghuz Turk migrations of the 9th‚Äì12th centuries C.E. In Iraq, although Al-Bayatis know of the tribal source of their name, it does not necessarily indicate a linguistic or cultural identity, as the Bayat tribe there is \\"largely Arabised, through intermarriage and linguistic assimilation.\\"  Al-Bayati as a Refugee  Due to his revolutionary ideas and advocacy for oppressed people, Abdul Wahab Al Bayati spent more than half of his life in exile. This gives a bitter flavor even to his love poetry. Following is from his The Impossible: With dawn it comes or does not come, My love that took to stony silence, Round the walls it goes, begging, Torn by talons of death whenever Out of the death and gnawed by despair It shouts: O you, creature you! The Ship of Fate moved on, Sinbad of the Wind never came, How was it you came when our wells Are poisoned, where can you have come from? Did we meet before I came to be?\\"Jayyusi, S. K. (ed.). (1987). Modern Arabic Poetry: An Anthology. New York: University of Columbia Press, p. 170. With total despair, he speaks about the tormenting pain of exile. Following is his poem entitled Why Are We in Exile the Refugees Ask (translated from Arabic by Abdullah Al-Udhari): Why do we die? In silence And I had a house And I had ‚Ä¶. And here you are Without a heart without a voice Waiting, and here you are Why are we in exile? We die We die in silence Why are we not crying? On fire, On thorns We walked And my people walked Why are we Lord? Without a country, without love We die We die in terror Why are we in exile? Why are we lord?Hamalian, L. & Yohannan, J.D. (1978). New Writings from the Middle East. New York: New American Library, p. 66.  The Sufi and Leftist Inspirations  Al-Bayati has intensively been influenced by the Middle Eastern Sufi figures for their visionary values and passionate love. He was fascinated by the love of Satan for God elaborated by some Sufi masters like Imam Ahmad A-Ghazali. This is an unconditional love in which the lover approaches his beloved as par excellence and cannot see any rival for Him. On example is a poem by Al-Bayati entitled A‚Äôisha‚Äôs Mad Lover in his book, Love Poems on the Seven Gates of the World (1971): ‚ÄúIn this context Al-Bayati‚Äôs poetry becomes Sufi in default, since he assumes the position as a modernist whose aspirations for an earthy paradise have not materialized.‚ÄùAl-Musawi, M. (2009). Islam on the Street: Religion in Modern Arabic Literature. Toronto: Bowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc., p. 211. Al-Bayati‚Äôs communist ideology prompted him to make close friendship with the Turkish poet and playwright Nazim Hikmat (1902-1963). They met in Moscow, as both of them were in exile in the Soviet Union. He was also under the influence of other leftist poets and men of letters like the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893-1930), the French surrealist poet Louis Aragon (1897-1982), the Spanish poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca (1898-1936) and the Chilean poet and politician Pablo Neruda (1904-1973).

The rigid social confines of his suburban, middle-class upbringing placed Monette in a position where life in the closet seemed to be the only option. For the majority of Monette's childhood, he felt suffocated and alienated by the strict, religious atmosphere in which he was raised. Monette would later describe this life in the closet as hindering his personal development as a child, as he was forced to deny a part of his identity that was seen as sinful by everyone around him. He described his youth in the closet as an ‚Äòinternal exile‚Äô, an ‚Äòimprisonment‚Äô, and claimed that closeted life equates to ‚Äòthe gutting of all our passions till we are a bunch of eunuchs.‚Äô Conflicted about his sexual orientation, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where he taught writing and literature at Milton Academy. In 1978 he moved to West Hollywood with his romantic partner, lawyer Roger Horwitz (November 22, 1941 ‚Äì October 22, 1986). He wrote and published several novels during this time period, starting with Taking Care of Mrs. Carroll in 1978, which featured a gay protagonist. Monette himself later described the books he produced in this time period \\"glib and silly little novels.\\" His more serious work came later in his life and was largely driven by his experiences with AIDS.  Notable works  = Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir = Monette's most acclaimed book, Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir, chronicles Horwitz's fight against, and eventual death from, AIDS. The memoir details the final nineteen months of Horwtiz's life, beginning with the day that he was first diagnosed with AIDS. Monette describes the day as \\"the day we began to live on the moon,\\" isolating himself from the reader in order to demonstrate the devastating loneliness that is felt among AIDS patients and their loved ones. It was a miserable existence for Monette, he writes: \\"within three months this sense of separateness would grow so acute that I really didn't want to talk to anyone anymore who wasn't touched by AIDS, body or soul.\\" = Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story = His 1992 memoir, Becoming a Man: Half a Life Story, tells of his life in the closet before coming out, culminating with his meeting Horwitz in 1974.

He wrote Afterlife (1990) and Halfway Home (1991) which were centered around people with AIDS and their families' experiences. He once said in an interview that \\"One person‚Äôs truth, if told well, does not leave anyone out.\\" Because of this belief, he tried to tell the truth in a way that gave a voice to a community that was usually left out.  Later life and death  Monette's final years, before his own AIDS-related death, are chronicled in the film Paul Monette: On the Brink of Summer's End by Monte Bramer and Lesli Klainberg. \\"By the end of his life, Monette had healed most of his psychic wounds, but his rage persisted.\\" He said, \\"go without hate, but not without rage; heal the world.\\" He had tried to use his rage to heal the world through his writing and activism.

The triband is one of the most common designs of flag, and is the design of some 30% of all current national flags. As the name suggests, the main feature of the design of a triband is three parallel bands of colour. If the three bands have three different colours, the triband is a tricolour. In its simplest form, the triband consists of three equally sized horizontal or vertical stripes and nothing else. Examples of horizontal tribands include the national flags of Austria and Germany, and examples of vertical tribands include the national flags of Nigeria and France. In each of these pairs, the second named flag is also a tricolour. Diagonal tribands are less common, and often do not have stripes of equal areas or widths. An example is the flag of the Republic of the Congo. Such flags are often not considered tribands by vexillologists, but rather are described as having a single diagonal stripe (heraldically, a bend) on a one- or two-coloured background (or field). More complex tribands include flags charged or defaced with an emblem (such as the national flag of Croatia) or flags with bands of unequal size (such as the national flag of Colombia). The most famous complex triband is arguably the national flag of Canada, which is charged with a maple leaf and has bands of uneven size. The ratio of the bands on this latter flag (1:2:1) has led to the term Canadian pale to refer to any central vertical band on a triband which is twice the size of the bands on either side. Some tribands, such as the flag of the Gambia, are fimbriated. This means that between the stripes there are narrower stripes. This is sometimes done to increase contrast between multiple stripes or to follow the rule of tincture, though in some cases the fimbriation also has specific symbolism. List of tribands Below is a list of tribands organized by continent. Some of them are charged, i.e. they have some additional symbol apart from the three simple coloured fields. = Africa =  Tricolours  * (charged)  (charged) * (charged) (charged) * (fimbriated)

around the neck like a scarf. A modern, pink chandelle feather boa, in a black and white image Construction A boa can be made of fur, but it is usually made instead from various types of feathers. Ostrich, marabou, chandelle, and turkey are the most common feathers used, although non-feather boas are also available. Feathers used go through bleaching or dyeing processes and are glued and stitched into lengths called \\"ply\\". Sometimes more natural boas are produced. A lightweight chandelle boa might only weigh , whereas a 24 ply ostrich boa can weigh as much as . The more ply, the fluffier and thicker the boa. Boas are generally measured by weight (grams), length (centimetres), and ply. Boas are available through novelty, costume, or lingerie shops, as well as online. Young woman modeling a knitted boa, San Diego, California ‚Äì Photograph by Patty MooneyWith the development of \\"fun fur\\" or \\"eyelash\\" yarns in the late 20th century, an adept craftsperson can knit a boa of one solid color or a mix of various colors. Yarn boas do not \\"shed\\" like feather boas and are favored for their soft texture against the neck. The rounded boa shape is achieved by knitting one row and purling the next row, then repeating this pattern until reaching the desired length. Types Ostrich ‚Äî Thousands of long thin feather strands woven into ply are used to construct these very fluffy boas. These form the larger, Las Vegas showgirl type boas, as when they are coloured and woven into many ply, they can look very dramatic even at a distance. Turkey ‚Äî Many larger flat turkey feathers form these heavier boas which might weigh between 120 and 400 grams and reach in diameter. Marabou ‚Äî The fine down from marabou is used to form these very thin, and very fluffy boas. Chandelle ‚Äî Smaller feathers or \\"flats\\" from the turkey are used to create these lighter boas with smaller diameters. History Woman with a black feather boa, c. 1892, by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec Feather boas have been documented for use as an adornment since at least 1820, but they might have been worn as early as the 17th century. Feather boas have fallen in and out of fashion many times over the years. Feather boas have had the reputation of being elegant as well as being considered campy or vulgar apparel. Some historic eras where feather boas were in style or trendy include: the late Victorian era and Edwardian era (between 1890 and 1915), the 1920s, and the 1970s during the glam rock and disco music eras. Entertainers have long used feather boas as part of their act. A few feather boa wearers include: dancer Isadora Duncan; singer Shirley Bassey; actor/comedian Mae West; wrestlers Jesse Ventura, Superstar Billy Graham, and Hulk Hogan; singers Scott Weiland, Celia Cruz, Cher, Marc Bolan, Gerard Way, and Elton John; and numerous other opera and cabaret singers. Other uses Social clubs such as the Red Hat Society, or those who are involved with historic re-enactment societies, wear boas at meetings while they are often worn as a costume accessory for parties around holiday seasons such as Halloween or Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Feather boas are worn around campus by new members of the Mask & Wig Club at the University of Pennsylvania. Feather boas are worn for erotic seduction purposes and are at times considered fetish wear. Nude performers may use boas to cover themselves while teasing their audience. Feather boas are sometimes used as trims for skirts or tutus.

Established in the Department of the Treasury by an act of June 14, 1930, consolidating the functions of the Federal Narcotics Control Board and the Narcotic Division. These older bureaus were established to assume enforcement responsibilities assigned to the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act, 1914 and the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, 1922. (aka Jones- Miller Act) Harry J. Anslinger was appointed its first commissioner by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon under President Herbert Hoover. Under Anslinger, the bureau lobbied for harsh penalties for drug usage. The FBN is credited for criminalizing drugs such as marijuana with the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, as well as strengthening the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914. Even so, the main focus of the FBN was fighting opium and heroin smuggling. One instance against opium was the Opium Poppy Control Act of 1942. To that end the FBN over time established several offices overseas in France, Italy, Turkey, Beirut, Thailand and other hotspots of international narcotics smuggling. These agents (never totaling more than 17) cooperated with local drug enforcement agencies in gathering intelligence on smugglers and also made undercover busts locally. The work against heroin and opium was however hamstrung by US foreign policy considerations: during the Vietnam War for instance great importance was placed on investigating minor Vietnamese smugglers that could be connected to the resistance while investigations of large scale smugglers from the US ally Thailand were left unfinished. Anslinger retired in 1962 and was succeeded by Henry Giordano, who was the commissioner of the FBN until it was merged in 1968 with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control, an agency of the Food and Drug Administration, to form the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, an agency of the United States Department of Justice.

It was opened in 1965 as Kotara Fair. In 2003 the shopping centre was purchased by the Westfield Group. The centre's major tenants include Coles, Target, Kmart, Woolworths and a David Jones. It is often locally referred to as Garden City, reflecting its former title. History An outdated sign on Northcott Drive reflecting the centre's former name. The centre was developed by Woolworths and was called Kotara Fair when it first opened on 6 October 1965. It was anchored by a Woolworths supermarket and a Big W department store, and there were 27 speciality stores. Kotara Fair was purchased by David Jones in 1971 and was subsequently redeveloped. The expansion was completed in October 1974 and the centre was renamed Garden City. As part of the redevelopment, David Jones and Norman Ross department stores, as well a further 24 speciality stores, were added. Further redevelopment occurred in 1977 when Norman Ross closed, and another 13 speciality stores were added. In 1980 Garden City was purchased by AMP and in 1988 another expansion created the largest shopping centre in the Hunter Region. The expansion added a Super Kmart and Best & Less as well as bringing the total number of retailers to 120. On 28 December 1989, shortly after completion of another expansion program, the centre suffered significant damage during the Newcastle earthquake. Most affected were the upper levels of the car park adjacent to Northcott Drive and the Super Kmart. Despite the damage, repairs were effected quickly. In 1995 Toys \\"R\\" Us opened and was followed in 1998 by the addition of 14 speciality stores. In 2003 following the purchase of Garden City by the Westfield Group, the centre was renamed Westfield Kotara. Westfield worked for over a year to expand Westfield Kotara in an expansion that significantly increased its size. The centre now features a total of 247 shops. The redevelopment commenced in May 2006. The new food court and half the mall opened on 16 August 2007. The Fashion Mall was completed in September 2007. In 2010 a development application was submitted for an eight screen cinema complex and possible ten pin bowling alley as part of a $12.5 million expansion in light of the opening of the new Charlestown Square in late 2010. On 26 November 2015, an entertainment precinct called \\"The Rooftop\\" opened.

In this context, the song [is] an assertion of black manhood.\\"  Recordings and releases  Waters recorded the song in Chicago on May 24, 1955. It is his only recording between January 1953 and June 1957 that did not feature Little Walter on harmonica (who was on tour supporting his then-number one hit \\"My Babe\\" and thus unavailable for the recording session) and is one of few studio recordings with Junior Wells.

It is approximately west- south-west of the central business district of Newcastle. Charlestown has the largest business centre within the Lake Macquarie city, with a greater turnover than that of the neighbouring Newcastle CBD. The suburb serves as the district's transport hub.  History  The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land. Originally granted to the Waratah Coal Company, the area was the site of the company's first shaft, sunk in 1873. Officially called South Waratah Colliery (later just Waratah Colliery), the pit was variously known as Charles' Pit, Raspberry Gully or The Gully Pit. These names all applied to Charlestown in its early days and the surviving name seem to have been derived from that of Charles Smith, the company's manager. The first settlers were miners from the pit. The colliery closed in 1961. The company had the area surveyed on 29 April 1876; the first subdivision later became Ida Street, Pearson Street, Milson Street and Frederick Streets. Harry Wright bought the first lot when it was auctioned later in 1876. The town had its first water main in 1927 and was connected to civic sewage in 1959.

It has distinguished itself during the two world wars and also since the Independence of India. The regiment has won many battle honours and gallantry awards, and is considered to be one of India's most decorated regiments with three Param Vir Chakra awardees in three different conflicts. Early history The oldest grenadier regiment of the armies in the Commonwealth belongs to the Indian Army. The concept of 'Grenadiers' evolved from the practice of selecting the bravest and strongest men for the most dangerous tasks in combat. The Grenadiers have the longest unbroken record of existence in the Indian Army.Sharma, p. 75 The history of the Indian Grenadiers is linked to the troops recruited for the army of the Bombay Presidency. The very first mention of a grenadier company hails back to 1684, when a little army of English troops, which had taken possession of the island of Bombay and comprising three companies of Europeans and local Christians, had a grenadier company, but nothing was heard about this unit subsequently. In 1710, the Bombay Army consisted of five companies of \\"Europeans, topasses (Indian Christians), and coffrees (Kaffirs or African slaves)\\" of which the first company was a European grenadier company. This company was merged into the Bombay European Regiment, which was later disbanded. In 1757, Robert Clive had raised the 1st Regiment of the Bengal Native Infantry of which two companies were grenadier companies, however, no regiments of grenadiers were formed from the Bengal Army until a battalion was formed in 1779. In 1759, as a response to French manoeuvring in South India, the strength of the Bombay Army was enhanced, and the first company of sepoy grenadiers was raised with the best of Bombay sepoys \\"paying a regard to those having families on the island\\". It had only native officers and all sepoys wore red coats faced with blue. Later on, an adjutant was appointed to the corps. Later the Bombay Army comprised a number of sepoy battalions, each having one or two grenadier companies. These were clubbed together as a composite battalion comprising the grenadier companies of the Bombay sepoy battalions, and they won the famous battle of Talegaon in 1778. So impressive was the performance of this composite battalion that the Bombay Presidency ordered the permanent raising of a grenadier battalion which duly took place on 12 March 1779, thirty-six years before the first time that a British battalion was given the honour of calling itself \\"grenadiers\\". The Governor General of Bombay made an Order dated 12 November 1779, according to which the grenadier companies of the following regiments combined to form the very first Grenadier Regiment in the world, namely \\"The Grenadier Battalion, First Regiment of Infantry\\": * 1st Sepoy Battalion * 2nd Sepoy Battalion * 3rd Sepoy Battalion * 4th Sepoy Battalion * 5th Sepoy Battalion * 6th Sepoy Battalion * Marine Battalion (two companies of grenadiers) 4th Bombay Grenadiers The 4th Bombay Grenadiers were an infantry regiment of the pre-independence Indian Army, formed on 1 March 1922 as part of the reforms of the Indian Army that took place after the end of the First World War. Following this, the Regiment spent the next fifteen years serving in the British Somaliland protectorate in present-day northwestern Somalia, as well as in China and on the North-West Frontier. The 3rd, 4th and 5th Battalions were all disbanded and the 10th Battalion amalgamated with the 10th Battalion, Jat Regiment to form a Combined Training Centre at Bareilly.Sharma, p. 75 Following the Second World War they were one of the regiments allocated to the new Indian Army and renamed The Grenadiers The regiment consisted of six battalions, all former regiments themselves. These were: *1st Battalion - Formerly the 101st Grenadiers. *2nd Battalion - Formerly the 102nd King Edward's Own Grenadiers *3rd Battalion - Formerly the 108th Infantry *4th Battalion - Formerly the 109th Infantry *5th Battalion - Formerly the 112th Infantry *10th (Training) Battalion - Formerly the 113th Infantry =Second World War= Sherman III tank in the Middle East, March 1944. At the beginning of the Second World War there were only two battalions of the Regiment, the 1st and 2nd. This was soon changed, though, as a number of battalions were raised for wartime service, including: 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 14th, 25th, 26th and 27th Battalions. The 10th (Training Battalion) was also de-linked from the Jat Regiment. Some of these battalions were to be garrison or rear area troops only, while others went on to serve with distinction in a number of theatres during the war including the Middle East and Burma, notably during the Arakan campaigns and at Kohima.

It was last owned by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which decided to demolish it to make way for the Las Vegas Global Business District. The hotel had more than 2,100 rooms, fewer than half of which were located in a 23-story tower. The casino had of gaming space. History =Development and founding= The casino was first proposed by Detroit mobster William Bischoff as the Casa Blanca, and received a gaming license in 1952. Bischoff later withdrew from the project, which was taken over by Miami businessman Samuel Cohen. By March 1955, Cohen, identified as a member of Miami's S & G gambling syndicate, was no longer part of the investment group, though rumors persisted that he secretly maintained an involvement. Marx Brothers Harpo and Gummo held minority interests at the opening. The Riviera opened on April 20, 1955 as the first high-rise at 9 stories, and the ninth resort on the Las Vegas Strip. The resort was designed by Miami architects Roy F. France & Son with J Maher Weller of Las Vegas serving as associate architect. The general contractor selected to build the resort was Taylor Construction Co. of Miami. Liberace cut the opening ribbon, and became the first resident performer. The Riviera became one of the oldest and most famous casino resorts in Las Vegas Valley. The Riviera also broke new ground in its design: previously, Strip resorts resembled roadside motor courts. The opening of the Riviera, along with The Dunes and the Royal Nevada casino resorts within a month were the subject of a famous issue of Life magazine, on June 20, 1955 with a Moulin Rouge showgirl on its cover. The headline was \\"Las Vegas‚ÄîIs Boom Overextended?\\" and a story about how Las Vegas had built too many hotel rooms to be profitable. =Bankruptcy and new ownership= The old marquee in 1962, with Debbie Reynolds headlining, and Billy Williams, along with Roberta Linn on the under-billing The Riviera casino went bankrupt just three months after opening. A group of former Flamingo Hotel managers led by Gus Greenbaum took over operation of the property, leasing it from the ownership group. Greenbaum had recently retired, and it was widely suspected that he was coerced to return to work by threats from Chicago mob boss Tony Accardo. Among Greenbaum's staff was entertainment director William Nelson, who was soon discovered to be mob informer Willie Bioff, leading to his murder in November 1955. Greenbaum's drug and gambling addictions led to his embezzling from the casino. In December 1958, Greenbaum and his wife were murdered in their Phoenix, Arizona home, reportedly on the orders of either Meyer Lansky or Tony Accardo.The Encyclopedia of Unsolved Crimes by Michael Newton, Checkmark Books (August 2004) An 8-story expansion was made off the south side of the original 9-story tower in 1959. It was designed by Los Angeles architect Welton Becket. A 12-story tower was added off the south west side of the 8-story tower in 1965. The new tower expansion was designed by Harold W. Levitt with Ernest W. Le Duc and William H. Farwell as consulting architects. Mob fixer Sidney Korshak played a major role in the property's management. Law enforcement agencies suspected that he represented the Chicago Outfit's interest in the Riviera, and was responsible for skimming the casino's revenue and delivering the proceeds to Chicago. The Riviera was purchased in June 1968 by a group including bankers E. Parry Thomas and Jerome Mack, and investors tied to the Parvin-Dohrmann Corp., owner of the Aladdin, Stardust, and Fremont casinos. In 1969, a deal was made to sell the Riviera to the Parvin-Dohrmann Corp., but the sale was blocked by the Nevada Gaming Control Board due to the company's previous failure to report a change of ownership. Dean Martin was hired in 1969 to perform in the casino's showroom, and was given a 10% interest in the Riviera. Martin left in 1972, after management refused his request to cut his performance schedule from two nightly shows to one; the Riviera bought back his shares. In 1973, the Riviera was purchased for $60 million by AITS Inc., a Boston-based travel company controlled by Meshulam Riklis and Isidore Becker. The Riviera is the setting for the movie Fake-Out (aka. Nevada Heat, 1982), which was financed by Riklis and starring his wife, Pia Zadora. The 17 story Monte Carlo Tower was constructed circa 1974. The tower was designed by Martin Stern Jr. & Associates. The 6 story San Remo Tower also a Stern design was constructed in 1977 by the Del E. Webb Corporation. =Expansion (1983‚Äì2009)= The Riviera filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983. Riklis pledged money to keep the business in operation, and appointed Jeffrey Silver as CEO to turn the Riviera around. Silver began shifting the Riviera's marketing focus away from high rollers, and towards middle- and working-class gamblers. He opened a Burger King franchise in the building, the first fast food chain outlet in a casino; this move inspired the phrase \\"Burger King Revolution\\" to refer to the broader trend of Las Vegas casinos catering to middle-class customers. The Riviera underwent an expansion from 1988 to 1990 this included the 24 story Monaco Tower also designed by Martin Stern Jr. and two parking garages. The project went significantly over budget, leading the parent company to file again for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. The business emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 as Riviera Holdings Corp., owned by the previous secured creditors. =2010 bankruptcy= On July 12, 2010, Riviera Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its bankruptcy included a reorganization plan under which secured lenders, led by Starwood Capital Group, would receive new debt and stock. The plan was negotiated with holders of 2/3 of the secured debt worth over $275 million, which included a $225 million term loan, unpaid interest and amounts owing on a swap agreement. Riviera Holdings listed assets and liabilities of $100 to $500 million each. Under the terms of the agreement negotiated by Starwood, secured lenders would receive a new $50 million loan plus 80% of the new stock. Lenders who provide $20 million in a so-called new money loan would receive 8% of the new stock plus warrants for another 10%. Creditors who provide a $10 million working capital loan would receive 7% of the new stock. The last 5% of the new stock goes to the lenders in return for providing a backstop insuring availability for the $30 million in loans. Existing Riviera shareholders received nothing. The Riviera lost $4.5 million on income of $30.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. The decline in popularity of the Riviera was caused in part by the decline of pedestrian foot traffic in the vicinity. Previously, the Riviera was surrounded by the Stardust, New Frontier, and Westward Ho, properties which were demolished to make room for new construction. A shutdown in the new construction in progress at the adjacent Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas and Echelon Place contributed to the Riviera's decline. The company had 1300 employees in Las Vegas and 260 employees in Black Hawk, Colorado. =Closure and demolition (2015‚Äì16)= In February 2015, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority acquired the Riviera hotel and its associated land for $182.5 million. The property was leased back to its existing operators, Paragon Gaming, who officially closed the establishment on Monday, May 4, 2015. After winding down operations the hotel was closed and demolished to make way for a planned expansion of LVCVA's Las Vegas Global Business District exhibit and meeting center project.Las Vegas Sun Due to its size, the Riviera was demolished through two separate implosions conducted in June and August 2016. Work began by gutting the Monaco Tower while the hotel parking garages and the Versailles Theater were demolished - the work took place during the summer. Next came the demolition of the San Remo Tower. Much of the property was demolished during the first implosion. Asbestos was discovered in the hotel's Monte Carlo tower and in the 1960s towers, and was removed prior to the implosion. Demolition cost a total of $42 million. The first implosion took place at 2:35 a.m. (Pacific Time) on June 14, 2016, taking down the 24-story Monaco tower. A firework display and countdown led up to the implosion.http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/32214299/rivieras-first-implosion- brings-down-monaco-towerImplosion 6/14/16 After the implosion of the Monaco Tower, the casino area was demolished followed by the 8 story 1959 tower. The original 9 story tower built in 1955 was demolished next. It was the oldest remaining structure on the Strip. On August 16, 2016 at 2:30 a.m., the Monte Carlo tower along with the 12 story tower constructed in 1965 were imploded.

The Riviera poker room closed in 2013, two years before the remaining gaming operations. In August 2011, the Riviera re-opened its bingo room, in an attempt to bring in new customers and compete against newer resorts on the Strip. At that time, it was the only casino on the Strip to offer bingo.Las Vegas Sun The Riviera also had one of the largest bingo rooms in Las Vegas, and was voted the 'Best Bingo Room' by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The Riviera later launched a marketing partnership with Buffalo Studios, a company that had created a Facebook bingo game titled Bingo Blitz. Beginning in May 2012, the game allowed players to play online bingo on a web page that featured an image of the Riviera, as a marketing move to attract customers. The casino had a sportsbook operated by William Hill. Entertainment Liberace was the featured headliner at the resort's opening, and for many years afterward. In 2006, Splash, a traditional Las Vegas revue created by Jeff Kutash, ended an extended 22-year run at the Riviera. In 2009, An Evening at La Cage, featuring female impersonators including Frank Marino and his impersonation of Joan Rivers, ended one of the longest runs in Strip history. =Crazy Girls= The resort had one long-running show: *Crazy Girls, a topless show. The performers for Crazy Girls, including transgender showgirl Jahna Steele, are immortalized with a bronze sculpture at the front of the casino unveiled in 1997Crazy Girls News with the phrase No \\"Ifs\\", \\"Ands\\" or....

This show has currently relocated to the Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. All of these shows were associate produced and booked by Sam Distefano, the resort's Vice-President of Entertainment and Special Events, who signed George Burns, Bob Hope, Tony Bennett, and Frank Sinatra to a special two-year contract to perform on a recurring basis.\\"Short Takes: Riviera Signs Frank Sinatra\\". Los Angeles Times, September 28, 1990. Accessed December 19, 2015. =Jan Rouven= * Starlight Theater In June 2011 the Starlite Theatre reopened its doors. Mary Wilson of The Supremes was the headliner through July 4, 2011. The Village People and comedian Andrew Dice Clay also headlined the venue. In June 2012 German Illusionist Jan Rouven took over the Starlite Theatre to headline there six nights a week. His show Illusions became one of the most successful shows the Riviera ever had. He became a headliner at The New Tropicana Las Vegas in November 2014, but his show closed 15 months later amid child pornography charges. =Previous acts= *Barbra and Frank: The Concert That Never Was, (Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra impersonators). This show has now moved to the off strip Las Vegas Westin Casuarina. * Dao ‚Äì The Asian Celebration, which according to the Riviera's website offers \\"acrobatics, dance and martial arts in fusion with stunning costumes, exquisite stage design and beautiful music... mind and body in motion\\". * ICE, an ice dancing show featuring Russian skaters; cancelled in November 2009. *Greg London's ICONS *Society of Seven *Pat DiNizio's 'Confessions Of A Rock Star' *Mike Tricarichi Presents Steve-O & Tom Green's 'Icons of Comedy: Original Pranksters Tour' with opening act Tom Garland Pocket billiards (pool) As of 2010, the Riviera had a near-monopoly on championship-level North American and international amateur pool (pocket billiards) tournaments held in the United States, aside from the Florida-based U.S. Amateur Championship. The hotel's convention center hosted the Billiard Congress of America, American Poolplayers Association, Valley National 8-Ball Association and American Cuesports Alliance pool leagues' annual international championships, and various related events. BCA scheduled their 2011 and 2012 amateur championships at the Riviera, as well as the 2011 professional U.S. Open Ten-ball Championship. BCA moved their 2013 events to Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino VNEA announced in May 2010 that their event would move to Bally's, further down the Strip, in 2011. APA held annual events at the Riviera for 23 years up until its closure. In the week prior to the Riviera's close, the APA held their Annual League Operator's Convention as well as their 2015 National Singles Championship. At 7PM on May 3, 2015 APA President Rene√© Lyle and Marketing Director Jason Bowman held an awards ceremony for the APA's 2015 8-Ball Classic - the final event to be held at the Riviera. In popular culture The Riviera was often chosen as a shooting location due to its history and recognition as a landmark. Portions of the following features were filmed at The Riviera: *Ocean's 11 (1960) *Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969) *Diamonds Are Forever (1971) * Butterfly (1982) *Casino (1995) *Showgirls (1995) *Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) *Con Air (1997) *Vegas Vacation (1997) *Go (1999) *3000 Miles to Graceland (2001) *Crazy Girls Undercover (2008) *21 (2008) *The Hangover (2009) *Ghost Adventures (2012, 2016) *Sky (2015) *Jason Bourne (2016) The majority of the television series Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling was shot in the Riviera Hotel during its four- year run and subsequent 1991 pay-per-view. The game show Hollywood Squares also taped its final syndicated season at the Riviera, from 1980-81. There was also a radio booth inside the casino where live telecasts were made featuring various guests. Sports The Riviera was the site of the first boxing match between Larry Holmes and Michael Spinks on September 21, 1985. Spinks won in an upset on a unanimous decision, winning Holmes's International Boxing Federation heavyweight championship, and preventing Holmes from tying Rocky Marciano's undefeated 49‚Äì0 record. In 1994, the Riviera was the host of the practice field for the short lived Las Vegas Posse of the Canadian Football League during the league's brief U.S. expansion . Built on a former parking lot on Riviera property, the Posse practiced on a smaller-than-regulation field (only 70 yards long) where a sign read \\"Field of ImPOSSEable Dreams.\\" The team folded after the 1994 season.

The leader of the congregation is Rabbi Menachem Goldberger. History Rabbi Menachem Goldberger Congregation Tiferes Yisroel was founded in 1986 by twelve families and individuals in Baltimore, who invited Rabbi Menachem Goldberger, a native of Denver, to be their Rabbi. The congregation initially met in a private home, hosting 126 people at their first Rosh Hashanah services; after about nine months, when membership had increased to over 70 families, the congregation purchased what had been the B'nai Akiva building in Baltimore. In 1993 the synagogue bought its present home on Park Heights Avenue, into which it moved in 1994. As of its 25th anniversary in 2011, the congregation numbered 140 families. The congregation is not affiliated with any of the various umbrella Orthodox organizations, but is a Hasidic shtiebel with Haredi leanings. Prayer services are conducted in Nusach Sefard. Goldberger draws his inspiration as a Hasidic rabbi from the teachings of Rabbi Shlomo Twerski, of whom he was a close student. The congregation emphasizes music and singing as a vehicle for religious worship. Goldberger has released a compilation of his own, original religious compositions, called L'cha Dodi. Other areas of specific emphasis are the importance of family, the Land of Israel, and the lifelong goal of Torah study. The congregation welcomes all Jews, especially those who were not raised in the Orthodox Jewish tradition, such as Baalei teshuva or converts to Judaism. In conjunction with the synagogue's 25th anniversary in 2011, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore proclaimed March 13, 2011 as \\"Rabbi Menachem Goldberger Day\\". Bitcoin In May 2013 Tiferes Yisroel became the only American religious institution to accept bitcoin for dues, donations, and other payments. Over a period of nine months, the synagogue collected 1.98 bitcoins, worth approximately $1,253. The congregation stopped accepting bitcoins in March 2014 following the collapse of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange.

The plot is about an adventurer called the Dragon Knight of Palados, who sets on a quest in a South American-like jungle country in order to discover the priceless golden idol statue of Katak, God of Flame, which is hidden in an abandoned pyramid temple deep in the wild. The path there is hazardous enough, with hostile natives, traps, and quicksand to kill unwary travellers, but the Dragon Knight gets a sidekick in the form of a small spider monkey who can guide him around such things. The Dragon Knight has a great evil enemy who covets the idol as well: Damontir the Demented, a mad scientist and archeologist who is a practitioner of black magic. His greatest weapon is the Ring of Ruby Death, which releases a powerful red blast laser ray. Damontir is followed by supernatural henchmen, called the Nightmare Guard. These figures are similar to mystical ninja, wearing black silk outfits and crumbling into yellow dust when slain. Damontir can also call on the undead, in the form of a 'boss fight' with a huge warrior called Thula Doom.

It was one of the sites of the 29 October 2005 Delhi bombings. It is close to Safdarjung Airport, starting 2010, it is serviced by the Sarojini Nagar on the newly constructed underground station on the Pink Line of Delhi Metro.. Overview Prior to the adoption of the name, Sarojini Nagar was called Vinay Nagar and also Beena Nagar, Laxmi Bai Nagar was called East Vinay Nagar and Netaji Nagar was called West Vinay Nagar. Named after the famous woman freedom fighter Sarojini Naidu, this colony is encircled by Safdarjung Enclave, South Extension, Laxmibai Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Chanakyapuri and Netaji Nagar. It is in the vicinity of Chanakyapuri which is home to various embassies and consulates, including those of the United States and Russia. Essentially located in the South West Delhi locality of the city, Sarojini Nagar (or SN as it is sometimes called) is one of the places in the city to buy clothes and fabrics. Apart from a large number of large sized showrooms for various international and local brands, the crux of the market is formed by street side shops which sell garments of all sizes, designs and colors. Recently Sarojini Nagar was in the international news when a small shop was destroyed (and has since been rebuilt) in the Diwali Delhi blasts on 29/10/05 Delhi bombings. The market which is surrounded by government housing has the following sections, as locals call them. 90% of the shops in SN are family- owned. Babu Market is located at the north-west corner of Sarojini Nagar Market. It has four rows of enclosed shops facing each other. Most of the shops are garment and clothes shops. The first shop on the corner of Sarojini Nagar which faces the north-east of Babu Market is Mahindra Sweets. This shop is outside the enclosed area of Babu Market. More famously known as Mucchal Halwayi ki Dukaan. A name was given to this shop because its owner had big moustaches. After his demise, his children have taken over the business. On rainy days or during evenings crowds line up in front of this shop to buy hot Samosas and Jalebi. This shop is followed by steel utensil shops which draw large crowds during Dhan-teras. On the north-west corner of the market, the first shop is a shoe shop. This used to be a bakery and general store till the early 1990s. Most of the shops that are enclosed in rows facing each other are garment shops. Shopping here becomes a challenge during the Summer time when temperatures get into 45 to 48 ¬∞C (116 ¬∞F). G, H, and I are the nearest Residential block to Babu Market. During evenings, the section of the market that faces the central market lights up with hundreds of street vendors, popcorn vendors, and other small street sellers who usually carry a small kerosene gas lamp on their carts. There is also a CGHS dispensary just opposite to Babpu Market where government employees can get a free checkup from a 24-hour available doctor. Like any other section of the market, parking is a big problem in Babu Market, especially during evenings. The far south end of the Sarojini Nagar market is Subzi Market. Subzi is the common Hindi word for vegetables in North India. This Subzi market is known for its fresh vegetables in South West Delhi. The vegetable vendors shout at the top of their voice to attract customers to their stalls. Some of these vendors get creative with the calls and rhyme them in a comic way. Subzi market is also the best place to get freshest fruits in South West Delhi at a reasonable price. Customers can bargain with vendors when buying large quantities of fruits or vegetables. There is a parking lot right behind the market facing the Government Girls Senior Secondary School No. 1. Facing Subzi market is a section of Central Market. Till the early 1990s the corner-most shop of the western end of this market used to be a Sweets Shop. After the father‚Äôs demise, the younger generation converted this into a garment shop. Right outside this shop however, a traditional Tikki and Kulfi vendor continues to sell Tikki and Kulfi. The large central market is shaped like a horizontally extended \\"I\\" or \\"][\\". Layout of the market is unique wherein visitors move around in a circle without realizing so. People who get lost sometimes find it hard to believe that by keep going on they will reach the starting point of their trip. Shops are lined up in rows and there is a newly constructed open- air path-way in front of the shops for customers to move through the crowds to get into each shop. These pathways are also largely occupied by illegal street vendors. Shops have a front opening and a back opening. The back-streets (galiyan) of SN market are just as crowded and busy as the path-ways in front of the shops. On one side of the central market, there are bakery shops. The export lane compromises of great bags store which keeps all kind of leather and non-leather bags. The North side of central SN market mostly has footwear shops. There are also a few leather belt vendors who occupy the space near the large arches where you may still see the decades-old sign \\"SAROJINI NAGAR\\". Some of the letters in this sign were already missing and maybe as it stands today, these letters may not even be there. Sarojini Nagar was also a hot bed of BJP, RSS and VHP activities. The annual dussera festival is still celebrated with the nine days of Ram-Lila followed by Ravan Dahan. In early 1980s and 1990s RSS Svayam Sevaks (activists) could be seen holding Shakhas (daily gatherings) in their uniquely recognizable short-pants and white shirts. Some of the parks in the surrounding area are named after freedom fighters and religious leaders such as Swami Vivekanand Park. In the late 1970s or 1980s, this park was also called the Fountain Garden or (Hindi: Fuarey wala park), since it had water fountains and lights that would attract local visitors and kids during evening hours. The park got renovated and landscaped around 2007 and provides respite to tired shopaholics/joggers/residents. The Sarojini Market remains closed on Mondays. Sarojini Nagar Market opens up around 11 A.M. and shut down around 8 or 9 P.M.http://www.kahajaun.com/delhi/shopping-fashion/144/sarojini-nagar-market- cheap-and-best-shopping-destination-in-delhi/ Sarojini Nagar is a place that is located in the south-west district of Delhi state in India. Known for its Delhi Development Authority (DDA) flats and also, as a shopping paradise for many, Sarojini Nagar will soon be known for a revamped look, too. The locality is among the few old localities of South Delhi that are undergoing redevelopment plan set by National Building Construction Company (NBCC) and the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD). The colony will be redeveloped with a modernised residential building designed in compliance with the fire safety standards, green norms and utilising maximum land resources.

The set of urban rail systems can be roughly subdivided into the following categories, which sometimes overlap because some systems or lines have aspects of multiple types. Urban rail transit types =Tram= The Toronto streetcar system is an extensive tram network A tram, streetcar, or trolley system is a rail-based transit system that runs mainly or completely along streets (i.e. with street running), with a relatively low capacity and frequent stops. Passengers usually board at street- or curb-level, although low-floor trams may allow level boarding. Longer-distance lines are called interurbans or radial railways. Few interurbans remain, most having been upgraded to commuter rail or light rail or abandoned. The term \\"tram\\" is used in most parts of the world. In North America, these systems are referred to as \\"streetcar\\" or \\"trolley\\" systems; in Germany, such systems are called \\"Stra√üenbahn\\" which literally translates as \\"street train\\" or \\"street railway\\". =Light rail= A light rail system is a rail-based transit system that has higher capacity and speed than a tram, usually by operating in an exclusive right-of-way separated from automobile traffic, but which is not fully grade-separated from other traffic like rapid transit is. Light rail also generally operates with multiple unit trains rather than single tramcars. It emerged as an evolution of trams/streetcars. Light rail systems vary significantly in terms of speed and capacity. They range from slightly improved tram systems to systems that are essentially rapid transit but with some level crossings. The term \\"light rail\\" is the most common term used, though German systems are called \\"Stadtbahn\\" (which translates to \\"city railway\\"). =Rapid transit= The Hong Kong MTR operates a high capacity rapid transit network. A rapid transit system is a railway‚Äîusually in an urban area‚Äîwith high passenger capacities and frequency of service, and (usually) full grade separation from other traffic (including other rail traffic). It is often known as \\"heavy rail\\" to distinguish it from light rail and bus rapid transit. In most parts of the world these systems are known as a \\"metro\\" which is short for \\"metropolitan\\". The term \\"subway\\" is used in many American systems as well as in Glasgow and Toronto. The system in London is named the \\"Underground\\", and commonly nicknamed the \\"tube\\". Systems in Germany are called \\"U-Bahn\\", which stands for \\"Untergrundbahn\\" (underground track). Many systems in East and Southeast Asia such as Taipei, Chennai and Singapore are called MRT which stands for \\"mass rapid transit\\". Systems which are predominantly elevated may be referred to as \\"L\\" as in Chicago or \\"Skytrain\\", as in Bangkok and Vancouver. Other less common names include \\"T-bane\\" (in Scandinavia) and \\"MTR\\". =Monorail= A monorail is a railway in which the track consists of a single rail, as opposed to the traditional track with two parallel rails. =Commuter rail= A Sydney Trains A set. Sydney Trains operates a large commuter network throughout Sydney. A commuter rail, regional rail, or suburban rail system operates on mainline trackage which may be shared with intercity rail and freight trains. Systems tend to operate at lower frequencies than rapid transit or light rail systems, but tend to travel at higher speeds, have more widely spaced stations, and cover longer overall distances. Though many European and East Asian commuter rail systems operate with frequencies and rolling stock similar to that of rapid transit, they do not qualify as such because they share tracks with intercity/freight trains or have at grade crossings. For example, S-trains are hybrid systems combining the characteristics of rapid transit and commuter rail systems. Generally S-trains share tracks with mainline passenger and freight trains but distances between stations and service headway resemble Metro systems. =Funicular= A funicular is a cable-driven inclined railway that uses the weight of descending cars to help pull the ascending cars up the slope. =Cable car= A cable car in the context of mass transit is a system using rail cars that are hauled by a continuously moving cable running at a constant speed. Individual cars stop and start by releasing and gripping this cable as required. Cable cars are distinct from funiculars, where the cars are permanently attached to the cable and cable railways, which are similar to funiculars, but the rail vehicles are attached and detached manually. =Classification issues= Shanghai Metro Line 5 is a rapid transit line erroneously referred to as light rail Transit agencies' names for lines do not necessarily reflect their technical categorization. For example, Boston's Green Line is referred to as a subway, despite having street-running portions. Conversely, the Docklands Light Railway in London, Green Line in Los Angeles and some metro lines in China are referred to as \\"Light Rail\\" even though they qualify as rapid transit because they are fully grade-separated and provide a high frequency of service. Many cities use names such as subway and elevated railway to describe their entire systems, even when they combine both methods of operation. Slightly less than half of the London Underground's tracks, for example, are actually underground; New York City's subway also combines elevated and subterranean stations, while the Chicago 'L' and Vancouver SkyTrain use tunnels to run through central areas. =Other types of services= Guided bus rail-guided bus in Nancy, France A bus shares many characteristics with light rail and trams, but does not run on rails. Trolleybuses are buses that are powered from overhead wires. Vehicles that can travel both on rails and on roads have been tried experimentally, but are not in common use. The term bus rapid transit is used to refer to various methods of providing faster bus services and the systems which use it have similar characteristics to light rail. Some cities experimenting with guided bus technologies, such as Nancy, have chosen to refer to them as 'trams on tyres' (rubber tyred trams) and given them tram-like appearances. =AGT= Economics of rail transit Luz Station in S√£o Paulo, Brazil In a 2006 article, political scientist Ted Balaker and urban planner Cecilia Juong Kim say that public rail transit provides certain benefits for a community, but also say the goals of policymakers are not often met. They also say some American economists claim that, contrary to popular belief, rail transit has failed to improve the environment, serve the poor, or reduce highway congestion in the United States. They also say economists are somewhat more optimistic about rail transit's impact on economic development.

Etymology Dhoby Ghaut or Dhobi Ghat (, IAST: Dhobƒ´ GhƒÅ·π≠) literally means washerman's place in Hindi, from dhobi, \\"washerman\\" or one that does laundry, and ghat, referring to a series of steps leading down to a body of water, as in the case of the Varanasi ghats by the Ganges. The Hindi term ghat passed into English usage during the British occupation of India, and was later anglicised to ghaut. Early history Until the early 1900s, the dhobis used water from a clear stream that flowed into Sungai Bras Basah, now Stamford Canal. This stream now exists as a large drain beside Handy Road. The ghats, or steps leading down to the stream, were demolished when Sungai Bras Basah was canalised. The dhobis would then dry the laundry at Dhoby Green, the open park bounded by Stamford Road, Handy Road, Bras Basah Road and Prinsep Street.

His research interests include the interstellar medium, infrared astronomy, light scattering theory, applications of solid-state physics to astronomy, the early Solar System, comets, astrochemistry, the origin of life and astrobiology. A student and collaborator of Fred Hoyle, the pair worked jointly for over 40 years as influential proponents of panspermia. In 1974 they proposed the hypothesis that some dust in interstellar space was largely organic, later proven to be correct.Wickramasinghe, D. T. & Allen, D. A. The 3.4-¬µm interstellar absorption feature. Nature 287, 518‚àí519 (1980).Allen, D. A. & Wickramasinghe, D. T. Diffuse interstellar absorption bands between 2.9 and 4.0 ¬µm.

Hoyle and Wickramasinghe have advanced the argument that various outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease. For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesised that cometary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations‚Äîa view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. Claims connecting terrestrial disease and extraterrestrial pathogens have been rejected by the scientific community. Wickramasinghe has written more than 30 books about astrophysics and related topics; he has made appearances on radio, television and film, and he writes online blogs and articles. He has appeared on BBC Horizon, UK Channel 5 and the History Channel. He appeared on the 2013 Discovery Channel program \\"Red Rain\\". He has an association with Daisaku Ikeda, president of the Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai International, that led to the publication of a dialogue with him, first in Japanese and later in English, on the topic of Space and Eternal Life. Education and career Wickramasinghe studied at Royal College, Colombo, the University of Ceylon (where he graduated in 1960 with a BSc First Class Honours in mathematics), and at Trinity College and Jesus College, Cambridge, where he obtained his PhD and ScD degrees. Following his education, Wickramasinghe was a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge from 1963 to 1973, until he became professor of applied mathematics and astronomy at University College Cardiff. Wickramasinghe was a consultant and advisor to the President of Sri Lanka from 1982 to 1984, and played a key role in founding the Institute of Fundamental Studies in Sri Lanka. After fifteen years at University College Cardiff, Wickramasinghe took an equivalent position in the University of Cardiff, a post he held from 1990 until 2006. After retirement in 2006, he incubated the Cardiff Center for Astrobiology as a special project reporting to the President of the University. In 2011 the project closed down, losing its funding in a series of UK educational cut backs. After this event, Wickramasinghe was offered the opportunity to move to the University of Buckingham as Director of the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology, University of Buckingham where he has been since 2011. He maintains his part-time position as a UK Professor at Cardiff University. In 2015 he was elected Visiting scholar, Churchill College, Cambridge, England 2015/16. He is a co- founder and Board member of the Institute for the Study of Panspermia and Astroeconomics, set up in Japan in 2014,ISPA - About us . and the Editor-in- Chief of the Journal of Astrobiology & Outreach. He was a Visiting By-Fellow, Churchill College, Cambridge, England 2015/16; Professor and Director of the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology at the University of Buckingham, a post he has held since 2011; Affiliated Visiting Professor, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; and a Board Member and Research Director at the Institute for the Study of Panspermia and Astroeconomics, Ogaki-City, Gifu, Japan. In 2017, Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe was appointed Adjunct Professor in the Department of Physics, at the University of Ruhuna, Matara, Sri Lanka. Research In 1960 he commenced work in Cambridge on his PhD degree under the supervision of Fred Hoyle, and published his first scientific paper \\"On Graphite Particles as Interstellar Grains‚Äù in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1962. He was awarded a PhD degree in Mathematics in 1963 and was elected a Fellow of Jesus College Cambridge in the same year. In the following year he was appointed a Staff Member of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. Here he continued to work on the nature of interstellar dust, publishing many papers in this field, that led to a consideration of carbon-containing grains as well as the older silicate models. Wickramasinghe published the first definitive book on Interstellar Grains in 1967. He has made many contributions to this field, publishing over 350 papers in peer- reviewed journals, over 75 of which are in Nature. Hoyle and Wickramasinghe further proposed a radical kind of panspermia that included the claim that extraterrestrial life forms enter the Earth's atmosphere and were possibly responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and genetic novelty that Hoyle and Wickramasinghe contended was necessary for macroevolution. Chandra Wickramasinghe had the longest-running collaboration with Fred Hoyle. Their publications on books and papers arguing for panspermia and a cosmic hypothesis of life are controversial and, in particular detail, essentially contra the scientific consensus in both astrophysics and biology. Several claims made by Hoyle and Wickramasinghe between 1977 and 1981, such as a report of having detected interstellar cellulose, were criticised by one author as pseudoscience. =Organic molecules in space= In 1974 Wickramasinghe first proposed the hypothesis that some dust in interstellar space was largely organic,Nature, vol: 252, 462, 1974; and Nature, Vol 268, 610, 1977. and followed this up with other research confirming the hypothesis.Wickramasinghe, D. T. & Allen, D. A. The 3.4-¬µm interstellar absorption feature. Nature 287, 518‚àí519 (1980). Allen, D. A. & Wickramasinghe, D. T. Diffuse interstellar absorption bands between 2.9 and 4.0 ¬µm.

Wickramasinghe also proposed and confirmed the existence of polymeric compounds based on the molecule formaldehyde (H2CO).N.C. Wickramasinghe, Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space, Nature, 252, 462, 1974 Fred Hoyle and Wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175A.,F. Hoyle and N.C. Wickramasinghe, Identification of the lambda 2200A interstellar absorption feature, Nature, 270, 323, 1977 thus demonstrating the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space. =Hoyle- Wickramasinghe model of panspermia= Throughout his career, Wickramasinghe, along with his collaborator Fred Hoyle, has advanced the panspermia hypothesis, that proposes that life on Earth is, at least in part, of extraterrestrial origin. The Hoyle-Wickramasinghe model of panspermia include the assumptions that dormant viruses and desiccated DNA and RNA can survive unprotected in space; that small bodies such as asteroids and comets can protect the \\"seeds of life\\", including DNA and RNA, living, fossilized, or dormant life, cellular or non-cellular; and that the collisions of asteroids, comets, and moons have the potential to spread these \\"seeds of life\\" throughout an individual star system and then onward to others. The most contentious issue around the Hoyle-Wickramasinghe model of the panspermia hypothesis is the corollary of their first two propositions that viruses and bacteria continue to enter the Earth's atmosphere from space, and are hence responsible for many major epidemics throughout history. Towards the end of their collaboration, Wickramasinghe and Hoyle hypothesised that abiogenesis occurred close to the Galactic Center before panspermia carried life throughout the Milky Way, and stated a belief that such a process could occur in many galaxies throughout the Universe. Scientists in North America, Europe, Russia, and Japan are testing many aspects of panspermia. (Further information at Panspermia#Research in outer space.) =Detection of living cells in the stratosphere= An image of a clump of microorganisms from 41 km fluorescing on application of a carbocyanine dye (indicating viability) is shown in the left panel, and scanning electron microscope image of a similar clump is shown on the right panel. On 20 January 2001 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) conducted a balloon flight from Hyderabad, India to collect stratospheric dust from a height of 41 km (135,000 ft) with a view to testing for the presence of living cells. The collaborators on this project included a team of UK scientists led by Wickramasinghe. In a paper presented at a SPIE conference in San Diego in 2002 the detection of evidence for viable microorganisms from 41 km above the Earth's surface was presented. However, the experiment did not present evidence as to whether the findings are incoming microbes from space rather than microbes carried up to 41 km from the surface of the Earth. In 2005 the ISRO group carried out a second stratospheric sampling experiment from 41 km altitude and reported the isolation of three new species of bacteria including one that they named Janibacter hoylei sp.nov. in honour of Fred Hoyle. However, these facts do not prove that bacteria on Earth originated in the cosmic environment. Samplings of the stratosphere have also been carried out by Yang et al. (2005,Yang, Y., Yokobori, S., Kawaguchi, J., et al., 2005. Investigation of cultivable microorganisms in the stratosphere collected by using a balloon in 2005, JAXA Research Development Report, JAXA-RR-08-001, 35-42 2009). During the experiment strains of highly radiation-resistant Deinococcus bacterium were detected at heights up to 35 km. Nevertheless, these authors have abstained from linking these discoveries to panspermia. Wickramasinghe was also involved in coordinating analyses of the red rain in Kerala in collaborations with Godfrey Louis.Red rain in Kerala =Extraterrestrial pathogens= Hoyle and Wickramasinghe have advanced the argument that various outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease. For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesised that cometary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations‚Äîa view almost universally dismissed by external experts on this pandemic. On 24 May 2003 The Lancet published a letter from Wickramasinghe, jointly signed by Milton Wainwright and Jayant Narlikar, in which they hypothesised that the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin instead of originating from chickens. The Lancet subsequently published three responses to this letter, showing that the hypothesis was not evidence-based, and casting doubts on the quality of the experiments referenced by Wickramasinghe in his letter. Claims connecting terrestrial disease and extraterrestrial pathogens have been rejected by the scientific community. Wickramasinghe suggests that the 2019 coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, came from outer space. He says: > The sudden outbreak of a new coronavirus is very likely to have a space > connection, the strong localisation of the virus within China is the most > remarkable aspect of the disease. In October last year a fragment of a comet > exploded in a brief flash in North East China. We think it probable that > this contained embedded within it a monoculture of infective 2019-nCoV virus > particles that survived in the interior of the incandescent meteor. We > consider the seemingly outrageous possibility that hundreds of trillions of > infective viral particles were then released embedded in the form of fine > carbonaceous dust. We believe infectious agents are prevalent in space, > carried on comets, and can fall towards Earth through the troposphere. > These, we think, can and have in the past gone on to bring about human > disease epidemics. =Polonnaruwa= On 29 December 2012 a green fireball was observed in Polonnaruwa Province, Sri Lanka. It disintegrated into fragments that fell to the Earth near the villages of Aralaganwila and Dimbulagala and in a rice field near Dalukkane. Rock samples were submitted to the Medical Research Institute of the Ministry of Health in Colombo. The rocks were sent to the University of Cardiff in Wales for analysis, where Chandra Wickramasinghe's team analyzed them and claimed that they contained extraterrestrial diatoms. From January to March 2013, five papers were published in the fringe Journal of Cosmology outlining various results from teams in the United Kingdom, United States and Germany. However, independent experts in meteoritics stated that the object analyzed by Wickramasinghe's team was of terrestrial origin, a fulgurite created by lightning strikes on Earth. Experts in diatoms complemented the statement, saying that the organisms found in the rock represented a wide range of extant terrestrial taxa, confirming their earthly origin. Wickramasinghe and collaborators responded, using X-ray diffraction, oxygen isotope analysis, and scanning electron microscope observations, in a March 2013 paper asserting that the rocks they found were indeed meteorites, instead of being created by lightning strikes on Earth as stated by scientists from the University of Peradeniya. Participation in the creation-evolution debate Wickramasinghe and his mentor Fred Hoyle have also used their data to argue in favor of cosmic ancestry,Creationism versus Darwinism.

IBLP was established by Bill Gothard for the purpose of resolving youth and family conflicts. IBLP's stated purpose is to provide instruction on how to find success in life by following biblical principles. It is a non-profit tax-exempt religious or charitable organization as defined by the IRS. History The organization changed its name to Institute in Basic Youth Conflicts (IBYC) in 1974, and adopted its current name in 1989 (to reflect its expansion beyond traditional teenage issues). IBLP started promoting Basic Youth Conflicts seminars in areas around the United States and other nations, which according to its own history, during the 1970s had attendances of up to 20,000 persons. IBLP's programs have keys services, which include seminars for ministry, community outreach, troubled youth mentoring, and an international ministry. They all deal with education and contributing to the community. According to the IBLP, many of the ministry's workers have received (and continue to receive) Presidential medals for their work in helping the community in various ways. In 2006, IBLP was reported to earn (equivalent to about $M in ) annually.Silja J.A. Talvi \\"Cult of Character\\" In These Times January 9, 2006 By 2009 to 2012 the Institute in Basic Life Principles began a steady decline, losing money, assets, and greatly decreasing the number of annual seminars it conducted, while the public became increasingly aware of controversy (more specifically, allegations of sexual misconduct) associated with IBLP.  Controversy  A number of former adherents of IBLP programmes have described the organization and/or associated circles as a cult. Don Veinot, president of Midwest Christian Outreach, says that the charismatic leader, authoritarian control, isolation of members, severe punishments, and demand for absolute and blind loyalty add up to IBLP being \\"cult-like\\". In the 1980s, the organization faced \\"a major sex scandal\\" when Gothard's brother, Steve Gothard, resigned as administrative director after having affairs with several secretaries of the institute.\\" In 2014, Bill Gothard resigned as President of IBLP after reports that he had sexually harassed multiple women and failed to report allegations of child abuse in the organization. Gothard allegedly selected young women for administrative positions within the organization, then manipulated and harassed them while in his employment, several of whose stories were featured on the website of Recovering Grace, a website and Christian ministry that functions as a support group for former students and members of IBLP. An investigation into the allegations by the IBLP concluded he \\"acted inappropriately,\\" but \\"not criminally.\\" On October 20, 2015, a civil lawsuit alleging a sex-abuse cover-up involving several minors was filed in DuPage County, Illinois against IBLP and its board of directors. Gretchen Wilkinson et al. vs. Institute in Basic Life Principles and William W. Gothard Jr. was brought on behalf of five female plaintiffs in order to \\"seek redress and damages for personal injuries based on the negligent and willful and wanton acts and omissions of the defendants with regard to sexual abuse and sexual harassment and similar allegations of malfeasance suffered by the plaintiffs.\\" \\"Besides monetary damages, they have asked a DuPage County judge to bar IBLP leaders from alleged plans to liquidate resources estimated at more than $100 million while they close the institute's headquarters near Oak Brook and relocate to Texas, the lawsuit states.\\" Five additional accusers joined the suit in January 2016, and even more in February 2016, bringing the grand total of complainants to 16 women and two men. The case was voluntarily dismissed on February 26, 2018. Programs =Seminars= *Basic Seminar‚ÄîThe introduction to the basic teachings of Gothard and IBLP. The seminar is 32 hours in length, typically held over a period of six days.

The powder keg of Europe or Balkan powder keg was the Balkans in the early part of the 20th century preceding World War I. There were a number of overlapping claims to territories and spheres of influence between the major European powers such as the Russian Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the German Empire and, to a lesser degree, the Ottoman Empire, the United Kingdom and Kingdom of Italy. In addition to the imperialistic ambitions and interests in this region, there was a growth in nationalism with the indigenous peoples of this region leading to the formation of the independent states of Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania.  Background   Irredentism in the Balkans and the Great Powers  Within these nations, there were movements to create \\"greater\\" nations, which is to enlarge the boundaries of the state beyond those areas where the national ethnic group was in the majority (irredentism). This led to conflict between the newly independent nations and the empire from which they split, the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, it led to differences between the Balkan nations who wished to gain territory at the expense of their neighbors. Both the conflict with the Ottoman Empire and between the Balkan nations led to the Balkan Wars in 1912‚Äì13. In a different vein, the ideology of Pan-Slavism in Balkans gained popularity; the movement built around it in the region sought to unite all of the Slavs of the Balkans into one nation, Yugoslavia. This, however, would require the union of several Balkan states and territory which was part of Austria-Hungary. For this reason, Pan-Slavism was strongly opposed by Austria- Hungary, while it was supported by Russia which viewed itself as leader of all Slavic nations. To complicate matters, in the years preceding World War I, there existed a tangle of Great Power alliances, both formal and informal, public and secret. Following the Napoleonic Wars there had existed a \\"balance of power\\" to, in theory, prevent major wars. This theory held that opposing combinations of powers in Europe would be evenly matched entailing that any general war would be far too costly for any nation to risk entering. This system began to fall apart as the Ottoman Empire which had been seen as a check on Russian power began to crumble, and as Germany, which had been a loose confederation of minor states, was united into a major power. Not only did these changes lead to a realignment of power, but of interests as well. All these factors, and many others, conspired to bring about the First World War. As is insinuated by the name \\"the powder keg of Europe,\\" the Balkans were not the major issue at stake in the war, but were merely the catalyst that led to the conflagration. The Chancellor of Germany in the late 19th century, Otto von Bismarck, correctly predicted it would be the source of major conflict in Europe. The powder keg \\"exploded\\" causing the First World War, which began with a conflict between imperial Austria-Hungary and Pan-Slavic Serbia. Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, a member of the Austrian royal family, was assassinated by a Bosnian of Serb extraction, a member of the Young Bosnia movement. Austria-Hungary then issued an ultimatum to Serbia intended to provoke it to war through extreme demands. The Serbian government reservedly accepted all of the conditions of the ultimatum, except for condition number six which demanded the inclusion of Austria-Hungary in Serbia's judicial inquiry into the assassination. Serbia indicated this would be unconstitutional and a violation of its sovereignty and Austria-Hungary used it as a casus belli to invade Serbia. With Germany fully supporting them, the Austro-Hungarians partially mobilized their army against Serbia, which had already begun mobilizing before replying to the Austro-Hungarian July Ultimatum. Russia then began mobilizing in support of Serbia, though not bound by treaty to do so. Due to the system of European alliances, this led to a series of escalating Austrian and Russian mobilizations and eventually Britain and France were also obliged to mobilize and declare war.

In common with most politicians of his era, McIlwraith was an influential businessman, who combined his parliamentary career with a prosperous involvement in the pastoral industry. Early life Thomas McIlwraith was born in Ayr, Scotland in 1835, one of four sons of John McIlwraith, plumber and shipowner, and his wife Janet Hamilton n√©e Howat. His eldest brother, John (1828‚Äì1902), migrated to Victoria in 1853; his youngest brother, Andrew (1844‚Äì1932), co-founded McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co in London with Malcolm McEacharn. J.

They had three daughters, Jessie (b. 1866), Mary (b. 1868) and Blanche (b. 1872). He eventually moved to Queensland, but Margaret was reluctant to live in isolated Merivale station. In 1871 she visited Merivale, but soon returned to Melbourne for Blanche's birth. In 1874 they decided to live in Brisbane. Thomas found that she was drinking heavily, and sent her to Scotland where she died in 1877. McIlwraith fathered an illegitimate daughter in Victoria. In 1877 McIlwraith was a founding partner of the North Australian Pastoral Company. In 1879 he married Harriette Ann n√©e Mosman. Harriette was the sister of Hugh Mosman, who discovered gold in Charters Towers, and Cecilia Mosman, wife of his political colleague Arthur Palmer (also Premier of Queensland);J. X.

Parliamentary career While working for J V A Bruce, he represented his employers in a dispute with the Victorian government, and attracted public attention. In 1864 he contested the Sandhurst seat in the Victorian Legislative Assembly but won few votes as a free trader. McIlwraith was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the seat of Maranoa in 1868. He joined the ministry of Arthur Macalister in January 1874 becoming Secretary for Public Works and Mines. He resigned from these posts in October of that year. The government of John Douglas was defeated in 1879 after a series of severe droughts and McIlwraith became premier for the first time. He quickly worked to ameliorate the colony's finances and with the assistance of a return of agricultural prosperity he turned the budget deficit into a surplus. Queensland at this stage was seeing increasing numbers of immigrants and McIlwraith oversaw the colony's economic development. The McIlwraith government introduced the divisional system of local government to the larger part of Queensland and assisted in establishing a postal service through the Torres Strait Islands. In 1882 he was knighted. The Australian colonies were extremely anxious about German colonial activities in the region, it became clear that the German government was planning to annex eastern New Guinea, to Queensland's north. McIlwraith took the extraordinary step of attempting to annex New Guinea for Queensland; he employed Henry Chester to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty which occurred on 4 April 1883. This was later disallowed by the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Derby on the basis that a colonial government had no authority to annex other colonies. Yet it was at the same time suggested that the British government expedite the annexation of New Guinea if the Australian colonies would combine to finance the venture. This was then instrumental in the gathering of an Intercolonial Convention in November and December 1883, with federation and annexation on its agenda. It was the first step to unite the Australian colonies in a federation movement. The result was that orders were finally given to establish British New Guinea, as a protectorate on the southern coast of eastern coast of New Guinea on 6 November 1884. However, well informed the German Navy had secretly landed annexing the northern coast under the name ‚ÄòKaiser-Wilhelmsland‚Äô three days earlier. But the news about German New Guinea was successfully kept a secret until finally the news finally broke on 22 December that year.Brisbane Courier 15 November 1884 page 4&5 & Brisbane Courier 23 Dec 1884, page 4. In 1883 a government proposal to raise funds for the construction of a transcontinental railway line by a system of land grants was attacked for corruption in allocation of grants. McIlwraith lost office to his rival, Samuel Griffith, in November and retired from politics in 1886. McIlwraith returned to the Parliament in 1888, this time as member for North Brisbane. His party won a majority in the elections and he again became Premier and Treasurer. He came into conflict with the colony's Governor, Sir Anthony Musgrave over the exercise of the royal pardon. Musgrave died in October and McIlwraith petitioned the new Colonial Secretary Lord Knutsford, to allow the Queensland government to be consulted on the choice of governor. Knutsford refused and appointed Sir Harry Blake, however, the local legislature problematically declined to ratify the appointment. In November of that year ill-health forced him to resign in favour of Boyd Dunlop Morehead, whereupon McIlwraith travelled to China and Japan. After his return, McIlwraith's relationship with his colleagues had deteriorated, and in August 1890 he formed an alliance (later known as the \\"Continuous Ministry\\") with his erstwhile foe to become Treasurer in the government of Sir Samuel Griffith. In March 1893 Griffith stepped down to join the Supreme Court of Queensland and McIlwraith became Premier again. His health was still poor and in October he resigned in favour of Hugh Nelson, contenting himself with the cabinet position of Chief Secretary and secretary for railways until 29 March 1895.

He was rugged and masterful, possibly on occasions not over-scrupulous, with a habit of getting his own way by sheer force of character rather than by intellectual ability. For nearly 25 years he was one of the greatest personalities in Queensland. After politics Since 1888 the London directors of McIlwraith's Queensland Investment and Land Mortgage Co. had complained about the practices of the local board, and in 1892 they charged McIlwraith, Palmer and two others with fraud. The remaining years of his life were surrounded in financial scandal and large financial losses by institutions that he was involved with. Although McIlwraith left for England on 15 January 1895, he was still a minister of the Queensland cabinet until 25 November 1897 when the Labor Party with government support succeeded in passing a resolution that he should retire. On 9 December he resigned from the Executive Council. McIlwraith died in London on 17 July 1900 and was buried at Ayr.

Kidd, who died on the bridge of his flagship during the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Admiral Kidd was the first US flag officer to die during World War II, and the first American admiral ever to be killed in action. A National Historic Landmark, she is now a museum ship, berthed on the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is the only surviving US destroyer still in her World War II configuration. World War II Kidd (DD-661) was launched on 28 February 1943 by Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., Kearny, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. Isaac C. Kidd, widow of Rear Admiral Kidd. The destroyer was commissioned on 23 April 1943, Commander Allan Roby in command. During her initial cruise to the Brooklyn Naval Shipyards, she sailed across New York Harbor with the Jolly Roger flying from the foremast. Subsequently, during outfitting, her crew adopted the pirate captain William Kidd as their mascot, and commissioned a local artist to paint a pirate figure on the forward smokestack. After shakedown out of Casco Bay, Maine in June, Kidd cruised in the Atlantic and Caribbean escorting large combatant vessels until she departed for the Pacific in August 1943 in company with the battleships and . Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 17 September 1943, she got underway on 29 September escorting aircraft carriers toward Wake Island for the heavy air attacks conducted on October 6 on Japanese installations located there, returning to Pearl Harbor on October 11, 1943. Mid-October Kidd was underway with a task force to strike Rabaul and support the Bougainville landings. Upon reaching a strike position south of Rabaul on the morning of 11 November, the task force launched attacks upon Japanese positions on the island. Kidd was ordered to rescue the crew of an aircraft from which had ditched astern of the formation. During this rescue, a group of Japanese aircraft attacked the destroyer; Kidd shot down three attacking aircraft and completed the rescue while maneuvering to dodge torpedoes and bombs. Cmdr. Roby, her commanding officer, received the Silver Star for gallantry during this action. The destroyer returned to Espiritu Santo on 13 November. Kidd next screened carriers making air attacks on Tarawa during the Gilbert Islands invasion from 19 to 23 November. On 24 November, she spotted 15 low flying enemy bombers heading toward the heavy ships, gave warning, and shot down two Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers. After Tarawa was secure, Kidd remained in the Gilbert Islands to support cleanup operations before returning to Pearl Harbor 9 December. On 11 January 1944 Kidd sailed for the forward area at Espiritu Santo, then sailed the next day for Funafuti, arriving 19 January. During the invasion of the Marshall Islands 29 January to 8 February, Kidd screened heavy ships and bombarded Roi and Wotje, then anchored at Kwajalein 26 February. Kidd off Roi island on 12 June 1944 From 20 March to 14 April, Kidd guarded an airstrip under construction on Emirau and supported the occupation of Aitape and Hollandia in New Guinea 16 April to 7 May. She fought in the Marianas campaign 10 June to 8 July, and performed shore bombardment at Guam between 8 July and 10 August. In need of repairs, Kidd sailed for Pearl Harbor, arriving 26 August 1944. On 15 September, she departed Pearl, reached Eniwetok 26 September, and arrived at Manus on 3 October. There she became part of the giant Philippines invasion fleet and entered Leyte Gulf 20 October. Here, she screened the initial landings and provided fire support for soldiers who fought to reconquer the island until she sailed 14 November for Humboldt Bay, New Guinea, arriving 19 November. On 9 December Kidd headed toward Mare Island Navy Yard for overhaul and moored at Mare Island on Christmas Day. Kidd sailed 19 February 1945, to join Task Force 58 (TF 58) for the invasion of Okinawa. Trained and battle wise, Kidd played a key role during the first days of the Okinawa campaign, screening battleships, bombarding shore targets, rescuing downed pilots, sinking floating mines, providing early warning of raids, guarding the heavily-damaged aircraft carrier , and helping to shoot down kamikazes. While on picket station 11 April 1945, Kidd and her division mates, , , and , with the help of Combat Air Patrol, repelled three air raids. That afternoon, a single enemy plane crashed into Kidd, killing 38 men and wounding 55. As the destroyer headed south to rejoin the task group, her fire drove off further enemy planes that were trying to finish her off. Stopping at Ulithi for temporary repairs, she got underway on 2 May for the West Coast, arriving at Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard on 25 May. On 1 August 1945, Kidd sailed to Pearl Harbor and returned to San Diego, California 24 September 1945 for inactivation. She decommissioned 10 December 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Korean War USS Kidd dropping depth charges When North Korea attacked South Korea, the United States called up a portion of its reserve fleet. Kidd was a part of that call and was recommissioned on 28 March 1951, Lt. Cmdr. Robert E. Jeffery in command. The destroyer sailed to the Western Pacific on 18 June; and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 15 July. She joined Task Force 77 and patrolled off the Korean coast until 21 September when she sailed for the East Coast of Korea. From 21 October to 22 January 1952, Kidd bombarded targets of opportunity from Wan-Do Island to below Koesong. She then sailed with Destroyer Division 152 to San Diego, arriving on 6 February 1952. Kidd again got underway for Korea on 8 September 1952; joined the screen of a hunter- killer group near Kojo; and, in November, was back on bombardment missions off North Korea. Shortly thereafter, truce talks began. Kidd continued to patrol the Korean coast during negotiations. She departed the Far East on 3 March 1953 via Midway and Pearl Harbor and arrived San Diego for overhaul on 20 March. Once the overhaul was completed, Kidd proceeded to Long Beach, California on 20 April 1953. The next day, the Swedish freighter Hainan collided with Kidd in Long Beach harbor requiring repairs that lasted until 11 May 1953. Cold War With the onset of the Cold War, from late 1953 to late 1959 Kidd alternated between West Pacific anti-Soviet submarine patrols with operations on the West Coast making stops at Pearl Harbor and various ports in Japan, Okinawa, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. She visited Sydney, Australia, on 29 March 1958 and later that year entered the Taiwan Strait. Kidd got underway on 5 January 1960 for the East Coast via the Panama Canal, arriving at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 25 January. From there she made Naval Reserve training cruises to various East Coast ports. She joined fleet operating forces during the Berlin Crisis in 1961. December 1961 found Kidd patrolling off the Dominican Republic in a \\"show of force\\" patrol to provide an element of security in the troubled Caribbean. Kidd arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 5 February 1962 and joined Task Force Alfa for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises. On 24 April she was assigned to the Naval Destroyer School at Newport, Rhode Island. After a cruise to the Caribbean, on 1 July 1962 she resumed Naval Reserve training. Kidd was decommissioned 19 June 1964, entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, and was berthed at the Philadelphia Shipyard.

Wadleigh, daughter of RAdm. Wadleigh; and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 19 October 1943, Lieutenant Commander Walter C. Winn in command.  World War II  Following shakedown training in the West Indies, Wadleigh rendezvoused in the mid- Atlantic with , , and . The three destroyers escorted the battleship as she carried president Franklin D. Roosevelt back to the United States from talks with other Allied leaders at the Cairo Conference. = 1944 = Soon after her return from this special escort duty, Wadleigh got underway from Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 3 January 1944 and steamed via Panama to Pearl Harbor. Her baptism of fire came on 20 March 1944 during the Marshall Islands campaign. Assigned shore-bombardment duties, Wadleigh‚Äîin company with and ‚Äîsupported LCIs and LSTs during the landings on Ailinglapalap and expended 478 rounds of 5 inch shells which destroyed an enemy-held village. Three days later, the new destroyer again took part in shooting up Japanese defenses, shelling a weather station and a radio station on Ebon Island, helping to clear the way for the 1,500 marines who soon took the island. The ship returned to the Hawaiian Islands for further operational training in preparation for the upcoming conquest of the Marianas. Assigned to Task Group 52.4 (TG 52.4), Wadleigh arrived off Roi Island in the Marshalls on 10 June, five days before D-Day for the invasion of Saipan Island. The day before the first landings, the warship closed Saipan and commenced fire early in the morning, beginning her part in the operations designed to \\"soften up\\" the enemy defenses. On D-Day, Wadleigh lay offshore, providing predawn gunfire support for underwater demolition teams (UDTs) and for the initial waves of troops. After spending the day in shelling enemy positions, she retired seaward to conduct screening patrols. While thus engaged, Wadleigh and both picked up strong sonar contacts with a submarine west of Tinian. Both ships went to general quarters and attacked, dropping depth charges with deadly precision. A heavy explosion, followed by a widening slick of oil and debris, indicated that whatever had been down there had been heavily hit. Postwar accounting revealed that the two destroyers had teamed to sink the . Assigned to bombard Garapan, the capital city of Saipan, Wadleigh encountered heavy activity of all types in this area, from both friend and foe alike, while expending some 1,700 rounds of 5 inch shells against the Japanese-held island. Not only was Wadleigh fired on by a Japanese shore battery, but the doughty destroyer was also straddled by a stick of bombs from a Japanese plane, mistaken for a low-flying aircraft by American forces, and again taken under fire from shore‚Äîall within a hair-raising space of 15 minutes! During the latter days of the campaign Wadleigh shot enemy snipers out of caves, trees, and cliffs; picked up an occasional Japanese prisoner, and rescued downed American aircrews shot down near her position. Following escort runs to Eniwetok and Guadalcanal, Wadleigh was assigned to support the invasion of the Palaus. On 15 September, she patrolled north of the islands on radar picket duty, standing ready to provide early warning if Japanese planes were sighted. USS Wadleigh hull damage as a result of mine strike on September 16th, 1944 off the Palau Islands On the following day, Wadleigh steamed to Kossol Roads to begin assisting minesweepers in clearing the sealanes there. Floating mines swept up by the minesweepers provided the destroyers with \\"game\\", and Wadleigh destroyed 22 with 40-millimeter fire. The 23d, however, was deadly. While approaching one mine, the destroyer brushed horns with another, an unswept mine which burst amidships. The explosion ripped into the bowels of the ship, killing three men and injuring 20, while flooding three engineering compartments and one living space. As the crew raced to general quarters, the ship settled five feet by the stern, and listed seven degrees to starboard. Wadleigh, now sporting a 40-foot rend in her bottom, came to an even keel as the crew manhandled all movable weight from starboard to port to correct the list. passed a towline and towed the stricken destroyer out of danger.

Nearly rebuilt from the keel up, Wadleigh emerged from Mare Island on 20 February 1945 for speed trials and gunnery shoots. She departed San Diego, California, on 19 April and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 April, in company with , to conduct type-training exercises in the Hawaiian Islands. She departed Pearl Harbor on 3 May, bound for Ulithi, and arrived there after an 11-day passage. Rejoining her old unit‚ÄîDestroyer Squadron 54 (DesRon 54)‚Äîthe destroyer sortied with other 5th Fleet units on 25 May. After serving several tours on radar picket stations with the Fleet, Wadleigh weathered heavy typhoons from 5 to 7 June and subsequently accompanied and in a shore bombardment mission to Minami Daito Shima (Rasa Island) on the 9th, demolishing radar installations and buildings. After a rest period in the Philippines, Wadleigh sailed again for Japanese waters to screen the aircraft carriers as they continued to pound the Japanese home islands. On 10 July, the ship embarked a party of dignitaries‚Äîincluding Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air, John L. Sullivan, and Vice Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch, for transportation to Iwo Jima. Rendezvousing with at Guam, she rejoined her task force on 21 July to support offensive operations off Japan's doorstep. While serving on occasion 50 miles from the enemy shore, Wadleigh rescued two downed Navy aircrewmen who had been shot down during a strike on Tokyo. The destroyer slowed to destroy a derelict mine on 10 August, but excessive turbine vibrations forced the ship to shut down her starboard engine. Detached from the task force, Wadleigh limped back to Ulithi, in a convoy of replenishment ships and tankers, for repairs. While en route, she received word of the Japanese capitulation. Departing Ulithi on 23 August and hoping to rejoin the Fleet in time for the triumphal entry into Tokyo Bay, Wadleigh stopped at Iwo Jima en route for passengers and mail and arrived 24 hours after the first ships had entered the bay. Ordered to proceed directly to Sagami Wan, Wadleigh went to general quarters in company with as the ships passed beneath the once-menacing shore batteries along the Urage Strait. They soon arrived at their destination, the Yokosuka Naval Base, on 29 August. As the first American troops went ashore at Yokohama and Yokosuka, Wadleigh headed out to sea and rendezvoused with incoming carrier groups. She returned to her anchorage, near , on 2 September‚Äîin time to be on hand when the official surrender accords were signed that day. Back at sea with the carriers once more, Wadleigh patrolled off the Japanese coast for two weeks, before she departed Nipponese waters on 16 September and proceeded via Eniwetok to Saipan in company with and for air group replacements. The destroyer returned to Tokyo Bay after a week at Saipan and arrived on 13 October, escorting and Lexington. Departing Japanese waters on 20 October, bound for the Hawaiian Islands, Wadleigh carried a load of men eligible for discharge upon their return to the United States. After a 48-hour layover in the Hawaiian Islands, she pressed on for San Francisco, arriving on 5 November 1945. She commenced a preinactivation overhaul on 5 December and sailed for San Diego, California, on 27 January 1946, for inactivation. The destroyer was placed out of commission, in reserve, in the San Diego group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, in January 1947.  1951 - 1962  Wadleigh remained in reserve until she was reactivated during the Korean War. On 3 October 1951, Wadleigh was recommissioned at San Diego, Comdr. R. H. Pauli in command. USS Wadleigh's engine compartment crew photographed in 1952. She departed San Diego on 4 January 1952, bound for duty with the Atlantic Fleet. She transited the Panama Canal on 14 January‚Äîin company with , , , and ‚Äîand, upon arrival at her new home port of Newport, Rhode Island, became flagship for Destroyer Division 342. After participating in various Fleet exercises, Wadleigh arrived at Pensacola, Florida, on 17 August, to commence four weeks of plane-guard duty for . She rescued three downed aviators from the Gulf of Mexico during this tour. Next, the destroyer sailed north for an overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard‚Äîduring which time the ship received a battery of 3 inch guns‚Äîreplacing the older 40-millimeter mounts.

Photograph by John Berwick While in Subic Bay, Wadleigh was put on alert and ordered to rendezvous with Task Group 70.2 (TG 70.2). Once she joined with the group, TG 70.2 proceeded to the southern coast of Formosa in a precautionary move by the United States to forestall possible Chinese communist intentions towards the American-supported Nationalist Chinese regime on the island. While en route to Formosa, the ship struck an underwater object which inflicted minor damage to both screws. Returning to Subic Bay, the ship repaired the damage and sailed to rejoin the group. Once back on station, she spent 20 tense but uneventful days on patrol off Formosa and, soon thereafter, proceeded back to Sasebo, Japan, to prepare to return to the United States. Wadleigh returned to Newport‚Äîvia Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, and various Mediterranean ports‚Äî and arrived at her home port on 28 November 1954. Shifting to the Caribbean, she operated both in these waters and off the east coast, on antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and local operations, through the end of 1955. She then deployed three times to the Mediterranean. During the third of these deployments, in July 1958, tensions flared in Lebanon, and civil strife threatened American lives and property. Accordingly, the United States landed troops to restore order. Wadleigh was among the first American ships to arrive on the scene, with another much-decorated Fletcher-class destroyer, , arriving simultaneously. During the Lebanese crisis, she conducted eastern Mediterranean patrols as a unit of TF 61\\\\. She returned to the east coast soon thereafter to operate along the Atlantic seaboard and into the Caribbean through the fall of 1958 before deploying to the Mediterranean for a fourth time in June 1959. While homeward-bound to Newport in September of that year, she served as one of the chain of ships beneath the aerial route of president Dwight D. Eisenhower's return to the United States after his summit conferences in Europe. During the period in which the ship continued to be based out of Newport, she conducted ASW exercises and local operations through the end of the year and into 1960. On 19 March 1960, Wadleigh sped to the scene of a collision between and a Swedish tanker off Cape Henry. Commander, Destroyer Squadron 20 (DesRon 20), embarked in Wadleigh, was on-scene commander and directed the successful effort to take Darby under tow. Returning to a schedule of local operations, Wadleigh conducted a midshipman's training cruise, ASW patrols, and exercises. During a deployment to European waters in the fall of 1960, she conducted NATO fall exercises in the North Sea and across the Arctic Circle. USS Wadleigh underway. Deploying to the Mediterranean for the fifth time, Wadleigh transited the Suez Canal and participated in CENTO Exercise Midlink III, in which the naval forces of five nations participated. In November 1960, the ship returned to Mediterranean and western European waters, and took part in ASW Exercises \\"Hay-strike\\" and \\"Jetstream\\" with French Navy units before returning to Newport on 15 December 1960. She then conducted ASW exercises out of Mayport, Florida, and practiced recovery techniques for participation in Project Mercury, the first American manned spaceflight program. Attached to TG 140.8, Wadleigh was on station on 5 May 1961 when Comdr. Alan Shepard conducted his history-making flight. A second participation by Wadleigh in the Project Mercury program came in August of that year, but unfavorable weather \\"scrubbed\\" the launch, and the destroyer was detached to return to Newport. Late in the following fall, Wadleigh sailed for European waters once more and participated in Exercise Line Jug II‚Äîextensive ASW exercises with Royal Navy units. She topped this deployment with visits to ports in the British Isles like Londonderry and Southampton before returning to her home port on 22 February 1962. She conducted routine local operations until departing Newport on 22 June for Norfolk, Virginia. There, the ship was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 28 June 1962. =Honors and awards= Wadleigh received six battle stars for her service in World War II.  Chilean service  Wadleigh was transferred to Chile under the Military Aid Program in 1963. The ship was renamed Blanco Encalada and was given identification number 14. Blanco Encalada was decommissioned and stricken in 1982, and on 28 September 1991 was sunk off southern Chile by a Harpoon missile launched from the Spruance-class destroyer during an Operation Unitas XXXII exercise.

M., editor, ' 'Modern Indian Literature, an Anthology' ', pp 231, 236 published by Sahitya Akademi, 1992, retrieved 10 January 2009 He was part of the royal family of erstwhile Parappanad, Malabar. Kerala Varma is also known as the Kalidasa of Kerala. Kerala Varma has been called \\"a colossal Renaissance figure in 19th century Kerala\\" and \\"perhaps the first of the major [Malayalam language] writers who consciously and deliberately began to absorb and celebrate the Western influence\\" on his native literature. He advocated resuscitation of Malayalam literature by absorbing selected Western influences combined with native Sanskritic elements in poetry, drama and prose. Life He was born in Changanacherry at the Laxmipuram Palace on 19 February 1845 (6 Kumbham 1020) in Pooyam star. His mother was Pooram Nal Devi Amba Thampuratti while his father was Cheriyoor Mullapally Narayanan Namboothiri, Perinchelloor Gramam (Taliparamba) in Kannur District. His family had fled Malabar and sought refuge in Travancore during the invasion of Tipu Sultan towards the end of the 18th century. After peace was restored, however, the Parappanad Royal family agreed to accept a pension from the British government as also from the Travancore government and stayed back in the latter state. Although the Koil Thampuran was born at Changanacherry, his family subsequently moved to Haripad and settled at the Ananthapuram Palace. In 1859 he was married to Her Highness Bharani Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, the adopted niece of Uthram Thirunal, then Maharajah of Travancore. His marriage to the Senior Rani thus brought him into close association with the Travancore Royal Family. Later, however, through palace intrigues and personal disaffection with the Maharajah Ayilyam Thirunal he was confined at Haripad forcefully in 1875, only to be released and reunited with his wife in 1880 by Maharajah Visakham Thirunal. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1885 by the British Government. After the death of his consort Rani Lakshmi Bayi in 1901 he was appointed the guardian of her two grandnieces, the Senior and Junior Ranis of Travancore, including Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi. He died in a car accident in September 1914. At that time, cars were rare in India, and only rich people like him had cars. According to the sources, Kerala Varma was going to Vaikom Mahadeva Temple with his nephew and disciple A. R. Rajaraja Varma, another great scholar, called as 'Kerala Panini'. On the way of return, he stayed at Ananthapuram Palace, Haripad. The next day, while going to Thiruvananthapuram, his car got crashed, and he died on the hands of his nephew. People from various spheres mourned his death. He was cremated with full state honours at his home in Changanassery. Literary works Kerala Varma was in close touch with literary movements in both northern and southern parts of Kerala, including Bhashaposhini Sabha and magazines such as Vidya Vinodini and Malayala Manorama. His work Abhijnana Sakunthalam(1898), a translation of Kalidasa's Sakunthalam, is one of the most acclaimed works of poetry in Malayalam from that period. It influenced a number of other translations of Sanskrit classics into Malayalam and was a success on the stage. The subsequent spate of translations from English and Sanskrit into Malayalam was an important feature of Malayalam literature in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He has also written Mayoorasandesham (also spelt Mayura Sandesam; 1894) on the line of Kalidasa's MeghaDooth(aka Meghaduta). In this poetry he has used the peacocks of Haripad temple to send his messages to his wife, the Maharani, in Trivandrum.

After finishing his theological and philosophical studies at Basel, he visited the universities at Zurich, Bern, Lausanne, and Geneva. On his return he took on the duties, for a short time, of the professorship of logic, for Samuel Burckhardt. In 1685 he became professor of Greek at Basel. . In 1686 Werenfels undertook an extensive journey through Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, one of his companions being Gilbert Burnet. In 1687 he was appointed professor of rhetoric, and in 1696 became a member of the theological faculty, occupying successively, according to the Basel custom, the chairs of dogmatics and polemics, Old Testament, and New Testament. Werenfels received a call from the University of Franeker, but rejected it. In 1722 he led a successful move to have the Helvetic Consensus set aside in Basel, as divisive. He was member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel of London.James Isaac Good, History of the Swiss Reformed Church since the Reformation (1913), p. 172; archive.org.

Works =Logomachy= Adriaan Heereboord had argued in Cartesian style, against scholasticism for limitations to be put on disputation, which should be bounded by good faith in the participants. Werenfels went further, regarding \\"logomachy\\" as a malaise of the Republic of Letters.Wolfgang Rother, Paratus sum sententiam mutare: The Influence of Cartesian Philosophy at Basle pp. 79‚Äì80, in History of Universities, Volume XXII/1 (2007), pp. 79‚Äì80; Google Books. The \\"triumvirate\\" position on ecumenism was based on the use of fundamental articles through the forum of the Republic of Letters.Martin I. Klauber, Between Reformed Scholasticism and Pan-Protestantism: Jean-Alphonse Turretin (1671-1737) and enlightened orthodoxy at the Academy of Geneva (1994), p. 173; Google Books. The underlying causes of logomachy were taken by Werenfels to be prejudice and other failings of the disputants, and ambiguity in language. In his dissertation De logomachiis eruditorum (Amsterdam, 1688)1702 edition on Google Books. Werenfels argued that controversies that divide Christians are often verbal disputes, arising from moral deficiencies, especially from pride. He proposed to do away with them by making a universal lexicon of all terms and concepts. In the Oratio de vero et falso theologorum zelo he admonished those who fight professedly for purity of doctrine, but in reality for their own system. He considers it the duty of the polemicist not to combat antiquated heresies and to warm up dead issues, but to overthrow the prevalent enemies of true Christian living. =Theology= In 1699 he published anonymously Judicium de argumento Cartesii pro existentia Dei. It was an acceptance in particular of the proof of existence of God from the third Meditation of Descartes; and in general of Cartesian philosophical premises.Rother, p. 85; Google Books. His conception of his duties as a theological professor was shown in his address, De scopo doctoris in academia sacras litteras docentis. He believed that it was more important to care for the piety of candidates for the ministry, than for their scholarship. It was his belief that a professor of practical theology is as necessary as a professor of practical medicine. He stood for the necessity of a special revelation of God, and defended the Biblical miracles as confirmations of the words of the evangelists. In his Cogitationes generales de ratione uniendi ecclesias protestantes, quae vulgo Lutheranarum et Reformatorum nominibus distingui solent, he sought a way of reconciling Lutherans and Calvinists. The De jure in conscientias ab homine non usurpando dated from 1702; it was written after Nicolaus Wil(c)kens had defended a thesis on religious freedom in the absence of consequences for public order, and defends freedom of conscience. The work met the approval of Benjamin Hoadly and Samuel Haliday, while being used by Daniel Gerdes to attack Johannes Stinstra.Dutch Review of Church History (2006), review p. 540; Google Books. =Collections= His Dissertationum theologicarum sylloge appeared first Basel, 1709;Google Books. a further collection of his works is Opuscula theologica, philologica, et philosophica (Basel, 1718, new ed., 3 vols., 1782). =Sermons, dissertations, translations= From 1710 Werenfels (a native speaker of German) was asked to preach sermons in the French church at Basel; they were in a plain style.Edwin Charles Dargan, A History of Preaching vol. 2 (1905), p. 269; archive.org. As a preacher he has been described as \\"estranged from false pathos, elegant, intelligible, and edifying\\".Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia volume 9, article Preaching, history of, p. 171; archive.org. These sermons were published as Sermons sur des verit√©s importantes de la religion auxquels on ajoute des Considerations sur la re√ºnion des protestans (1715). They were translated into German, and into Dutch by Marten Schagen.Van Eijnatten, p. 170;Google Books. Schagen also translated the De recto theologi zelo into Dutch.Van Eijnatten, p. 168 note 102;Google Books. The De logomachiis eruditorum was translated into English as Discourse of Logomachys, or Controversys about Words (1711). Thomas Herne under a pseudonym translated Latin and French works as Three Discourses (1718), at the time of the Bangorian Controversy.Three Discourses: one a defence of private judgment; the second against the authority of the Magistrate over conscience; the third, concerning the Reuniting of Protestants.

The palace belongs to a branch of the Kulasekhara dynasty that ruled the principality of Udayamangalam in Northern Kerala. The family belongs originally to the Valluvanad royal line of ascension who presided over the Mamamkam festival. During the southern campaign of Tippu Sultan, the family relocated to the south of Kerala and took shelter under the patronage of the King of Travancore. The family divided into two branches establishing principalities within Travencore in Mariapalli and Tiruvalla. The current palace stands at the location of an earlier palace that belonged to the erstwhile Raja of Tiruvalla. Architecture The palace is constructed in the traditional complex 'pathinaru kettu' structure (lit. 16 blocks) which divided the structure into four blocks of rooms with indoor open courtyards connected to each other. The structure is supported by teak beams and false ceilings. At present the building is in disrepair. It is built in the kovilakam style. A single block of this architecture is called NƒÅlukettu and is generally constructed as a single dwelling of many joint families. Foe each block of 'Nalukettu', barring the foundation and floor is made of carved and slotted wood and has a close resemblance to East Asian gabled and thatched structures. In later years, tiles replaced the coconut fronds. The enclosed courtyard is sunk and is used for ritual ablutions and to grow plants for ritual use. The courtyard is open and gives direct access to the rooms. The building is divided into two blocks by an inner temple where the family deity is kept and worshipped. The large teak doors on the outer verandahs are reserved for various ritual uses and are seldom opened. The outer verandahs on both the western and eastern verandahs are left open, the northern and southern verandahs are enclosed or semi-enclosed. The main palace is surrounded by out buildings of later vintage. Of these, Puttan Kottaram (New Palace) houses a temple, Tekke Kottaram (Northern Palace, now demolished) housed one branch of the family while Vadakke Kottaram (Southern Palace) is a structure separated from the main compound by a river that housed non-members connected by marriage.Another branch of this palace, kezhakke nedumpurathu Kottaram , renamed as Thukalassery kottaram for the last 100years headed by Bhageerathi Thampuratty and her brother U Rama Varma Thampuran. This palace has been maintained as such without any modern modifications thus maintaining the aesthetic of the magnificent royal structure. Genesis and mythology Based on Keralolpathi, the last Perumal, Ramavarma Kulasekhara Perumal, of the Second Chera Kingdom (Kulasekhara Samrajyam, 800‚Äì1102), with its capital at Mahodayapuram, divided his kingdom to his relatives and Nair chiefs. There is some evidence to support this claim. The family came into being as one of branches of this division. The earliest recorded existence of the original Valluavanadu lineage extends to the 12th century even through earliest known member of the palace to locate to Tiruvalla lived in the 17th century. They descend from the Kolathiri rajas and ruled parts of today's northern Kerala. The members from southern branch of the Kolathiri Rajas were adopted to the Venadu Swarupam and thus became the royal family of Travancore. As a branch of the principality of Mavelikkara who came and settled there during Tipu's \\"pattayottam\\" time, the family is also directly related to Raja Ravi Varma. When the royal family of Travencore did not have an heir in the 19th century, the dynasty was restarted by adoption from Mavelikkara. Thus the family is related both by blood and marriage to the royal families of Travancore and by marriage to the royal family of Cochin. The family is matrilineal with the oldest male relative through the mother heads the household as the \\"Valia Raja\\" and the oldest female gaining the title of \\"Amma Raja\\". The fortunes of the family went into decline in the 19th century as result of the end of feudalism and through the slow decline of marumakkathayam. In the last 19th century, the Valia Raja siphoned off the funds of the palace to fund the lifestyle of his birth family. Nomenclature All the male Thampurans were named according to the following methodology. * Eldest Son To A Mother Rama Varma * Second Son Kerala Varma * Third Son Ravi Varma * Fourth Son Goda Varma All names are prefixed with their day of birth and suffixed with Varma Raja.

The team originally appeared in Fly-Man No. 31, #32 and No. 33 before being launched in its own title, Mighty Crusaders. Written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel, the series lasted seven issues before being cancelled. The team was revived under Archie's Red Circle Comics line in 1983. In 1992 DC Comics licensed the characters and relaunched the team as The Crusaders, aiming the comic at younger readers as part of its !mpact line. This series lasted eight issues, cover-dated May to December 1992. Publication history The popularity of DC's and Marvel's Silver Age superhero titles led Archie Comics to revive their own line of superhero comics. The Archie Adventure line began with titles centered on The Fly, The Jaguar, and a superheroic/spy version of the 1930s pulp character the Shadow. After suggestions and fan-art\\"The Jaguar's Lair [lettercolumn],\\" The Jaguar #8 (September 1963). Fan Paul Seydor suggests a team called \\"The Anti-Crime League,\\" and includes a drawing. See http://www.mightycrusaders.net/anticrimesquad.htm began suggesting a team made up of the characters published by Archie Comics precursor MLJ in the 1940s, Archie's superhero imprint, soon retitled Mighty Comics, re-introduced many of these characters, and brought them together in several issues of Fly Man. This team, which followed the success of the Avengers and the Justice League of America, was made up of the Shield, the Fly (re-dubbed Fly-Man), the Black Hood, and the Comet. Calling themselves the Mighty Crusaders, they initially came together as part of a plan by the Fly's nemesis the Spider to trap the hero. After appearing as a team for two more issues of Fly Man, and gaining Flygirl as a member in the process, they spun off into their own series, The Mighty Crusaders, which ran bimonthly for 7 issues. The Archie series mixed typical superhero fare with high camp. Don Markstein writes that they touched on \\"all the genre's cliches of the time\\", with Siegel's writing on the book being a \\"hokey rendition of Stan Lee\\". In 1983 the team and the series were relaunched, with Rich Buckler as writer and penciller on the first issue. A contractual dispute between Buckler and DC Comics saw the publication of the first issue delayed. Buckler recruited Cary Burkett to write several issues of the Mighty Crusaders title. The series ran until the middle of 1985, being cancelled with issue 13, cover dated September 1985. In 1992 DC Comics acquired a license to publish the characters, and launched a team book as part of the line. This series, titled only The Crusaders, launched in early 1992. The first issue saw scriptwriting by Mark Waid and Brian Augustyn. The series and the line itself, Impact Comics, were aimed at younger readers. DC Comics attempted to sell Impact Comics titles through news-stands in an attempt to expand the potential market. However, due to internal conflicts, this distribution never happened and the imprint eventually collapsed due to poor sales. The last issue of the DC series was issue 8, cover dated December 1992. The team also served as a partial inspiration for Alan Moore's Watchmen series. Moore had initially imagined the story as being based around second string heroes; \\"I wanted more average super-heroes, like the Mighty Crusaders line ... [the] original idea had started off with the dead body of the Shield being pulled out of a river somewhere.\\" Moore used this idea when asked to submit a pitch for a treatment of DC Comics' then-newly acquired Charlton Comics properties. Although the treatment was rejected for those characters, DC Comics commissioned Moore to base the story on all new heroes, and the project became Watchmen. Moore later used the Crusaders as inspiration for the Minutemen, the Golden Age predecessors of the Watchmen main characters. Team membership =First series= The first Mighty Crusaders group was created by Archie under their Mighty Comics line in the 1960s. At that time, members of the team consisted of: *Black Hood ‚Äì first appeared in Top-Notch Comics No. 9, October 1940; revived in Adventures of the Fly #7 (July 1960).http://www.comics.org/issue/15704/#125517 *The Comet ‚Äì first appeared in Pep Comics No. 1 in January 1940; revived in Adventures of the Fly #30 (October, 1964).http://www.comics.org/issue/18644/#140702 *The Fly ‚Äì created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, first appeared in The Double Life of Private Strong No. 1. *Flygirl ‚Äì first appeared in issue No. 13 of The Adventures of the Fly. *Shield ‚Äì first appeared in Fly-Man No. 31. The Shield first appeared in Pep Comics No 1, January 1940, and was a cover featured character until Archie took over Pep a few years later. The character was relaunched in 1959 as The Private Life of Lancelot Strong (bh Simon & Kirby), and appeared in Fly-Man 31 with trunks instead of the singlet style American flag suit as used in the original incarnation. =Second series= The second Mighty Crusaders group was created by Archie Comics under their Red Circle Comics line of the 1980s. At this time, members of the team consisted of: *Black Hood II (nephew of the original Black Hood) *The Comet *Darkling (later killed off) *The Fly *Flygirl *The Jaguar *Lancelot Strong: Shield II (soon killed off) *Shield I (the original Shield) *The Web II (son of the original Web) This title kicked off the Red Circle comics and lasted thirteen issues. =Impact Comics series= When DC Comics licensed the Archie superheroes for their Impact line in the 1990s, the team was simply called the Crusaders. The DC series The Crusaders lasted eight issues, from May to December 1992. =DC Comics series= A new Mighty Crusaders series was released by DC Comics, which assimilated the Red Circle heroes into its continuity following Final Crisis. A series of one-shots lead into two ongoing Shield and Web titles, each of which was canceled after the publication of ten issues. Mighty Crusaders lasted seven issues. In addition to the established Red Circle characters, an original heroine by the name of War Eagle was introduced as well. The new team consists of: *The Comet *Inferno *Flygirl *The Shield *The Web *Hangman *The Fox *Jaguar *War Eagle =New Crusaders= In 2012, Archie comics returned to The Mighty Crusaders characters. The new series, titled New Crusaders would pick up on the characters from the original series many years after the last of their arch-villains had been defeated. New Crusaders follows the progeny of the Mighty Crusaders as they struggle to become heroes after the return of the Brain Emperor. The series debuted digitally on May 16, 2012, through Archie Comics‚Äô Red Circle app, with print publication scheduled to begin monthly on September 5, 2012. For digital release, issues were divided into fourths and released once a week. A spinoff, Lost Crusade, was announced which would run every fifth week and fill in the gaps between the 1980s Red Circle comics & New Crusaders. Ian Flynn expressed a desire to explore the gap between the 1980s series and New Crusaders: \\"There were so many open endings when the '80s era series wrapped up that it's hard to choose. What happened to Darkling? Who was the traitor? Did Black Hood figure it out, or just make things worse? Did anyone mourn Doc Reeves? There's tons of stories and characters to explore, and it's honestly hard to choose.\\" Comic Book Resources: \\"CCI EXCLUSIVE: Chuck Dixon Joins Red Circle's \\"Lost Crusade\\"\\"Comic Book Resources: Ian Flynn Launches Red Circle's \\"Lost Crusade\\", August 29th 2012 However, despite announcements for New Crusaders: Dark Tomorrow and Lost Crusade creative teams,.Robot 6: \\"Archie goes same-day print and digital with Red Circle comics\\"Robot 6: \\"Jon Goldwater discusses 2012 and what lies ahead for Archie Comics\\" the incoming Red Circle editor Alex Segura mentioned \\"[I] have a great fondness for New Crusaders and the stuff that book aimed to do\\" in a March 2014 interview but that Red Circle (later rebranded Dark Circle) would be taking a new path: \\"These won‚Äôt be all-ages superhero books that we hope will appeal to older readers.

We see the Red Circle expansion as a continuation of the success of Afterlife.\\" =Dark Circle's Crusaders= Dark Circle comics started a new run in December 2017 featuring the new Shield (Victoria Adams) , Steel Sterling, Firefly, Darkling, The Comet, and Jaguar. Collected editions Recently, Archie Comics has reprinted some of the Mighty Crusaders adventures in a trade paperback collection under the \\"Red Circle Productions\\" name. This TPB is no longer available, however, since Joe Simon successfully contested ownership of the character of The Fly/Fly-Man in 2011, meaning that Archie Comics is no longer allowed to use the character. *Mighty Crusaders: Origin of a Super Team (reprints Fly-Man #31, #32 and #33 and Mighty Crusaders #1, 96 pages, November 2003, ) Other media =Toys= The Mighty Comics Superheroes Game board game was released by Transogram in 1966, and featured the Mighty Crusaders characters.

Hodder & Staughton) The Prodigal Daughter is a novel by Jeffrey Archer, published in 1982. It is the story of Florentyna Kane, the daughter of Abel Rosnovski of Archer's Kane and Abel. The novel, one of Archer's best sellers, portrays Florentyna's life from early childhood to her final ascension to the position of President of United States. In this way, President Kane becomes the first female U.S. president. The character of Florentyna Kane also appears in Shall We Tell the President? by Archer. This book initially featured President Ted Kennedy, but following the success of Kane and Abel and The Prodigal Daughter, the character was changed to President Kane in later editions. Plot summary The story begins by introducing Kane and Abel's past and the feud between them. It then tells the story of Kane and Abel from the perspective of their children, Florentyna Rosnovski and Richard Kane. Their childhood, and all the incidents and people who affected them, are portrayed in a similar manner as their fathers' lives were told in Kane and Abel. There are some inconsistencies, however. For example, after Abel's divorce from Zaphia in Kane and Abel Abel gets the custody of Florentyna. But in The Prodigal Daughter, Zaphia has custody of Florentyna. Richard and Florentyna meet by sheer chance and fall in love. When their parents are told, both sets naturally react explosively; Abel goes so far as to slap the daughter he had raised with great affection. The two lovers run away that day to a friend's house in another city. Later, they two create a chain of retail stores named Florentyna's, which are a huge success. Abel helps his daughter anonymously, but refuses to accept his son-in-law. The tale takes a twist with the senior Kane's death, when Abel learns that Kane was the anonymous benefactor who helped him launch his hotel empire. He thus accepts Richard and his grandchildren and considers it an honor that his grandson is named William Abel Kane. Richard and Florentyna take charge of the Baron Hotels, with Florentyna as chairwoman, and then in a daring feat take over Lester's (Kane's bank). Eventually Florentyna takes up politics due to the persuasion of a childhood friend named Edward Winchester. Florentyna's career becomes central to the plot, as she attempts to deal with the problems a very busy and successful mother faces, including the fact that her daughter has an abortion in the early 1980's and smokes marijuana in the mid 1970's. However, her career takes a back seat when Richard dies in a car crash in 1985. For some time, Florentyna loses the will to pursue anything, even her career. Then suddenly, seeing a homeless Vietnam Vet impels her to come \\"back with a vengeance.\\" Working harder than ever, she comes very near her goal of becoming the first female U.S. President. For the good of her party, she strikes a deal with her opponent, Pete Parkin to support him if he promises not to run for a second term, and if he makes her his vice presidential candidate. During Parkin's term, Florentyna averts many a crisis: actions for which the President takes full credit. At the end of his term, however, he not only reneges on his promises and wants to run, but undermines Florentyna's support by announcing Ralph Brooks, the other Illinois Senator as his running mate. It seems as though Florentyna's dream will never become a reality. Disgusted with the entire situation, she leaves Washington. While she is playing golf and discussing what to do with her life‚Äîher son William is now President of Lester's, with Edward, Secret Service agents arrive to announce President Parkin's sudden death from a heart attack. Florentyna thus becomes the President.  Inspiration  Archer got the inspiration for Florentyna's political life and rise to the Presidency from the elections of Golda Meir, Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi.

Its origins lie in John Fuller's Griffin Brewery, which dates from 1816. In 1845, John Fuller's son, John Bird Fuller, was joined by Henry Smith and John Turner to form the current company. Fuller Smith & Turner was originally both a brewer and operator of a large chain of pubs, brewing its beer at Fuller's Brewery in Chiswick, West London. However in January 2019 it sold its brewing division, comprising the Chiswick brewery as well as Cornish Orchards, Dark Star Brewing and Nectar Imports, to Asahi. Following the sale of the brewery, Fuller, Smith & Turner still own and operate over 380 pubs, inns, and hotels across the south of England. History Beer has been brewed on Fuller's historic Griffin Brewery site in Chiswick since the seventeenth century. From the original brewery in the gardens of Bedford House on Chiswick Mall, the business expanded and thrived until the early part of the nineteenth century. Money problems forced the owners, Douglas and Henry Thompson and Philip Wood, to seek a partner. John Fuller, of Neston Park, Wiltshire was approached to see if he would inject the required amount of money. In 1829 he joined the enterprise, but the partnership proved a difficult one and in 1841 Douglas Thompson fled to France and the partnership was dissolved. It became apparent that it was difficult for one man with no brewing experience to run a brewery of that size alone. In 1845 John Fuller's son, John Bird Fuller, was joined by Henry Smith from the Romford Brewery of Ind & Smith and his brother-in-law, head brewer John Turner, thereby forming Fuller, Smith & Turner. In 2019, Fuller, Smith & Turner Plc sold their drinks company (The Fuller's Griffin Brewery, Cornish Orchards, Dark Star Brewery & Nectar Imports) to Asahi for ¬£250m.

This club spread throughout Europe and attracted thousands of members. It is notable for the D√Æners d'Epicure--menus that were served simultaneously in many restaurants. The first was served to over 4000 members in 37 European cities; the last, held in July 1914, was served to over 10,000 diners in 140 different cities. The first menu included Dodine de Canard au Chambertin, a duck casserole cooked in a dodine. Nathaniel Newnham- Davis, in _Gourmet's Guide to London_ (1914) devotes a full chapter to the Ligue des Gourmands, noting that in 1914, the branch in London takes the lead in the number of members (60 members), followed by Paris (43 members). \\"Marseilles, New York and Montreal tie for third place with twelve members each\\" (p. 326).

About Four typical folk racing cars. Volvo 244 in foreground. A VW Beetle used as a folk racing car. Folkrace crash on H√∂gstabanan in Haninge, Sweden The races are run on special gravel or tarmac tracks, in length. The tracks are designed to limit the top speed to , but on most of the tracks speeds of over 120 km/h can be reached. The competitions are divided into different classes depending on age and gender. Participants can be as young as 14 years of age. The race is divided into different heats with usually 6 cars. The driver winning a race is awarded seven points, second five points, third four points and so on. When all the heats have been driven, the total score is calculated and the top six drivers get to race in the A final, the next six in the B final and so on. The winner of the A final wins the event. To maintain its inexpensive nature, there is a rule on car costs. The races are run in standard cars, but participants are generally free to choose as long as they meet certain minimum safety regulations. In Finland, the cars must not be all-wheel drive and cannot have a diesel engine and they have to be made of family cars (no mid- engine layout and minimum of 4 seats). Anyone can place a fixed price bid on any car, and the buyer is then chosen by draw. The fixed price is ‚Ç¨ 1500 (Finland, ca. USD 1650 ) or 8000 SEK (Sweden, ca. USD 1000). Refusing to sell is grounds for having one's competition license revoked, however participants with handicaps can get an exemption if they need special equipment in the cars. Personal equipment such as the seat and safety harness are not included in the sale. This type of system eliminates the motivation for sinking extensive amounts of work and money into a folk racing car. Because old road cars are used up in folk racing, retro and antique car enthusiasts talk about \\"the folk racing death\\": Folk racing does away with many cars that are too old to be considered usable for everyday driving but too new to have reached the status of a \\"veteran\\" or \\"antique\\". Folk racing is a full contact sport like banger racing.

Biography Born in Venice, he entered the Benedictine Order in Florence in 1695 and was ordained in 1702. From 1710 to 1714, he undertook extended educational journeys through England, France, Germany, and the Netherlands and corresponded or even met with eminent scholars of his time such as Bernard de Montfaucon, Isaac Newton, or Voltaire. Upon his return to Italy, he was made abbot of the Benedictine monastery in Rome and charged with compiling the annals of the order. In 1723, he was elected Archbishop of Corfu. Pope Benedict XIII created him Cardinal in pectore in 1726; he was installed as Cardinal and bishop of Brescia a year later. In 1730, he became the head librarian of the Vatican Library. 1747/48 he again went on a journey through Switzerland and Bavaria. In these years, he also became a member of the Academies of Sciences of Berlin, Vienna, and Russia, and was member of the first learned society of Habsburg Monarchy, the Societas eruditorum incognitorum in terris Austriacis. He had increasing differences with Pope Benedict XIV, though, such as over the assignment of Cardinal Passionei as pro-librarian and the pope's position in a conflict with Venice. Ultimately, these differences aggravated and led to his being sent back to his diocese in Brescia, where he died a few years later. Quirini's writings include many works on the history of the Church, of Corfu, and of Brescia, as well as a five-volume edition of the correspondence of Cardinal Reginald Pole. In Brescia, he founded in 1745 the Biblioteca Queriniana, which still exists , and he sponsored the German missions. He also financed the completion of the St. Hedwig Church in Berlin, which is today the cathedral of the archbishopric of Berlin.

Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day ‚Äì perhaps as many as tens of times per day.  Rationale  When embarking on a change, a developer takes a copy of the current code base on which to work. As other developers submit changed code to the source code repository, this copy gradually ceases to reflect the repository code. Not only can the existing code base change, but new code can be added as well as new libraries, and other resources that create dependencies, and potential conflicts. The longer development continues on a branch without merging back to the mainline, the greater the risk of multiple integration conflicts and failures when the developer branch is eventually merged back. When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy. The more changes the repository contains, the more work developers must do before submitting their own changes. Eventually, the repository may become so different from the developers' baselines that they enter what is sometimes referred to as \\"merge hell\\", or \\"integration hell\\", where the time it takes to integrate exceeds the time it took to make their original changes.  Workflows  = Run tests locally = CI is intended to be used in combination with automated unit tests written through the practices of test-driven development. This is done by running and passing all unit tests in the developer's local environment before committing to the mainline. This helps avoid one developer's work-in-progress breaking another developer's copy. Where necessary, partially complete features can be disabled before committing, using feature toggles for instance. = Compile code in CI = A build server compiles the code periodically or even after every commit and reports the results to the developers. The use of build servers had been introduced outside the XP (extreme programming) community and many organisations have adopted CI without adopting all of XP. = Run tests in CI = In addition to automated unit tests, organisations using CI typically use a build server to implement continuous processes of applying quality control in general ‚Äì small pieces of effort, applied frequently. In addition to running the unit and integration tests, such processes run additional static analyses, measure and profile performance, extract and format documentation from the source code and facilitate manual QA processes. On the popular Travis CI service for open- source, only 58.64% of CI jobs execute tests. This continuous application of quality control aims to improve the quality of software, and to reduce the time taken to deliver it, by replacing the traditional practice of applying quality control after completing all development. This is very similar to the original idea of integrating more frequently to make integration easier, only applied to QA processes. = Deploy an artifact from CI = Now, CI is often intertwined with continuous delivery or continuous deployment in what is called CI/CD pipeline. \\"Continuous delivery\\" makes sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users and \\"continuous deployment\\" makes the deployment process fully automated.  History  The earliest known work on continuous integration was the Infuse environment developed by G. E. Kaiser, D. E. Perry, and W. M. Schell. In 1994, Grady Booch used the phrase continuous integration in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications (2nd edition) to explain how, when developing using micro processes, \\"internal releases represent a sort of continuous integration of the system, and exist to force closure of the micro process\\". In 1997, Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries invented Extreme Programming (XP) while on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System project, including continuous integration. Beck published about continuous integration in 1998, emphasising the importance of face-to-face communication over technological support. In 1999, Beck elaborated more in his first full book on Extreme Programming. CruiseControl, one of the first open-source CI tools, was released in 2001.  Common practices  This section lists best practices suggested by various authors on how to achieve continuous integration, and how to automate this practice. Build automation is a best practice itself. Continuous integration ‚Äì the practice of frequently integrating one's new or changed code with the existing code repository ‚Äì should occur frequently enough that no intervening window remains between commit and build, and such that no errors can arise without developers noticing them and correcting them immediately. Normal practice is to trigger these builds by every commit to a repository, rather than a periodically scheduled build. The practicalities of doing this in a multi-developer environment of rapid commits are such that it is usual to trigger a short time after each commit, then to start a build when either this timer expires, or after a rather longer interval since the last build. Note that since each new commit resets the timer used for the short time trigger, this is the same technique used in many button debouncing algorithms.See for example In this way the commit events are \\"debounced\\" to prevent unnecessary builds between a series of rapid-fire commits. Many automated tools offer this scheduling automatically. Another factor is the need for a version control system that supports atomic commits, i.e. all of a developer's changes may be seen as a single commit operation. There is no point in trying to build from only half of the changed files. To achieve these objectives, continuous integration relies on the following principles. = Maintain a code repository = This practice advocates the use of a revision control system for the project's source code. All artifacts required to build the project should be placed in the repository. In this practice and in the revision control community, the convention is that the system should be buildable from a fresh checkout and not require additional dependencies. Extreme Programming advocate Martin Fowler also mentions that where branching is supported by tools, its use should be minimised. Instead, it is preferred for changes to be integrated rather than for multiple versions of the software to be maintained simultaneously. The mainline (or trunk) should be the place for the working version of the software. = Automate the build = A single command should have the capability of building the system. Many build tools, such as make, have existed for many years. Other more recent tools are frequently used in continuous integration environments. Automation of the build should include automating the integration, which often includes deployment into a production- like environment. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries, but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Debian DEB, Red Hat RPM or Windows MSI files). = Make the build self-testing = Once the code is built, all tests should run to confirm that it behaves as the developers expect it to behave. = Everyone commits to the baseline every day = By committing regularly, every committer can reduce the number of conflicting changes. Checking in a week's worth of work runs the risk of conflicting with other features and can be very difficult to resolve. Early, small conflicts in an area of the system cause team members to communicate about the change they are making. Committing all changes at least once a day (once per feature built) is generally considered part of the definition of Continuous Integration. In addition performing a nightly build is generally recommended. These are lower bounds; the typical frequency is expected to be much higher. = Every commit (to baseline) should be built = The system should build commits to the current working version to verify that they integrate correctly. A common practice is to use Automated Continuous Integration, although this may be done manually. Automated Continuous Integration employs a continuous integration server or daemon to monitor the revision control system for changes, then automatically run the build process. = Every bug-fix commit should come with a test case = When fixing a bug, it is a good practice to push a test case that reproduces the bug. This avoids the fix to be reverted, and the bug to reappear, which is known as a regression. Researchers have proposed to automate this task: if a bug-fix commit does not contain a test case, it can be generated from the already existing tests. = Keep the build fast = The build needs to complete rapidly, so that if there is a problem with integration, it is quickly identified. = Test in a clone of the production environment = Having a test environment can lead to failures in tested systems when they deploy in the production environment because the production environment may differ from the test environment in a significant way. However, building a replica of a production environment is cost prohibitive. Instead, the test environment, or a separate pre-production environment (\\"staging\\") should be built to be a scalable version of the production environment to alleviate costs while maintaining technology stack composition and nuances. Within these test environments, service virtualisation is commonly used to obtain on-demand access to dependencies (e.g., APIs, third-party applications, services, mainframes, etc.) that are beyond the team's control, still evolving, or too complex to configure in a virtual test lab. = Make it easy to get the latest deliverables = Making builds readily available to stakeholders and testers can reduce the amount of rework necessary when rebuilding a feature that doesn't meet requirements. Additionally, early testing reduces the chances that defects survive until deployment. Finding errors earlier can reduce the amount of work necessary to resolve them. All programmers should start the day by updating the project from the repository. That way, they will all stay up to date. = Everyone can see the results of the latest build = It should be easy to find out whether the build breaks and, if so, who made the relevant change and what that change was. = Automate deployment = Most CI systems allow the running of scripts after a build finishes. In most situations, it is possible to write a script to deploy the application to a live test server that everyone can look at. A further advance in this way of thinking is continuous deployment, which calls for the software to be deployed directly into production, often with additional automation to prevent defects or regressions.  Costs and benefits  Continuous integration is intended to produce benefits such as: * Integration bugs are detected early and are easy to track down due to small change sets. This saves both time and money over the lifespan of a project. * Avoids last-minute chaos at release dates, when everyone tries to check in their slightly incompatible versions * When unit tests fail or a bug emerges, if developers need to revert the codebase to a bug-free state without debugging, only a small number of changes are lost (because integration happens frequently) * Constant availability of a \\"current\\" build for testing, demo, or release purposes * Frequent code check- in pushes developers to create modular, less complex code With continuous automated testing benefits can include: * Enforces discipline of frequent automated testing * Immediate feedback on system-wide impact of local changes * Software metrics generated from automated testing and CI (such as metrics for code coverage, code complexity, and feature completeness) focus developers on developing functional, quality code, and help develop momentum in a team Some downsides of continuous integration can include: * Constructing an automated test suite requires a considerable amount of work, including ongoing effort to cover new features and follow intentional code modifications. ** Testing is considered a best practice for software development in its own right, regardless of whether or not continuous integration is employed, and automation is an integral part of project methodologies like test-driven development. ** Continuous integration can be performed without any test suite, but the cost of quality assurance to produce a releasable product can be high if it must be done manually and frequently. * There is some work involved to set up a build system, and it can become complex, making it difficult to modify flexibly. ** However, there are a number of continuous integration software projects, both proprietary and open-source, which can be used. * Continuous integration is not necessarily valuable if the scope of the project is small or contains untestable legacy code. * Value added depends on the quality of tests and how testable the code really is. * Larger teams means that new code is constantly added to the integration queue, so tracking deliveries (while preserving quality) is difficult and builds queueing up can slow down everyone. * With multiple commits and merges a day, partial code for a feature could easily be pushed and therefore integration tests will fail until the feature is complete. * Safety and mission-critical development assurance (e.g., DO-178C, ISO 26262) require rigorous documentation and in- process review that are difficult to achieve using continuous integration. This type of life cycle often requires additional steps be completed prior to product release when regulatory approval of the product is required.

Belinsky is one of only two pitchers in Angels franchise history to start his career with a four-game winning streak or better, the other being Jered Weaver. Early life Belinsky was born on the Lower East Side in Manhattan in New York City, to a Polish-American Catholic father and a Jewish mother. \\"Bo Belinsky,\\" SABR. When he was a child his grandmother, who was a Russian Jew, called him \\"bubelah\\". He was raised mostly in Trenton, New Jersey, where he became a \\"street rat\\" and one-time pool hustler. He attended Trenton Central High School. Baseball career Belinsky was already notorious as a minor leaguer for his night life during several seasons in the Oriole farm system. His career and life changed when the Angels picked him in a minor league draft for the 1962 season. His pre-season contract holdout and charismatic personality made him a star before he'd thrown a single pitch in major league competition. Belinsky had a career record of just 28‚Äì51, but threw the first no-hitter in the history of the Los Angeles Angels and the first one at Chavez Ravine (Dodger) Stadium, beating the Baltimore Orioles 2‚Äì0 on May 5, 1962. But the no-hitter‚Äîhis fourth straight win at the start of his rookie season‚Äîwould immortalize his name and, perhaps, mark the beginning of his long downfall. Belinsky would finish the 1962 season with a 10‚Äì11 win‚Äìloss record, a 3.56 earned run average, 4th in the league in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (6.966) and the league lead in walks (122).Bo Belinsky Stats  Baseball-Reference.com He finished the season second in the American League in home runs per 9 innings pitched (0.577), third in hits per 9 innings pitched (7.158), and sixth in shutouts (3). Perhaps tellingly, however, after throwing the no-hitter Belinsky also said, \\"If music be the food of love, by all means let the band play on.\\" The 1962 season was a raucous one for Belinsky in that he became glittering copy for southern California sportswriters with his wit and unapologetic womanizing. \\"Within days of his no-hitter Belinsky would be heralded as sport's most original and engaging playboy-athlete,\\" pitcher-turned-journalist Pat Jordan wrote in a striking 1971 Sports Illustrated profile. \\"His name would become synonymous with a lifestyle that was cool and slick and dazzling ... But in time the name Belinsky would become synonymous with something else. It would become synonymous with dissipated talent.\\" In addition to pitching the first no-hitter in Angels' history, Belinsky was also on the losing end of the first no-hitter ever pitched against the Angels‚ÄîEarl Wilson's 2‚Äì0 gem at Fenway Park on June 26 of the same 1962 season. The Boston Red Sox pitcher hit a home run in that game, one of four no-hit pitchers ever to do so. Belinsky fell to 1‚Äì7 in 1963, and was sent to the Angels' minor league team in Hawaii, where he pitched his way back and finished the year 2‚Äì9 in the Major Leagues. Belinsky was 9‚Äì7 with a career-best 2.86 ERA in August 1964 when came the incident that ended his days with the Angels: a hotel room fight with elderly Los Angeles Times sportswriter Braven Dyer. He was suspended from the Angels, then traded to the Philadelphia Phillies after the season for Costen Shockley and Rudy May. After spending a little over a season with the Phillies, in which he was used mostly as a long reliever before his outright release back to the minors, he also pitched for the Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds before his career ended in the Cincinnati minor league system in 1970. Later life and death Belinsky became a kind of prot√©g√© to fading but still influential and show business-connected newspaper columnist Walter Winchell. He was linked romantically, at one time or another, to such women as Ann- Margret, Connie Stevens, Tina Louise and Mamie Van Doren, the last his fiancee for a year. Contemporary player Mike Hegan once said, \\"Bo had more fun off the field than he did on the field.\\" \\"What was clear,\\" Jordan wrote, \\"was that Belinsky had dissipated a promising career, that people had grown tired of him, and that most of the problem could be traced to his personality. He did not have the knack of such later athletes‚Äîthe Namaths, Harrelsons and Sandersons‚Äîof cultivating his personality precisely up to, but not beyond, that point at which the public became bored with it.\\" Belinsky married and divorced Playboy Playmate of the Year Jo Collins, then heiress Janie Weyerhaeuser. He eventually overcame alcoholism to become first a counselor and spokesman for the alcohol abuse program he entered in Hawaii, and then an auto agency representative at Saturn of West Sahara in Las Vegas. Clean, sober and a born-again Christian (\\"Can you imagine,\\" he was quoted as saying, \\"finding Jesus Christ in Las Vegas?\\"), Belinsky battled bladder cancer before his death in Las Vegas of an apparent heart attack at age 64. He is interred at Davis Memorial Park in Las Vegas, Nevada. Veteran sportswriter Maury Allen wrote a biography of Belinsky, Bo: Pitching and Wooing, \\"with the uncensored cooperation of Bo Belinsky,\\" in 1973.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/353987ab Criminal accusation Gloria Eves, a former nightclub cashier and hatcheck attendant, filed a $150,000 damage suit against Belinsky claiming an assault on June 13, 1962. Eves, a resident of 7130 Hollywood Boulevard, claimed to have been dragged by Belinsky from the rear seat of his late model Cadillac. She asked $50,000 for disfigurement and $100,000 for medical costs and punitive damages.$150,000 Suit Is Filed Against Bo Belinsky, Chicago Tribune, August 16, 1962, pg. D3.

Early life Born in Hanover Square, London, on 23 April 1740, Ker succeeded his father to become the 3rd Duke of Roxburghe in 1755. During his Grand Tour in 1761 he fell in love with Duchess Christiane of Mecklenburg, oldest daughter of Duke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg.\\"Ker, John, third Duke of Roxburghe\\", in: Dictionary of National Biography vol. 31, New York 1892, p. 51. This would have been a perfect match of social equals. Shortly afterwards a younger sister, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, became engaged to King George III. It was considered bad etiquette for an elder sister to marry someone of lower rank than a younger sister. For whatever reason, both John Ker and Christina separated and remained single for the rest of their lives. If George III recognised the sacrifice that Ker had made, it was rewarded with a high position at court. He was Lord of the Bedchamber from 1767, was appointed a Knight of the Thistle in 1768. In 1796 he was appointed Groom of the Stole and made a Privy Counsellor. He was appointed a Knight of the Garter in 1801. John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe by Pompeo Batoni (circa 1761) Bibliophile While in Italy, Ker saw a first edition of Boccaccio's Decameron, often called the Valdarfers edition. This was a fabled book, which many said did not exist. He paid 100 guineas for it and showed it to his friends in London to huge acclaim. For the next 40 years he collected ancient and curious books, particularly editions of Shakespeare's works and other works which merely mentioned Shakespeare. At his death in 1804 there were 10,000 items. Most were books, but there were also pamphlets and broadside ballad sheets. His library was auctioned in 1812, leading to the formation of the Roxburghe Club. His collection of ballads were later published as the Roxburghe Ballads. He died unmarried and childless, and the titles Earl Ker and Baron Ker, which had been created for his father in 1722 in the Peerage of Great Britain, became extinct. His cousin William Bellenden, 7th Lord Bellenden succeeded to the dukedom and all of its other subsidiary titles. John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe by Thomas Patch (circa 1761) In popular culture In Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, a 2004 novel by British writer Susanna Clarke, the Duke's affection for the Queen's sister and their subsequent separation are mentioned, and made a premise for an important aspect of the story. One of the title characters, Gilbert Norrell, had a longstanding wish to examine the books of the Duke's library, believing there to be magical texts within. The Duke, being a bibliophile and rich, saw no reason to allow Mr. Norrell the opportunity, and so upon the Duke's death, the new Duke puts the library up for sale in order to pay off court debts. The Duke's library contained several extremely rare and valuable tomes, which Mr. Norrell purchases at auction, causing an increase in friction between himself and Jonathan Strange.

It stars Burt Lancaster in his film debut, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien and Sam Levene.. The film also features William Conrad in his first credited role, as one of the killers referred to in the title.. An uncredited John Huston and Richard Brooks co-wrote the screenplay, which was credited to Anthony Veiller. In 2008, The Killers was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Hemingway, who was habitually disgusted with how Hollywood distorted his thematic intentions, was a fan of the film, stating that \\"It is a good picture and the only good picture ever made of a story of mine.\\" Plot Two hitmen, Max and Al, come to a small town, Brentwood, New Jersey, to kill Pete Lund, known as \\"The Swede\\". Lund's coworker at a gas station warns him but, strangely, he makes no attempt to flee, and they kill him in his hotel room. The Swede is soon revealed to have really been named Ole Anderson. A life insurance investigator, Jim Reardon, is assigned to find and pay the beneficiary of the Swede's $2,500 policy. Tracking down and interviewing the dead man's friends and associates, Reardon doggedly pieces together his story. Philadelphia police Lieutenant Sam Lubinsky, a close, longtime friend of the Swede, is particularly helpful. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that the Swede was a professional boxer whose career was cut short by an injury to his right hand. Rejecting Lubinsky's suggestion to join the police force, the Swede gets mixed up with a bad crowd, including \\"Big Jim\\" Colfax. He drops his girlfriend Lily for the more glamorous Kitty Collins. When Lubinsky catches Kitty wearing stolen jewelry, the Swede \\"confesses\\" to the crime and serves three years in prison. When the Swede gets out, he, \\"Dum-Dum\\" Clarke and \\"Blinky\\" Franklin are recruited for a payroll robbery in Hackensack, New Jersey, masterminded by Big Jim. Complicating matters is the fact that Kitty is now Big Jim's girl. The robbery nets the gang $254,912. When their rendezvous place (supposedly) burns down, all of the gang members but the Swede are notified of where to meet. Kitty then informs the Swede that he is being double-crossed. The Swede takes all of the money at gunpoint and flees. Kitty meets him later in Atlantic City, then disappears with the money herself. Back in the present, Reardon watches the boarding house where the Swede lived. Sure enough, Dum-Dum shows up, searching for a clue as to the whereabouts of the loot. Reardon gets some information from the robber, but Dum-Dum gets away before the police can arrest him. When Reardon gets confirmation of one particular detail, he is certain he knows what happened. He goes to see Big Jim, now a very successful building contractor in Pittsburgh. Reardon lies, telling Big Jim that he has enough evidence to convict Kitty. He suggests that Kitty contact him. She agrees to meet him, and they go to a nightclub at her suggestion. However, after she goes to the ladies' room, Max and Al show up and try to kill Reardon. He and Lubinsky are ready for them, and the two hitmen are slain instead. Reardon and Lubinsky head to Big Jim's mansion, but are too late to stop Dum-Dum and Big Jim from killing each other. Reardon explains that when he discovered that the fire that destroyed the rendezvous point had been set hours after Kitty was sent to notify everyone of the new meeting place, he realized that Kitty and Big Jim, her husband, had been setting up the Swede. Dum-Dum finally figured out the truth, as well. When Lubinsky asks the dying Big Jim why he had \\"the Swede\\" killed, Big Jim tells him he could not take the chance that another member of the gang might find the Swede, as he had. Kitty begs her husband to exonerate her in a deathbed confession, but he dies first. Cast Production Trailer for The Killers The first 20 minutes of the film, showing the arrival of the two contract killers, and the murder of \\"Swede\\" Andreson, is a close adaptation of Hemingway's 1927 short story in Scribners Magazine. The rest of the film, showing Reardon's investigation of the murder, is wholly original. According to Hemingway's biographer, Carlos Baker, The Killers \\"was the first film from any of his works that Ernest could genuinely admire.\\"Baker, Carlos. Hemingway, Princeton University Press; 4th edition, November 1, 1972. Producer Mark Hellinger paid $36,750 for the screen rights to Hemingway's story, his first independent production.

Siodmak later said Hellinger's newspaper background meant he \\"always insisted on each scene ending with a punchline and every character being over established with a telling remark\\" which the director fought against.Encounter with Siodmak Taylor, Russell. Sight and Sound; London Vol. 28, Iss. 3, (Summer 1959): 180. Reportedly, Hellinger was looking to cast two or three unknowns on the theory that the known actors of the time were already so typed that the audience would know the threats instantly which would take away some of the suspense of the story. He also later said that Lancaster was not his first pick for the part of \\"the Swede\\", but Warner Bros. would not lend out Wayne Morris for the film. Other actors considered for the part include Van Heflin, Jon Hall, Sonny Tufts, and Edmond O'Brien, who was instead cast in the role of the insurance investigator. Hellinger alleged that he tested so many potential 'Swedes' that if somebody had suggested Garbo, he would have tested her too. Lancaster was under contract to producer Hal Wallis but had not yet appeared in a film. Wallis' assistant Martin Jurow told Hellinger about the then unknown \\"big brawny bird\\" who might be suitable for the role and Hellinger set up a meeting. After his screen test, Hellinger signed a contract with Lancaster to do one film year and cast him in the role that would make him a star. In the role of the femme fatale, Hellinger cast Gardner, who had up to then appeared virtually unnoticed in a string of minor films under contract to MGM. Gardner had difficulty achieving the requisite histrionics necessary at the end of the film when Sam Levene memorably tells her \\"Don't ask a dying man to lie his soul into Hell\\". Director Siodmak felt she did not have the necessary technique to reach the emotional climax necessary for the scene so he chose to \\"bully her\\" into Kitty's fragile emotional state by \\"barking at her if she did not do the scene right, he would hit her\\". The \\"dum-da-dum- dum\\" sequence of opening chords of Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa's theme music was later reused for the Dragnet television series. Reception =Critical response= When the film was first released, Bosley Crowther gave it a positive review and lauded the acting. He wrote, \\"With Robert Siodmak's restrained direction, a new actor, Burt Lancaster, gives a lanky and wistful imitation of a nice guy who's wooed to his ruin. And Ava Gardner is sultry and sardonic as the lady who crosses him up. Edmond O'Brien plays the shrewd investigator in the usual cool and clipped detective style, Sam Levene is very good as a policeman and Albert Dekker makes a thoroughly nasty thug. ... The tempo is slow and metronomic, which makes for less excitement than suspense.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, August 29, 1946. Last accessed: February 24, 2008 In a review of the DVD release, Scott Tobias, while critical of the screenplay, described the drama's noir style, writing, \\"Lifted note-for-note from the Hemingway story, the classic opening scene of Siodmak's film sings with the high tension, sharp dialogue, and grim humor that's conspicuously absent from the rest of Anthony Veiller's mediocre screenplay. ... A lean block of muscles and little else, Burt Lancaster stars as the hapless victim, an ex-boxer who was unwittingly roped into the criminal underworld and the even more dangerous gaze of Ava Gardner, a memorably sultry and duplicitous femme fatale. ... [Siodmak] sustains a fatalistic tone with the atmospheric touches that define noir, favoring stark lighting effects that throw his post- war world into shadow.\\"Tobias, Scott. AV Club, film and DVD review, February 26, 2003. Last accessed: February 24, 2008.

Early life  Powers was born in 1853 in Brisbane, Queensland. He was educated at Ipswich Grammar School and Brisbane Grammar School captaining the Schools First XI. He was a talented sportsman, and at one point captained a state cricket team against a touring English side. After completing his articles of clerkship, Powers was admitted to practise law as a solicitor in 1876, after which he moved to Bundaberg to practise. In 1878, he married Kate Ann Thorburn, whose father was a solicitor from Victoria. Powers continued to work in Bundaberg until 1882.  Politics  In 1883 Powers became the mayor of Maryborough. In June 1888, Powers was elected to the Parliament of Queensland as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Burrum. On 19 November 1889, Powers became Postmaster-General and Minister for Education in the ministry of Premier Boyd Dunlop Morehead, and he held these positions until resigning with his colleagues in August 1890. In 1891 he was a member of a Royal Commission which was established to investigate the possibility of establishing a university in Queensland. Powers was admitted to practice as a barrister at the Queensland bar in 1894, although since he was still in parliament at the time, he did not actually practice. From 1894 to 1895, Powers was the leader of the opposition in Queensland. During this time, he put forward an electoral reform bill which provided for women's suffrage, and the abolition of plural voting, however the bill did not succeed. If it had, Queensland would have become the second Australian colony after South Australia to allow women to vote. An industrial relations bill brought by Powers also failed.  Legal career  From 1899 to 1903, Powers served as the Crown Solicitor for Queensland, and in 1903, he was appointed as the first Commonwealth Crown Solicitor.Sir Charles Powers KCMG, High Court of Australia During this time, he conducted several appeals on behalf of the recently formed Federal Government to the Privy Council, where he argued many significant constitutional issues. He played a key role in preparing the prosecution in the Coal Vend cases, arising out of prosecutions brought by then Attorney-General of Australia Billy Hughes against a coal industry cartel. The case was successful at first instance, but was lost on appeals to the full High Court and to the Privy Council. Nevertheless, Hughes was pleased with Powers' work, and Hughes's opinion was undoubtedly influential when the Fisher government appointed Powers to the High Court of Australia in 1913. Powers was the only solicitor to be appointed, and remains the only Justice (with the exception of the initial three) to have not argued a case before the court. He was also the first Justice appointed without a university degree. Powers was one of two justices of the Court to have previously served in the Parliament of Queensland, along with Samuel Griffith. The appointment of Powers, along with the concurrent appointment of Albert Piddington, were highly controversial. The press considered the two appointees to be insufficiently qualified, and both were criticised for their lack of expertise and experience. There was also controversy arising from Hughes' desire to appoint judges who would be sympathetic to interpreting the power of the Parliament of Australia broadly. Piddington caused the most public outrage for stating his sympathies in a telegram, although Powers had actually prepared many of the arguments Hughes would wish him to uphold on the bench. While Piddington ultimately resigned, Powers persevered, and remained on the High Court. Later in 1913 he was made Deputy President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration under Justice Higgins, leaving the court on 30 April 1920. He was reappointed as Deputy President on 12 February 1921 and ultimately succeeded Higgins as President on 30 June. As President, Powers introduced the first system of automatic adjustments to the basic wage to account for changes in the cost of living, applied quarterly. He finally left the Arbitration Court on 25 June 1926.  Later life  Powers was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1929, and on 22 July that year resigned from the High Court. Powers died in Melbourne in 1939 and was buried in Burwood Cemetery.

It is located on The Embarcadero in San Francisco, California. On top of the building is a clock tower with four clock dials, each in diameter, which can be seen from Market Street, a main thoroughfare of the city. Designed in 1892 by American architect A. Page Brown in the Beaux Arts style, the ferry building was completed in 1898. At its opening, it was the largest project undertaken in the city up to that time. Brown designed the clock tower after the 12th- century Giralda bell tower in Seville, Spain, and the entire length of the building on both frontages is based on an arched arcade. With decreased use since the 1950s, after bridges were constructed carry transbay traffic and most streetcar routes were converted to buses, the building was adapted to office use and its public spaces broken up. In 2002, a restoration and renovation were undertaken to redevelop the entire complex. The Great Nave was restored, together with its height and materials. A marketplace was created on the ground floor, the former baggage handling area. The second and third floors were adapted for office and Port Commission use. During daylight, on every full and half-hour, the clock bell chimes portions of the Westminster Quarters. The ferry terminal is a designated San Francisco landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Ferry Building is in the center of this film from 1906 \\"UNION DEPOT AND FERRY HOUSE\\" map from 1899 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map Opened in 1898, the building replaced a wooden predecessor constructed on the same site in 1875. The well built reinforced building with its arched arcades survived both the 1906 and the 1989 earthquakes with little damage. It served as the destination for commuters to San Francisco from the East Bay, who rode the ferry fleets of the Southern Pacific and the Key System. It also served as the connection to San Francisco for the transcontinental rail lines of the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and Western Pacific which terminated in Oakland, and for the Northwestern Pacific running north from Marin County. The ferry piers north of the clock tower served the Key System, Santa Fe, and Northwestern Pacific, while the piers south of the tower served the Southern Pacific and Western Pacific.The Key Route: Transbay Commuting by Train and Ferry, Harre Demoro, Interurban Press (1985), Vol.2, p.185 A loop track in front of the building enabled convenient transfers to streetcars. A large pedestrian bridge spanned the Embarcadero in front of the Ferry building to facilitate safe crossing of the busy plaza and transit hub. In the 1940s, the bridge was dismantled to supply scrap metal for the Second World War. Until the completion of the Bay Bridge (which began to carry railroad traffic) and Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s, the Ferry Building was the second busiest transit terminal in the world, second only to London's Charing Cross Station. After the bridges opened, and the new Key System and Southern Pacific (Interurban Electric/IER) trains began running to the East Bay from the Transbay Terminal in 1939, passenger ferry use fell sharply. In the second half of the 20th century, although the Ferry Building and its clock tower remained a part of the San Francisco skyline, the condition of the building interior declined with changes. Beginning in the 1950s, unsympathetic renovations installed a mezzanine level, broke up the grand space of the Great Nave, and partitioned the ticketing counters and waiting room areas into office space. The formerly grand public space was reduced to a narrow and dark corridor, through which travelers passed en route to the piers. Passengers were made to wait for ferries on outdoor benches, and the ticketing booths were moved to the pier. Embaradero Freeway limiting access to the Ferry Building, February 1982 In the late 1950s, the Embarcadero Freeway was built, which passed right in front of the Ferry Building, and views of the once-prominent landmark were greatly obscured from Market Street. Pedestrian access was treated as an afterthought, and the public was cut off from the waterfront. Market Street Railway services terminated at a loop in front of the building prior to the construction of the Transbay Terminal. The last streetcars ran on July 2, 1949. With the structural failure of the Embarcadero Freeway during the October 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco was offered the choice of whether to rebuild it or remove the freeway and reconnect the city with the eastern waterfront and the historic Ferry Building. As part of the larger rejection of the 1950s comprehensive freeway plan as unsympathetic to the city's character, and the general unpopularity of the freeway, Mayor Art Agnos led the charge to remove the Embarcadero freeway entirely. It was replaced with a ground-level boulevard, which reconnected a significant portion of San Francisco's waterfront and the rest of the city. Access was restored to Embarcadero Plaza (previously Justin Herman Plaza) and the foot of Market Street, of which the Ferry Building had been an integral part for so many decades. =Renovations= \\"Great Nave\\" of the Ferry Building after its renovations By 1992, the freeway had been removed and San Francisco began to create a comprehensive port development plan that would revitalize the newly cleared space, create public access, and reintroduce the ferry service. As the most iconic element of the waterfront, the Ferry Building was central to the aesthetic and the overall success of the development plan, and its status as a historic landmark for both architecture and engineering made a sympathetic restoration essential. The 1898 Ferry Building was a symbol of San Francisco's history as a bustling port city, but with the redevelopment plan, the city was choosing to also make the structure a symbol of San Francisco's future. The vastness of the project resulted in the selection of a group of firms that could each focus on a key aspect of the redevelopment plan. ROMA Design Group‚Äîsite design architects‚Äîdesigned the bayside and cityside promenades and plazas and reoriented the public spaces of the area to the building and to the bay. ROMA Design Group also designed new ferry terminals and the main historic streetcar stop that re-established the area as a multi-modal transit hub and gateway into the city. Simon Martin- Vegue Winkelstein Moris Architects (SMWM), founded by Cathy Simon, created an overall plan for the building; Baldauf Catton Von Eckartsberg Architects (BCVE) examined and planned for the needs of new retail spaces; Page & Turnbull, specialists in historic preservation, dealt with the restoration, replacement, and recreation of the historic elements of the structure. Although the project was a restoration project, the structure would not be returned to its pure historic use as a nexus of bay transit. While the demand for ferry transit has experienced increasing demand in recent years by cross- bay commuters, the ferry service will never again reach historic levels. Therefore, in order to draw visitors, the Ferry Building has been transformed into a retail and restaurant space on the ground floor that focuses on local, sustainable products. The Port and the project developers believed that the combination of transit, office use, and unique retail would make the Ferry Building a destination for locals and tourists alike that would drive the greater goal of stimulating the waterfront. The focus on creating a viable economic use for the Ferry Building was fundamental in developing the final restoration plan and while important historic features that are key to the structure's integrity were largely restored, some adaptations were allowed more license to meet the needs of the reuse proposal. The restored Ferry Building was opened in 2003. The lead developer was EQ Office. EQ Office was acquired by The Blackstone Group in 2007. The ground floor of the building is occupied by a marketplace featuring about 50 restaurants, retail shops and food purveyors, most of which are open seven days a week. The outdoor Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, which is run by CUESA, operates on the surrounding plaza on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Architecture and design alt= The present structure was designed in 1892 by A. Page Brown, a New York architect who had started with McKim, Mead & White and later moved to California. Influenced by studies at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he designed the clock tower after the 12th-century Giralda bell tower in Seville, Spain. Brown designed it to satisfy needs of an industrial society in high style associated with traditional buildings; the entire base is an arched arcade reminiscent of European buildings. The highest quality materials were used, such as marble and mosaics for the state seal. The Great Nave on the second floor was the major public space for arriving and departing ferry passengers. =Grand Nave= Ferry Building Marketplace The original description of the Ferry Building as published in the Board of Harbor Commissioners' Biennial Report (1888) specified that \\"Passengers should pass from the upper decks of the ferries through the second story, with a bridge over the crowded and dangerous portion of East [now Embarcadero] Street.\\" The first floor was not intended for public viewing or access and was filled with the movement of baggage, mail, and freight. Instead, the public was meant to enter the structure from an elevated walkway and move through the more refined spaces of the second floor lit by the nave. By 1992, the nave had been turned into private offices and the loss of the foot bridge meant that all public approach to the building would be at street level, altering the way in which the building was understood and experienced. With the restoration however, the developers argued that the public's historic interaction with the space was defined by the natural light cascading from the nave, not by the elevated entry way. With the movement of the primary public space to the first floor, it became essential to their proposal that this historic experience would be recreated. Beyond removing an added third floor and restoring the nave to its two-story height, the proposal included cutting two openings, each at , into the floor of the second level. These openings would allow for this historic feature to be extended to the visitor's experience of the first floor. This was a controversial choice, and due to the building's historic status, the proposal had to be approved by the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO); this was the subject of multiple hearings. =Marble mosaics= The greatest debate raised by the opening of the second floor cuts, however, surrounded the treatment of the historic mosaic tiling of the second floor. The second floor Grand Nave was tiled with a mosaic marble floor of white and gray tesserae with a border of red and purple. In the center of the space at the top of the main stairway is a reproduction of the Great Seal of the State of California worked entirely in mosaics. At the time of the restoration, this surface was primarily covered with linoleum, and some small sections had been lost to prior alterations. This feature was considered integral to the historic character of the building, and as a primary public space, the tiling was a key component of community memory. In allowing the amplification of one feature (the nave), the loss of another (the mosaics) was inherently tied. The final agreement reached between the SHPO and the development team found that as long as the important decorative portions of the flooring were restored and extra tesserae would be used to repair damaged sections, the cuts would be approved. In order to restore the mosaic, the applied linoleum surface had to be carefully peeled away and a mixture of crushed walnut shells was then used to clean the marble surface without damaging the material. =Arch reproduction and patinization= In the process of removing of the 1947 and 1950 third- floor additions, Page & Turnbull discovered the extent of the damage to the brick and terra cotta arches of the nave. Twenty-two arches span the length of the nave on each side, and of the 44 total, 11 had been destroyed. Over 25 percent of the original material had been removed in the first remodel, including terra cotta scroll-work, the arches themselves, and sections of the surrounding brickwork. In order to restore the highly significant nave, Page & Turnbull had to design and create replacements for these 11 arches that would be accurate enough not to detract from the sight line of the second story that these arches flank. The prohibitive cost and effort of replacing these materials in kind led to the choice of a cast-stone with fiberglass support that mimics the buff brick in both color and finish. Through the use of a cast material, Page & Turnbull was able to create a fiberglass mold to be used for casting each arch as a unit that could then be inserted into sections where original fabric had been lost. The addition of fiberglass as a support material‚Äîthat allows for both flexibility and compressive strength‚Äîwas seen as an added benefit in meeting concerns over the building's continued seismic safety. Creating visual continuity between the new and the old was critical in this instance due to the significance of the long stretch of the nave; here an obvious alteration in material or color would detract from the pattern of springing arches that continues through the length of the structure. Page & Turnbull invited faux-finishing specialist Jacquelyn Giuffre to disguise the new sections and recreate the continuity of pattern and color. Guiffre's job was made more difficult by the fact that the structure had not been completely sealed against the elements during the restoration and the salts of the bay air triggered a staining process that created green marks in the yellow and buff brick. In order to match the texture and patina of the old brick, Guiffre used six different pigments applied by hand, and then applied green shading to mimic the new staining process. Once the pieces were installed, a final stage of blending was completed on site to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. =Clocks= The original clock mechanism was refurbished in 2000; it is complete and intact, despite two previous modifications. The Ferry Building has its original Special #4 clock made in 1898 by the Boston clock maker E. Howard. It was the largest wind-up, mechanical dial clock in the world but is now powered by an electric motor. The four dials are each in diameter, and a portion of the dial appears to be back-lit at night. This is the effect of two concentric dials on each clock face, in which the inner dial is lit and visible at night. Although the hands and a small portion of the works are now powered by an accurate electric motor, the entire clock mechanism is still there. The huge weight hangs in its shaft; once wound, it formerly kept the clock running for eight days. The pendulum also remains, but it is motionless, replaced by more modern, reliable, and accurate electric power. There is also a set of horn loudspeakers above the clock that play Westminster Chimes on the hour and makes a loud siren noise every Tuesday at noon on the hour. Ferry service MV Del Norte at the Golden Gate Ferry Terminal in 2018 The Ferry Building is the primary San Francisco terminal for commuter ferry service. (Service to Pier 41 by Blue & Gold Fleet and other operators is primarily for excursions rather than commuting.) The building has six ferry piers lettered Gate B through Gate G. Gate B, used by the San Francisco Bay Ferry Vallejo/Mare Island route, is adjacent to the north end of the building. Gates C and D are the Golden Gate Ferry Terminal, located on a larger wharf near the center of the Ferry Building. They are used by Golden Gate Ferry service on the Sausalito, Tiburon, and Larkspur routes. Gates E through G are located south of the south end of the building; they are used by San Francisco Bay Ferry services on the Oakland/Alameda, Alameda Harbor Bay, and Richmond routes. Privately run service to Berkeley docks at Pier 1 to the north. The Golden Gate Ferry Terminal, which is located on a wharf built in the late 1960s as part of the Transbay Tube, opened with the introduction of Golden Gate Ferry in 1976. Vallejo service was added in September 1986. When emergency ferry service was added after the 1989 earthquake, Alameda service docked between Pier 7 and Pier 9, Berkeley service docked at Pier 1, and all other service used the existing Ferry Building piers. Berkeley and Richmond service ended in March 1990, but Oakland/Alameda service continued, with Harbor Bay service added in March 1992. These services used a new pier constructed north of the Ferry Building at Pier (adjacent to Pier 1). The modern Gate B and Gate E opened in October 2001 as part of the larger renovation of the Ferry Building. Construction of Gate G in November 2018 The 2001‚Äì2003 renovation anticipated a future phase to add additional capacity. Around 2008, WETA and the Port of San Francisco began planning the construction of three new ferry piers to support increased frequencies and new routes. Environmental planning for the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project began in 2011, with an Environmental Impact Statement released in 2014. Construction of Gate A in the North Basin was deferred, with focus shifted to the South Basin improvements. These include the addition of Gates F and G behind the Agriculture Building, reconstruction of Gate E, and the creation of a new public plaza between Gate E and The Embarcadero. A groundbreaking ceremony was held for the then-$79 million project on May 11, 2017. Gate G opened in December 2018, followed by Gate F on February 14, 2019, allowing Gate E to close for reconstruction. Gate E reopened in February 2020, and the $98 million project was completed in August 2020. Transit connections F Market & Wharves streetcar at the Ferry Building in 2018 The two Muni historic streetcar lines - the E Embarcadero and F Market & Wharves - stop at a surface station located on the pedestrian plaza in front of the Ferry Building. The station (which is signed as Ferry Building, but also known as The Embarcadero/Ferry Building) opened with the extension of F Market service to Fisherman's Wharf on March 4, 2000. No Muni bus routes run directly to the Ferry Building, but many stop in the surrounding area near Embarcadero station, the closest Muni Metro and BART station. The terminal is also served by a single northbound SolTrans route 82 bus trip in the late evening, intended for passengers who miss the last ferry to Vallejo.

The Swiss dagger (Schweizerdolch) is a distinctive type of dagger used in Switzerland and by Swiss mercenaries during the 16th century. It develops from similar dagger types known as basler which were in use during the 14th and 15th centuries. The characteristic mark of the Swiss dagger are two crescent-shaped, inward- bent metal bars delimiting the hilt. The curved shape of the Swiss dagger hilt appeared as early as the 13th century and remained peculiar to Switzerland, and does not appear to have been imitated elsewhere. The blade was characteristically double edged, tapering to a point and usually had a diamond shape cross-section. One of the masterpieces of Hans Holbein the Younger is a 1521 design for a dance of death on the sheath of such a dagger (which was implemented on a number of surviving examples),E. A. Gessler, 'Eine Schweizer Dolchscheide mit der Darstellung des Totentanzes', in: Schweizerisches Landesmuseum in Z√ºrich, Jahresbericht 39 (1930), 82-96. After 1550, the Swiss dagger became a prestigious ornamental weapon, with hilt and sheath decorated with precious metal and scenes from the Bible, classical antiquity or Swiss history. Daggers of this period are also referred to as \\"Holbein\\" daggers. Schneider (1977) dates the bulk of the extant specimens of this ornamented type to the 1560s to 1570s.dated sheaths according to Schneider (1977): 1563 (no. 80), 1564 (79), 1565 (33), 1567 (16, 17), 1569 (27, 129), 1572 (113), 1573 (119), 1581 (43a), 1582? (97), 1585 (19,94), 1592 (58). The Swiss dagger disappears with the beginning Baroque period, in the early 17th century. Schneider (1977) compiled a full index of all known originals and copies (including a considerable number of 19th-century imitations forgeries), for a total of 156 specimens. Many copies of originals were made in the period of national Romanticism (19th century), using a casting method. Schneider was able to distinguish copies from originals due to a slight shrinking due to the casting process. His conclusion was that only slightly less than half of the extant \\"Holbein\\" daggers are originals. The ordnance dagger issued to officers in the Swiss Armed Forces beginning in 1943 was modeled after the historical Swiss dagger. In Nazi Germany, the hilts of some political and military daggers (worn by members of SS, SA, and NSKK formations) were also modeled on the Swiss dagger. In the Swiss army, the dagger was removed from the officers' dress uniform in 1995.Revue Militaire Suisse 147 (2002), p. 33.
