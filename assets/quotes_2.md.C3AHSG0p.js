A pilot by the name of Count Moriarty offers to fly the residents to freedom for a considerable fee, however, even his plans are wrecked when his plane crashes in the mountains. Moriarty, Seagoon and the other survivors must rely on a mysterious, barefoot boy named Bluebottle to guide them to safety.

In 1878 he was appointed Professor of Zoology at the University of Cagliari, remaining there for several years until 1881 when he took up an appointment at the University of Bologna as Professor of Zoology, remaining there for thirty-five years until his death. Emery specialised in Hymenoptera, but his early work was on Coleoptera. Prior to 1869, his earliest works were a textbook of general zoology and papers on fishes and molluscs. From 1869 to 1925 he devoted himself almost entirely to the study of ants. http://gap.entclub.org/taxonomists/Emery/index.html Emery published extensively between 1869 and 1926 describing 130 genera and 1057 species mainly in Wytsman's Genera Insectorum series.

History  = The Kingdom of Majorca (1276-1349)= In 1276, King James II of Majorca made Perpignan the capital of the Kingdom of Majorca. He started to build a palace with gardens on the hill of Puig del rey on the south of the town, the architects were Ramon Pau, Pons Descoll, and Bernat Quer with completion in 1309. = Ending the Western Schism = In 1415, the Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund of Luxemburg, organised a European summit in Perpignan, to convince the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII to resign his office and take to an end the Western Schism through the Council of Constance. On 20 September 1415, the Emperor met with Pope Benedict XIII at the palace with the King Ferdinand I of Aragon and the delegations of the Counts of Foix, Provence, Savoy, Lorraine, the embassy of the Roman church for the Council of Constance, and embassies from the Kings of France, England, Hungary, Castille and Navarre. The pope refused to resign and to recognise the Pope that the Council had chosen, clashing with the emperor who left Perpignan on 5 November. = The Franco-Spanish wars = Part of the northern wing of the palace was destroyed in a siege in 1502. Following the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, France gained Roussillon, and proceed to develop the defensive features of the palace. The General Council of the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales bought the Palace and the gardens in 1958, to the Ministry of Defence who keeps the Vauban bastions and 19th century buildings and courts as a garrison.  Architecture  The Palace of the Kings of Majorca is a fortified Palace in the Gothic style. It is organised around three courtyards 60 m square. The first foremen on the site were Ramon Pau and especially Pons Descoyl, very active in Perpignan and the Baleares. It has two chapels, one above the other: the lower is the Queen's Chapel, while the upper is Holy Cross with a pink marble door. Here we have together in the ‚ÄúGreat Hall‚Äú, the seat of political power, the chapel and the royal residence. The position of the chapel in the heart the royal apartments, opposite the throne room, indicates the importance of the spiritual over the temporal. The plan of the palace was inspired by those of Majorca, and the chapel is like that of the earlier Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. The walls, built with uncut stones and bricks bound with mortar, were coated with lime and painted. Doors, corridors, stairs, armatures and the main towers are all made of cut stone: ochre stone from Les Fonts, Baixas Blue, Sandstone, Red Marble from Villefranche-de- Conflent, White and Blue Marble from Ceret.  Activities  = Guitares au Palais = The Guitares au Palais, a free three-day guitar music festival, is held in the last weekend of August in the Palace and the gardens. The festival's art director is Pedro Soler and opens the stage to an eclectic stream of guitar enthusiasts with performances in traditional acoustic guitar, flamenco, classical music, gypsy music, pop music and jazz. International guests includes the Rosenberg Trio, Tekamali and Paco Ib√°√±ez in 2004, Montserrat Figueras, Rolf Lislevand and Manolo Sanlucar in 2005, The National and Sergio Lopez in 2006, Caetano Veloso in 2007, and the Rumberos Catalans, Bernardo Sandoval, Peter Finger and Aaron and Bryce Dessner in 2008.

There a winding of the phase {\\\\phi} by 2\\\\pi creates a vortex which carries one flux quantum. See quantum vortex. The term Fractional vortex is used for two kinds of very different quantum vortices which occur when: (i) A physical system allows phase windings different from 2\\\\pi \\\\times \\\\mathit{integer}, i.e. non-integer or fractional phase winding. Quantum mechanics prohibits it in a uniform ordinary superconductor, but it becomes possible in an inhomogeneous system, for example, if a vortex is placed on a boundary between two superconductors which are connected only by an extremely weak link (also called a Josephson junction); such a situation also occurs in some cases in polycrystalline samples on grain boundaries etc. At such superconducting boundaries the phase can have a discontinuous jump. Correspondingly, a vortex placed onto such a boundary acquires a fractional phase winding hence the term fractional vortex. A similar situation occurs in Spin-1 Bose condensate, where a vortex with \\\\pi phase winding can exist if it is combined with a domain of overturned spins. (ii) A different situation occurs in uniform multicomponent superconductors which allow stable vortex solutions with integer phase winding 2\\\\pi N, where N= \\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 2, ... , which however carry arbitrarily fractionally quantized magnetic flux.Egor Babaev, Vortices with Fractional Flux in Two-Gap Superconductors and in Extended Faddeev Model Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 (2002) 067001.  (i) Vortices with non-integer phase winding  = Josephson vortices =  Fractional vortices at phase discontinuities  Josephson phase discontinuities may appear in specially designed long Josephson junctions (LJJ). For example, so-called 0-œÄ LJJ have a \\\\pi discontinuity of the Josephson phase at the point where 0 and \\\\pi parts join. Physically, such 0-\\\\pi LJJ can be fabricated using tailored ferromagnetic barrier or using d-wave superconductors. The Josephson phase discontinuities can also be introduced using artificial tricks, e.g., a pair of tiny current injectors attached to one of the superconducting electrodes of the LJJ. The value of the phase discontinuity is denoted by Œ∫ and, without losing generality, it is assumed that , because the phase is periodic. An LJJ reacts to the phase discontinuity by bending the Josephson phase \\\\phi(x) in the \\\\lambda_J vicinity of the discontinuity point, so that far away there are no traces of this perturbation. The bending of the Josephson phase inevitably results in appearance of a local magnetic field \\\\propto d\\\\phi(x)/dx localized around the discontinuity (0-\\\\pi boundary). It also results in the appearance of a supercurrent \\\\propto\\\\sin\\\\phi(x) circulating around the discontinuity. The total magnetic flux Œ¶, carried by the localized magnetic field is proportional to the value of the discontinuity \\\\kappa, namely , where is a magnetic flux quantum. For a œÄ-discontinuity, , the vortex of the supercurrent is called a semifluxon. When , one speaks about arbitrary fractional Josephson vortices. This type of vortex is pinned at the phase discontinuity point, but may have two polarities, positive and negative, distinguished by the direction of the fractional flux and direction of the supercurrent (clockwise or counterclockwise) circulating around its center (discontinuity point). The semifluxon is a particular case of such a fractional vortex pinned at the phase discontinuity point. Although, such fractional Josephson vortices are pinned, if perturbed they may perform a small oscillations around the phase discontinuity point with an eigenfrequency, that depends on the value of Œ∫. Splintered vortices (double sine-Gordon solitons) In the context of d-wave superconductivity, a fractional vortex (also known as splintered vortex) is a vortex of supercurrent carrying unquantized magnetic flux , which depends on parameters of the system. Physically, such vortices may appear at the grain boundary between two d-wave superconductors, which often looks like a regular or irregular sequence of 0 and œÄ facets. One can also construct an artificial array of short 0 and œÄ facets to achieve the same effect. These splintered vortices are solitons. They are able to move and preserve their shape similar to conventional integer Josephson vortices (fluxons). This is opposite to the fractional vortices pinned at phase discontinuity, e.g. semifluxons, which are pinned at the discontinuity and cannot move far from it. Theoretically, one can describe a grain boundary between d-wave superconductors (or an array of tiny 0 and œÄ facets) by an effective equation for a large-scale phase œà. Large scale means that the scale is much larger than the facet size. This equation is double sin-Gordon equation, which in normalized units reads where is a dimensionless constant resulting from averaging over tiny facets. The detailed mathematical procedure of averaging is similar to the one done for a parametrically driven pendulum, and can be extended to time-dependent phenomena. In essence, () described extended œÜ Josephson junction. For () has two stable equilibrium values (in each 2œÄ interval): , where . They corresponding to two energy minima. Correspondingly, there are two fractional vortices (topological solitons): one with the phase going from to , while the other has the phase changing from to . The first vortex has a topological change of 2œÜ and carries the magnetic flux . The second vortex has a topological change of and carries the flux . Splintered vortices were first observed at the asymmetric 45¬∞ grain boundaries between two d-wave superconductors YBa2Cu3O7‚àíŒ¥. =Spin-triplet Superfluidity= In certain states of spin-1 superfluids or Bose condensates, the condensate wavefunction is invariant if the superfluid phase changes by \\\\pi, along with a \\\\pi rotation of spin angle. This is in contrast to the 2\\\\pi invariance of condensate wavefunction in a spin-0 superfluid. A vortex resulting from such phase windings is called fractional or half-quantum vortex, in contrast to one-quantum vortex where a phase changes by 2\\\\pi.  (ii) Vortices with integer phase winding and fractional flux in multicomponent superconductivity Different kinds of \\"Fractional vortices\\" appear in a different context in multi-component superconductivity where several independent charged condensates or superconducting components interact with each other electromagnetically. Such a situation occurs for example in the U(1)\\\\times U(1) theories of the projected quantum states of liquid metallic hydrogen, where two order parameters originate from theoretically anticipated coexistence of electronic and protonic Cooper pairs. There topological defects with an 2\\\\pi (i.e. \\"integer\\") phase winding only in or only in a protonic condensate carries fractionally quantized magnetic flux: a consequence of electromagnetic interaction with the second condensate. Also these fractional vortices carry a superfluid momentum which does not obey Onsager-Feynman quantization Egor Babaev, \\"Vortices with fractional flux in two-gap superconductors and in extended Faddeev model\\" Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 (2002) 067001. . Egor Babaev, N. W. Ashcroft \\"Violation of the London Law and Onsager-Feynman quantization in multicomponent superconductors\\" Nature Physics 3, 530 - 533 (2007). Despite the integer phase winding, the basic properties of these kinds of fractional vortices are very different from the Abrikosov vortex solutions. For example, in contrast to the Abrikosov vortex, their magnetic field generically is not exponentially localized in space.

It has also been performed by Danny Kaye, Eartha Kitt, Gracie Fields and Kirk Douglas. According to Albert Mackie's The Scotch Comedians (1973), Fyffe got the inspiration for the song from a drunk he met at Glasgow Central Station. The drunk was \\"genial and demonstrative\\" and \\"laying off about Karl Marx and John Barleycorn with equal enthusiasm\\". Fyffe asked him: \\"Do you belong to Glasgow?\\" and the man replied: \\"At the moment, at the moment, Glasgow belongs to me.\\"Mackie, Albert David. The Scotch Comedians: from the music hall to television. (Edinburgh: Ramsay Head, 1973) :If your money, you spend, :You‚Äôve nothing to lend, :Isn‚Äôt that all the better for you. The song speaks of drink, in a period where temperance campaigns were very common, and shows a typical music-hall attitude to the supposedly tyrannical wife. The monologue accompanying the song is the origin of several popular humorous catch phrases, including \\"under the affluence of incohol\\". The entertainer Harry Lauder was offered the song, but turned it down since it praised strong drink. As a result of this song, Will Fyffe became forever associated with Glasgow, even though he was born away, in the east coast city of Dundee. The song was used in the 1955 film The Colditz Story, but the lyric was modified to \\"I Belong To Colditz\\".

The temple stands on ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska Street, adjacent to St John's Cathedral, and is one of the most notable mannerist-style churches in Warsaw. History The Jesuit Church was founded by King Sigismund III Vasa and Podkomorzy Andrzej Bobola (the Old) at Piotr Skarga's initiative, in 1609, for the Jesuits. The main building was constructed between 1609 and 1626 in the Polish Mannerist style by Jan Frankiewicz. Church doors by Igor Mitoraj In 1627 the church was encompassed with three chapels, and in 1635 Urszula Meyerin, a great supporter of the Society of Jesus, was buried within. Meyerin funded a silver tabernacle for the church. She was also King Sigismund III's mistress, and was politically influential. Her grave was plundered and destroyed by the Swedes and Brandenburg Germans, in the 1650s, during the Deluge. A vestibule was added to the interior of the temple in 1633, and a choir was added three years later. An altar made of silver was installed by Cardinal Charles Ferdinand Vasa in the 1640s. The interior of the church was damaged and looted in 1656. An icon of Our Lady of Graces (Matka Bo≈ºa ≈Åaskawa), a gift from the Pope Innocent X, was introduced to the church and crowned in 1651. Its veneration has been growing, especially since the epidemic in 1664, when Blessed Virgin Mary was believed to save the city.Internetowa Liturgia Godzin In later years the building became more and more ornate, with baroque furnishings and marble altars and floors. Two more chapels were added. When the order of Jesuits was dissolved in 1773, the church changed ownership several times. For some time it was a school church, later it was demoted to the role of the magazine of church furnishings, and then it was given to the order of Piarists. The Jesuits did not get the church back until the end of the First World War. In the 1920s and 1930s the church was renovated. During World War II, after the Germans suppressed the Warsaw Uprising, they razed the Jesuit Church to the ground. All that remained of the four-hundred-year-old edifice was a great pile of rubble. Between the 1950s and 1973, the church was rebuilt in a simplified architectural style. Interior Jan Tar≈Ço's cenotaph by Jan Jerzy Plersch 1753, destroyed in 1944, reconstructed in 2010. The facade is Mannerist, although the interior is completely modern, because very few of the original furnishings of the church were preserved. Inside, there are preserved fragments of a tomb monument of Jan Tar≈Ço carved by Jan Jerzy Plersch in white and black marble in 1753, together with reconstructed epitaphs of Sarbiewski, Konarski, Kopczy≈Ñski and Kili≈Ñski. A painting of Our Lady of Grace brought to Poland in 1651 by bishop Juan de Torres as a gift from Pope Innocent X is also displayed, along with a preserved wooden crucifix from 1383, a baroque sculpture of Our Lady of Grace, from the beginning of the 18th century, and a stone sculpture of a laying bear from the half of 18th century.

It is designed primarily for rowing, but which also handles well under its traditional square sail when running before the wind or on a broad reach. The word is cognate with yawl and yole. Construction Oselvar under construction Until about 1860, yoals were imported in kit form from the area around Bergen in Norway. The traditional small wooden boats were known as either Strandebarmer or Oselvar from Os in Hordaland, Norway. The wooden boats were taken apart and then 'flat packed' for shipping to the Shetland Islands. Instead of sending complicated assembly instructions, they sent Norwegian boatbuilders to re-build them. However, increasing customs duty meant that Shetland builders took over the building but stayed mostly with the original Norwegian design. Strileb√•ten (Oselvarverkstaden) in Norwegian} All the parts of a yoal have a name, perhaps to make assembly easier when they came in kit form, or to make it easier to order spare parts. In many cases, the names of the parts bear a closer relationship to Norwegian than British usage. The descriptive text on this page names most of these parts. There are six boards to the construction of a yoal, they are from the keel up, the gabbard straik; the Hassen Straik; the lower sool; the upper sool; the sand straik, and the upper wup. The boards were fixed to three main frames baands which curved across the keel between gunwales, underneath the tafts (seats), and also to the stammerin or cant frame, near both bow and stern, before fixing to the fore and aft stems. The upper wups were joined by the hinny spot where they met the horn, at the top of the stem, for added strength. The baands were not fixed to the keel, this again adding to the flexibility of the yoal. The baands divided the boat into four sections: the fore room, for fishing tackle etc.; the mid room, for ballast; the owsin room, which was kept clear for bailing, owsin, any water which came aboard, using an owsekerri; and the shot room, which is where the catch was stored. To save the gunwales from wear, at each aer, (oar), position a block of hard wood, the routh, was fixed in position with two wooden pegs called routh pins. Sticking up from the routh was the kabe, a hardwood peg, against which the oar was rowed. The oar was held in position against the kabe by a loop of rope called the humlieband. One notable feature of yoal construction are the gunwales which stop short at both bow and stern leaving several inches of upper board with no gunwale. This is supposed to give the craft more flexibility in heavy seas. The yoal was rowed by three men with a pair of oars each. The men were seated on tafts, which rested on the wearin a wooden support which ran across the three main baands, and for purchase they could brace their feet against a fitlinn, a piece of wood across between the baands. The floorboards of the boat were called tilfers. When wind conditions were baand yoal carried a square sail, hoisted on a wooden mast which was stepped through the mid taft and braced at its base to the mid 'baand' History The yoal was the main vessel used for haaf (open water within sight of land, up to 10 miles from shore) fishing for cod, ling and tusk until the fish shoals moved further offshore at the end of the 17th century, probably due to climatic change. Although yoals were not designed for the far haaf, Shetland fishermen continued to use them for relatively deep sea fishing with attendant accidents and loss of life until the introduction in the mid 18th century of the larger, heavier and deeper sixareen designed for fishing further offshore. Although there were some variations in size the yoal was generally 21ft 5in overall, 15ft keel, 21in inside depth amidships and 5ft 5in beam. George Johnson of Skelberry, Dunrossness, was one of the most prolific builders of ness yoals. Among the yoals built by Johnson, in his later years, were several larger ones up to 23ft 10in overall. One of these, which sadly has gone now, was the Oceans Gift, so named because all the wood for her construction came from driftwood. Unusual features of these larger yoals were that their gunwales did not stop short of the stem and stern like the normal yoals, and some of them had a full fourth 'baand'. Present day Throughout Shetland many traditional yoals, built by Johnson, and others of his era, still exist. Very few are still in regular use, although in the Virkie Marina there are 2 which are used for pleasure fishing. In recent years the advent of yoal rowing regattas has seen an upsurge in the building of these traditional craft. Ian Best of Fair Isle, and Tommy Isbister of Trondra, are the most prolific yoal builders today.

It is a clinker-built boat, evolved as a larger version of the yoal, when the need arose for crews to fish further from shore. The first of the sixareens were, like the yoal, imported from Norway in kit form until the mid 19th century, when increasing import duty made it more cost effective to import the raw materials and build the boats in Shetland. Construction and terminology The sixareen was so named because she was crewed by six men, each man rowing a single oar, unlike the yoal where three men rowed a pair of oars each. The size of a sixareen was about overall, with a beam of . The boat carried a square sail which was used when the wind was favourable, however in light winds or in a head wind the crew could row for many hours to complete their journey. Fishing trips usually were over three days, with the boats making two trips each week when the weather permitted. As with the yoal, all the parts of a sixareen have names, which are usually found only in the Shetland dialect, although many of the names are derived from the old Norse language. The names of the parts listed here include the English name and where possible, the Norwegian name. There are six separate rooms, or sections in a sixareen: The fore head where sails and tackle were stored, the fore room, the mid room where stones for ballast were placed, the owsin room which was kept clear for owsin (bailing) out water using an owsekerri, the shot room where the catch was stowed, and the kannie where the skipper sat at the helm. The compartments in the boat were separated by tafts on which the crew sat, fiskabrods under the tafts which stopped the catch and fishing gear from shifting between rooms, and by baands, the frames to which the boards were fixed. The boards, named from the keel upwards, were the boddam runner, the hassen, the first and second swills, the laands (four boards), and the reebin, the upper board, inside which the wale or gunwale was fixed. At the bow and stern the boards were fixed to the stammerin before attaching to the fore and aft stems. The reebin was additionally strengthened by the breast hook or hinny spot where it met the horn at the top of the stem. History While the yoal was used for inshore fishing, and seldom ventured more than from land, the sixareen was used to fish up to from Shetland. Because of this, and the unpredictable nature of the weather in northern waters, the loss of boats and lives was high. The worst losses were on 16 July 1832 when 17 boats and 105 men were lost in a severe gale, and again on 21 July 1881 when a sudden and violent summer storm claimed 10 boats and 58 men, mostly from Gloup, in the north of Yell, in what became known as The Gloup Disaster. Although it is not clear when the last sixareens were built for fishing, it is likely to be not much later than the late 1880s, by which time it was seen that larger boats were the way forward for the local fishing industry. Two sixareens were built in the 20th century. In the 1980s Duncan Sandison of Unst realised that the sixareen was very much a boat of the past, as there were none left in Unst. With the help of a group of volunteers, after 800 hours work, the Far Haaf, a replica sixareen was completed in 1988, but was destroyed by a hurricane which swept the isles in 1992. Another Far Haaf was built and launched in 1993. It now occupies a special enclosure outside the Unst boat haven. Another sixareen, the Vaila Mae, was built in 2008 for the Shetland Museum in Lerwick, where it can be seen on the water during the summer months.

From mid-1941 until the end of the war it operated a number of vessels, mostly Norwegian fishing boats.The Shetland Bus (D. M. Henderson, Queens‚Äô College, Cambridge) Background Germany launched their invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, and despite the efforts of the Norwegians and the British, the Germans controlled most of the country by the beginning of May. The occupation of Norway and the oppression which followed immediately prompted a number of Norwegians to escape and make landfall in the Orkney and Shetland Islands. Only a few weeks after the occupation began, the first boats of an \\"armada\\" of fishing vessels and other boats began to arrive in Shetland. Many of these boats made several journeys across the North Sea carrying refugees. The boats were of many types and shapes, but most of those later used as the \\"Shetland Bus\\", were from 50 to , with two masts and equipped with a 30 to single-cylinder semi-diesel engine, which made the characteristic 'tonk-tonk' sound. They had a maximum speed of . These engines were very unusual, and spare parts were not available in Britain, but that was easily solved. Norway's largest engine factory, Wichmann Diesel, at the time under German control, was located at B√∏mlo, near Bergen. The agents in the area received messages about which parts were needed, workers in the factory, many of them active members of the Resistance Movement, smuggled them out, and the parts were sent to Shetland with the next \\"Bus\\". There were \\"Hardanger Cutters\\", with a straight bow and long stern from the Bergen area, and the more rounded \\"M√∏re Cutters\\" from the area around √Ölesund. It appeared that the \\"M√∏re Cutter\\" was the strongest and best fitted for the heavy weather in the North Sea. Most of their crossings were done in the dark winter months with storms and heavy seas. Although these crossings were, by their nature, carried out in a manner to avoid enemy contact. The crews managed to equip the boats with several concealed weapons. David Howarth, who was with Special Operations Executive and Norwegian seaman, Per Blystad (1911-1942) invented many of these constructions. The most ingenious of these was a concrete-lined oil drum bolted to the deck. When the removable lid was lifted, a pair of ready loaded Lewis Guns were telescoped into firing position, with the aid of a counterweight below decks. A steel shield came automatically up to protect the gunner. Oil drums were a natural thing to carry on a fishing boat's deck. Once in the North Sea, one of the boats was inspected by a suspicious British Navy ship, all other weapons were confiscated, but they did not find the two twin machine guns mounted on deck! Special low mountings for twin 0.50\\" Colt machine guns were mounted in the netroom, at the aft of the boat. These were not totally hidden, but with the use of folding handles, triggers, aims and shields they managed to keep them just above the edge of the gunwale, and they were easy to camouflage with a net. A similar construction was mounted in the bow, with a tarpaulin over, of the same shape as the covering of the whaling harpoons many of the Norwegian fishing boats had in the bow. At last all of the Bus boats carried seven or eight mounted, ready armed machine guns, and were able to protect themselves against enemy aircraft attacks. In October 1943 three American submarine chasers, , Vigra and Hessa, were delivered, which made the journeys across the North Sea much safer. The submarine chasers made more than 100 crossings with no losses of ships or men. The only damage that occurred on the boats was when the Hessa was attacked by an Allied aircraft.The Shetland Bus (Learning and Teaching Scotland) Boats used in the Shetland Bus operation =M/B Aksel (M40G)= Malakoff & Moore's Slip, Scalloway, Shetland. This slip was one of the links in 'The Shetland Bus'.

Skipper Anders N√¶r√∏y chose the Aksel on the first official \\"Shetland Bus\\" mission, on 30 August 1941. Aksel later made several journeys to Norway with different skippers. On 8 December 1942, Aksel, on its way from Kristiansund, skippered by B√•rd Grotle, sent out a SOS signal north of Shetland. A Catalina flying boat and an MTB were sent out to search for the vessel. The next day the Catalina found the lifeboat with the crew, and the Aksel nearly sunk nearby. The sea was too rough for the aircraft to land, and the MTB had to return to Lerwick before they reached the lifeboat because of lack of fuel. The crew were never found again. Several aircraft and boats searched for days, but the crew of six were lost. =M/K Heland (M5V)= Owned by Sevrin Roald, Arne Roald and Olav R√∏svik, of Vigra. Built by Einar Helland, Vestnes 1937. long, with Haahjem engine. On its first voyage in November 1941 the Heland was skippered by one of the owners, Sevrin Roald, and made for Shetland, with two Company Linge agents Karl Johan Aars√¶ter and √Ösmund Wisl√∏ff aboard. Using the false name M/K Per, it managed to get undamaged through the same storm in which the Blia disappeared, and returned to Norway with supplies to other agents. Another agent transport was made in January 1942. On 27 February 1942, the Heland arrived at Lunna with 23 refugees, among them, Milorg's district leader in the √Ölesund area, Trygve Rypdal and family. Sevrin Roald brought his wife, Inga, with him and they both became part of the land crew in the \\"Shetland Bus\\" operation in Scalloway. As a \\"Shetland Bus\\", the Heland made several tours to Norway, mostly skippered by August Ner√∏, but with other skippers too. There were many narrow escapes, but the vessel always returned safely to Shetland. In 1943, when the submarine chasers arrived, the Heland became a reserve vessel and made transport voyages to Scotland. When the war ended, the Heland returned to Norway and became fishing vessel again. In 1971, it was donated to Sunnm√∏re Museum.

The Vita had a Wickmann engine. The Vita arrived at Shetland on 9 May 1940 with four Norwegian Navy officers and two other refugees aboard. The Vita started as a \\"Bus\\" boat before the \\"Shetland Bus\\" was officially established. Her first voyage to Norway was on 22 December 1940, skippered by Hilmar Lang√∏y. The next was on 27 March 1941, this time skippered by Ingvald Johansen, who became her skipper for the rest of her missions. Johansen's crew were; √Öge Sandvik, H.W. Olsen, Jens Haldorsen and J. Hermansen. In May 1941, they picked up the twelve refugees from M/B Signal (M331A), which had suffered an engine failure and was drifting off the Norwegian coast. In mid-September 1941, the Vita made a journey to North Tr√∏ndelag. Johansen did not always follow the security rules. Once he posted a letter in Norway to his fianc√©e. He told her when and where he would return, and asked her to meet him and come with him to Shetland. The girl got the letter, met him, and followed. In Shetland they got married, and Johansen was not punished. Vita made seven successful voyages to Norway before her last. On 22 September 1941, she journeyed again to North Tr√∏ndelag, this time to Rek√∏y, to pick up some refugees. A traitor had told the Germans about the transport, and the Vita was seized and the crew arrested. The crew spent the rest of the war in prison, while the Germans used the Vita as a watch boat. After the war she became fishing boat in the North Sea again, until she was donated to the \\"Trondhjems Sj√∏fartsmuseum\\" (a maritime museum in Trondheim) in 1990. In 1995 she was taken over by \\"Kystmuseet i S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag\\" (S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag Coastal Museum) at Hitra. She is currently being renovated by local craftsman Per Johnson. =M/B Olaf (M73V)= Owned by Ansgar S√∏nderland and Johan O. R√∏rvik, Vigra. 52 feet long and with a June-Munktell engine. The owners gave their approval to use the Olaf in a refugee transport. It arrived at Lerwick on 30 September 1941 with seventeen refugees. The vessel was handed over to the \\"Shetland Bus\\" operation and Per Blystad from Fana became skipper. In the winter of 1942, the 'Olaf' made five voyages to Norway with agents and supplies, and returning with refugees. The crew on these tours were; Olai Hillers√∏y, Arne Nipen, Leif Kinn and Olav Kinn. On 17 April 1942, the Olaf went to Telav√•g with the Company Linge agents Arne V√¶rum and Emil Hvaal. The agents were discovered by the Germans, and that led to the \\"Telav√•g Tragedy\\", were the whole population were jailed or put into concentration camps, and all the houses burned in revenge for two German Gestapo officers deaths. The Olaf was attacked and damaged by German aircraft several times, but it always managed to get back to Shetland. The worst damage occurred on 12 May 1942. Three crew from the wrecked Fr√∏ya, along with some others, went out with the Olaf to search for a raft with four of the Fr√∏ya crew. They were attacked five times by a German Dornier bomber. The vessel was severely damaged, and some of the crew wounded. One of the three men from the Fr√∏ya, Hans Johansen, later died of his wounds. The Olaf made no more journeys and after the war it was returned to the owners who sold it in 1948.  Boats Lost  ;M/S Vita (H95B), September 1941 :Skippered by Ingvald Johannesen. Seized by Germans in Rek√∏y, Norway. Crew arrested. ;Nordsj√∏en, 20 October 1941 :Nordsj√∏en, a minelayer, skippered by Gjertsen, was sunk in heavy weather off the coast of West Norway. All the crew survived and returned to Shetland on 31 October aboard the M/K Arthur. ;M/K Blia (H197S), 14 November 1941 :Skippered by Ingvald Ler√∏y she disappeared in a storm on the way from Norway to Shetland. The crew of seven and 35 Norwegian refugees were lost. In the same storm, one man was blown overboard and lost from M/K Arthur, skippered by Leif Larsen. ;Sj√∏, August/September 1942 :Sj√∏, a open boat, with Per Blystad and Mindor Berge was in Norway on a reconnaissance mission. They were taken prisoners by the Germans and later shot. ;M/K Arthur (M192B), October 1942 :Skippered by Leif Larsen she was scuttled in the Trondheimsfjord after a failed attempt to attack the German battleship Tirpitz. Larsen and his crew escaped overland to Sweden, but a British agent following them was taken prisoner by Germans and shot. ;M/K Aksel (M40G), 8 December 1942 :Skippered by B√•rd Grotle. Sunk in the North Sea on the way back to Shetland. All six men lost their lives. ;M/B Sand√∏y, 10 December 1942 : Skippered by Harald Dyb, was attacked by German aircraft and sunk. Seven men were lost. ;M/B Fei√∏y (H10AM), January 1943 :Skippered by Ole Grotle. Disappeared on the way to Norway. Eight men were lost. ;M/K Bergholm, 23 March 1943 :Skippered by Leif Larsen. Was attacked by German aircraft and sunk. One man was killed in the attack. Larsen and six men, some wounded, managed to reach the coast of Norway by boat, and returned to Shetland later. ;M/K Brattholm (M172H√ò), 30 March 1943 :Skippered by Sverre Kverhellen. Attacked by a German torpedo boat. Of the crew of eight and four agents, only one, Jan Baalsrud, survived. The rest were either killed in the attack or taken prisoner by the Germans, tortured, and shot in prison. Those boats are the ten \\"Shetland Bus\\" boats that were lost from the base in Scalloway. For different reasons, there were some boats that started out from a base in Peterhead, and some of them were also lost. ;M/B Fr√∏ya (M32G) :A rather new \\"M√∏re cutter\\" which had arrived at Shetland on 16 March 1942, with the agent Knut √Örs√¶ter and four other men from the √Ölesund area. Towards the end of April, the vessel was sent out on a special mission to Troms, North Norway with a crew of seven and two agents. Off the coast of Tr√∏ndelag, the Fr√∏ya was bombed by a German aircraft, and began to sink. They had a small lifeboat, only long, and the skipper decided that only five men could board the boat. They made a raft of empty oil barrels for the others, and the skipper joined the men on the raft. :The five men in the lifeboat soon lost all their provisions, as they were washed out in the heavy sea, and they had to keep up a continuous bailing. They had a sail and tried to steer for Shetland. After several days, with no food and only the rainwater they could collect to drink, they sighted Muckle Flugga. Soon after they were picked up by a ship and told about the four men on the raft. Ships and planes were sent out searching. :Two of the men from the lifeboat were in a very bad condition, and were sent to hospital, while the other three were sent to the refugee camp in Lerwick. After a 24-hour sleep, these three men went out with the Olaf to help search for the raft. They were again attacked by German aircraft, and hardly made it back to Baltasound. One of the three men later died of the wounds sustained in the attack. :Everyone believed that the four men on the raft were lost, but when the war ended, it was discovered that they had all survived. After drifting for twelve days in heavy weather in the North Sea, they were spotted by a German aircraft and rescued. They said that they were ordinary Norwegian shipwrecked fishermen, and were put in a German POW camp, where they stayed until the end of the war. ;M/B Streif (H261B) :The Streif was sent out on a mission to Tr√∏ndelag, with an agent and supplies. The crew were that of the Harald, which had an engine failure. They went out with no navigator, because he had fallen ill, and there was no other available. The voyage to Norway went well, but on their return, the engine stopped, and they started drifting. After some days they managed to start the engine again, but they had no idea where they were. One day they saw a British plane, and flashed a signal. The plane turned eastward, and they believed that they were west of Shetland, and steered south, as they were bound for Peterhead. :After some time, they grounded on a sandbank. They realized that they had reached the coast of the Netherlands, and managed to get rid of their weapons and other suspicious items before the Germans arrived. They told a story about escaping from the British who wanted their vessel. The story was believed, and all were sent to an ordinary POW camp. If not, they surely would have been executed. By coincidence they met the crew from the Fr√∏ya raft in the camp, and joined them until the war ended. :The Streif stayed in The Netherlands, and the owner's son has said that long after the war, he received letters with questions about the engine. ;Bod√∏ :The fishing vessel Bod√∏ was sent out from Peterhead to South Norway on 1 January 1943, with commandos for \\"Operation Carhampton\\". On her return, the Bod√∏ hit a mine near the Scottish coast, and the whole crew were lost. One of her crew, Olaf Skarpenes, has his name on the monument in Scalloway.

Gopal Rao and Gopu Subburaya Chettiar played a pivotal role in the growth of the school. The Chairman of Kumbakonam Municipality, Shri. P. Thambusamy Mudaliar offered his plantain grove of 100,800 square feet for the school, at a low price. The foundation stone for the main building was laid by Porter on 29 December 1881. In 1885, the two houses in which the school had functioned were sold at the cost of Rs. 10,500. In 1887, a committee that consisted P. Thambusamy Mudaliar, A.C. Narayana Iyer and V. Krishna Iyer was formed to supervise the construction of the school building. Taking a school which was in Pondicherry as a model, this school was constructed in 1891 at the cost of Rs. 58,000. In 1892, the building was opened by Dr. Duncan, Director of School Education. Since its inception, the institution was always run by a group of people belonging to Kumbakonam town. It is today an aided institution of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The motto of this school is 'TRUTH, HONOUR, SERVICE AND SACRIFICE'.http://thsskumbakonam.com/ In July 1978, the school was upgraded to a higher secondary school. K. Baladandayuthapani is the current secretary and correspondent of the school while R. Raman is the headmaster. The school releases a bimonthly magazine called HARMONY to develop the writing skills of the students in English. It also has an English Literary Club.

He is mainly known for writing about the genre of heavy metal music. The senior editor and co-founder of Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles, he has additionally written over twenty books that both critically evaluate heavy metal and document its history. He has been called \\"heavy metal's most widely recognized journalist\\" by his publisher. Popoff lives in Toronto, Ontario. Career Born in Castlegar, British Columbia, Popoff's interest in heavy metal began as a youth in Trail, British Columbia, in the early 1970s, when bands such as Led Zeppelin and Iron Butterfly were in the collections of the older brothers and cousins of Popoff and his friends. Black Sabbath played even heavier music, and became the group his circle of friends thought of as \\"our band, not the domain of our elders\\". Other heavy rock albums of the era, such as Nazareth's Razamanaz and Kiss' Hotter Than Hell, further shaped his emerging musical tastes. Angel City and April Wine were among Popoff's favourite bands as a teenager. Of popular music magazines around at the time, Popoff recalls being a regular reader of Circus, Hit Parader, and later, Kerrang! blew our minds.\\" Popoff does not identify any specific writers as being particularly influential on his own writing style, saying \\"it never registered who wrote what.\\" Popoff received a B.A in English from the University of Victoria in 1984 and an MBA in marketing at McMaster University in 1987, working for Xerox before co-owning a print brokering company. For a while in the 1980s he also played drums in a bar band called Torque. In 1993 he released his first book, the independently published Riff Kills Man!: 25 Years Of Recorded Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, a collection of 1,942 critical reviews of heavy metal records. Shortly after its publication he co-founded Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles, which released its first issue in 1994. He soon returned to his reviews book, releasing a revised and expanded version in 1997 titled The Collector's Guide To Heavy Metal, which almost doubled the original book's number of reviews to 3,700. In the book he identifies three major stages in the early development of heavy metal. The first stage, \\"invention\\", took place in 1970 with the release of Deep Purple in Rock coinciding with debut albums from Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep. Stage two, \\"re-invention\\", occurred in 1976 with Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny. The third stage, \\"re-intensification\\", happened in 1984 with the release of Metallica's Ride the Lightning. In the 2000s Popoff revised and expanded his Collector's Guide one more time, splitting it up by decade into three separate volumes comprising a total of 6,763 albums spanning three decades of heavy metal. Volume 3: The Nineties was published in 2007. Popoff has stated that he considers the greatest record of all time to be Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti, followed by Black Sabbath's Sabotage. He has also named Queen's self-titled debut as his personal favourite record of all time, and often regards Max Webster as his all-time favourite band. Newer groups that Popoff has spoken highly of include Mastodon, Opeth, Lamb of God and Dark Tranquillity. His Collector's Guide became rather notorious in some circles of rock fans for a particularly scathing review of Def Leppard's worldwide smash hit glam metal album Hysteria, to which he awarded a score of zero (out of ten). Popoff continues to defend his opinion of it years later, citing \\"just awful production, lyrics, singing, clich√©s of every musical and lyrical sort.\\" A number of Popoff's other books are biographies of notable metal bands, including Black Sabbath in Doom Let Loose and Dio in Light Beyond The Black. While the biographies are usually not officially authorized, a large amount of research consists of interviews between Popoff and members of each band. Popoff has said of his relationship with his subjects: \\"I censor myself because I don't want to write something to hurt people. You write a book on Sabbath and you don‚Äôt want to write something to hurt (their) families - I love those guys.\\" A Judas Priest biography, Heavy Metal Painkillers, was published in 2007. In 2014 Popoff stated that he is working on a new book, entitled Who Invented Heavy Metal? On March 6, 2015 Popoff told Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi that he had finished writing the book and it will be published in approximately a month's time.

International career At international level, Barbieri most notably represented Italy 1924 Summer Olympics football tournament. Managing career As a manager, Barbieri led L'Aquila Calcio during the 1933‚Äì34 season, winning the Italian 1st Division Championship and bringing the team to serie B for the first time. He later worked with Atalanta in Serie B between 1936 and 1938, before coming back to Genoa, now as a coach, in 1939. In 1944 won campionato Alta Italia 1944 (champion of Italy de facto) with Spezia. Style of management Barbieri have introduced the sweeper role to Italian football during his time as Genoa manager. Influenced by Karl Rappan's verrou, he made several alterations to the English WM system (known as the sistema in Italy), which led to his system being described as mezzosistema. His system used a man-marking back-line, with three-man-marking defenders and a full-back who was described as a terzino volante (or vagante, as noted at the time by former footballer and Gazzetta dello Sport journalist Renzo De Vecchi); the latter position was essentially a libero, which was later also used by Giuseppe Viani in his vianema system, and Nereo Rocco in his catenaccio system. The team's midfield played in a triangular shape, with the centre-half-back ‚Äì known as the centromediano metodista or \\"metodista,\\" in Italy ‚Äì fielded in front of the back-line. His formation also made use of three forwards in attacking trident, but the right-sided winger was also tasked with assisting the midfield defensively, and therefore acted in the manner of a right-sided wide midfielder, known as the tornante in Italian football.cbcsports.com 1962 Chilefifa.com Intercontinental Cup 1969 Honours =Player= ;Genoa *Italian Football Championship: 1922‚Äì23, 1923‚Äì24 =Manager= ;Spezia *campionato Alta Italia 1944 References External links *OttavioBarbieri.com 1899 births 1949 deaths Italian footballers Italy international footballers Association football midfielders Serie A players Serie B players Olympic footballers of Italy Footballers at the 1924 Summer Olympics Italian football managers Atalanta B.C. managers Genoa C.F.C. players ","title":"Ottavio Barbieri"},{"id":"13196646","text":"The 2007 Batna bombing took place on 6 September 2007 in Batna, a town in Batna Province, eastern Algeria.

The use of zinc in organic reactions was common at that time, but it was subsequently replaced by the more convenient magnesium. This was not possible for the reaction of Œ±-chloro acids with ketones, because the magnesium based Grignard reagents are more reactive and lead to other products. This made the Reformatsky reaction a convenient way for the synthesis of Œ≤-hydroxy acids which were difficult to obtain with other methods.

The area began to develop in the Taish≈ç period with the development of the Meitetsu Inuyama train line. The town of Shikatsu was created on April 1, 1961, followed by Nishiharu on November 1, 1963 as the population increased due to increasing industrialization of the area. The two towns were merged to create the city of Kitanagoya on March 20, 2006. Government Kitanagoya has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 21 members. The city contributes two members to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aichi District 5 of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Economy Due to its location adjacent to the Nagoya metropolis, which is only ten minutes away by express train, Kitanagoya is largely a commuter town. However, agriculture is also highly developed, using the productive fertile soil and land with an alluvial fan created by Kiso and Sh≈çnai River.Kitanagoya.lg.jp Education Kitanagoya has ten public elementary schools and six public junior high schools operated by the city government, and one public high school operated by the Aichi Prefectural Board of Education.

It opened in 1838, and used the unusual track gauge of 5 ft 6 in (1,676 mm). In 1848 it changed to standard gauge and connected to the emerging Scottish railway network. It was absorbed by the larger Caledonian Railway, but when the North British Railway completed the construction of the Tay Bridge in 1878, it was granted part ownership of the line to enable it to form its main line to Aberdeen, so the line became the Dundee and Arbroath Joint Line. The main line is in use at the present day (except for the terminals at each end) as part of the Dundee to Aberdeen main line. History =A scheme agreed= System map of the Dundee and Arbroath RailwayDundee had for centuries been a centre of trade on the Firth of Tay, but Arbroath too was an important port and manufacturing centre. The turnpike road and coastal shipping were both in heavy use connecting the two places. A railway had been proposed in 1826, but not proceeded with. In 1831 an inland-facing line had been opened; it was the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, designed to connect the port with the fertile agricultural area of Strathmore. As it had challenging terrain to traverse, crossing the range of the Sidlaw Hills, it had been built with three steep inclines worked by stationary steam engines. Its financial performance, like its operational performance, had been disappointing. Now in 1834 George Matthewson was asked to survey the possible route of such a line. He found that a line was feasible and his calculations suggested a return of 8 to 10% on capital. This was reported locally in the press, and generated considerable enthusiasm. A public meeting was held on 12 October 1835, and it was agreed to prepare a Parliamentary Bill; Grainger and Miller were asked to execute the full survey required for the purpose. Three weeks later John Miller presented his survey and findings; the line could be built for ¬£85,000 including land acquisition and rolling stock, and would return 7.5%. ¬£94,000 was subscribed immediately at the meeting, and the remarkable step was taken of increasing the subscription list to ¬£100,000 to mollify those intending investors who had not been able to subscribe at the meeting itself. =Authorisation= The Bill was presented to the 1836 session of Parliament, and passed on 19 May 1836: the Dundee and Arbroath Railway was incorporated, with capital of ¬£100,000. On the same day another Arbroath line got its Act: the Arbroath and Forfar Railway had been engineered by Miller's senior partner, Thomas Grainger. Lord Panmure had been energetic in promoting the railway and now, as chairman, he generously granted much of the necessary land for the line at a nominal rent, keeping the cost of the line low. Grainger and Miller settled on the track gauge of 5 ft 6in (1,676 mm). They did not conceive of the likelihood of interoperability with other lines (although the A&FR; was considered a partner of the Dundee and Arbroath and was to use the same gauge), and selected the gauge as a compromise between the (English) standard gauge and the broad gauge of I K Brunel.The nearby Dundee and Newtyle Railway used a different gauge, 4ft 6.5in (1,384 mm). The line was to run close to the coast between the two termini, but a branch was authorised to Almericloss,There are several alternate spellings of the location. an area close to the A&FR; station where it was expected that there would be an interchange depot. The main Arbroath terminal was to be at Lady Loan, on the sea front and a little short of the harbour. At Dundee the station was to be at Trades Lane, close to the expanded dock complex then under construction. =Construction and opening= The main line of the railway was almost level, and construction proceeded well enough; however at this early date contractors were not well equipped to handle large contracts and some of them experienced difficulties with cash flow: in July 1837 more than half the contractors for the construction of the line were bankrupt from this cause. The permanent way was 48 lbs/yard parallel rails held in chairs on stone blocks. By October 1838 the majority of the line was ready for a ceremonial opening, held on 6 October. The line was open from Lady Loan in Arbroath to Craigie Crossing, about two miles (3 km) short of Dundee. The Almericloss branch at Arbroath had been forgotten for the time being. The public opening of the line took place on 9 October 1838. The cost overrun was 74.4%. The reason for the opening stopping short of Dundee itself now emerged: the westward progress of construction took the line directly to the water's edge, and the uncertain ground there required a causeway; in the final approach to Dundee the line passed across the frontage of industrial premises, severing their access to the river. After some delay the railway came to an amicable agreement with the proprietors, which seems to have involved paying them to relocate their works to the river side of the new line. The area in question was known as the Carolina Port (near the present-day Market Street). From there the Dundee Harbour Trustees had secured control of the railway's planned construction: the harbour was being greatly extended at the time. This section was built under their supervision, and was known as the Trades Lane and Carolina Port Railway owned by them; it was leased to the Dundee and Arbroath Railway but remained the property of the Dundee Harbour Trustees (until 1907). The causeway was constructed, and the railway was opened westward to a temporary \\"Dundee\\" terminus at Roodyards (close to the present Roodyards Road); this opening took place on 3 June 1839. Ten months later the final extension took place, to the Trades Lane terminus: the station was in the angle between the present day Marketgait and Camperdown Street. It opened on 1 April 1840. The building was said to be very basic and primitive. The initial passenger train service was two return trips daily augmented by a third on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Passenger revenue exceeded expectations and soon climbed to 66% of income (by 1843). The line was single track but right hand running applied at passing places, until the regauging of 1847.Marshall, page 37 The locomotives at first were named Wallace, Griffin, Fury and Rapid; they had the 2-2-2 wheel arrangement with 13 inch cylinders and an 18-inch stroke. Whishaw says \\"the steam is not allowed to blow off to waste, but is admitted to the tank of [the] tender, to raise the temperature of the water.\\" The average velocity (he says) \\"is about 21 miles an hour; but in parts of the journey it is considerably above 30 miles an hour.\\" =Part of a Scottish network= The line had been planned for purely local transits, with only a possible link with the Arbroath and Forfar line in mind. In the years following the opening of the line, the notion of a railway network in Scotland gathered support; such a network was already forming in England, and controversy was seen everywhere in the press over a route from central Scotland to England; which route would be practicable? That discussion lent further weight to ideas of trunk railways in Scotland, and the availability of cheap money led to a frenzy of railway promotions. In the 1845 Parliamentary session, the Caledonian Railway was authorised, capital ¬£1.5 million, to build from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Carlisle, there joining the English system; but in addition the Scottish Central Railway (Castlecary to Perth), the Scottish Midland Junction Railway (Perth to Forfar), the Aberdeen Railway (Forfar to Aberdeen) and the Dundee and Perth Railway were all authorised on the same day, 31 August 1845. Alliances had already been forged between several of them: the Caledonian Railway in particular saw itself as the controller of a large network throughout much of Scotland. The Caledonian board approved a lease of the D&AR; at 8% annual charge, although this was repudiate later. All these lines were going to be made on the standard gauge, and suddenly the two Arbroath lines saw that their unique gauge was a major disadvantage. The directors of the newly authorised Dundee and Perth line met with the Dundee and Arbroath and the Arbroath and Forfar directors in London on 19 May 1845; it was agreed that the two Arbroath lines would convert their track gauge, and make the connection to Almericloss that had been authorised originally; and that they would encourage the Aberdeen Railway to form a connection making a line from Dundee to Aberdeen. This required an authorising Act, and the Dundee and Arbroath Extensions Act was passed on 3 July 1846. As well as the gauge change and the Almericloss line, this authorised a branch at Broughty Ferry to the Harbour. There was (of course) a ferry there,A passenger ferry; the community had been known as Broughty Ferry since at least 1826. and the Dundee and Arbroath had a station nearby, but not immediately at the ferry pier. The Edinburgh and Northern Railway was building a line from Burntisland to Ferryport-on-Craig, on the Fife side of the Tay, and to Perth. The E&NR; would be making possible journeys from Edinburgh to Dundee (by two ferry crossings, of the Forth and the Tay) and was known to be considering expansion on the north side of the Tay. The Broughty Ferry branch was intended to forestall an unwelcome incursion by the E&NR.; The gauge change meant that considerable sums of money were required, as rolling stock needed to be converted or acquired as well. The Arbroath connecting line and the gauge change were completed on 23 December 1847, and the Broughty Ferry branch was opened in May 1848. It made a triangular junction with the main line, occupying the alignment of the present-day St Vincent Street, but on 1 May 1851 it was replaced with a single connection in a more easterly position, facing Arbroath only, and requiring a reversal for trains to Dundee. In July or August 1847 the street running connection between the Dundee and Arbroath and the Dundee and Perth line was opened. From 1851 to 1907 it was leased to the D&AR; by the Harbour Commissioners who owned it; only horse traction was allowed on it. =Proposals to lease to the Dundee and Perth and make a cross-Dundee line= By this time the company was trading successfully, but considerations of the wider railway network led it to agree to lease its line to the Dundee and Perth Railway, this to take effect on 30 April 1847. The D&PR; would have a terminus at the west end of the city, and the D&AR; terminus was at the east end. The arrangement was to include a new line linking the routes by a high level line sweeping round the north of the city. The proposal was authorised by the Dundee and Perth Railway (Dundee Junction) Act, 1848 although it had been strongly objected to by the Council of Dundee, and the Dundee and Arbroath Railway Lease Act was obtained later in the same session (on 31 August 1848) authorising the lease and changing the name of the Dundee and Perth Railway to the Dundee and Perth and Aberdeen Railway Junction Company. However the lease was not put into effect, and the promised 8% lease charge was felt to be unsustainable in the changed financial climate. The two companies disengaged from 9 March 1850, authorised by Act of 15 July 1850. =The Carmyllie line= In June 1854 it was announced that an agreement had been finalised with The Marquess of Dalhousie to work a line he was proposing to build privately, from quarries at Carmyllie to Elliot. This opened in 1855 and became known as the Carmyllie Railway. =A better Dundee terminus= The Trades Lane terminal had long been criticised as inadequate, and in 1850 steps were taken to improve matters. Dock Street ran along the alignment of the present-day Camperdown Street, and was diverted northwards into its present- day position to allow for the larger station premises; the line to the original station had been extended to connect to the Dundee and Perth station; it ran through the streets and only horse drawn transfer movements were permitted, although these apparently included passenger movements.Marshall, page 39 This was retained, and the new station joined the earlier alignment at Camperdown Junction, named after the adjacent dock basin. The new station, Dock Street, was opened on 14 December 1857; it was renamed Dundee East in 1858, and the track in the old station was removed in January 1858. =The Scottish North Eastern Railway= The several independent railways in the area north of Falkirk had experienced changing allegiances, and at one time amalgamations had been frowned on by legislators. However, by Act of 29 July 1856 the Scottish North Eastern Railway was formed, by merging the Aberdeen Railway and The Scottish Midland Junction Railway. This new company controlled the line from Perth and Arbroath to Aberdeen, and the Dundee and Arbroath line saw its future more positively in that group: it agreed to be vested in the SNER from 31 January 1862; this was ratified by Act of 28 July 1863, bringing about the end of the independent existence of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway. At this time the Dundee and Perth Railway had become part of the Scottish Central Railway (SCR); relations between the SNER and the SCR were not always harmonious, and the two lines were only connected at Dundee by the limited street running section. However, the SNER and the SCR were not to last long: they sold their lines to the Caledonian Railway, the SNER doing so in 1866, and the D&AR; line went with it. Now the Caledonian Railway controlled the network north and east of Perth. =Dundee and Forfar direct line= The SNER had obtained an Act of Parliament for a direct line from Dundee to Forfar in 1864, but the work was not put in hand. After the Caledonian Railway took over the Scottish North Eastern Railway, it prepared plans for a different alignment, joining the Arbroath line at Broughty Ferry. The Dundee and Forfar Direct Line opened in 1871. It diverged from the D&A; line at Broughty Ferry, leaving towards the south and climbing before turning north and crossing the main line, running through hilly and sparsely populated terrain to Forfar. =The North British Railway= The North British Railway was dominant in its network in Fife and had long aspired to cross the Firth of Tay by a bridge. Its trains already ran to Dundee, crossing the Tay by ferry (referred to as a \\"floating bridge\\") from Tay-Port to Broughty Ferry, from where they were \\"shunted into Dundee on a Caledonian branch\\", paying a charge of ¬£10,000 annually for the privilege, which was much resented. Two trains a day ran to Aberdeen from Burntisland using the ferry and the D&AR;, using their own locomotives. During some arcane railway politics in 1866 the Caledonian had given an assurance that they would not oppose Parliamentary proceedings for a Tay Bridge at Dundee, and would transfer the Dundee and Arbroath line to joint ownership. The NBR had previously made attempts to get authorisation for a bridge crossing and been rebuffed, but now in 1869 a definite proposal found widespread support. On 15 July 1870 the North British Railway (Tay Bridge and Railways) Act was passed. Construction was not without its problems, but the bridge was formally opened on 31 May 1878. On the Dundee side the bridge landed by Magdalen Green and curved east alongside the existing Dundee and Perth line; considerable land had been reclaimed from the Tay. There was a new through station near Craig Pier: the present day station, immediately to the south of the D&PR; Dundee West terminus. The line continued in a cut-and-cover tunnel under Dock Street (now Marketgait) emerging at Camperdown junction, immediately east of the Dundee East terminus. At last Dundee had a through west to east railway, as well as the bridge to Fife. On 28 December 1879 the bridge fell during an extremely strong storm, taking a train down with it. 74 or 75 persons lost their lives. The Broughty Ferry, which had been discontinued on the opening of the bridge, was resumed, and NBR trains for the train ferry now used the new Tay Bridge station. The NBR was anxious to provide a replacement bridge as soon as possible, and notwithstanding the financial and social difficulties, the new bridge was inaugurated on 20 June 1887. =The Dundee and Arbroath Joint Line= Dundee and Arbroath Joint Line in 1880The NBR had planned for many years to extend to Aberdeen, and the Tay Bridge was only part of that plan. In 1871 it had been authorised to build a line from St Vigeans Junction (immediately north of Arbroath) to Kinnaber Junction, north of Montrose; this line was fully open by 1883. During the process of building the (first) Tay Bridge, the NBR had petitioned Parliament for the Dundee and Arbroath section (the former D&AR; now owned by the Caledonian) to be transferred to joint ownership. When the SNER had been created in 1856 there had been concerns about monopolistic power of large railway companies, and Parliament was amenable to the change, which would enable the NBR to operate a service between Edinburgh and Aberdeen relatively independently. This transfer was mandated by the North British Railway (Dundee and Arbroath Joint Line) Act of 21 July 1879, to take effect on 1 February 1880. (The Tay Bridge fell in the intervening period.) The whole of the original Dundee and Arbroath line from Camperdown Junction to the Arbroath joint station was included, as well as the former A&FR; section from there to St Vigeans Junction, the Carmyllie branch and the Arbroath Harbour branch. The Caledonian Railway received ¬£171,566 in compensation, after arbitration by the Railway and Canal Commission. The NBR already had been granted running powers over the Aberdeen section of the Caledonian Railway, so it now had a viable route from Edinburgh to Aberdeen via Dundee and Montrose. In addition there had previously been working agreements for Dundee East station for goods and passenger purposes, and these continued. The train service was operated in alternate years by the two owning companies until 1929. Proposals in the first years of the twentieth century to expand the track facilities around Dundee East were frustrated by obstruction from the Dundee Port Authority, who feared loss of business. However the ownership of the section closest to Dundee East was transferred to the Joint Line, when the Trades Lane and Carolina Port Railway became part of the joint line, by agreement of 20 November 1906, effective on 28 August 1907. =Grouping; and nationalisation= The Railways Act 1921 caused the main line railways of Great Britain to be \\"grouped\\" into one of four large concerns; the Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and the North British Railway was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). This took effect on 1 January 1923.For practical purposes; delay in tidying up the administration caused the Caledonian to enter the LMS formally on 1 July 1923, but the Caledonian share of the Dundee and Arbroath Joint Line was schemed across to the LMS on 1 January. The train service pattern did not change fundamentally; residential traffic around Dundee had built up in the twentieth century and this continued. On 1 January 1948 the railways were nationalised, and the main line railways of Scotland became part of British Railways Scottish Region. Still the train service pattern was not radically changed, although diesel multiple units were introduced on local services. The three terminal stations were retained for the time being. The decline in local passenger use was a greater factor, and the Dundee and Forfar direct line closed to passengers on 8 January 1955. Dundee East station only handled local passenger trains and as this traffic declined, the requirement for the terminus fell away; it closed on 5 January 1959. =The Beeching report= In 1963 British Railways published a report, The Reshaping of British Railways, colloquially referred to as the Beeching Report. The railways had been accumulating increasing losses with little means of reducing them, and widespread closures and \\"rationalisation\\" were proposed. On 3 May 1965 Dundee West station was closed, all passenger services being concentrated on Tay Bridge station, which was renamed Dundee. The Tay road bridge opened in 1966. The two routes from central Scotland to Aberdeen were unsustainable and the Caledonian route through Strathmore was closed in 1967; all through trains to Aberdeen now travelled via Dundee and Arbroath. =Dundee Harbour Lines= The Dundee Harbour lines were adjacent to Camperdown Junction; train operation on them was subject to bye-laws. From 1931 these included: * Small and light locomotive engines, approved by the Harbour Engineer, shall be used in the conduct of traffic. * Coke, or a mixture of coke and coal only (not more than fifty per cent coal), shall be used for such engines, the use of other fuel being prohibited. The engines shall not be allowed in the sheds except where rails are laid down for their passage. * An iron grating, or other spark arrester ... shall at all times be kept on the funnel of each engine. * There shall always accompany each locomotive or train two qualified pilotmen each wearing a red cap. One of the pilotmen shall walk in advance of the locomotive or train not more than 30 feet ahead of it, and the other shall walk by the side of the train. * Steam whistling shall be practised only when absolutely necessary, and then with great caution, after a careful look-out.\\"Bye-laws made by the Trustees of the Harbour of Dundee and subsequently confirmed by the Sheriff of the County of Angus on 23rd September 1931\\", quoted in Current operations The majority of the Dundee and Arbroath Joint Line remains in use, from Camperdown Junction at Dundee to St Vigeans Junction north of Arbroath. Dundee East station, the Broughty Ferry Pier branch, and Arbroath LadyLoan are closed, as is the Carmyllie branch. Domestic passenger services are operated by Abellio ScotRail, and a limited service between London and Aberdeen is operated by London North Eastern Railway. Long distance passenger trains from other English destinations are operated by CrossCountry and a night sleeping car train to London is run by Caledonian Sleeper.

History  Although the precise circumstances of the naming of Rapid Creek remain obscure, the name must have been applied by Surveyor-General George W. Goyder's surveyors not long after the arrival of the 1869 Northern Territory Survey Expedition. The outline of the creek, running from Marrara swamp to the sea between Casuarina Beach and Nightcliff, is present on Goyder's map, though no name appears on it. Goyder personally visited the locality on Saturday, 3 April 1869 and described the creek, without naming it, as \\"a strong shallow stream near Night Cliff\\". Sometime between then and 13 September, the name came into existence. There is an entry in Goyder's diary for the latter date which records that surveyor George MacLachlan was sent out to Rapid Creek to check on the availability of fresh water and good feed for the horses. On the basis of a satisfactory report from MacLachlan, \\"all the spare bullocks and horses were sent out to Rapid Creek to rest\\", two days later. The name remained in common local usage and it is evident that settlers continued to visit the area regularly. In a book published in 1882, William Sowden described travelling from Palmerston (Darwin) to Casuarina Beach passing \\"Rapid Creek, which rushes swiftly along its bed during the wet season, but at other times during the dry.....its waters are clear and crystal\\". The year 1882 also saw the establishment of the first permanent settlement in the area. Rapid Creek is bounded by the Darwin Harbour foreshore in the north, the Rapid Creek in the east, Trower Road in the south and Nightcliff Road in the west. Rapid Creek was originally established in the late 19th century when it was settled by the German Jesuit Mission from 1882 to 1891, which proved unsuccessful.Rapid Creek (1882-1891), German Missionaries in Australia. Rapid Creek prior to World War II was a favourite day trip / picnic area for Darwin people, along the bush track which later became Bagot Road and McMillans Road. After Nightcliff grew as a seaside suburb in the 1950s, residential development expanded into the Rapid Creek area, primarily during the 1960s. The streets in Rapid Creek are mostly named after early police officers. Nightcliff and Rapid Creek were the first Darwin suburbs to feel the force of Cyclone Tracy which came off the Timor Sea on 25 December 1974. Much of the residential buildings were totally destroyed.  Present day  Rapid Creek is a predominantly residential area and is generally associated with its sister suburb, Nightcliff, and the adjacent northern suburbs of Millner and Coconut Grove. A lot of development has been completed on the coastal road, Casuarina Drive, which runs along the coast from Rapid Creek to Nightcliff. Rapid Creek Sunday Market is the oldest market in Darwin. It's held every Sunday morning, and comprises stalls selling fresh produce including fruit, vegetables, Asian produce, herbs and spices, exotic plants, and seafood. There are also food stalls selling dishes from a variety of cuisines including Indian curries, Malaysian Laksa, Vietnamese rice paper rolls and Thai papaya salad.  References  * Barter, Leith.

He was Local Assistant Keeper of Rona Lighthouse and the part-time postman for the north end of Raasay. Early life Calum was the son of Donald Macleod of Arnish Raasay and Julia Gillies of Fladda. He was born in Glasgow as his father was working in the merchant navy. With the outbreak of World War I, Calum and his mother moved to the croft and house adjacent to that of his grandfather, in northern Raasay. Calum had two brothers, Ronald and Charles, and three sisters, Bella Dolly (died in the 1919 Spanish flu pandemic), Katie and Bella. Calum attended Torran school, with its single teacher, James Mackinnon (Seumas Ruadh). He married Alexandrina (Lexie) Macdonald (1911‚Äì2001). Road building Calum and his brother, Charles, constructed the track from Torran to Fladda (Eilean Fladday), over three winters from 1949‚Äì1952. For this, they were each paid ¬£35 a year by the local council. After decades of unsuccessful campaigning by the inhabitants of the north end of Raasay for a road, and several failed grant applications, Calum decided to build the road himself. Purchasing Thomas Aitken's manual Road Making & Maintenance: A Practical Treatise for Engineers, Surveyors and Others (London, 1900), for half a crown, he started work, replacing the old narrow footpath. Over a period of about ten years (1964‚Äì1974), he constructed one and three quarter miles of road between Brochel Castle and Arnish, using little more than a shovel, a pick and a wheelbarrow. Initial blasting work was carried out and funded, to the sum of ¬£1,900, by the Department of Agriculture's Engineering Department, who supplied a compressor, explosives, driller, blaster, and men. Several years after its completion, the road was finally adopted and surfaced by the local council. By then, Calum and his wife, Lexie, were the last inhabitants of Arnish. Recognition Calum was awarded the British Empire Medal \\"for maintaining supplies to the Rona light\\". The citation could not say for constructing a road which had been the subject of conflict with the authorities for twenty years. Calum's Road has been commemorated in music by Capercaillie on their 1988 album The Blood is Strong and in a book by Roger Hutchinson.Capercailie website A major film was also planned with the rights to the book having been bought by HandMade Films with the intention of producing the film in partnership with UK Made Films and with a screenplay written by the Scottish writer Colin MacDonald. These plans however have not come to fruition. A cairn beside his road near Brochel Castle commemorates Calum's achievements. It is inscribed in Gaelic and then English. This cairn was built by Donald John Graham of Portree, Skye. A song on Scottish band Runrig's eleventh studio album The Stamping Ground, entitled Wall of China / One Man was inspired by Calum's story. A play Calum's Road was adapted by David Harrower from Roger Hutchinson's book. Produced by the National Theatre of Scotland and Communicado Theatre Company, directed by Gerry Mulgrew, it toured Scotland in Autumn 2011 and in the Summer of 2013. Calum's Road, a radio play written by Colin MacDonald and starring Ian McDiarmid, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in October 2013. Gillian Reynolds, in the Daily Telegraph, described it as \\"a story to inspire\\". A dance \\"Calum's Road\\" was choreographed by British circle dancer Cindy Kelly, and it is regularly done by circle dance groups worldwide. Gaelic writer As well as being a road-builder, Macleod was a writer. A zealous and tireless correspondent with local authorities and newspapers, he was also a local historian of some distinction. Some, but by no means all, of his writings were published during his lifetime as articles in the Gaelic periodical Gairm, while others have been posthumously collected, translated, and edited by his daughter Julia Macleod Allan as F√†sachadh An-Iochdmhor Ratharsair: The Cruel Clearance of Raasay (Cl√≤ √Ärnais, 2007). =Published writings= 'An G√†idheal gaisgeil', Gairm, 111-12 (Summer/Autumn, 1980), 223‚Äì42; 113 (Winter, 1980-1), 65‚Äì78.

This was one of the most important innovations in the history of the horn, comparable with Heinrich St√∂lzel's development of the first valve horn in 1817. It was this development that enabled the horn repertoire of Mozart, Weber and others to be written. Hampel was born in Prague, but worked in Dresden, Germany, with instrument maker Johann Georg Werner, collaborating on the design of the so-called Inventionshorn, which used sliding medial crooks inside the hoop in an attempt to achieve a fully chromatic instrument. Hampel also taught Giovanni Punto, who went on to refine the hand-stopping technique and spread it through Europe, inspiring works from composers such as Beethoven.

He was burnt at the stake in Brentford and is commemorated as one of the Ipswich Martyrs. William Pyckes He was a tanner, and lived in the parish of St Margaret's Ipswich, which occupies the area directly to the north of the town centre, outside the medieval earth rampart. The church of St Margaret's stands adjacent to Christchurch Mansion and Park, which was built during Wyl Pyckes' lifetime. The Mansion stood on the site of the former Holy Trinity Priory, one of the two houses of Augustinian canons in the town, which was dissolved and became the property of Sir Thomas Pope (friend of Thomas More, Wolsey's successor as Chancellor), before being demolished to make way for the new brick mansion built by Edmund Withypoll. The christenings and deaths of the children of Wyl Pyckes are recorded in the register of St Margaret's Church, between 1541 and 1558. He may therefore have been born around 1520. He was a believer in the reformed faith, and was of a hospitable disposition, generous toward the poor, and often opened his doors to give comfort to those who were hunted for their beliefs. He had absented himself from public worship for three years, following the accession of Queen Mary, since the Roman Mass was contrary to his conscience. His name appears in a list of dissenting persons of St Margaret's, drawn up on 18 May 1556, entitled A complaint against such as favoured the Gospell in Ipswich, exhibited to Queene Marie's Counsaile. Pyckes was a diligent student of the Bible, and possessed a copy of the Matthew Bible, containing the translations of Tyndale and Coverdale, which, although bearing King Henry VIII's royal licence, had since been suppressed and became a forbidden book. A presentiment of death Shortly after Midsummer 1556, Wyl Pyckes was sitting in his garden, facing south, with the Bible open upon his knee. \\"Suddenly fell down upon his book, between eleven and twelve o'clock of the day, four drops of fresh blood, and he knew not from whence it came. Then he, seeing the same, was sore astonished, and could by no means learn from whence it should fall; and wiping out one of the drops with his finger, he called his wife and said, 'In the virtue of God, wife, what meaneth this? Will the Lord have four sacrifices? I see well enough the Lord will have blood. His will be done, and give me grace to abide the trial! Wife, let us pray, for I fear the day draweth nigh.'\\" The meeting at Islington A few days after this, he went up to London to take part in a meeting with some forty men and women who met together for prayer and Bible study. This took place in a back close, 'in the field by the town of Islington', the chosen place being a walled garden so that they would not be discovered. But a certain man looked over the wall and eventually greeted them, saying that 'they looked like men that meant no hurt.' One of their company then asked his permission for them to stay there, thinking perhaps he was the owner, and he repeated the same words and went away. They resumed their readings, and suddenly the Constable of Islington appeared among them, with six or seven other men, armed, and demanded that their books should be handed over. Arrest, imprisonment and inquisition Various people, including the women present, escaped either from the close, or from the company as they were led away to the brew-house nearby. But the men were divided into groups and taken away among the soldiers, and twenty-seven were taken before Sir Roger Cholmley, and their names were demanded. Twenty-two willingly gave their names, and were immediately taken to the Newgate. They went with their captors meekly, though it would not have been difficult to escape if they had wished. At first they were offered the opportunity to be released from the Newgate if they would hear a Mass. Those who remained obstinate were then presented an inquisition of fourteen articles, by Edmund Bonner, to which they were required to make satisfactory answers or be condemned. Executions Of the twenty-two who had given their names, thirteen remained constant to their principles and held out against the demands. They were condemned to die, and were executed in two separate groups. The first group, of seven, consisted of Henry Pond (or Houde), Reinald Eastland (or Launder), Robert Southain/Southam, Matthew Ricarby/Ricarbie, John Floyd/Flood, John Holiday/Hollyday and Roger Holland, and were burnt at Smithfield on 27 June 1558. Roger Holland embraced the stake and the bundles of reeds for the fire, making the following prayer: > \\"Lord, I most humbly thank Thy Majesty that Thou hast called me from the > state of death, unto the Light of Thy Heavenly Word, and now unto the > fellowship of Thy saints that I may sing and say, 'Holy holy holy, Lord God > of hosts!' And Lord, into Thy hands I commit my spirit. Lord bless these Thy > people, and save them from idolatry.\\" And so, praying and praising God with his eyes raised to heaven, he ended his life. The second group, of six, consisted of Robert Mills, Stephen Cotton, Robert Dynes, Stephen Wight (or Wreight), John Slade and William Pikes (or Pikas/Peckes), and suffered in a similar way at Brentford on 14 July 1558. Pikes prayed for 'grace to abide the trial', and animated by his faith he approached the stake 'joyfully'. Sources *John Foxe, Booke of Martyrs *N.F.

Castors and wheels are manufactured under the TENTE registered trademark. The history of the company began in 1923 in the district of Wermelskirchen Tente with the sale of ball castors and castors for sliding cupboard doors. TENTE-ROLLEN GmbH in Wermelskirchen is the largest subsidiary of TENTE International GmbH. With the production of castors and wheels for hospital beds, shopping trolleys, furniture and transport trolleys, TENTE developed into the city's second largest employer in the following years.  Founding and development up to 1970  Adolf Schulte founded TENTE-ROLLEN GmbH as a sales company in 1923. The range of products included cast iron castors, piano castors, furniture and sliding door castors, as well as tracks and fittings. The company began its own production from a garage ten years later. TENTE's product range grew continuously during the initial years of the economic miracle. From 1954, TENTE presented its products under the company logo with a Roman chariot at national and international trade fairs. Five years later, the company moved to new factory and offices in Tente- Herrlinghausen. In 1963, the institutional castor with swivel brake was unveiled for the first time, an innovation that is known today as a directional lock. Internationalisation for TENTE began one year later with membership of European standardisation committees. With the move to the new offices in 1965, electronic data processing also found its way into TENTE. In 1968, castor production exceeded 10 million units for the first time. Two years later, one of Europe's first computerised high rack warehouses emerged at Tente.  Development from 1971 to 1999  TENTE South Africa, TENTE's first branch office, was founded together with the Protea Holding Group in South Africa in 1971. In 1973, TENTE-ROLLEN GmbH expanded and started to operate a second high rack warehouse. TENTE USA is situated in Hebron, Kentucky, and was founded in 1979. It develops and produces castors and wheels specifically for the US market. In 1983, Raymond Schulte resigned as managing partner, and Dr Dietrich Fricke, who had been the managing director of TENTE in Wermelskirchen since 1958, acquired the partner's shares. The first steps to present the company with a new corporate identity as a global brand already began in 1985. TENTE acquired competitor 'Hufa-Rollen' a few years later and, thanks to Hufa's international subsidiaries, now has a stronger market presence in England, France, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. Some of these companies were already agents of TENTE before the acquisition was made. 1991 saw the introduction of a new generation of hospital bed castors, which were awarded numerous product design prizes. In 1994, TENTE developed its corporate identity for the 21st century with a modernised logo and a new corporate colour. Two years later, after acquiring the castor division of the company Schulte, the 'Greif' product name was added to the range. The Czech subsidiary has been part of the TENTE company since 1997 and also serves Slovakia. Since 1997 new technologies have enabled the development of further products. Within a very short time, the hospital bed castor 'INTEGRAL' received two design awards. In 1998, TENTE founded a Spanish subsidiary in Barcelona, TENTE Spain, which also serves the Portuguese market. The company celebrated its 75th anniversary in the same year. In addition, expansions to its factory and to the offices were completed, and the third fully computerised high rack warehouse was built.  Development from 2000 to 2013  In the year 2000, the acquisition of BRUANDET, a leading manufacturer of chair and furniture castors, rounded off the TENTE range in this market segment. Since 2002 there has been a subsidiary in Sweden; a 'North' branch based in B√∂nen and a 'South' branch in Nersingen were founded in Germany in the same year. In the financial year 2003, TENTE Polyurethane Parts S.A.S. in Macon, France, was taken over as a polyurethane specialist to further the company's activities in the heavy duty field. In 2005, TENTE founded a production plant and a sales office in Suzhou, China. In the two years that followed, further subsidiaries emerged in Hungary, Finland, Canada, Norway and Japan. In 2007, TENTE-ROLLEN GmbH founded a subsidiary in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, which became a subsidiary of TENTE International GmbH in 2013. TENTE Schwerlasttechnik GmbH, specialising in the manufacture of heavy duty castors and wheels, was founded in 2008. The agent in Denmark (a TENTE agent since 1961) became a subsidiary in the same year. In the two years that followed, TENTE founded further subsidiaries in Italy, Latvia, Russia, Australia and Switzerland. In 2013, two more subsidiaries were founded, this time in Belarus and in the Ukraine.

Thrown into prison, Sehera meets Jafar, Shahryar's former vizier and friend, who tells Sehera the history and fate of Fatima, Shahryar's adulterous wife who was originally his father's latest concubine; unknown to all, Sehera's plan was inspired by Shahryar having mistaken him for her while delirious from an almost successful assassination attempt. When Shahryar entered the cell with the intention of executing them, Sehera says he would happily die for Shahryar if his death gave him peace of mind but wants to tell him a story first, saying Shahryar is free to do as he wishes afterwards.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. As of 2010 the church is being converted into a community facility for the village and locality. History A chapel on this site is first mentioned in 1280. It is likely that this earlier church was timber-framed. The present church was built in 1609. Restoration was carried out in 1862‚Äì63, and at this time a vestry was added to the north side and a larger belfry was erected. Architecture The church is built in ashlar red and buff sandstone with a Welsh slate roof and a stone ridge. The five-bay nave and chancel are in one range, and there is a south porch and a north vestry. Inside the church is a hammerbeam roof. The windows are square-headed, those on the sides having four lights, while the east window has six lights with a transom. The porch contains churchwardens' inscriptions date 1611 and 1775. Inside the church is the framework of a screen bearing the date 1609. The stained glass includes the east window dating from 1885‚Äì87, which was designed by Carl Almquist and made by Shrigley and Hunt. A north window in the chancel, dated 1908, is by Mary Lowndes. External features In the churchyard to the east of the former church is a mausoleum dated 1885 which is constructed in ashlar buff sandstone with granite dressings. It is rectangular in plan with a stepped hipped cap surmounted by a slab with a cross upon it. On the long sides are six short pilasters and on the short sides four pilasters. The side panels are inscribed with memorials to members of the Barbour family of Bolesworth Castle. Also in the churchyard is a sandstone cross from the 11th or 12th century, and a sundial dated 1778 consisting of a sandstone column on an old millstone. All these structures are listed at Grade II.

Her real surname may have been Gienger (or Gienger von Gr√ºnb√ºchl), but that remains in dispute;W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czapli≈Ñski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV i jego czasy (W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV and His Times). PW \\"Wiedza Poweszechna\\". Warszawa 1976, p. 18 she signed her letters Ursula Meyerin. In the German language, that surname means \\"chamberlain\\", \\"administrator\\", \\"manager\\".  Early life  Urszula was most likely born near Munich in Duchy of Bavaria in a poor noble family. She was the daughter of Anna, a Bavarian burgher lady, and (probably) one of the Habsburgs. Meyerin came to Graz as a child in the 1580s. She was pretty in her youth, and some time later was chosen by Maria Anna of Bavaria to become mistress to King Sigismund III of Poland. Maria Anna's own daughter (Anna of Habsburg) was fianc√©e to the Polish King, but was unattractive, and the Habsburgs had bad experiences with two marriages of King Sigismund Augustus of Poland. The girl joined Anne's court in Poland as a chamberlain in 1592.  Chamberlain  Urszula had a great influence on the King and Queen. She was a strict religious person. Shortly after her arrival in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, she acquired knowledge of Polish. Despite that she was very unpopular in the Commonwealth, because she was involved in affairs of state. She used her influence on the King to appoint her favourites to state positions. She was contemptuously called King's mistress, minister in a skirt and Jesuit's bigotry. The King's secretary Jan Szczƒôsny Herburt called her \\"obscene favourite\\". W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sigismund Vasa, c.1605. Meyerin was a chamberlain (See also Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) of the Queen's court. Though she became the senior governess to the King's children and supervisor of Royal Nurses, she was not held in high esteem among them (Urszula was especially loathed by a protestant nurse of prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw, Scottish Mrs. Forbes). After the Queen's death in 1598 she did not leave Poland as did the other German Queen's ladies. The reason was her great attachment to the King and to young prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw. Her tender letters to the prince are sometimes interpreted to contain more than a tutor's affection. In her constant correspondence with the Archduchess Maria she reported in details the life of King Sigismund and his court. I've never seen a man who would cry so much she reported on May 19, 1598, describing the monarch bidding farewell to his children before leaving for Sweden. As noted Stanis≈Çaw Kobierzycki, she replaced the deceased Queen, since she was not unpleasant to the King (as wrote Archduchess Maria Anna). Constance of Austria and her mother Maria Anna of Bavaria during entrance into Krak√≥w, c.1605. When Sigismund III married again in 1605 in Krak√≥w with a sister of his first wife, Constance of Austria, Urszula became her \\"close worries and consolations participant\\". She traveled in the Queen's carriage, dined with her at the same table, administered the court's treasury, and even assisted with official audiences with the King. Meyerin fostered the King's children and spoke to them mainly in Polish (their own mother communicated with them only in German). She never married and rejected all offers (even her great friend Albrycht Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç). As a chamberlain she was very thrifty and dressed mainly in a black Spanish dress. She corresponded with Emperor Ferdinand II and the Pope and received a Golden Rose for an \\"exceptionally virtuous life\\". In 1617 during W≈Çadys≈Çaw's expedition against Russia to regain the tsar's throne, he asked of her intervention in favour of Marcin Kazanowski who came into dispute with the Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz. During the last year of Sigismund's life he was often seriously ill and Urszula become the real Polish Duke of Lerma, leaving him an increasingly peripheral figure. She signed official state documents instead of the King and received foreign ambassadors. After the King's death in 1632 the imperial diplomat Arnoldin Mathias von Clarstein who came to Warsaw, turned with his requests first to Urszula who promised to support him in his efforts to obtain a loan. When Urszula frightened the sum demanded, Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw unexpectedly entered the audience chambers of the deceased King, he found us sitting together, smiled and asked me if it's not the right time for us to deal with the matter on the outside, in the winter garden, as long as uberius coram de quo. Urszula died in 1635 at the Royal Castle and was buried in the Jesuit Church in Warsaw with a solemn burial ceremony, almost like a Queen. Her grave was plundered and destroyed by Swedish and German troops during the Deluge in the 1650s.  Legacy  Silver reliquary of Saint Ursula by Stanis≈Çaw Ditrich, ca. 1600, Diocesan Museum in P≈Çock. It most probably bears the features of mistress of Sigismund III Vasa. Urszula Meyerin died childless. All her effigies, including some by such great artists as Peter Claesz. Soutman or Christian Melich (Polish court painters), were destroyed when the Royal Castle in Warsaw was ransacked and burned down during the Deluge. A few months before her death, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Vasa commissioned a painting, in which she sat in the middle of all the descendants of King Sigismund III, as a guide and guardian of the Vasa family. The canvas had semi-private character and expressed the idea Familia vasorum. It is believed that one of the ladies in the painting Adoration of Our Lady of the Rosary from Sandomierz (1599) depicts Urszula Meyerin. But it is more likely the mature blonde dressed according to Imperial court fashion and facing the King to represent Sigismund's mistress who was almost 30 at that time, than the effigy of a youth brunette in Polish costume as it is supposed.

History  As early as 1658, only six years after the first permanent settlement of Europeans at the Cape of Good Hope, four free burghers were given permission to settle in Saldanha Bay on the West Coast of Southern Africa. They were given the right from the Dutch East India Company to fish the waters of Saldanha Bay and send their catches to the Company's trading post at the Cape of Good Hope, to be sold to other burghers as well as to passing ships in Table Bay. They had sole rights to the lucrative fishing until 1711. One fifth of the catch had to be delivered in salted and dried form, which was the origins of bokkoms in South Africa.  Preparation  The ingredients for bokkoms consists of small (juvenile) mullet (fish), coarse salt and fresh water. The original West Coast way of preparing bokkoms starts with catching the small (juvenile) mullets (called \\"harders\\" in Afrikaans). A large square tank built out of bricks or stone is filled with a strong pickle made of around 50 kg of coarse salt and fresh water, to which the fish is added. As soon as enough fish is added to reach the top of the tank, two or three spades full of dry coarse salt is spread on top of the fish. Thereafter more layers of fish and salt is put on top until all the fish is covered in salt. A thick layer of salt is added to the top. This is left for one day. On the second day, a press made with wood with weights on top, is placed on the fish in the tank. The purpose of the press is to ensure that the guts of the fish is pressed flat so that it does not go bad. After the third day in the tank, the fish is taken out and is then stringed up in bunches of 10 to 25 fish each on a rope, making use of a fish needle which is pushed through the eyes of the fish. The bunches are then dipped 2 to 3 times in fresh water, before it is hung on scaffolds to dry. = Drying = The most suitable circumstances for drying is a lot of wind and not too harsh sunlight. At nighttime, the fish is brought under a roof to prevent it from drawing in damp, and the next day it is taken outside again to hang in the sun. The whole drying process takes about 5 days. More recently, people have started to make use of drying \\"ovens\\". This consists of a closed room with an electrical fan, in which the fish is hung. The fan blows heated air into the room. This simplifies the drying process considerably, since the fish does not need to be moved indoors every evening. This also allows drying to take place during the wetter winter months.  The bokkom industry  Bokkoms is a delicacy typical to the Western Cape of South Africa, and specifically the West Coast. Although it has a significant market in the Western Cape (where it is very popular and can be found in hotels, bars, bottle stores (in UK: off-licence), fish shops and beach kiosks on the beaches and holiday resorts), it has not been able to become a common product in the larger part of Southern African butcheries, fisheries and grocery stores like biltong has. It is, however, available for ordering and shipping through the internet in vacuum packed format. There is a vibrant bokkom industry in the \\"bokkom capital\\" of the world, Velddrif, on the West Coast of South Africa. Around 95% of South Africa's bokkoms are produced in Velddrif, in a series of small individual factories located along the Berg river. Each factory has its own small jetty on the river at the front of the factory. In the past, large schools of mullet was caught in the river and the jetties were used as a place to tie the fishermen's \\"bakkies\\" (small boats) to unload their catch. Because of over-fishing, the catching of mullet in the river is now prohibited and it must be netted in the open sea just off Laaiplek. Velddrif is the ideal place for the bokkom industry. It has access to the mullet just off the coast, its weather conditions are ideal for drying the fish (dry summers and relatively low rainfall), and it has access to huge amounts of sea salt as spring tide pushes the sea over the extensive salt pans (the largest salt factory in South Africa where salt is extracted from sea water, the Cerebos salt factory, is also situated there). It also has access to fresh water in the form of the Berg river. It is thus no co-incidence that the bokkom industry originated and still continue to be situated in Velddrif. The well-known \\"Bokkomlaan\\" (Bokkom avenue) along the banks of the Berg river in Velddrif is a place where tourists can see large numbers of bokkoms strung up in bunches on rows of reed scaffolds along the side of the road.  Eating  Bokkoms is a unique, traditional delicacy of the West Coast of South Africa. It is best enjoyed with white wine, or with bread, apricot jam and black coffee, but can also be used in soups and spaghetti's, tapenades, ragout or just as a bite on its own.SA West Coast Route 27 website: http://www.route27sa.com/velddrif.html  Environmental concerns  There has been concern raised over declining fish stocks on the West Coast of South Africa. The Southern mullet is on the WWF Southern African Sustainable Seafood Initiative (SASSI) Orange list as an unsustainable species. This group includes species that have associated reasons for concern, either because the species is depleted as a result of overfishing and cannot sustain current fishing pressure, or because the fishing or farming method poses harm to the environment and/or the biology of the species makes it vulnerable to high fishing pressure. These species may be legally sold by registered commercial fishers and retailers. However, an increased demand for these could compromise a sustainable supply.  In popular culture  The word bokkoms has been taken up in the Afrikaans language in at least three proverbs: #To refer to a very boring, tiresome, dull person, i.e. \\"a dry old stick\\", in the phrase \\"\`n dro√´ bokkom\\" (literally translated \\"a dry bokkem\\"). #To refer to someone who is incompetent, unable to perform his work adequately, not able to do the simplest of things, in the phrase \\"hy kan nie bokkom braai nie\\" (literally translated \\"he is not able to barbecue a bokkom\\").Elektroniese WAT (Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal) , Buro van die Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal, Stellenbosch : Buro van die WAT 2008 #To refer to someone who is very thin and emaciated, in the phrase \\"hy is pure bokkom en biltong, maar min vir die jakkalse\\" (literally translated \\"he is pure bokkom and biltong, but not much for the jackal\\"). It has also been used as the name for a specific family of plants with sharp seedpods found in South Africa. These plants have been given the name of bokkoms in Afrikaans because the seedpods look like bokkoms, and their unpleasant smell reminds of the strong fish smell of bokkoms.  Comparison to similar foodstuffs  Bokkoms are similar to dried herring, as well as bloaters, kippers and buckling. Bloaters (whole fish), kippers (split) and buckling (head and guts removed) are all lightly salted and smoked for a short period of time. Although the method for making bokkoms probably originated from the European method of making dried herring, bokkoms use a different species of fish (the mullet) and do not regularly make use of smoking in preparation of the delicacy.

The Kyiv city team Start (Cyrillic: –°—Ç–∞—Ä—Ç), which represented the city's Bread Factory No.1, played several football games in World War II. The team was composed mostly of former professional footballers of Dynamo Kyiv and Lokomotyv Kyiv, who all worked at the factory under the occupation authority and were made to produce bread for German soldiers. On August 6, 1942, FC Start played the German team Flakelf. There were an estimated 2,000 spectators in attendance, with each spectator paying a total of five rubles to attend.  Background  1941 Khreshchatyk bombings A Kyiv native Georgiy Kuzmin points out in his book Facts and fiction of our football (–ë—ã–ª–∏ –∏ –Ω–µ–±—ã–ª–∏ –Ω–∞—à–µ–≥–æ —Ñ—É—Ç–±–æ–ª–∞) that the first squads of Dynamo Kyiv included a number of regular Cheka members among whom was Konstantin Fomin. Konstantin Fomin is known to have participated in repressions against Kharkiv sportsmen of Polish descent during 1935-1936.Kipiani, V. \\"Byli i niebyli nasheva futbola\\". From the Polytechnic to the Death match. Ukrayinska Pravda. May 5, 2012. Right before World War II, Fomin also played in Lokomotyv. Because players were not getting paid regularly, the football team of Dynamo for some time had a shortage (only eight players). The team's captain Konstantin Shchegotsky even tried to escape to Dnipropetrovsk, where he played for FC Dynamo Dnipropetrovsk, but was forced to come back. During the Holodomor in 1932-33, half of the team escaped to Ivanovo near Moscow. Two of Dynamo's players, Pionkovsky and Sviridovsky, were arrested by the NKVD agents during an attempt to exchange several cuts of cloth for products and therefore had to work \\"for the good of the country\\" for two years in a penal colony. During the Great Purge in 1938, Piontkovsky, and one of the Dynamo's team creators, Barminsky were targeted, and eventually shot in 1941. The season was never completed, as Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Several Dynamo Kyiv players joined the military and went off to fight. The initial success of the Wehrmacht allowed it to capture the city from the Red Army. Several of the Dynamo Kyiv players who had survived the onslaught found themselves in prisoner-of-war camps. In taking Kyiv, the Germans captured over 600,000 Soviet soldiers. The city was under a strict occupation regime. Universities and schools were shut down; only in 1942 a four-year school for the Ukrainian population was introduced. Youth over 15 years and adults under 60 years old were submitted to labour obligations. Thousands of inhabitants were deported to Germany for forced labour. The Germans controlled the Ukrainian police, who took part in the hunt for Bolsheviks and Jews.  Myth  =Creation= In autumn of 1943 after the withdrawal of the German troops from Kyiv and the reestablishment of Soviet administration, writer Lev Kassil was the first to report about the death of Dynamo players murdered by the Germans. But his report in the newspaper Izvestiya did not mention the football match.Izvestiya, 16 November 1943, p.4.see: The expression \\"Death Match\\" appeared in the newspaper Stalinskoye plemya (\\"Stalin's tribe\\") on August 24, 1946 (#164, page 3) where a film script of Aleksandr Borshchagovsky was published. In 1958, he published his novel Alerting Clouds (Trevozhnye oblaka) about the match. Also in 1958, Piotr Severov and Naum Khalemsky published their novel The Last Duel (Posledni poyedinok).http://www.e-reading- lib.com/book.php?book=1013262 These two novels gave inspiration to Yevgeny Karelov's black and white film Third Time (–¢reti time).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056615/ According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia about 32 million spectators saw it in the Soviet cinemas.http://www.enci.ru/ –¢—Ä–µ—Ç–∏–π_—Ç–∞–π–º_(—Ñ–∏–ª—å–º) The \\"Death Match\\" was also a very popular subject of the Soviet press. None of these publications mentioned survivors of the match. The Start players surviving the German occupation did not show up in public. In the first years after World War II, they were suspected as having collaborated with the Germans. They were controlled and interrogated by the secret police (NKVD).Georgi Kuzmin, Goryacheye leto sorok vtorogo, in: Futbol 13/1995 chapter: –§—É—Ç–±–æ–ª, —Ö–ª–µ–± –Ω–∞—Å—É—â–Ω—ã–π. = In the Brezhnev era = The reports about the \\"Death Match\\" changed in the mid- sixties.

Historical accounts and analysis after the dissolution of the USSR  After the decline of the Soviet Union, journalists and historians in the new state of Ukraine were able to make historical research without being controlled by Glavlit, the Soviet censorship agency. = Eyewitness = The 50th anniversary of the \\"Death Match\\" in 1992 marked the beginning of eyewitness reports in Ukrainian mass media: *Kyiv Radio broadcast an interview with former Dynamo player Makar Honcharenko Partially cited in Honcharenko denied the version that the players were threatened by an SS officer: \\"Nobody from the official administration blackmailed us for giving up the match.\\" *Sport reporter Georgi Kuzmin published a series of articles entitled \\"The Truth about the Death Match\\". According to him the creation of the \\"Death Match\\" legend was a countermeasure of Soviet propaganda to the reproach that the inhabitants of Kyiv \\"did not fight against the aggressor\\".\\"Pravda o ‚ÄöMatche smerti'\\", in: Kievskie Novosti, 22 October 1992, p. 8. *Writer Oleg Yasinsky published his report \\"Did the Death Match happen?\\"O.

Later he interviewed (unofficially) some of the players. All these reports denied the Soviet version: There were no SS officers being referees or threatening the Start team. The Germans played fair, the referee did not manipulate. There were no heavily-armed soldiers with dogs in the stadium. The red jerseys were not a symbol for communist spirit; instead, the players got them from the Germans. Indeed, the Germans arrested nine of the Start players, but the first among them was nine days after the match. Five, not four, players were murdered by the SS, three of them half a year after the match. All the eyewitnesses denied the version that the Dynamo players were murdered as revenge for the German defeat.Russian articles confronting elements of the Soviet version to the eyewitness reports = Historical research = The first genuine historical studies of the \\"Death Match\\" confirmed the reports of the eyewitnesses. Former Generallieutenant of Justice Volodymyr Pristaiko, having been vice chief of the Ukrainian Security Service SBU, summoned his analysis of the papers documenting the arrest and death of the Dynamo players: \\"There was definitively no context to the match.\\" In his book (2006), he published NKVD papers concerning FC Start from 1944 to 1948 as well as KGB documents from the Brezhnev era.35 dokuments, p. 41‚Äì105. Historian Volodymyr Hynda showed that defeats of German teams against local clubs happened regularly. The Ukrainian press, controlled by the Germans, published many reports about these matches. Hynda found information about 150 matches and documented the results of 111 among them: the Ukrainians won 60 matches and lost 36 matches, 15 were draws.  History of FC Start  Articles published in the daily Nove ukrainske Slovo (New Ukrainian Word), controlled by the Germans, the reports of the witnesses and the NKVD documentation allow a reconstruction of FC Start's history. = Organisation of the bakery team = Under German occupation, all Soviet organisations and clubs were dissolved. By the end of 1941, German administration allowed newly formed Ukrainian sport clubs. In January 1942, football trainer and sport reporter Georgi Dmitrievich Shvetsov founded the club Rukh (Movement). He tried to engage the best players in Kyiv. But most of the former Dynamo players, among them the very popular goalkeeper Trusevich, did not want to play in Rukh, probably because they took Shvetsov for a collaborateur. Trusevich found a job in the Bakery No. 1 which guaranteed their workers and their families normal supplies of food. More former Dynamo players found jobs in the bakery. The German director Joseph Kordik, an engineer from Moravia, encouraged them to form a football team: FC Start. After World War II Kordik declared to the NKVD that in reality he was Czech, not German. Three players of the former club Lokomotiv Kyiv were incorporated into the new team. Four former players who were directly submitted to the German administration also played for Start: three Ukrainian policemen and one engine driver of the German railways Reichsbahn in Kyiv. None amongst the Start players had played for the Dynamo team in the years just before the war. Some of them had left the club a couple of years before. = Matches in June and July 1942 = Seven Start matches are documented for June and July 1942: against the Ukrainian teams Rukh and Sport, three Hungarian military teams, a team of the German artillery and the German railway team RSG. FC Start won all the matches, scoring 37 and conceding only 8 goals. = Match against Flakelf on 6 August 1942 = On 6 August 1942, FC Start beat Flakelf scoring 5‚Äì1. The names of the German players are given in cyrillic letters on the poster: Harer, Danz, Schneider, Biskur, Scharf, Kaplan, Breuer, Arnold, Jannasch, Wunderlich, Hofmann.http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Start-Flakelf_6_aug_1942.jpg = Revenge match against Flakelf on 9 August 1942 = With spectators of 2000, the teams met again three days later, in the later so-called \\"Death Match\\". The poster informed that Flakelf had a \\"strengthened\\" team but did not reveal any names. But it named 14 Start players, amongst them Lev Gundarev, Georgi Timofeyev and Olexander Tkachenko, Ukrainian policemen under German command. The score was 5‚Äì3 in favour of Start. Only the first half of the match is documented: The Germans opened the score, then Ivan Kuzmenko and Makar Honcharenko two times marked the 3‚Äì1 score for half time. After the match a German took a photograph of both teams showing a relaxed atmosphere. Some days later he offered a copy to former Lokomotiv player Volodymyr Balakin. This photograph was never published in Soviet times.Foto 2 Afterwards the winners drank a glass of self-made vodka and met at a party in the evening. = Arrest of the players = On 16 August 1942, FC Start beat Rukh scoring 8‚Äì0. Two days later, on 18 August, the Gestapo arrested six of the Start players in the bakery and two days later two others were arrested.  The fates of the Kyiv players  In contradiction to the Soviet version not all of the Start players were prosecuted by the Gestapo. After the war Soviet authorities punished some of them for collaboration with the Germans. = In Gestapo jail = According to the archives, some of the Start players said during the NKVD interrogation that they had been denounced to the Gestapo by Rukh trainer Georgi Shvetsov. According to them, he had been very angry after Rukh's 8‚Äì0 defeat. Therefore, he informed the Gestapo that the former Dynamo players had been officially members of the NKVD. The Gestapo arrested them as potential NKVD agents who could organise sabotage acts in Kyiv. Ukrainian historians are convinced that this version was the real reason for the arrest; also because of the fact that the three former Lokomotive players in FC Start were not prosecuted by the Gestapo. The Gestapo arrested neither Georgi Timofeyev, for having played in the \\"Death match\\", nor Lev Gundarev who was named on the poster but did not take part in the match. Both served in the Ukrainian police. Their names were never mentioned in Soviet publications. = The first two deaths = The Kyiv archives document the cases of Olexander Tkachenko and Mikola Korotkykh as both not having played on Dynamo's first team before the war. Both cases do not show any context of the \\"Death Match\\": *Tkachenko, one of the three policemen in FC Start, had beaten up a German in Kyiv and therefore was arrested by the Gestapo. According to his mother's report, he tried to escape from the Gestapo arrest and was shot by an SS man. At this very moment, his mother came to the police station where he had been taken when arrested to bring him a meal. His case was not mentioned in Soviet publications. *Korotkykh had left Dynamo in 1939 and played in the club Rotfront. In 1942, he did not work in the bakery but in the kitchen of a German officers' club. His name was on a list of former NKVD agents established by Ukrainian collaborators. When he got information about this list, he hid himself. According to some reports, his sister was afraid of the Gestapo and denounced him. During the interrogation, the Gestapo tortured Korotkykh to death. According to some of the players, the Germans found a NKVD identity card in his clothes, but there is no proof for this version in the NKVD archives, which contain only documents about his membership in the Communist Party and about his military service in a NKVD unit from 1932 to 1934 in the Russian city of Ivanovo. = Forced labour in the concentration camp Syrets = After three weeks in the Gestapo prison, eight of the former Dynamo players were deported to the Syrets concentration camp next to the valley of Babi Yar in the outskirts of Kyiv. Nikolai Trusevich, Olexi Klimenko and Ivan Kuzmenko had to work in a group of street builders. Pavlo Komarov, Mikhail Putistin and Fedor Tyutchev worked as electricians outside the camp. Makar Honcharenko and Mikhailo Sviridovsky had to repair shoes for the Wehrmacht. The prisoners working outside the camp were not guarded by the SS, but rather by Ukrainian policemen who allowed their families to bring them food. They spent only nights in the camps; Komorav was chosen by the SS as a Kapo. = Execution of three players in the concentration camp = About half a year after their arrest, Trusevich, Klimenko and Kuzmenko were executed amongst a group of prisoners on 24 February 1943 in the camp. Survivors reported that the bodies were thrown into the mass graves of Babi Yar. None of the surviving players described the execution as a consequence of the match on 9 August 1942. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the match, Honcharenko said on Kyiv radio: \\"They died like many other Soviet people because the two totalitarian systems were fighting each other and they were destined to become victims of that grand-scale massacre.\\"see The reports give several reasons for the execution: * A conflict concerning the dog of the camp commandant Paul Radomski: Some prisoners were said to have beaten it with a shovel in the camp kitchen. In this situation one of the prisoners had attacked an SS soldier. * Punishment for the escape of some prisoners. * Disobedience of prisoners who were ordered to hang other prisoners who tried to flee from the camp. * A sabotage act of partisans on a tank repair facility. = After World War II = After receiving the information about the execution in the camp, Honcharenko and Sviridovsky left the shoe repairing facility and hid in the apartment of friends in Kyiv. By the end of the sixties, Honcharenko became a media figure and often told the official version of the Death Match, but after the end of the Soviet regime he denied this version. Putistin and Tyutchev fled from the camp in September 1943 when the Germans left Kyiv. Tyutchev died in 1959, before the surviving Dynamo players became stars of Soviet propaganda. Putistin was not awarded any honour in 1966. According to his son, he did not want to repeat the propaganda version. Komarov, before World War II Dynamo's penalty specialist, left Kyiv with the Germans. It is not known whether he was forced to come with them as a forced labour slave or was a collaborator. In 1945, he found himself in occupied Western Germany and soon he emigrated to Canada. His name was never mentioned in any Soviet publications. Former Ukrainian policeman Timofeyev was sentenced to five years in the Gulag for collaborating with the Germans. Gundarev, according to NKVD documents a \\"German agent\\", was condemned to death, but later his punishment was changed to ten years in the Gulag. He was not allowed to return to Kyiv; he had to stay in the Asian part of the Soviet Union. He became the director of the stadium in Karaganda in the Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan. Both cases were never mentioned in Soviet publications. = Investigation in Germany = After the publication of a report in a German newspaper repeating the Soviet version,Stuttgarter Zeitung, 5 December 1973, p. 9. a case about the \\"Death Match\\" was opened by the prosecution office of Hamburg in July 1974.No. 147 Js 7/74 As Soviet authorities did not collaborate on the case, it was closed in March 1976. In 2002, the Ukrainian authorities informed Hamburg about their new investigation, so the case was reopened, but finally closed by the investigation commission in February 2005. The commission was not able to find any connections between the game and the execution of people who participated in it, nor any person responsible for the executions being still alive.Disclosed myths about the Death match., Focus, 14 March 2005, Radomski had been killed on 14 March 1945.  In popular culture  The Death Match has inspired numerous films, books, and articles. = Two Half Times in Hell (1962) = Two Half Times in Hell was a 1962 Hungarian war film in which Germans would play against Hungarian labour servicemen of war. = The Longest Yard (1974) = The Longest Yard is a 1974 American sports comedy film directed by Robert Aldrich, written by Tracy Keenan Wynn and based on a story by producer Albert S. Ruddy. The film follows a former NFL player (Burt Reynolds) recruiting the group of prisoners and playing football against their guards. The film has been remade three times, including for the 2001 British film Mean Machine, starring Vinnie Jones, the 2005 film remake, The Longest Yard starring Adam Sandler, and as the 2015 Egyptian film Captain Masr. = Escape to Victory (1981) = In 1981, Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone starred in the film Escape to Victory, directed by John Huston, which told the story of a group of Allied POWs who are challenged to a match against the prison's guards. While the film's POWs are not Ukrainian but rather predominately Westerners, the story parallels are clear: they are threatened with death if they win, the playing ground is surrounded with Nazi guards and attack dogs, the referee ignores vicious and brutal fouls committed by the German team, yet the Allied prisoner team ignore the threat and draw the match, thus risking forfeiting their lives. (Huston's film has a deus ex machina ending which conflicts with the original Soviet story when the spectators storm the field at the match's end and the POWs escape in the resultant confusion, but as no event similar to this actually occurred in the West during World War II, it is generally assumed that this film was inspired by the legendary/propaganda version of the Death Match.) = Dynamo: Defending the Honour of Kiev (2001) = In the Anglo-American media, the publication of a book Dynamo: Defending the Honour of Kiev by the Scottish journalist Andy Dougan inspired many articles.p.e. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18609772; Dougan specialises in publications about Hollywood and has written books about George Clooney, Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. On the front page of his Dynamo book, he exposes his thesis: \\"If ever soccer was a matter of life and death, then it was here.\\" Without giving any concrete sources Dougan\`s docufiction which invented dialogues repeats the Soviet version of an SS-officer threatening the Start players (p. 178). According to him the players were arrested because of their victories against Flakelf. He describes many details which Ukrainian historians revealed as false before the publication of his book: e.g. the red jerseys as symbol of the players‚Äò communist spirit (p. 137), the SS officer demanding the Nazi salutation from the Start players (p. 164), the heavy armed German soldiers surrounding the playground with German shepherds(p. 177-178), Trusevich praising the Soviet regime before his execution (p. 210).Das \\"Todesspiel von Kiew\\", SportZeiten. Sport in Geschichte, Kultur und Gesellschaft, 1.2014, p. 14-17. = The Death Match: Dynamo Kiev vs. the Nazis (2008) = In 2008 Willie Gannon a senior Bleacher Report writer wrote an article about the Dynamo's \\"Death Match\\" that starts with the following \\"This is a true story that I was told by my father...\\"Gannon, W. The Death Match: Dynamo Kiev vs. the Nazis. Bleacherreport. 9 September 2008 In the article Mr.Gannon claims that Hitler in order to prove that he is the greatest military general of all time invaded Russia. Mr.Gannon also claims that Germans entered Kyiv \\"with little or no resistance\\" and Major General Ebenhardt was rushing to stage a game between a German team and no other else but Dynamo Kyiv. In the article the writer also describes that the Kyiv team was always threatened with execution, but played and won every single game including the game against \\"German\\" team Rukh. After beating Rukh 8 to 0, all players were either executed or sent to concentration camp, so no one survived. = Match (2012) = The film Match (2012) by the Russian director Andrey Malyukov, also ignores the reports of Ukrainian witnesses and scholars and repeats the Soviet propaganda version. In the film, Russian communists are fighting against the German occupiers. All the collaborateurs speak Ukrainian. Malyukov became popular as a director of a nationalistic‚Äìpatriotic TV series about Russian troops in the Caucasus and in Afghanistan.http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/260136/ Ukrainian authorities blocked the release of the film for several months because according to them, the film gives a wrong picture of history.http://article.wn.com/view/2012/04/11/Ukraine_blocks_death_match_film/#/related_news Further reading * Anspach, Emma, Hilah Almog, and Taylor, The Death Match!

Career Richard Hudson was a member of Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera, in which he played drums and sitar and sang. In 1970, he and band-mate John Ford joined Strawbs. Hudson and Ford began to co-write material which appeared to be aiming in a slightly different direction to the compositions of Strawbs' main writer, Dave Cousins. In 1973 after a 52-date tour to promote the album Bursting at the Seams, there were acrimonious exchanges (which both parties now regret). Hudson and Ford left to form Hudson Ford. Hudson at this point switched from playing drums to guitar and sang more lead vocals. The punk era sounded the death knell of many progressive rock acts, including Hudson Ford. Hudson, Ford and Terry Cassidy founded the mock punk group The Monks and, more strangely, High Society, which performed a pastiche of 1930s music. Hudson rejoined Strawbs for their 1987 album Don't Say Goodbye and stayed on for 1991's Ringing Down the Years on which he co-wrote two tracks with bass player Rod Demick and guitarist Brian Willoughby. In recent years he has played live gigs with Strawbs and continues to play with The Good Old Boys, alongside original Deep Purple bassist Nick Simper. In July 2009, The Good Old Boys released the CD Live at the Deep Purple Convention.

Set during the American Civil War, the series starred John Hammond, Stacy Keach, Lloyd Bridges, and Gregory Peck as President Abraham Lincoln. It was executive produced by Larry White and Lou Reda, in association with Columbia Pictures Television. A novel of the same name by John Leekley was published as a companion to the series in 1982, based on a story by John Leekley and Bruce Catton and the teleplay by Ian McLellan Hunter. The title refers to the colors of the uniforms worn by United States Army and Confederate States Army soldiers respectively. Synopsis The plot revolves around the families of two sisters; Maggie Geyser and Evelyn Hale. The Geysers are farmers who reside near Charlottesville, Virginia, and the Hales own a small newspaper in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Geysers are generally indifferent to the issue of slavery, but are sympathetic to the Southern cause. The lone exception in the family is son John, an artistic young man who becomes sympathetic to the plight of Southern slaves and free Negroes. The Hales are pro-Union and anti- slavery, but, like many Northerners at the time, they hope for a peaceful solution to the nation's problems. The drama begins in 1859 when John leaves the Geyser family farm for Pennsylvania, where he gets a job as an artist correspondent for the paper owned by his uncle, Jacob Hale, Sr. John's first assignment takes him to the trial of abolitionist John Brown, where he meets and befriends the mysterious Jonas Steele, a former Jayhawker and Pinkerton detective. Jonas returns with John to Gettysburg and falls in love with John's cousin Mary, but is afraid to commit to her, thanks to his troubling dreams that seem to predict the future. After falling out with his family over the issues of slavery and secession during Christmas of 1860, John returns to Pennsylvania, while John's brothers Matthew, Mark, and Luke join the Confederate Army. John's cousins, Malachy and Jake Hale, join the Union Army. The Hales' youngest child, 16-year-old James, lies about his age to join the Union Army, but contracts dysentery and dies before he sees any action. Caught \\"betwixt and between\\", John will not fight for the South, but is unwilling to bear arms against his own brothers. After being reunited with Jonas Steele, who has joined the Union Army as a scout, John becomes a war correspondent for Harper's Weekly. John travels with the Union Army and witnesses many of the important events of the Civil War, including First Bull Run, the Peninsula Campaign, the Siege of Vicksburg, Battle of the Wilderness (where his brother Mark is killed in front of him), Lee's surrender at Appomattox and Abraham Lincoln's assassination. At Bull Run, John meets Kathy Reynolds, the daughter of a senator, who, despite her higher social standing, proves to be a good war nurse. Jonas overcomes his doubts and marries Mary. John's sister, Emma, and her child are caught up in the Siege of Vicksburg, where her husband, Lester is killed. The Battle of Gettysburg is a prominent focal point of the story; Mary is killed as the battle rages near the Steele home. John reconciles with his family as he, his father, and Matthew join a group of Confederate troops in defending the Geyser homestead against a Union Army attack. The Union Army is driven off, but Matthew is killed in the skirmish. Despite being a Union officer, Jonas gains the respect of the Geysers (and possibly a future with Emma) by orchestrating Luke's rescue from a Union POW camp. Later, his strange dream of President Lincoln arrives too late to save the President at Ford's Theatre. The Hales and the Geysers come together after the war to celebrate John and Kathy's wedding at the Geyser homestead in Virginia.

Huguenot forces under the leadership of Gabriel de Montgomery defeated Royalist forces under General Terride in French Navarre. Following the battle, Huguenot forces killed many of their Catholic prisoners. Background In the later half of the sixteenth century, all Aquitaine above the Garonne except for Bordeaux was in Protestant hands. At that time, Orthez was the largest and most dynamic city of B√©arn. It was a market town which served as the main funnel for products making their way to Bayonne for export. Orthez was therefore quite wealthy. One wealthy Protestant, Adrien-Arnaud de Gachassin, had gifted his mansion in Orthez to Jeanne d' Albret in 1555 (today, it is called Maison of Jeanne d' Albret and has become a museum of how wealthy Protestants lived). The Huguenots were therefore desirous of capturing the important and wealthy town of Orthez. En route to Orthez Le Pont-Vieux over the Gave de Pau in Orthez. The opening in the parapet of the bridge is the point from which the Catholic priests of Orthez were thrown to their deaths during the massacre. The Protestant forces of Montgomery and Montamat had left Castres around noon on July 27, 1569. They pillaged along the way, passing through Maz√®res in Foix. The troops crossed the Garonne and the Gave at Coarreze and by August 9, they reached Queen Jeanne d' Albret‚Äôs castle at Navarrenx. On August 11, the troops were on the move again and now headed for Orthez. By August 15, after a relentless siege, Montgomery had weakened Orthez greatly. On August 24, Huguenots captured the town and massacred many of the imprisoned Catholics. Among the victims were Terride, Bassillon, governor of Navarrenx, as well as other leadership and troops in Terride‚Äôs defenses, local clergy, and people of Orthez. A special death was contrived for the clergy - they were thrown to their deaths from the heights of Orthez's Le Pont-Vieux over the Gave de Pau. In addition, the local Moncade castle was destroyed as well as the town‚Äôs churches and many homes. Aftermath Massacre of religious opponents characterised much of the Wars of Religion. Montgomery‚Äôs Huguenot troops committed subsequent massacres of Catholics in Artix, Tarbes, and elsewhere, while a massacre of Protestants took place in Paris and a number of other cities in August-September 1572. Jeanne d'Albret, a leading Huguenot figure. Jeanne III d'Albret (1528‚Äì1572), queen of Navarre, and considered ‚Äúqueen of the Huguenots‚Äù played a leading role during the French Wars of Religion in the vast territory of Guyenne in southwestern France. Her goal was to create a Protestant Guyenne by force of arms. Based on correspondence and the memoirs of Jeanne III d'Albret, as well as the fact that the war was taken specifically to Orthez and Navarrenx by her direct orders, the historian Communay posits that she herself may have ordered the slaughter of the Catholic prisoners. Doubtless, however, the Huguenots were so enraged from the persecution inflicted on them by the Catholics that they could not be restrained from the massacre. The massacre at Orthez occurred three years to the day before the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in Paris, which some historians suggest may have been a revenge killing for the massacre of Catholics in Orthez. In all, both events fit into the bigger picture of the Wars of Religion.

It is arguably the most popular and well-known Soviet synthesizer in the West, likely due to the uniqueness of both its appearance and sound. The Polivoks was designed at the Urals Vector plant, but actual production was handled at the Formanta Radio Factory in Kachkanar, Russian SFSR.\\"The A-Z of Analog Synthesisers Part Two: N-Z\\" by Peter Forrest, page 290. It was intended to appear and sound similar to American and Japanese synthesizers from companies such as Roland, Moog, and Korg. The Polivoks was engineered by circuit designer Vladimir Kuzmin with the appearance of the instrument influenced by his wife Olimpiada,Interview with Vladimir Kuzmin at http://analogik.com/instrument_polivoks.asp who took inspiration from the design of Soviet military radios. Its retail price upon release was 920 rubles and over its lifetime around 100,000 Polivoks were manufactured - sometimes with a production rate of up to 1,000 units a month.\\"The A-Z of Analog Synthesisers Part Two: N-Z\\" But accordingly to information shared by Vladimir Kuzmin only 200-300 Polvokses were produced per month. It means that total number cannot be more than 32000. The Polivoks has some features that are either unusual or uncommon on most analog mono synthesizers including a filter that can be switched from low pass to bandpass and two envelopes that can be looped over the AD sections. Due to its unique history and relative rarity, the Polivoks has become popular as much for its unique sounds as for its aesthetics. It is often used by bands who take inspiration from the Soviet chic movement, as well as the ostalgie phenomenon in the former East Germany.  Notable uses  * The Polivoks was used prominently on indie-rock band Franz Ferdinand's 2009 album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand, especially in the songs \\"Ulysses\\" and \\"Lucid Dreams\\" according to music critic Simon Maes. * The Polivoks was used by the Russian indie-metal band KanZer, in song \\"Pepel\\" and \\"Plat'e\\" * The Polivoks was used by Goldfrapp on their 2003 album Black Cherry. * Polivoks is also being used in trash-electro project of Kuba Kristo, Crashed Disco Balls, according to Bottomlayer.org * The Polivoks was used to compose sound for the 2016 video game Doom.

The district, which lost accreditation in 2011, regained provisional accreditation from the state in 2014. In November 2016, the district announced it had gotten a high enough score on state accountability measures for the State Board of Education to consider full accreditation. However, the state's education commissioner told KCPS she wanted to see sustained progress. The earliest the district is likely to regain full accreditation is 2018. In 2016, the district moved from their long time offices at 1211 McGee in Downtown Kansas City, Missouri to a Midtown location to be closer to district families.  Boundaries The school district serves some of the residents within Kansas City, Missouri. It is bordered on the west by the Kansas/Missouri border line and on the east by the Independence and Raytown school districts. It is bordered on the north by the Missouri River.

The district's annual budget more than tripled in the process. The expenditure per pupil and the student-teacher ratio were the best of any major school district in the nation. Many high schools were given college-level facilities. Despite all the largesse, test scores in the magnet schools did not rise; the black- white gap did not diminish; and there was less, not more, integration. On May 1st, 2000, Kansas City Public Schools became the first district in the nation to lose accreditation. Finally, on September 20, 2011, the Missouri Board of Education voted unanimously to withdraw the district's accreditation status, effective January 1, 2012. In August 2014, the Board of Education granted provisional accreditation status to KCPS in recognition of the academic gains made by KCPS students.http://dese.mo.gov/communications/news-releases/kansas- city-public-schools-receives-provisional-accreditation In the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, KCPS has 13 schools which met the state standard for full accreditation, and another eight which met the standard for provisional accreditation. =Missouri v.

Twaron finds applications in numerous markets, such as automotive (tires, hoses, belts), aerospace, civil engineering, construction, leisure goods (e.g. boats), protective clothing (bullet-, fire- and cut-resistant clothing), optical fiber cables, friction and sealing materials and more. The company has been part of the Japanese Teijin Group since 2000, prior to this they were a division of Akzo Nobel, division Industrial Fibers. Next to Twaron, the company markets Technora, Endumax and Teijinconex as well. History Twaron is a heat-resistant and strong synthetic fiber, developed in early 1970s by the Dutch company AKZO, division Enka, later Akzo Nobel Industrial Fibers. The research name of the aramid was originally Fiber X, but soon called Arenka. In 1973 Akzo decided to use sulphuric acid (H2SO4) as a solvent for spinning. In 1976 a pilot plant was built. In 1982 the name Twaron was introduced. In 1985 commercial production was started on 3 locations and 9 plants. In 1989 the aramid business of AKZO became an independent Business Unit called Twaron BV. In 1995 the capacity was 11.000 tons/yr Since 2000 Twaron BV is owned by the Teijin Group and now called Teijin Twaron BV. Teijin Twaron is based in Arnhem, The Netherlands and main production facilities for Twaron are in Emmen and Delfzijl. In 2003 a major capacity increase to 18.500 tons/yr was completed. In 2006 additional process improvements gave 24.000 tons/yr capacity. In 2007 the name of Teijin Twaron BV was changed to Teijin Aramid BV. Teijin projects an 8- to 10-percent increase in the worldwide aramid fibers market in future years, and is adding another 5- to 10-percent increase in capacity in 2007. On July 13, 2017, Teijin Aramid announced it is going to expand its aramid production capacity for its Twaron super fiber. It will invest in new spinning technology at the Twaron facility in Emmen, the Netherlands, starting up in the first quarter of 2019. On December 20, 2017 Teijin Aramid announced its second intention to increase the production capacity for its Twaron super fiber by more than 25%.

He was a famous and celebrated commander of civilian life-saving crews in the 19th century, credited with saving over 500 lives from the age of about 15 when he first associated himself with the Massachusetts Humane Society until his death at the age of 75 while on duty with the United States Life‚ÄìSaving Service. During his lifetime he was honored with the highest medals of the Humane Society and the United States. His father, mother, brothers, wife, and son were also lifesavers in their own right.\\"Captain Joshua James, USLSS\\", Personnel, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office James was a recipient of the Gold Lifesaving Medal, awarded by the United States Government, along with four medals, a certificate, and numerous monetary awards from the Massachusetts Humane Society. Early life and education Joshua James was born on November 22, 1826, in Hull, Massachusetts. He was the seventh of ten children to Esther Dill, of Hull, Massachusetts, and William James, who had emigrated from Dokkum, the Netherlands as a young man. Little is known of William James's early life except that he was a soldier in the Dutch Army before running away and becoming a sailor. In time he made his way to America, landing in Boston, where he earned a living as a sailor on numerous small schooners that provided paving stones to the city.Kimball, Spencer, Joshua James, Life-Saver, American Unitarian Association, 1909, Boston, MA, at 7, 8, 12, 15, 17-19, 23, 25, 52, and 53. Eventually he made his home in Hull and via frugality became the owner of his own schooner and engaged in the paving-stone business for himself. Esther Dill was the daughter of Nathaniel and Esther (Stoddard) Dill, of Hull, both descended from the early English colonists. Her great-grandfather, John Dill, who \\"for a number of years,\\" was the skipper of the boat which supplied the market at Oliver's Dock [Boston] with fresh fish.\\" Three of Esther's uncles, Daniel, John, and Lemeul, a \\"famous drummer,\\" served in the Continental Army under George Washington during the Revolutionary War. Another uncle, Samuel, appears to have died in the Maine wilderness while serving with General Benedict Arnold's expedition against Quebec in 1775. Esther's father, Nathaniel (1756-179?), occasionally mustered as a fifer, spent most of his Revolutionary War service at Boston Harbor forts, but also appears to have served in the Continental Army early in the War. One of Esther's brothers, Nathaniel, lost his life aboard the 32-gun wooden frigate USS Boston during its engagement and capture of the 22-gun French corvette Berceau in 1800 at the end of the Quasi-War with France, while another, Caleb, died on a military expedition to Canada during the War of 1812. Esther Dill was the only girl in a family of seven children and was sixteen at the time of her marriage to William James in 1808. Not long after Joshua's birth, about 1829, William James purchased the Dill home by the sea along present-day James Avenue in Hull. He was a Lutheran, and it was his custom to read from the Bible he brought with him from the Netherlands. When his children were old enough they were required to read every morning in English from the King James version of the Bible. During Joshua's childhood, there were occasional Methodist itinerant preachers who visited Hull as they had for decades. There was no church building save a one-room schoolhouse prior to construction of a Town Hall in 1848. He was described by his elder sister Catherine that he had a thoughtfulness and reserve that distinguished him from other children. He was the favorite of his father, beloved by his brothers, idolized by his sisters. Joshua was a great reader from childhood on, preferring historical and scientific books, notably astronomy. His preference for practical literature is most likely due in part to his parents, whose strict religious views largely guided the children's choice of reading. Esther Dill prohibited the reading of novels and fiction of all kinds, and forbade the neighbors lending her children novels. On one occasion she destroyed a beautiful and expensive copy of The Children of the Abbey that she found in the hands of one of her daughters. On April 3, 1837, at the age of 10, Joshua witnessed a pivotal event in his life; he was an eye-witness to the death of his mother and a baby sister in the shipwreck and sinking of the schooner Hepzibah in Hull Gut, only a half-mile from safe harbor. Mrs. Ester James was returning from a visit to Boston in the Hepzibah, a paving-stone hauling vessel owned by her son (his brother) Rainier James. As they were passing through the treacherous Hull Gut, a sudden squall threw the vessel on her beam; the Hepzibah filled and sank before Mrs. James and her baby, who were in the cabin, could be rescued. This event was no doubt influential in shaping Joshua's life. His older sister by five years, Catherine, took over the raising the family after the death of their mother. At a very early age Joshua began to go to sea with his father and his elder brothers, Rainer and Samuel. There his fondness for astronomy stood him in good stead, and he soon became an expert navigator. His father in later years was fond of relating incidents illustrative of Joshua's good seamanship and the confidence reposed in him by other sailors. William James continued in the paving-stone trade between Hull and Boston until cobblestones were replaced by more modern paving materials. At one time he had a large contract for filling in the west end of Boston, and owned a fleet of twelve vessels of from 50 to 125 tons burden. It was his practice to give each of his sons on reaching the majority age of 25 a complete outfit for the business, including a new schooner. Joshua, with his deep love of the sea and his early training on his father's and brothers' vessels, was a natural seaman, and with such an outfit provided by his father, entered business for himself, lightering and freight-carrying. Captain Joshua James, as he now came to be called, continued in his chosen profession until his appointment as keeper of the Point Allerton Life‚ÄìSaving Station in 1889. Career Joshua's lifesaving activities began on December 17, 1841, when he was just 15 years old. Five years after the death of his mother and sister, Joshua James leaped aboard a surfboat manned by volunteers from the local chapter of the Massachusetts Humane Society at Hull heading toward the ship Mohawk which was being \\"hammered shapeless\\" off Allerton Beach at Harding's Ledge. He would continue to save lives for the next six decades as a member of the Massachusetts Humane Society and later the U.S. Life‚ÄìSaving Service . By 1886 he was involved in so many rescues that the Humane Society struck a special silver medal for \\"Brave and faithful service of more than 40 years.\\" The report said, \\"During this time he assisted in saving over 100 lives.\\" However, many records of his early rescues were lost when the archives of the Massachusetts Humane Society were destroyed in the Great Boston Fire of 1872.

The station and the gear are today maintained in functioning condition by the Hull Life‚ÄìSaving Museum.http://site.mawebcenters.com/hulllifesavingmuseum1/index.html =Appointment as U.S. Life‚ÄìSaving Service keeper= Boathouse, Point Allerton Life‚ÄìSaving Station, 1895, with a crewman on right, and Joshua James on right In 1889 the U.S. Life‚ÄìSaving Service established Point Allerton Station at Hull, Massachusetts. James was 62 years old, seventeen years past the mandatory retirement age of 45 for a federal appointment with the new U.S. Life‚ÄìSaving Service. Due to his unequaled lifesaving record, considerable petitioning by townspeople of Hull and his allies in the service Congress made a special provision to allow him to be appointed as keeper of the new station.

The snow and sleet in the early part of the storm gave way to rain. Early in the day of November 25, 1888, Captain James and a few hardy beachmen climbed to the top of Telegraph Hill, where through nearly blinding snow and wind they observed five schooners and one coal barge anchored off an area southeast of Boston called Nantasket, attempting to ride out the storm.Joshua James sworn statement of January 5, 1889. With the intensity of the storm growing and sensing that it was only a matter of time before some of the ships at anchor yielded to the storm, Captain James notified his volunteers to be ready for service, and about two o'clock ordered patrols all along the ocean shore. The beach patrols had hardly begun when the schooner Cox and Green was discovered broadside to the beach. When Captain James judged the seas too heavy to risk launching a rescue boat, the beach apparatus was called upon. With the assistance of local residents Captain James and his men rescued the entire crew by rigging a breeches buoy to the stricken schooner. This was to be the first rescue of an extraordinary 36 hours during which 28 Hull volunteers would work in five crews to save 29 lives along the town's shores. No sooner than the last crewman from the Cox and Green was safely ashore the schooner Gertrude Abbott had struck some rocks about one-eighth mile to the east of the Cox and Green and was too far out to reach with the line and breeches buoy.New York Times, November 27, 1888 Because night was approaching, the incoming tide was very high and the storm increasing in fury, Captain James decided the best course was to wait until low tide the next day. He ordered the surfboat R.B. Forbe brought on the beach abreast of the Gertrude Abbott and a bonfire lit on a bluff so the stricken vessel could be kept in view. During the evening, weather and sea conditions deteriorated so much that between 8:00 pm and 9:00 pm the crew chose to row out to the Gertrude Abbott during the night. Knowing that the conditions were extremely dangerous, Captain James told the men that only volunteers would be taken for the rescue attempt; all the men volunteered. They launched the surfboat R.B. Forbe through the breaking waves and rowed to the wrecked Gertrude Abbott with two of the crew bailing constantly to keep the boat from swamping. After desperate rowing the R.B. Forbe maneuvered under the ship's bow and a line was heaved from the surf boat to the schooner, and as the smaller craft was lifted by the cresting waves the eight sailors leaped one by one from the rigging into the surfboat. With 17 men aboard, they began the hazardous return journey to shore. Between rescuers and survivors, the R.B. Forbe was overcrowded, leaving little room to work the oars. The overcrowding also made the boat even more difficult to manage. Within two hundred yards of the beach, the R.B. Forbe struck a rock, rolled one gunwale deep under water, and began taking on seawater. The occupants quickly shifted their position and succeeded in righting the boat. One surfman was washed out of the boat by a wave, but was reclaimed by his comrades before the sea carried him away. The surfboat was buffeted along at the mercy of the waves and struck rocks a number of times. With most of the oars lost or broken, the men managed with the few oars left to steer the R.B. Forbe toward the shore so that the waves might push her in. Captain James admonished everyone to stick to the boat as long as possible. Finally near shore the R.B. Forbe was thrown upon some hidden rocks and completely wrecked. The occupants promptly jumped out and scrambled to shore and safety. The schooner's crew were immediately taken to a neighboring house and cared for. For the rescue that Captain James himself called \\"miraculous,\\" all nine surfmen were awarded the Treasury Department's U.S. Gold Lifesaving Medal, the highest possible award.http://www.uscg.mil/history/awards/25NOV1888.aspNew York Times, November 27, 1888Annual Reports of the United States Life‚ÄìSaving Service 1889 Pg.63 The station crew could haul the beach carts or the boat, but not both. Joshua James is in blue Because the storm continued, Captain James ordered the surfmen to maintain a patrol along the beach to watch for more wrecks. At 3:00 a.m. word came of a third wreck, of the schooner Bertha F. Walker. This time the vessel had sunk and seven crewmen were stranded in her rigging. As the surfboat R.B. Forbe had been wrecked in the rescue of the Gertrude Abbott, volunteers had to drag a second surfboat, the Robert G. Shaw four miles overland with the help of horses to the site of the wreck. At dawn, James and the rescuers were able to launch the second boat from the protected launch at Pemberton Point, but faced a six and a half mile row in difficult seas to reach the Bertha F. Walker and save the seven men in her rigging, who were in danger of perishing of exposure. Just as they landed ashore with the seven men from the Bertha F. Walker, word came of two more shipwrecks, the H. C. Higginson and the Mattie E. Eaton. In addition to Joshua and his crew of the Massachusetts Humane Society, the crew of the U.S. Life‚ÄìSaving Service station at North Scituate and Cohasset had also gone to the rescue of the H. C. Higginson. Captain James and his volunteers had to pull their beach cart with rescue equipment nine miles overland through snow and slush to get to the wreck site. Efforts to fire lines out to the H. C. Higginson failed due to debris fouling the lines, and the Cohasset and Scituate crews left the wreck site, so it was necessary to launch the untested surfboat, the Nantasket. The rescue was extremely dangerous because the waves were breaking around the wrecked H. C. Higginson. Captain James took the Nantasket out twice. The first attempt failed after forty-five minutes of rowing when the boat hit rocks that knocked two holes in it, making it necessary to return to shore to make temporary repairs using lead patches. On the second attempt, the Nantasket was rowed close enough to the schooner for the men to throw a line on board the H. C. Higginson. The first sailor to be rescued was in the mizzen rigging; he came cautiously down the shrouds, tied the line around his body, leaped overboard into the sea, and was hauled into the surf boat. Four other sailors in the fore rigging, exhausted from their long exposure, had to work their way with great difficulty into the main rigging. There they fastened lines to themselves and in turn jumped into the breaking waters and were hauled one by one into the Nantasket. Once in the surf boat, they were taken safely to the shore, where the half-starved and half-frozen men were quickly conveyed in carriages to the home of Selectman David O. Wade of Hull. Not all of the crew of the H. C. Higginson were so fortunate. Three lost their lives: the captain and one sailor were washed overboard in the night and a third man died in the rigging from exposure. By the time they were able to reach the site of the Mattie E. Eaton, the wreck had come so far up on the shore that her crew was able to get off on their own. The brigantine Alice was abandoned at sea, but late on the 26th the vessel had come ashore. Two salvors had gone aboard and needed to be rescued when their dory was swept away. Captain James and his crew took the would-be salvors off the wrecked Alice. The Alice was the last rescue of the Hurricane of 1888. For his work at the scene of six wrecks during a two-day period and rescuing 29 people, Joshua James was awarded gold medals by both the Massachusetts Humane Society and the U.S. Life‚ÄìSaving Service.Shanks, Ralph and York, Wick, pp 47-50 James' United States Gold Lifesaving Medal is now in the collection of the United States Coast Guard Museum at the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. The U.S. Life‚ÄìSaving Service also awarded eleven gold and four silver medals to the other volunteers for their heroic efforts. The 1888 storm led to the construction of the Point Allerton U.S. Life‚ÄìSaving Station one year later.Galluzo, p 127 Hurricane of 1898 The storm started quietly on the evening of the 26th of November 1898 with a light but strengthening wind. Within hours the winds had grown to hurricane proportions and was creating havoc all along the coast. The winds raged all through the night of the 26th, all day on the 27th, and did not subside until the 28th. Some 36 hours after the storm had started winds were clocked at up to 72 mph in Boston and were probably even stronger along the coast to the southeast on Cape Cod. At about 3:00am surfman Fernando Bearse who was on patrol spotted a schooner about a quarter mile from land directly in front of the station. With the surf pounding hard and the wind blowing strong it was decided against launching the surfboat. Around 6:30 am the Henry R. Tilton had swept westward and was now within range of the Lyle gun. Captain James' first two shots were unsuccessful, but the third shot landed within reach of the crew on board who quickly secured the whip line to the foremast twenty feet above the deck. After bringing the first sailor ashore the rescuers realized that the Henry R. Tilton was still drifting toward shore. After each transfer of a crewmen from ship to shore the rescuers had to reset the lines. The men handling the lines had to wade out into the water and were standing dangerously close to the breaking waves. From time to time the sea would engulf the men and equipment. It took over three hours with a mixed crew of U.S. Life-Saving men and Humane Society volunteers to bring all seven crew members of the Henry R. Tilton to safety. Back at the Point Allerton Station, Louisa James and the wives of the other surfmen had lit fire in the station's stove, laid out blankets, hot drinks and cared for the surviving crew of the Henry R. Tilton. After enduring 15 hours of riding out the storm the crew of the Henry R. Tilton could finally feel safe. At about the time Captain James and his crew completed their rescue of the Henry R. Tilton, word came that Coal Barge No. 1 of the Consolidated Coal Company was coming ashore about three-quarters of a mile west of their location on Toddy Rocks. The storm had blown down telephone, telegraph, and electrical lines in front of the Point Allerton station making it impossible to drag out the station's second beach rescue apparatus. Joshua James conferred with his son Osceola James, who was Captain of the Hull chapter of the Massachusetts Humane Society on the best course of action. The two agreed that Osceola would send some of his men to Massachusetts Humane Society's Station #18 to retrieve the Hunt Gun stored there and Osceola would rent some horses to bring the rest of the equipment. The rest of the men went to the wreck site.Galluzo, p 120, pp 128-130 At about 11:00 pm the two crews reached the wreck site and set up the Massachusetts Humane Society's beach apparatus. While they were firing shots from the Hunt Gun, they realized that Coal Barge No. 1 was about to break up. Both keepers called for volunteers to wade out into the surf. The volunteers tied lines to their waists and walked out amidst debris to get as close to the vessel as possible. While they were wading out to the stranded barge, the pilothouse broke free from the vessel and rode the waves toward the shore. Close to shore the waves slammed the pilothouse to pieces, tossing its passengers into the surf. The volunteers already in the water rushed to grab the survivors before the rip current could drag them away. With the surfmen holding on to the sailors they waited for waves to carry them to a point on the beach where they could scramble to safety. The schooner Henry R. Tilton On the morning of the 27th, Captain James using his spy glass spotted a predetermined distress signal at Boston Light on Little Brewster Island. The U.S Life‚ÄìSaving crew and four volunteers launched the Humane Society's surfboat #17, Boston Herald from Stony Beach.Galluzo, p 14 En route Captain James spotted the steam tug Ariel and arranged to be towed as close as possible to Great Brewster Island. After being brought as close as possible to the island, the surfmen rowed the Boston Herald through the breaking surf and came alongside the schooner Calvin F. Baker. Five survivors were retrieved. At 3:00 am on the 26th the Calvin F. Baker had run aground on the island and remaining eight crew members were forced into the bow rigging. They would remain in the rigging for the next thirty hours. During that time the First Mate and Second Mate could not hold on and fell into the water and drowned. The Steward froze to death in place. His body was carried down to the surf boat by the rescuers. After rowing the Boston Herald back through the breaking surf and to Stony Beach, the survivors of the Calvin F. Baker warmed themselves in front of the fire with fourteen other lucky survivors at the Point Allerton Station.Galluzo, p 15 Houses were blown over and washed away all along the coast from Cape Cod to Portland, Maine. The coastline was littered with the wrecks and wreckage of dozens of vessels large and small, smashed or sunk by the fierce winds and seas. In Provincetown harbor alone over 30 vessels were blown ashore or sunk. Damage along Boston's south shore and Cape Cod was probably the worst. Telegraph lines were brought down, railways washed out, and even the low scrub trees of Cape Cod were blown away. In Scituate, the coastline was permanently altered when mountainous waves cut a new inlet from the sea to the North River, closed the old river mouth and reversed the flow of part of the river. As with the hurricane of 1888 there were numerous brave rescues in an extraordinary 36 hours, during which the crew of the Point Allerton station and volunteers from Hull would save 41 lives along the town's shores. The schooner Ulrica On December 15, 1896, a northeast storm with gale-force winds and heavy snow struck the Massachusetts coast. The Ulrica, a three-masted schooner with a load of plaster southbound for Hoboken, New Jersey was caught in the storm. The ship turned for Boston Harbor to ride out the storm. When the winds shredded her sails she ended up dropping both of her anchors off Hull near Nantasket beach. Her anchors failed to hold and at about 8:00 am on December 16, 1896, she was observed aground by a patrolling surfman from the Point Allerton Station who promptly reported the wreck. News of a ship in trouble had already been telephoned to the station and Captain James accepted the railroad's offer to transport the rescuers the two and a half miles to the wreck site. One surfman was left behind to obtain horses and bring the beach cart to the scene. On arrival at the wreck site, they found very heavy seas breaking over the Ulrica forward of the mizzen mast. The crew had taken refuge in the aft house and the mizzen rigging. Concerned that the crew was in great danger Captain James decided not to wait for the beach cart and retrieved the Nantasket from the Massachusetts Humane Society which was housed nearby. A mixed crew of seven Life‚ÄìSaving Service men and six volunteers from the Humane Society launched the large surfboat only to be hurled back to the beach twice by the strong waves. The third launch attempt was successful, but progress was slow due to the strong current. At one point about halfway to the wreck a large wave struck the Nantasket astern, throwing Captain James out of the boat. He caught an oar as the boat passed him and was hauled back aboard the Nantasket. The schooner Ulrica aground at Nantasket Beach December 16, 1896. In the interim the beach cart had arrived and it was decided to try the breeches buoy to effect a rescue. Two shots from the Lyle Gun were fired across the Ulrica, but the crew was too cold to retrieve the line. The third shot fell close enough for the crew to grab the line, but because of the crew's exhausted state they were unable to make the line fast high enough in the rigging. Under these conditions Captain James thought it was too dangerous to use the breeches buoy and decided to make another attempt using the surfboat. Once more with a mixed crew of seven Life‚ÄìSaving Service men and five volunteers from the Humane Society, they attached the surfboat to the hawser via the traveler block and fastened the other line to the stern of the surfboat. Using a combination of oars and hand hauling on the hawser and aided by men on shore controlling the stern line. They managed to bring the Nantasket to the Ulrica. All seven crew members of the Ulrica were brought safely to shore and were taken to Seafoam House to recover before being taken to the Station. For this difficult rescue Captain James received the silver medal from the Massachusetts Humane Society.Boston Globe December 17, 1896.U.S. Lifesaving Station Point Allerton, Wreck Report for January 8, 1897.U.S. Lifesaving Station Point Allerton Log for December 16, 17, 18, 1891. =Known rescues= *December 17, 1841, assisted in the rescue of twelve crewmen of the Mohawk.Robert W.

Two days earlier all but one the Monomoy Point Life‚ÄìSaving Station crew perished in a rescue attempt, drowned by the panicked victims of a ship wreck they were attempting to save. The tragedy affected Joshua deeply and convinced him of the need for even more rigid training of his own crew. At seven o'clock the morning of March 19, with a northeast gale blowing, James called his crew for a drill and to test a new self-bailing, self-righting surfboat. For more than an hour the 75-year-old man maneuvered the boat through the boisterous sea. He was pleased with the performance of the boat and the crew. Upon grounding the boat he sprang onto the wet sand, glanced at the sea and stated, \\"The tide is ebbing\\" and then fell dead on the beach from a heart attack. Joshua was buried with a lifeboat for a coffin. A second lifeboat made of flowers was placed on his grave.

History The La Mesa Dam was constructed in 1929 during the United States administration of the Philippines. Sometime between 1920 and 1926, the Metropolitan Water District (a predecessor agency of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System) decided to build a replacement for the old Wawa Dam in Montalban, Rizal. The Wawa Dam which serves Manila and surrounding locales had to be replaced due to the growing population of the Manila area. The La Mesa was built in Novaliches, which was then still part of the municipality of Caloocan due to the sloping topography of the watershed area from Bulacan. The La Mesa dam later became part of a larger dam system with the opening of the Ipo Dam in Norzagaray, Bulacan in 1936, the Angat Dam in the same locale in 1967. The three dams formed part of the Angat-Ipo-La Mesa water system. The La Mesa Dam was raised in 1959 to increase the reservoir's maximum capacity to its current level. Dam The La Mesa Dam is an earth dam with a height of . The elevation at its crest is while the elevation at its overflow section is . Reservoir The La Mesa Reservoir has a maximum capacity of about . Water from the reservoir spills into the Tullahan River which transports the water to the Manila Bay. Administration The La Mesa Watershed Reservation which hosts the dam and reservoir is jointly administered, supervised, and controlled by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippine national government and the is under the joint administration, supervision and control of the (DENR) and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS). Water supply Metro Manila and its surrounding areas are divided into two water concessionaires: Maynilad Water (red) and Manila Water (blue). The La Mesa Dam is part of the Angat-Ipo-La Mesa water system which supplies water to the population of Metro Manila and surrounding provinces. The water collected in the reservoir is treated at the La Mesa and Balara Treatment Plants. The La Mesa facility has a design capacity of 2,400 million litters per day (mld) while the Balara facility has a capacity of 1,600 mld. The La Mesa treatment facility serves the western half of Metro Manila while the Balara facility serves the eastern portion of the metropolis. Whenever the water level of the dam drops below or the critical mark, the MWSS, Maynilad, and Manila Water begin to regulate the water supply they dispense to their patrons.

This sunny and tuneful piece manages to combine effective apparent pianistic pyrotechnics whilst keeping it within the range of ability of a keen student. The piece has three movements: *I. Allegro molto *II. Andante con moto *III. Presto The opening movement begins with a dramatic trumpet fanfare, followed by swirling piano writing that has a touch of the great piano concertos of Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov. There is a central dramatic cadenza before the opening theme returns, the movement ending with the same short fanfare. The second movement begins in G minor in a far more austere style, using pizzicato string notes over which a melody is played in octaves on the piano. There is a shimmering central section at a faster tempo that moves through various major keys before the opening minor theme is restated, but this time with a forte from the full orchestra. The opening quiet atmosphere eventually returns at the end of this movement. The final movement starts at breakneck speed, which is only briefly interrupted in the middle by a little march. Just before the end a sweeping romantic melody first heard in the first movement is played at full volume before the concerto ends with a prestissimo coda.

In September 1973, after Augusto Pinochet's coup, he re-joined the UN. He then used his diplomatic immunity status to protect opponents of Pinochet by granting them political asylum in various embassies, thus making him a target for the DINA secret police.

In July 2007, the Senate ratified this agreement with the UN, by 16 votes for against 14.Senado aprob√≥ indemnizaci√≥n para familia de Carmelo Soria, Radio Cooperativa, 18 July 2007 Senado aprueba indemnizaci√≥n para familia de diplom√°tico Carmelo Soria, El Mostrador, 18 July 2007 It had beforehand refused this same agreement, in November 2005. In October 2005, the family's lawyer, Alfonso Insunza, presented a request before the Chilean justice demanding that the General Eduardo Aldunate Herman, second-in-command of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), be heard in the Soria case. According to former DINA agent Carlos Labarca Sanhueza's judicial testimony, General Herman was part of the Brigada Mulch√©n special DINA unit involved in Soria's assassination.Familia de Carmelo Soria pidi√≥ que se interrogue a militar a cargo de tropas en Hait√≠, Radio Cooperativa, 11 October 2005 The Brigada Mulch√©n, ultimately placed under the orders of Augusto Pinochet, was found responsible of Soria's assassination by a Chilean Court of Appeal in 1992. According to Carmen Soria, General Herman was also involved in Eugenio Berr√≠os' assassination at the beginnings of the 1990s. In August 2006, the magistrate Alejandro Madrid, charged with the Soria case, stated that one of the key participant to Soria's assassination, the military officer Jos√© Remigio R√≠os San Mart√≠n, had been detained in 1993 by BIE agents (Batall√≥n de Inteligencia del Ej√©rcito, military intelligence agency) in order to convince him to change his judicial testimony. In this statement, R√≠os San Mart√≠n had accused the Brigadier Jaime Lepe, secretary- general of the Army and a close contact of Augusto Pinochet, and other DINA agents, of being responsible of Soria's death.Jorge Molina Sanhueza, El √∫ltimo secreto del crimen de Soria abre la puerta para condenar a brigadier (R) Lepe , La Naci√≥n, 21 August 2006 According to the judge Madrid, the order to detain R√≠os San Mart√≠n was directly issued by the Brigadier Jaime Lepe, whose promotion to General was blocked in 1997 by the former President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in 1997 following denunciations by Carmen Soria. According to R√≠os San Mart√≠n' testimony, the Brigada Mulch√©n was headed by the then Captain Guillermo Salinas Torre, who ordered Soria's kidnapping. The DINA then believed that Carmelo Soria was a member of the Chilean Communist Party. R√≠os San Mart√≠n' testimony relaunched the Soria case by confirming previous statements made by Michael Townley at the end of 1992 concerning Soria's abduction. In May 2016, the Chilean Supreme Court asked for the extradition of American Michael Townley, Cuban Virgilio Paz, and Chilean Armando Fernandez Larios for their alleged roles the murder of Soria.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-crime-extradition-idUSKCN0Y8296  References   See also  *Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial 1921 births 1976 deaths Communist Party of Spain politicians People from Madrid People killed in Operation Condor Spanish diplomats Spanish emigrants to Chile ","title":"Assassination of Carmelo Soria"},{"id":"13197825","title":"Ralph Hanan"},{"id":"13197842","text":"Life 24 was a British television channel owned and operated by Life TV Media, it was the second television channel from the company.

The name derives from ‚Äúharecarres‚Äù, a Border name for a boundary marker made of rock. Although this medieval place name has been found in three other sites in south-east Scotland, the six modern variations of the surname ‚Äì Hercus, Herkes, Harcus, Harkes, Harkess and Arcus come from the fourth medieval site today called Harcarse, in the parish of Fogo, Berwickshire, Scotland. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Adam de Harcarres, who in 1216, was elected Abbot of Newbattle and subsequently Abbot of Melrose. Alexander of Harcarse, knight, performed fealty to Edward I, king of England in 1297 and the arms of Harcarse of that Ilk [of Harcarse], are cited in the Scottish Arms 1370‚Äì1678. The name Hercas first appears in the Orkney Islands in the 1500s. Harcus is \\"the present Orkney spelling of Harcarse\\" according to George F. Black in \\"The Surnames of Scotland\\". The names of Robert, Johnne, and George Hercas are named in the Respite of 1539 for complicity in connection with the Battle of Summerdale, 1529. The naming of three Hercas out of a total of thirty one, is indicative of the relative importance of the family at that time in Orkney. On the 5th August 2011, a gathering of Hercus/Harcus and related surnames was held at The Lodge, Carfraemill, Lauder, Berwickshire, TD2 6RA, Scotland with attendees from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland, Spain, and the USA. At this gathering, the Flower of Scotland tartan was adopted as the Hercus tartan as no tartan was previously associated with this family name.

He is most famous for his excavations at Great Zimbabwe which provided the first solid evidence that the site was built by Shona peoples. Randall-MacIver was educated at The Queens College, Oxford. He graduated in 1896 with a first class degree. He began his professional archaeological career in 1898 working for Flinders Petrie in Egypt, uncovering the mortuary temple of Senwosret III at Abydos. In 1906 he was appointed as Curator of the Egyptian Section at the Penn Museum, University of Pennsylvania, taking charge of the collection following Sara Yorke Stevenson's resignation in 1905.Jenifer H Wegner, David Randall-MacIver: Explorer of Abydos and Curator of the Egyptian Section, Penn Museum, vol 48, no. 2, pp. 13-14 With funding from Eckley B. Coxe Jr., Randall-MacIver initiated research into the relationship between Egypt and Nubia, uncovering some of the earliest evidence of ancient Nubian culture, dating back to 3100 BCE. Between 1905 and 1906 Randall-MacIver conducted the first detailed study of Great Zimbabwe. The absence of any artefacts of non-African origin led him to conclude that the structure was built by local people. Earlier scholars had speculated that the structure had been built by Arab or Phoenician traders. Between 1907 and 1910 he excavated the site of Karanog, a former provincial capital of the Kingdom of Kush. Randall-MacIver left the Penn Museum in 1911 following a disagreement with new Museum Director George Byron Gordon, becoming librarian of the American Geographical Society. In 1914 he left the AGS to work as a British intelligence officer in the First World War. In 1921 he moved to Italy to study Etruscan archaeology. He remained in Italy during World War II, assisting the Allied forces Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, the famous \\"Monuments Men\\", to preserve historical monuments and cultural property. Randall-MacIver died in New York City on 30 April 1945.

It deals with Irish Analogue broadcasting systems and the amendment of legislation on Digital Terrestrial Television dating back to 2001. This act amends previous acts in particular the Broadcasting Act 2001. Summary of the Act The main purposes of the Act are: * to give Irish national public service broadcasters (Radio Telef√≠s √âireann (RT√â) and TG4) obligations relating to digital terrestrial television * to mandate the licensing of multiplexes for carriage on the RT√â multiplex of Irish free-to-air channels (first one, later two multiplexes) to the RT√â Authority * to mandate the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to license other interested broadcasters using free-to-air and pay-tier multiplexes (three, later four) * to mandate ComReg with regulation of non-big screen TV type services such as Mobile TV. As compensation for analogue television switch- off, it obligates RT√â to create a digital television channel available on various platforms, such as terrestrial, satellite, cable and IPTV, providing home-created television programmes to Irish citizens abroad. The channel's working title is RT√â International. Background DTT was due to be operational in 2002. With the collapse of ITV Digital, IT's TV was unable to get funding to cover its fees and rollout the network as planned. RT√â, holding a minority stake in the transmission network of IT's TV, carried out DTTV tests and a Digital Audio Broadcasting pilot between 1998 and 2001 using the Three Rock transmitter on channel 26. One applicant was announced by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, now the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). RT√â currently broadcasts RT√â, Network 2 (now renamed RT√â 2), TV3, and TG4, plus two other surplus channels, although Tara TV was carried by RT√â on one of these channels. No EPG information was involved but a wireless return path (DVB-TRC) was tested. This meant a telephone line would not be needed for the digibox for subscription services. Although now regarded as an unnecessary expense, TG4 has expressed an interest in its incorporation into rollout. RT√â also ran a transmitter on Band 3 at Three Rock on Channel D for VHF tests. It was intended to have a 2 way channel to allow the viewer's home aerial to send a signal back to the DTTV transmitter, rather than via a telephone line. [ICDG, 2007] Thirteen transmitters account for 92% network coverage. These are Kippure, Mount Leinster, Mullaghanish, Spur Hill, Maghera, Woodcock Hill, Truskmmore, Hollywell Hill, Moville, Cairn Hill, Three Rock, Clermont Carn, and Kilduff. Other in-fill transmitters are used to cover remoter areas. [RT√âNL, 2007] The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Test ran between August 2006 and August 2008. The pilot was open to 1,000 users chosen by a research company, 500 from around the Three Rock Transmitter in Dublin, and 500 from the Clermont Carn upgraded transmitter in County Louth. The broadcast contract is with BT Ireland, NEC UK supply the transmission equipment. Four multiplexes are being tested for use. One is for O2 Ireland and 3 Ireland called the DVB Multiplex. This uses Channel 26 to provide scrambled or encrypted channels only available to the DVB-Handheld enabled phone users. On 15 June 2007, Eamon Ryan TD, Communications Minister, was given an Introductory Brief on the Irish DTT. Under a DTT paragraph on page 4, the pilot is described as underway. It suggests that continued progress is required on developmental and formal arrangements, to ensure the analogue system is replaced nationwide under what is termed \\"analogue switchoff\\". The Introductory Brief (page 7) also outlines changes to divisions within the Department of Communications, Energy & Natural Resources. It proposes the Broadcasting, Telecommunications and Postal Sectors are renamed and subdivided into Broadcasting Policy, Communications (Business and Technology), Communications (Regulatory and Postal) and Communications (Development) Divisions. Broadcasting Expenditure for the period (page 8) is ‚Ç¨259.537 million with ‚Ç¨0.705 for programme administration. Broadcasting Policy is responsible for the legislative and regulatory framework for broadcasting in the Republic of Ireland. It has corporate governance responsibility for RT√â Group, TG4, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, and the Broadcasting Complaints Commission. ComReg falls under the Communications (Regulatory and Postal) division of the Department. The agencies of those above are set out in page 21. In particular, ComReg has a remit that covers TV services and mobile phone networks. The above document is available to view under Freedom of Information legislation. Future broadcasting acts regarding a regulator of content for RT√â and commercial TV companies in Ireland A broadcasting bill went into eConsultation and was concluded on 18 April 2007. It foresaw the establishment of a Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and would amend RT√â Authority provisions. The bill was expected to be enacted during 2008 and is part of the priority legislative Programme: 2007-2008 Proposals and will involve a new content regulator taking on the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) and RT√â Authority role. Therefore, it can be foreseen that RT√â Authority duties under the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act may possibly become duties of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, or may become part of the new RT√â structure duties that that Broadcasting Bill 2007 may become in a Broadcasting Act of 2008 (title or date of enactment not yet known) State aid issues related to RT√â and TG4 funding are also part of the Broadcasting Policy. The Broadcasting Bill 2006 will cover the dissolution of the RT√â Authority, BCI, BCC and allow for transition arrangements, exemption from stamp duty, funding of the BAI by broadcasters, and the rules governing state support to RT√â and TG4 under EC Directive 97/36/EC on state aid following government consultation with the Commission and EU Parliament. (Official Journal of EU. No. L. 202/60 of 30 July 1997). The Act will also deal with TV license definitions and enforcements, codes and contract awards. It primarily will deal with State Aid concerns following on from the TV3 complaint to the Commission regarding public broadcaster license fee usage rules. With regard to Digital Terrestrial Television and analogue switch-off, the Department of Communications has identified that Irish DTT is the only system that can provide \\"better quality, new services, and more channel... that can be regulated under Irish Law.\\" Large scale public awareness is identified by the department. It outlined that in 1999 the Republic of Ireland decided its approach to introducing DTT with the Broadcasting Act 2001 being enacted. The model adopted elsewhere was attempted but after a public tender competition the award to run the licenses failed in 2003. The next move happened in 2005 when the Department of Communications decided on a DTT pilot programme to start roll-out of the service in the Republic of Ireland and to help develop momentum regarding DTT in the consumer and private sector. Government approved and the trial is now up and running in Dublin and Louth using a three-year budget of ‚Ç¨10 million, broadcasting on four multiplexes from Three Rock and Clermont Carn mountains. Twelve TV channels and also radio channels are provided and higher definition TV was trialled in July 2007 of the All-Ireland Hurling Final. A Pilot Stakeholders Group exists to inform those involved in it and the department regarding issues that could be similar in a national roll-out. Under the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007, RT√â has a duty to roll out a DTT multiplex nationally carrying RT√â 1, RT√â 2, TV3, TG4 and possibly Channel 6. The BCI can allocate three other multiplexes which it is expected to put out to license by January 2008. Within the next year and a half, 20 to 30 channels are expected on Irish DTT. In its Digital Switchover Plan, the Broadcasting Section of the Department of Communications identified the benefits that Irish citizens can benefit with increased entertainment offerings, additional sources of information and new forms of interaction and a potential means of government and public sector information. Thus digital television could be a driver of business and economic development across many sectors in the view of the Department of Communications (page 3 Intentions with Regard to the Introduction of Digital Television in Ireland). It identifies the Irish Government's role in point 16, but that Ireland is unusual due to its separate geography from mainland Europe and the issues of spectrum usage and satellite transmission. Political, economic and geographical links with Northern Ireland affect broadcasting policies and UK TV is popular in the Republic of Ireland as a result, split between cable, satellite and analogue signal overspill. Ireland has he second highest penetration of satellite in Europe but Sky its main operator is unregulated in the Republic of Ireland. The Department of Communication also identified that broadband and digital TV contains synergies with data and telephony services. To that end, the Department is involved in a National Broadband Scheme to cover the telecoms infrastructure upgrade costs for the remaining 10% of the Republic of Ireland who for demographic and commercial telecom investment reasons would otherwise not get broadband. The Department has not proposed an analogue switchover date as yet, though the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act gives the responsibility for the BCI foreseeably (BAI) to report when digital multiplex coverage for the RT√â multiplex and other multiplexes are near universally covered and when analogue switchover can then be recommended and a date decided upon. In the next section the legislation underpinning Irish digital Subsequent legislation The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 makes provision in relation to broadcasting. It deals with the supply and transmission of programme material and other data by digital means. It also deals with a combination of such programme material in relation to the broadcasting of certain services to Irish communities outside the Island of Ireland. It deals with the discontinuance of certain broadcasting services by analogue means and confers additional functions on RT√â, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) and Teil√≠fis na Gaeilge (TG4) to confer power subject to license on Tel√≠fis na Gaeilge and amends the Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960 to 2001 and certain other enactments and related matters. Some definitions are used in the Act such as multiplex, programme material, sound broadcasting multiplex, television multiplex and television programme service contract. These warrant further explanation, as terms frequently referred to hereafter. A multiplex is an electronic system which combines programme material and related and other data in a digital form and the transmission of that material and data by means of wireless telegraphy, either directly or indirectly for reception by the general public. Channels and associated channel data such as interactive services related to that channel in effect can be broadcast on a transmission network multiplex subject to Broadcasting Commission of Ireland license. Sound broadcasting multiplex means a multiplex in which programme material is mostly sound orientated and television broadcasting multiplex is likewise mainly television broadcasting. The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007 repeals Section 24 of the Broadcasting Act 1990, Section 4 of the Broadcasting Act 2001, Section 10 of the Broadcasting Authority Act 1960, and of the Broadcasting Acts 1960 to 2001. Section 20 of the Communications Regulation Act 2001 is also repealed as is Section 20 of the Radio and Television Act 1998 and Section 45 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 to 1988. The preamble of the Act makes provision for broadcasting matters, for the supply of programme material, transmission of that material and of other data by digital means and in relation to broadcasting certain services to Irish communities outside the Island of Ireland. It also makes provision for the discontinuance of certain broadcasting services transmitted by analogue means, and confers additional functions on the Commission for Communications Regulation, Radio Tel√≠f√≠s √âireann, Telif√≠s na Gaeilge (still TG4's legal name) and confers powers subject to license on Teilif√≠s na Gaeilge and amend the Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960 to 2001 and certain other enactments on 10 April 2007.

Hornaday Awards are a series of awards presented by the Boy Scouts of America for service in conservation and ecology. The program is designed to encourage learning about natural resource conservation and the environment, teach sound stewardship of the natural resources and the environment, and recognize those who are outstanding in this field. Awards Recipients of the Bronze, Silver and Gold Medal may wear the corresponding square knot insignia, with a blue, green and white knot on a tan background, on the BSA uniform. The Hornaday Gold Medal for adults serving at least 20 years in conservation has only been awarded about 40 times since its establishment in 1975. Since the original Hornaday medals and badges were established in 1914, slightly more than 1,000 bronze medals and 2,200 youth badges have been awarded. About 114 silver medals have been awarded since its establishment in 1975 and 357 adult gold badges since its establishment in 2000. About 200 Hornaday Awards of all types (medals, badges, and certificates) are made nationally per year. Recipients of the Badge or Gold Badge may wear the corresponding badge on their uniform. Program The awards are presented at several levels: *The Unit Award is a certificate presented at the council level to a BSA unit that completes a significant conservation service project. *The William T. Hornaday Badge is a council level award that can be earned by Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts, and Venturers by completing certain advancement requirements and performing at least one substantial project. *The William T. Hornaday Gold Badge is a council level award presented to adult Scouters who have provided significant leadership in conservation at the council or district level over a period of at least three years. *The William T. Hornaday Bronze Medal is a national level award that can be earned by Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts, and Venturers by completing certain advancement requirements and performing at least three bronze substantial projects. *The William T. Hornaday Silver Medal is a national level award that can be earned by Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts, and Venturers by completing certain advancement requirements and performing at least four silver substantial projects. *The William T. Hornaday Gold Medal is a national level award presented to adult Scouters who have provided significant leadership in conservation on a national or regional basis over a period of at least twenty years. *The William T. Hornaday Gold Certificate is a national level award presented to corporations or organizations who have provided outstanding contribution to youth conservation education for at least three years. Origins This awards program was created to recognize those that have made significant contributions to conservation. It was begun in 1914 by Dr. William T. Hornaday, director of the New York Zoological Park and founder of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Dr. Hornaday was an active and outspoken champion of natural resource conservation and a leader in saving the American bison from extinction. He named the award the Wildlife Protection Medal. After his death in 1937, the award was renamed in Dr. Hornaday's honor and became a Boy Scouts of America award. In the early 1970s, the present awards program was established with funding help from DuPont. At that time, the late Dr. Hornaday's idea of conservation was broadened to include environmental awareness. Approximately 1,100 medals have been awarded over the past 80 years. These awards represent a substantial commitment of time and energy by individuals who have learned the meaning of a conservation/environmental ethic. Any Boy Scout, Varsity Scout, or Venturer willing to devote the time and energy to work on a project based on sound scientific principles and guided by a conservation professional or a well- versed layperson can qualify for one of the Hornaday Awards.

It was released on September 18, 2007, through J Records. Background Director Sean Penn hand-picked Vedder to provide the music for the film. Previously, Vedder had contributed two songs to the soundtrack for the 1995 film Dead Man Walking and a cover of the Beatles' \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\" to the soundtrack for the 2001 film I Am Sam, both of which starred Penn. Recording The songs for the soundtrack were recorded in 2007 at Studio X in Seattle, Washington. Vedder worked with producer Adam Kasper, who had previously worked on Pearl Jam's 2002 album Riot Act, and 2006 album Pearl Jam. The album was mixed by Kasper and Vedder. After viewing a rough cut of Into the Wild, Vedder quickly went to work writing songs for the film.Sandler, Adam. \\"Films thrive on singular musical vision\\". Variety. December 11, 2007. After three days, Vedder gave Penn a range of material to work with. Penn placed into the film what Vedder had given him, and Vedder then went on to work on more material that Penn could add to the film.Cohen, Jonathan. \\"Q&A;: Penn, Vedder go where the \\"Wild\\" things are\\". Reuters. October 26, 2007. Vedder said that Penn \\"gave [him] a lot of freedom,\\" and added that \\"the biggest thing was trust, which was just kind of unspoken.\\"Gilchrist, Todd. \\"Interview: Sean Penn and Eddie Vedder\\". IGN. September 21, 2007. Vedder also said that having to write songs based on a narrative \\"simplified things.\\" He said, \\"There were fewer choices. The story was there and the scenes were there.\\" Vedder said that the songwriting process \\"grew\\" as Penn would ask him for more material. Vedder described the recording process as a \\"factory.\\" He said, \\"I'd just sit in the chair, and they'd hand me a fretless bass, and they'd hand me a mandolin, and they'd take a second to do the rough mix, and then I'd write the vocal, and it was just quick.\\"Grossman, Lev. \\"Nature Boys\\". Time. September 13, 2007. On the recording sessions as a whole, Vedder stated, \\"It was like I kinda went into some weird space for a week or two, and then I woke up out of this daze, and it was done. I don't really remember it.\\" Composition Vedder's songs written for the film feature a folk sound. Thom Jurek of Allmusic called the soundtrack a \\"collection of folksy, rootsy tunes where rock & roll makes fleeting appearances.\\" Vedder is primarily responsible for the songs in the film while film music composer Michael Brook is acknowledged in the film's credits for composing the film's original music. Vedder said, \\"Michael made great choices with the way he orchestrated the score...Our pieces of music meshed together pretty well for not having approached it in a way of making sure these puzzle pieces fit. They just did.\\" Vedder collaborated with singer- songwriter Jerry Hannan on the song \\"Society\\", written by Hannan. Both songs appear in the film along with a slew of other folky ballads by Vedder. Vedder's songs help narrate the story of American wanderer Christopher McCandless. After graduating as a top student from Emory University, he decides to give up all of his money and travel. During forays into the Western United States and Mexico, McCandless decides to hitchhike to Alaska to live in the wilderness with little food and equipment, hoping to live a period of solitude. Nearly five months later, he died of starvation near Denali National Park and Preserve. Vedder said that he \\"realized the songs could now become another tool in the storytelling.\\" On writing the songs about McCandless, Vedder stated, \\"It was startling how easy it was for me to get into his head. I found it to be uncomfortable how easy it was, because I thought I'd grown up.\\" Release Auditorium Theatre in Chicago, Illinois on August 21, 2008.

Reception Upon its release, Into the Wild received mostly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 14 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave Into the Wild three and a half out of five stars, saying that Vedder \\"[tosses] his weighty baritone onto earthy, folky tracks that temper the romance of absolute freedom with an eerie foreboding.\\" Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B. She said \\"a real sense of the wide-open road permeates these nine original compositions.\\" She ended her review by saying that \\"though the album is flawed (some tracks on the 33-minute disc are so brief that they never leave the ground), there is still something here that's compelling enough to stand alone.\\" David Marchese of Spin gave the album three and a half out of five stars. He said, \\"The handful of somber, droning mood pieces don't really transcend their film-contingent origins, but on the actual full-length songs...Vedder's incantatory vocals and campfire instrumentation evoke the eerie beauty of untouched land.\\" Jonah Weiner of Blender gave the album three out of five stars. He said, \\"It's the sound of a 24-year-old accepting death, as imagined by a lifelong misfit aging gracefully.\\" Allan Jones of Uncut gave the album three out of five stars. He said, \\"Eddie here answers what you might be inclined to describe as the call of the wild with a series of mostly handsome, jangly folk-rock ballads.\\" Jamie Fullerton of NME gave Into the Wild a five out of ten. In the review, Fullerton states that \\"due to Vedder's interest in all things anti-corporate, McCandless' renouncement of materialism is celebrated rather than the fact that he eventually died.\\" He also says that it is \\"accomplished but occasionally overbearingly earnest.\\" AllMusic staff writer Thom Jurek gave the album two and a half out of five stars, saying that \\"musically there isn't enough imagination to distinguish [the songs], to set the tension of dynamic in motion.\\" \\"Hard Sun\\" was the most successful song from Into the Wild on the rock charts, reaching number 13 on the Modern Rock charts. Both \\"Hard Sun\\" and \\"Guaranteed\\" had accompanying music videos. Vedder won a 2008 Golden Globe Award for the song \\"Guaranteed\\" from Into the Wild. At the 2008 Grammy Awards, \\"Guaranteed\\" received a nomination for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. \\"Guaranteed\\" was also nominated for a 2008 World Soundtrack Award in the category of Best Original Song Written Directly for a Film.

Goodlass is better known as the one handed winger as he only has one hand due to an unfortunate accident with a power tool. He played for Everton in the old First Division. Favoured while playing for Billy Bingham, Ronny was replaced by Dave Thomas once Gordon Lee became the manager of Everton. Highlights of his Everton career include scoring from the half-way line at West Ham and playing a major role in 1977 in the run to the final of the League Cup against Aston Villa and the semi-final of the FA Cup against local rivals Liverpool. He was the player who provided the cross for the infamous disallowed \\"goal\\" by Bryan Hamilton by controversial referee Clive Thomas that would have seen Everton through to the FA Cup final. Post Everton In October 1977 he moved to Dutch club, NAC Breda for ¬£75,000. He then went on to play for ADO Den Haag before returning to play in England with Fulham. He returned to Everton once his playing career had come to an end under Joe Royle who appointed him as youth team coach. He also had a spell in charge of the now defunct Vauxhall Conference club Runcorn. He is best known these days as the Everton and Tranmere Rovers match day summariser for BBC Radio Merseyside. He is renowned for his catchphrase: \\"It's one of them!\\" He is well liked and respected by supporters for his honest opinion of the club's performances on and off the pitch. He is widely considered to be a fan first and a former player second. He can also be heard on the station's Friday night preview programme Blue Watch giving his opinion in \\"The Goodlass Guide\\" between 8.00pm and 8.30pm. He is a known supporter of keeping Everton in the city of Liverpool. Ronny now heads up his own charity called Health Through Sport which aims to improve fitness and eating habits among young people who comes from some of the most deprived and marginalised communities in Liverpool.

The floor trader must abide by trading rules similar to those of the exchange specialists who trade on behalf of others. The term should not be confused with floor broker. Floor traders are occasionally referred to as registered competitive traders, individual liquidity providers or locals. These traders are subject to a screening process before they can trade on the exchange. The people who operate as floor traders are in an open outcry system that has slowly been replaced by automated trading systems and computers that work in the same fashion as humans, without the interaction of people buying and selling stocks.  Process of becoming a floor trader  The process of becoming a floor trader, especially for those with insufficient capital, and lacking knowledge and experience, often begins by working as a clerk. The completion of a business degree at a university is not necessary, and very few floor traders used this to begin their careers. Those who have earned a higher degree rarely have an advantage over other floor traders, who have learned their craft by standing on the floor and actually trading. Much experience must be gained about the stock exchange as possible because it is an extremely fast-paced and competitive work environment. This is crucial to becoming a successful floor trader. Some may decide to work for a brokerage to get an idea of how the system functions or, as mentioned, to work as a clerk or trade-checker for another person. This is often necessary in order to save money for purchasing a membership which can be expensive, though memberships can be leased on a monthly basis, rather than purchased. Every floor trader (FT) is required to file a completed online Form 8-R and have a fingerprint card. They must also have proof from a contract market that they have been granted the trading privileges to work on the trading field. A non-refundable Floor Trader Application Fee, that comes at the cost of $85.00, is also required to become certified as a floor trader. Every non-natural person floor trader (FTF) is required to file a completed online Form 7-R. To be granted trading privileges, he must abide by the same process as the floor trader. The application fee comes at a higher cost than an FT with it, totaling $200.  Rise of machines  The first major electronic alternative was the Instinet, a machine that could bypass the trading floor and handle one another on a personal basis. It did not however begin taking off until the 1980s, but has been a vital player beside those of its likes such as Bloomberg and Archipelago. The use of electronic mediums to conduct tasks done by floor traders has increased throughout the years, however there are many exchanges in the United States such as the NYSE that prefer to use the open outcry method that involves verbal communication. The benefits of using this system are that traders can read people and results with surprisingly lower error rates in comparison to computers that cannot pick up verbal signals.

She belongs to the elite Dominican Olympic athlete program CRESO. She won the individual bronze medal at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, riding her approved Hannoverian stallion Bernstein. With that medal she repeated her performance from the 2003 Pan American Games held in her home country, where she also obtained the individual bronze medal riding a different mount, a Dutch mare named Inatana. Prior to her Pan Am medals, Losos de Mu√±iz also won double individual gold and a team bronze medal at the 2002 Central American Games in El Salvador. In 2010 she added two individual silver medals to her collection at the Central American and Caribbean Games which took place in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico. In 2010, she also qualified for the World Equestrian Games (WEG) with her Austrian Warmblood Optimus Prime. In addition to her twelve championship medals, she has also obtained numerous wins in Grand Prix and Small Tour at prestigious international events held in West Palm Beach, Florida, the Sunshine Tour (Spain), France and Germany. She has trained with riding master Jean Bemelmans, who also coached the Spanish Olympic team, as well as Harry Boldt from Germany, Jeff Ashton Moore from the USA, Carl Hester from England, Diederik Wigmans from the Netherlands, Ton de Ridder from Germany, Jose Antonio Garcia Mena and Severo Jurado from Spain, Andreas Helgstrand from Denmark and her current coach Kathy Priest from the United States. Losos de Mu√±iz competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, becoming the first Dominican equestrian athlete to participate at the Olympic Games. Following a winning streak at a number of international events in Wellington, Florida during the 2018 Adequan Global Dressage Festival, she qualified- together with her Belgian warmblood gelding Foco Loco W-for the single individual slot available to non-league nations for the FEI Dressage World Cup Final held in Paris, France. Her participation in the event marked the first time a rider from the Central America and the Caribbean competed in the global event. In July 2018, she won two individual gold medals at the Central American and Caribbean Games held in Colombia, and also won a team a team silver as the anchor rider for the Dominican Republic national team. At the event she rode Fredensdals Zig Zag, a Danish warmblood owned by Kathy Priest. Although she had qualified for the 2018 World Equestrian Games with two horses, a shoulder injury prevented her from participating, forcing a two- month layoff from riding altogether. In 2019 she competed in the FEI Dressage World Cup Final held in Gothenburg, Sweden, and qualified as an individual for the 2020 Olympic Games, now postponed to 2021. In 2019 she also participated in the Pan American Games held in Lima, Peru, where she finished fourth in the individual final. She continued her competitive performances during 2020, when she won the individual silver medal with her mare Aquamarijn at the FEI Nations Cup held in Wellington, Florida. During the winter show season, she competes in the dressage shows held in Wellington, Florida.Profile During the spring and summer she competes regularly in the European circuit as well as in Canada. She is consistently ranked in the top 100 in the FEI World Dressage Rankings, the only Latin American rider to achieve this. In September 2020, she received the prestigious Gold Medal Badge of Honor from the International Equestrian Federation (FEI), as a recognition of her multiple participations at Olympic Games, Continental Championships, World Cup Finals and Nations Cups, becoming the first dressage athlete from Latin America to receive this distinction. As a trainer, she has coached numerous riders from Latin America and Europe to top performances at international events and continental championships, and two of her students, Virginia Yarur from Chile and Patricia Ferrando from Venezuela, are in the qualified short list for the 2021 Olympic Games. She is a member of the International Dressage Riders Club, as well as a USDF Gold, Silver and Bronze medalist. Losos de Mu√±iz was born to Canadian parents of German and Polish descent, and was raised in Uganda and Kenya. She began riding as a teenager in Germany before subsequently moving to Canada. She lives in the Dominican Republic since 1990 with her Dominican-born husband; she acquired the Dominican nationality by marriage. She speaks English, German, Spanish, and Swahili.

The revised system, to enable unrestricted public access over the Internet, was called the Official Document System (ODS). Parallel development of an Integrated Library Management System, to facilitate indexing of documents with links to ODS, was delayed until 2002 by budget cuts. In 2004 the project to digitize older archived documents and upload them in electronic form was under way and ready to be made available once the system was opened up to the public at large. In 2007 the need for a proper content management system was recognized as a long- term solution. Since 2007, the global Making Commitments Matter Initiative is concerned with the creation of a searchable database of UN resolutions and conventions (UN-informed.org). Elements While United Nations bodies share many of the same procedures, the code numbers for their sessions are usually incompatible due to the date of establishment of the body and the different timing of their session transitions. For example, the General Assembly began operation in 1947 with its session number incrementing in September every year, while the Security Council is permanently in session, so its meetings are numbered consecutively from its first sitting at its foundation. =First letter= There are four primary document producing bodies which print documents under the mast-head of the United Nations. Other bodies, such as the World Health Organization, have their own sets of codes which are sometimes similar in nature but have a different heading at the top of the page. :A/ - United Nations General Assembly ::A/C.3 - Third Main Committee of the United Nations General Assembly :S/ - United Nations Security Council :ST/ - United Nations Secretariat :E/ - United Nations Economic and Social Council =Middle codes= */RES/ ‚Äì A resolution of the body */PV.67/ ‚Äì A full, first-person account of the proceedings of the 67th meeting (of the year, or since the start of the UN) known as a \\"proces verbal\\" or \\"Verbatim record\\".UN Speeches (Meeting Records): SC: UN */SR.67/ ‚Äì A third-person condensed version of the above meeting, known as the \\"Summary record\\". */L.45/ ‚Äì Document which has limited distribution, usually a draft resolution before it is voted on and reprinted in its final form. */ES-10/ ‚Äì A \\"meeting\\" of the Tenth 'emergency special session'.UN General Assembly ‚Äì Emergency Special Sessions =Trailing codes= :/Add.3 ‚Äì Addendum to a document. :/Rev.1 ‚Äì First revision of a document. :/Corr.1 ‚Äì Corrigendum to a document.

It provides water to the city and the adjacent Mount Isa Mines (MIM) mining lease. Construction began on the Leichhardt Dam in 1956, and was completed on 6 November 1958 at a cost of ¬£1.7 million. The dam was built for Mount Isa Mines and, at the time, was the largest water scheme in Australia financed by private enterprise.Lake Moondarra . Mount Isa Chamber of Commerce. Retrieved on 10 September 2007. The original construction was started by the American Utah Construction Company, but Thiess Brothers completed the project. On 11 July 1961 the dam officially became Lake Moondarra after a competition to name the dam was won by a Mount Isa local, Danny Driscoll. The Aboriginal name means \\"plenty of rain also thunder\\". The lake includes picnic areas, pontoons, a ski jump, and water sports facilities. The lake is popular with birdwatchers, sailors and anglers, as it is stocked with barramundi and sooty grunter. The Lake Moondarra Fishing Classic has been held there since 1999. Transport Bay was so named because tonnes of sand was deposited on the banks of the lake by MIM trucks to create a beach. The lake was the location for one of Australia's largest stone axe quarries. The axes were traded amongst Aborigines across distances as far as 1,000 km. Pest weed control In 1984, a species of weevil was successfully used as a biological pest control to contain a proliferation of the weed Salvinia molesta in the lake. The first releases were made in 1980. The weevil destroyed tens of thousands of tonnes of weed.

She dressed like a boy for the first 16 years of her life in order to participate in competitive sports as a Muslim girl, using the name Genghis Khan, fully supported by her Muslim parents. After defeating boys in weightlifting at age 12, Toorpakai turned to squash and having to produce a birth certificate gave up pretending to be a boy. She became the first tribal Pakistani girl in international squash tournaments, turning professional in 2006. In August 2007, the President of Pakistan bestowed the Salaam Pakistan Award upon her. She was threatened by the Taliban and locked herself in her house for the following 3 years. In 2009, she won third place in the world junior women's squash championship. In 2011, she arrived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to train with Jonathon Power. As of May 2016 she is ranked 56th among female players in the world. Early life and education Maria Toorpakai was born on November 22, 1990 in South Waziristan, a tribal region in northwest Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan. Her parents are teachers who are committed to women's rights despite the presence of the Taliban in the region. She credits her father's time spent with and learning from hippies visiting the area in his youth for his autodidactic education and supportive attitude toward women's education, which included education of her mother. Her father's name is Shamsul Qayum Wazir, also spelled Shamsul Qayyum Wazir. Her sister, Aisha Gulalai a Pakistani politician working to empower women in tribal areas. As a child, Toorpakai loved to play outside, even though girls are not allowed to go outside the house in the highly conservative tribal area. At age 4, her parents allowed her to dress in boys' clothes and by age 7 she lived as a boy. Before fifth grade she burnt all her dresses. Her father saw parallels to his tomboy sister, who \\"just collapsed one day and he thought she died basically of a broken heart, because she wasn't allowed to live the life that she wanted to live.\\" In 2002, Toorpakai's father put her into weightlifting in Peshawar to \\"channel her negative energies\\" and introduced her with the name Genghis Khan. She trained and competed as a boy with the explicit support of her father. At age 12 she won a junior championship in Lahore, and managed to keep her clothes on for the mandatory weighing, because her brother refused to take off his clothes and created a protective precedent. She became captivated by squash after observing it, where she was weightlifting, and saw it as her next challenge. Her father took her to a squash academy and after needing to produce a birth certificate, gave up pretending that she was a boy. The truth about her gender leaked out, and she had neither training partners nor coach and trained by herself for hours. She was harassed and bullied by other players, boys and men. Career In 2006, Toorpakai turned professional. As a female athlete who played without a veil and in shorts, her actions were perceived as \\"un- Islamic\\". It was in 2007, she recalls, two years before Malala Yousafzai was shot, that the Taliban threatened to kill her and her family. The Pakistani national squash federation provided security by \\"snipers around my house, all the way to the squash court and on the squash court\\". She recalls \\"There was a bomb blast every day. [...] terrible things [...] happening all around me.\\" Toorpakai decided it was safer for everyone if she found an opportunity to train internationally. She wrote to clubs, players, and schools and received no response; for three and a half years she \\"locked herself in a room in [her] house.\\" She said she kept playing squash, hitting balls against her wall, until her neighbors complained one day. \\"I had to switch the wall. But I kept going\\". Eventually former professional squash player Jonathon Power replied and in 2011, she arrived to train in his academy in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Toorpakai was ranked as Pakistan's top female squash player. In 2013, she was one of three Pakistani women in the top 200. and as of May 2016, she ranked 56th of female squash player in the world.

She served as the Minister of the Interior in the first post-soviet government, led by the Prime Minister Mart Laar. Biography Lagle Parek was born on 17 April 1941 in P√§rnu and was the daughter of the former captain of the Military of Estonia Karl Parek (1903 - 1941) and his wife Elsbeth Parek, a museum director (born in 1902). The father was deported by the Soviet authorities to Leningrad and soon shot. In March 1949, the remainder of his family - Lagle with her mother, older sister, Eva-Marju (born in 1931), and her grandmother, actress Anna Markus (1874 - 1955) were deported to Siberia (Novosibirsk Oblast) in the Operation Priboi deportation of Baltic inhabitants. Parek's mother was found to have had forbidden books in her museum, and was kept in prison in Siberia until an amnesty in 1953. Parek lived with her grandmother in Siberia and was able to return home after the death of Stalin. She graduated from the Tallinn University of Technology and worked as an architect in the organs of the State Planning Commission, then as a technician and technologist in design institute in Tartu. Dissident activities and arrest On 10 October 1981, Parek participated in the signing of an open letter to the heads of government of the USSR and the countries of northern Europe, in which the authors (38 Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians) supporting the Soviet leadership, approved the Scandinavian Nuclear-weapon-free zone initiative and proposed to extend this initiative to the Baltic States, as well as proposing the removal of Soviet missiles from their territory. Parek also participated in the publication of Samizdat journals, as well as liaising with dissidents in Russia. On 5 March 1983, Parek was arrested and on December 16 sentenced by the Supreme Court under Article 68 Part 1 of the Criminal Code of the ESSR (corresponds to Art. 70-1 of the Criminal Code of the RSFSR) to 6 years in prison and 3 years of exile. Other defendants in the same case, charged with the same crimes, were Heiki Ahonen (now the director of the Museum of Occupations in Tallinn) and Arvo Pesti (both born 1956). Both men received 5 years in prison and 2 years of exile. For a time she served in Dubravlag labor camp in the so-called \\"small area\\" for women who have been convicted of political crimes. Along with Tatyana Velikanova, Irina Ratushinskaya and others, Parek took part in the hunger strikes and other protests, for which she was subjected to imprisonment in solitary confinement. In January 1987, Parek was pardoned and released. After release After her release, Parek returned to Estonia. In 1988, she was one of the founders of the Estonian National Independence Party (ERSP) and she was its chairman from 1988 ‚Äì 1992. From 1990 to 1992 Parek participated in the Congress of Estonia, seen as an \\"alternative parliament\\". In 1992, in the first elections to the new Estonian Riigikogu, ERSP received 10 seats (8.8% of the vote) and entered a coalition government. Parek participated in the presidential elections in Estonia on 20 October 1992, taking fourth place with 4.3% of the vote. In the radical pro- reform government of Prime Minister Mart Laar Parek was appointed Minister of the Interior. On 27 November 1993 she resigned because of the Pullap√§√§ crisis, which involved charges of mutiny against a company of military rangers. Parek was a member of the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union party, formed in 1995 through the merger of ERSP and the National Coalition Party along with the \\"Fatherland\\" Party, to create the \\"Isamaaliit\\" (\\"Fatherland Union\\"), and then in 2006, she was a member of the Pro Patria Union and Res Publica Party. She is author of the book ¬´Mina ei tea, kust ma r√µ√µmu v√µtan. M√§lestused ¬ª(¬´ I do not know where I get joy. Memories ¬ª. Kirjastus Kunst, Tallinn, 2010, 424 pages). Conversion to Roman Catholicism In the mid-1990s Lagle Parek adopted Catholicism. She is head of the non-profit association Caritas Eesti, entering the international Catholic charity confederation Caritas. In recent years, Lagle Parek is living in the Pirita Convent in Pirita.

The company became a subsidiary of Gibson in 2007, but its plant was closed in 2010. During its existence, Garrison manufactured electric and acoustic guitars.  History  Chris Griffiths established \\"Garrison Guitars\\" in St. John's, a province of Newfoundland and Labrador, in 1999. In early 2001, Garrison Guitars opened an acoustic guitar manufacturing company in Canada tooled with the latest robotics, laser cutting, CNC milling, and UV finishing. The 20,000 square foot factory produced orders for distribution in North America, Australia, United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, China, Japan and Canada. G20-E acoustic model Garrison Guitars and its founder won awards for innovation, business planning, export growth, leadership and entrepreneurship. Garrison Guitars was awarded a \\"Golden Axe Award\\" for Best Value by Harmony Central in 2000. Founder Chris Griffiths was also awarded the Manning Innovation Award in 2003. Garrison Guitars were crafted using innovations including the Griffiths Active Bracing System, a revolutionary method of guitar construction that took over six years to perfect. The single unit brace combined all the acoustic guitar's top braces into a single unit to allow for resonance to have an uninterrupted path of travel throughout the instrument and provided enhanced structural stability. Offering a range of instruments in all price points, Garrison's \\"G \\"Series featured all solid woods, hard shell cases, bolt on necks, and UV finishes in a variety of wood combinations. The \\"G\\" series also included the full GAB system combining front and back braces, kerfing, and neck and end blocks. The \\"G\\" series were crafted in Canada. The \\"AG\\" Series was an affordable line using the patented bracing system technology only for the top, with more traditional back/side bracing and kerfing. The \\"AG\\" series were \\"designed in Canada, made in China\\". The company also manufactured all solid wood mandolins and mandolas in its 20,000 square foot facility in Canada. On Tuesday, July 3, 2007, Gibson Guitar Corporation announced its acquisition of Garrison Guitars. The acquisition was to \\"further Gibson's expansion in the acoustic guitar market offering a new series of Gibson brand acoustic guitars aimed at the median price point\\" and converted to produce the short-lived Gibson Songmaker Series. Gibson did not carry forward with the GABS in their Songmaker series, and ended production around 2010, closing down the Garrison factory in Canada, taking along with it the GABS technology.

Classification Technical progress can be classified into two parts: *Embodied Technical Progress: improved technology which is exploited by investing in new equipment. New technical changes made are embodied in the equipment. *Disembodied Technical Progress: improved technology which allows increase in the output produced from given inputs without investing in new equipment. In the real world, many innovations do not require replacing the entire or some part of the equipment. It can be improved for better use depending upon the change required. Hence technological progress, embodied or disembodied, is matter of degree. Kaldor's technical progress function The technical progress function developed by Nicholas Kaldor measures technical progress as the rate of growth of labour productivity. It is described by the following statements: #The larger the rate of growth of capital/input per worker, the larger the rate of growth of output per worker, of labour productivity. The rate of growth of labor productivity is thus explained by the rate of growth of capital intensity. #In equilibrium capital/input per worker and output per worker grow at the same rate, the equilibrium rate of growth. #At growth rates below the equilibrium rate of growth, the growth rate of output per worker is larger than the growth rate of capital/input per worker. #At growth rates above the equilibrium rate of growth it is the other way round, the rate of growth of output per worker is less than the rate of growth of capital/input per worker. Different technical progress models * Edward Denison's empirical data proved technology as major contributor to economic growth. * Simon Kuznets in his model proved and showed importance of technology innovation in the growth of an economy. * Solow identified technology in his aggregate production function. He also suggested a neutral technical progress and economic growth model. * Harrod also proposed a neutral technical progress and economic growth model. Technical progress and human capital Technology has an important relationship with human capital. Same technology can be applied in two different firms, but output varies with respect to the labour force of that firm. Adaption to new technology is directly proportional to pace of economic growth of the country. Hence labour should be experienced with the technology. Education also plays an important role as it helps in accumulating human capital which in turn helps technology diffusion. Education also helps a person get acquainted with technology efficiently and rapidly.

It is also the name of the valley in which the town is located. Geography Aouderas village is in the top of the Aouderas valley, at the base of Mount Todra and is just south of the Todgha range, which runs east to the Mount Bagzane (the highest point in Niger, part of the high Bagzane Massif), and the Assada plateau further north.Index Mundi/US National Imagery and Mapping Agency Aouderas valley is locally called a kouri, a Hausa term for a seasonal wash. The washed soil sprouts grasses in the brief rainy season, some small Dun palms (Hyphaene thebaica), Acacia and Calotropis procera, while the sandy bottom land to the west of the town can be thick with palms and is suitable for irrigated agriculture. Outside of that, the land is almost completely barren except for seasonal grasses. Population and history A Tuareg community, the small sedentary population is today made up of several hundred mostly Ikelan (or Bouzou in Hausa / Bella in Songhai), former slaves and captives of the Kel Owey Tuareg from Hausa and other southern peoples. These peoples were settled in Aouderas, as in other northern oases, to tend the date palm plantations fed by the oasis held by the noble clans. Situated on a plateau surrounded by mountains, Aouderas expanded in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 1970s, French geographers estimated there were 15000 date palms in Aouderas, more than the other older date plantations in In Gall, but half the number of the newer plantations at Telwa and Timia to the north.BERNUS, 1972. p. 38 As of 1972, the number of farms expanded since Heinrich Barth's visit in 1850, and the number of hectares under cultivation has expanded from 19.5 in 1946 to 59.3.Mortimore (1972), pp. 81, 83, 85, 89. As the area of cultivation expanded, so too has the diversity, as Aouderas's existence as a servile date plantation for Tuareg caravans has declined. While the early history of the A√Ør Massif is speculative, the area has been populated since at least 10,000 years ago, when the surrounding deserts were lush grasslands. When the Tuareg tribes were pushed south by Arab invaders in the eighth and ninth centuries CE, there were Gobirwa Hausa in the southern A√Ør. Successive Tuareg Tels have controlled the area since at least the twelfth century. Agadez, as well as Ingall to the east, were the farthest outposts of the Songhai Empire in the early 1st century. During the sixteenth century, the area fell under the control of the newly established Tuareg Sultanate of Agadez. It remained so until the arrival of the French at the end of the 19th. Barth passed through the Aouderas valley in 1850, and reported that it was only recently that the Kel OweyBernus (1972) says that, specifically, it was the Kel Negru sub-clan of the Kel Owey. had pushed the Kel Geres and Kel Itesen Tuareg south and west out of the valley. Some Itesen landowners, though, remained Aouderas as late as 1970. While the Kel Owey pastoralised in the region, visiting towns and their plantations irregularly, Aouderas developed a small but unusual sedentary population of Tuareg cultivators. Barth also described this valley as the southernmost instance of plow agriculture, though he witnessed the local servile population pulling the plows in place of farm animals. Despite dire social conditions for the sedentary population and frequent raids from rival Tels and Toubu pastoralists, the sedentary Ikelan had built a large fertile island in the A√Ør. From one of the largest oases in the area, Aouderas was abandoned in 1917‚Äì18. A violent 1875 flood destroyed most of the date plantation, and the emergence of the French weakened Kel Owey defences. From the 1880s, Toubu raids increased, and when the Tuareg Kaosen Ag Mohammed rose against the French in 1917, Aouderas was one of the towns he destroyed on his way to the siege of Agadez. When the French retook Agadez, a brutal punitive expedition through the A√Ør left Aouderas abandoned. By 1924, though, Aouderas was resettled, both with the remains of the local Ikelan, but also with refugees from Iferwan, also razed by Kaosen and the French successively. At that time it was the second largest town in the A√Ør, after Agadez.Jolijn Geels. Niger. Bradt London and Globe Pequot, New York (2006). While the Kel Owey continued to dominate the town, the sedentary farmers now held and inherited much of the Aouderas gardens, rare in the region.Mortimore (1972) points out that while Tibia farmers held their own land, they were descendants of Tuareg freemen, not slaves Most non-resident Tuareg land owners in 1946 were women, holding land under what the Tuaregs call a ', matrilineal, system. As the gardens prospered, more towns were formed to the west by Aouderas residents, the largest being Tegmak. The famines of the 1970s and 80s brought an end to this expansion, and as Agadez and Arlit grew, Aouderas shrunk. The Tuareg Rebellion of the 1990s saw brutal government reprisals which depopulated many villages in the A√Ør. Finally, in 2004, a locust invasion ravaged the Aouderas gardens.Geels (2006) Tourist industry Today, with caravan trade dwindled, date crops are supplemented with market gardens, citrus, and increasingly the tourist trade centred in Agadez.

Tuareg Rebellion, 2007 On 7 September 2007, a small Nigerien military garrison at Aouderas was attacked by Tuareg-led MNJ rebels, taking six soldiers captive. The 2007 Tuareg insurgency essentially precluded any 2007 tourist season, while roads have been mined, and locals fear attacks by both the rebels and the army.

Va ªa is a word in Samoan, Hawaiian and Tahitian which means 'boat', 'canoe' or 'ship'. A larger traditional seagoing vessel for long distance voyages is referred to as va ªa tele (big ship). The term alia is also used for larger vessels in Samoa. The smaller va ªa used for fishing typically have a float, or outrigger, attached to the main hull for stability. This outrigger part of the canoe is called ama in various Polynesian languages. The word is cognate with other Polynesian words such as vaka or the MƒÅori word waka.

Biography Tosi was born on 25 April 1837 in Santarcangelo di Romagna, Italy. He was one of the first two Jesuits missionaries (the other being Louis Robaut) to set foot in Alaska. As the first Superior of Jesuits in Alaska (from 1886 to 1897) and first to have ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Alaska (Prefect Apostolic from 1894 to 1897), he is regarded as the founder and organizer of the Church in North-Alaska. Ordained a (diocesan) priest in 1861, Tosi entered the Jesuits the following year in order to be sent to the 'American mission'. In 1865 he arrived in the United States to serve on the Rocky Mountain Mission. For two decades he proved to be an able missionary to the Indigenous Peoples of the American Northwest. When in 1886 Archbishop Charles John Seghers set out for northern Alaska on what was meant to be a reconnaissance expedition, he had with him as travelling companions Pascal Tosi and French Jesuit, Louis Robaut. The two were supposed to stay with the archbishop only on a temporary basis. The Jesuits had no intentions at the time of opening a new field of missionary activity in Alaska. However, the murder of Archbishop Seghers (November 1886) changed the situation, and their thinking on the matter. Tosi and Robaut spent the winter of 1886-87 in Canada at the confluence of the Yukon and Stewart Rivers. When in early 1887, upon entering Alaska, they learned of the death of Archbishop Seghers, Tosi considered himself to be in charge, at least for the time being, of ecclesiastical affairs in Alaska. The following Summer he made a trip to the Pacific Northwest to consult with the Superior of the Rocky Mountain Mission, Joseph M. Cataldo, who formally appointed him Superior of the Alaska Mission and entrusted him with the task of developing that mission. In 1892, he made a trip to Rome. There Pope Leo XIII, moved by Fr. Tosi's account of the state of the mission in Alaska, told him in their native Italian, Andate, fate voi da papa in quelle regioni! (\\"Go and make yourself the Pope in those regions!\\"). On July 27, 1894, the Holy See separated Alaska from the Diocese of Vancouver Island and made it a Prefecture Apostolic with Tosi as its Apostolic Prefect. By 1897, Tosi was physically worn out by a tough daily life and strenuous labours in an extreme climate. He was succeeded both as Superior of the Alaska Mission and as Prefect Apostolic in March of that year by French Jesuit Jean-Baptiste Ren√© (1841-1916). On September 13, 1897, Tosi sailed reluctantly from St. Michael, Alaska. As the ship left the harbour, a salute of four guns was ordered as a manifestation of the universal esteem in which he was held. He had hoped to stay on in northern Alaska, for what actually turned out to be a brief retirement in Juneau as he died in Juneau on January 14, 1898.

The next election with the new rules on January 15, 1855 decided those first Ward bosses who would serve with the short-term mayor, Allison Nelson. The Fifth Ward was laid out west of Ivy and north of A&W; Railroad. This ward contained the large homes along Peachtree Street and the southern part, Fairlie-Poplar was also largely residential with warehousing along the western part. 1871 Fifth Ward in purple (1871 to 1874) During a huge boom of post-war building, two new wards were added from parts of the First, Fourth and Fifth to reflect the changing look of the city. This would be the layout until the city limits were expanded in 1874. Parts of the Fourth and Fifth Wards were taken to form a Seventh Ward (grey) established on December 2, 1871. Specifically from the \\"junction of Houston and Pryor streets, thence through lot nineteen, between blocks three, one and two, five and six, to the city limits; thence northerly along the city limits to Peachtree Street; thence south along Peachtree Street and Pryor Street to the beginning.\\" And the Fourth was extended \\"from Ivy Street west to Pryor, and from Houston Street south to the railroad, and that Pryor Street shall be the line between the fourth and fifth wards, and Pryor and Peachtree streets between the fifth and seventh wards.\\" This gave the red-light district to the Fourth and created a new Ward of mostly farmers and to the west, fine residences along Ivy and the east side of Peachtree. 1874 Fifth Ward in purple (1874 to 1883) A new city charter increased the radius of the city from one to one and a half miles, reduced the number of wards back to five and created a bicameral council of two councilmen from each ward and a second body of three at-large aldermen was established. The new Fifth ward layout was from Pryor and tracks north-east to Peachtree, then West Peachtree to city limits, south-west to Foundry and W&A; RR and east to origin. Two councilmen would be elected from each ward each year. In late 1875, an ordinance passed where each year one councilman would be elected from each ward for a two-year term. The first year, 1876 just had one citywide alderman and a single councilman from each ward, and they would be fully staffed two years later. 1883 Fifth Ward in purple (1883 to 1894) On November 5, 1883 a Sixth Ward (beige) was carved out of the Fourth and Fifth Wards. In later years wards were added or modified to handle newly annexed parts of the city but the Fifth remained essentially unchanged. The city converted to a district system in 1954.

It stars Zain Khan and Rahul Bose as the lead protagonists. The film's title is taken from lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan's character in the 1982 film Satte Pe Satta. The film is based on the Hollywood movie Like Mike. The film features music by Salim‚ÄìSulaiman and lyrics by Irfan Siddiqui. Cricketer Kapil Dev also makes a cameo appearance in the film.  Plot  Karan (Zain Khan) is a thirteen-year-old boy who lives in a dilapidated orphanage owned by a stern, uncouth warden, John \\"Hitler\\" Kakkad (Rajesh Khera). Karan has two dreams: one is to have parents and the other is to be a big Cricketer. His inspiration is Kapil Dev, since he has been brought up on the motivating His dreams take a turn when one day, he lays his hands on an old cricket bat which Karan is convinced is the bat that Kapil Dev used to win the 1983 World Cup; for him, the bat becomes a magic bat. One day by a stroke of luck, the coach of the Indian cricket team spots Karan playing cricket and is highly impressed by his batting skill. At that point in town, the Indian cricket team has been going through a \\"rough patch\\". Karan and his magical bat are inducted into the Indian cricket team as the opening batsman along with the captain, Varun (Rahul Bose). When Karan marches onto the pitch and wins the match for India, he soon becomes the nation's heartthrob. Although he was formerly rejected by adopting couples, he is now the most sought after kid in the country. However, Raghav (Raj Bhansali), the orphanage bully, hates him and feels that if Karan did not have the magic bat he would have never made it to the cricket team. Raghav now wants the magic bat at any cost. Karan and Varun develop a strong emotional bond deeper than fellow cricketers. Karan has no parents and Varun has parents, but is estranged with his father and does not want to accept him. Karan strongly believes that parents are the best gift endowed by God and succeeds in uniting Varun with his father. At the final 5th one day match between India and Pakistan, events spiral out of control and Karan's magic bat is destroyed by Raghav. Karan is a nervous wreck, but Varun makes him realise that the bat was in fact just an ordinary bat, and it was a mere coincidence that two players viz. Karan and Kapil Dev who used that bat were both incredibly talented batsmen. Karan could get the magic back forever, if he places faith in himself instead of the bat. With Karan's help, India wins the match. After the match, Karan decides to stop playing and re-join the team when he is older. Varun and his girlfriend whom he marries, Malini (Meera Vasudevan) decide to adopt Karan.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 3, 2011 It contains over 100 aquatic species making it the second most diverse stream in North America. Known for its excellent bream, catfish, and crappie fishing, portions of the bayou are considered some of the best kept secrets of Arkansas anglers. It starts northwest of the city of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, in the Hardin community, winds through parts of Jefferson, Lincoln, Desha, Drew, Chicot, and Ashley counties in Arkansas, and Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, and eventually dumps into the Ouachita River after passing by the northernmost tip of Ouachita Parish, near Sterlington, Louisiana. The bayou serves as the primary border separating the Arkansas Delta from the Arkansas Timberlands. Bayou Bartholomew The present bayou bed was formed by the waters of the Arkansas River during a period when it was constantly changing courses. Approximately 1,800 to 2,200 years ago, the river diverted from the present area of the bayou, and the leisurely bayou began to develop in the old river bed. Until construction of railroad lines in the area in the late 19th century, it was the most important stream for transportation in the interior Delta. It allowed the development of one of the richest timber and agricultural industries in the Delta area. Once a pristine stream, it is now polluted, log-jammed, and over-sedimented in certain sections. In 1995, Dr. Curtis Merrell of Monticello (Drew County) organized the Bayou Bartholomew Alliance to \\"restore and preserve the natural beauty\\" of the bayou. With help from the Alliance, many government organizations (such as the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, Arkansas Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), Ducks Unlimited, and the public, the bayou may eventually reclaim some of its grandeur. Projects underway include monitoring water quality, planting trees for buffer zones, restoring riparian sites ruined by clear-cutting, trash removal, removing log jams, bank stabilization, building boat ramps, and encouraging no-till farming. At Beekman, LA, the bayou has a mean annual discharge of 1,985 cubic feet per second.https://waterdata.usgs.gov/la/nwis/annual/?format=sites_selection_links&search;_site_no=07364500&agency;_cd=USGS&referred_module=sw Location ;Mouth: Confluence with the Ouachita River in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana: ;Source: Jefferson County, Arkansas: See also List of Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers References External links * http://www.arkansasstripers.com/bartholomew.htm * http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=2226 Wetlands and bayous of Louisiana Wetlands of Arkansas Tributaries of the Red River of the South Bodies of water of Jefferson County, Arkansas Bodies of water of Lincoln County, Arkansas Rivers of Desha County, Arkansas Bodies of water of Drew County, Arkansas Bodies of water of Chicot County, Arkansas Bodies of water of Ashley County, Arkansas Bodies of water of Morehouse Parish, Louisiana Bodies of water of Ouachita Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Bayou Bartholomew"},{"id":"13198645","text":"Voigtsdorf () is a municipality in the district Mecklenburgische Seenplatte, in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is the G.I. Joe Team's original communications officer and debuted in 1982. Profile His real name is Alvin R. Kibbey, and his rank is that of corporal E-4. Breaker was born in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Breaker is familiar with all NATO and Warsaw Pact communication gear, as well as most world export devices. His primary military specialty is Infantry, and as his secondary military specialty he is a radio telecommunications technician. His specialized education includes Signal School, where he studied covert electronics and was involved with Project GAMMA. He is a qualified expert in the M-16, M-1911A1, and MAC-10 (Ingram). Breaker is described as \\"efficient and self-assured, and has an uncanny ability to turn adverse situations to his favor.\\" He also speaks seven languages. Breaker is the link between the battlefield and headquarters and has the ability to call in an air strike, provide artillery coordinates, request a Med-Evac or find an extraction site. Breaker constantly monitors all radio frequencies, providing situation reports to the command center. He also has the ability to crack enemy codes and to jam their transmissions. He is well liked by his teammates, although he has a habit of chewing bubble gum in any situation. In the UK Action Force toy series, Breaker is from Munich in Germany. Toys Breaker was first released as an action figure in 1982. All of the original sixteen figures from 1982 were released with \\"straight arms.\\" The same figure was re-released in 1983 with \\"swivel-arm battle grip\\", which made it easier for figures to hold their rifles and accessories. In Argentina, straight-arm Breaker was recolored in gray and available as \\"Topson\\". A version of Breaker nearly identical to the U.S. version was released in Argentina as \\"Roger\\" and in Brazil as \\"Falcon\\". A new version of Breaker was released in 1997, as part of the \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" boxed set. Figures of the character in the 25th Anniversary line include a bubblegum bubble accessory. To coincide with the launch of the movie G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Hasbro released a figure in 2009 based on the Breaker movie character, listed as Abel \\"Breaker\\" Shaz.

Joe: A Real American Hero #2 In issue #5, Breaker joins Steeler and Clutch in a parade with the M.O.B.A.T. (Multi-Ordnance Battle Tank); Cobra appears and attempts to steal the tank, which has no ammunition, so the Joes turn the tank's speakers to full blast and amplify the sound of Breaker's gum popping through a microphone in order to fool Cobra into thinking the cannon has fired a live round, which successfully encourages Cobra to surrender.G.I.

Joe: Renegades episode \\"The Package.\\" In this show, Alvin Kibbey is a college student who used to work for SSS Mart (which is owned by Cobra) until he was fired upon being accused of stealing one of their scanners (which he secretly did after that). Alvin starts an Anti-Cobra blog under the alias of the Coyote. G.I. Joe stumbles upon a plot to dispose of him, when they discover that a package to him was a bomb. When they find Alvin, he recognizes Scarlett by her blog screen name. Alvin explains that the scanner he stole contains the info on any illegal weapon selling that SSS Mart has been doing. G.I. Joe protects him when Baroness sends Major Bludd to assassinate him. Cobra is fooled into thinking Alvin had perished when a thrown knife goes through the scanner in his backpack instead of his body. Alvin had also laid a trap using the bomb to destroy a Cobra weapons depot. In the episode \\"Return of the Arashikage\\" Pt. 1, it appears that Breaker has been placed in a hidden location by G.I. Joe in order to find any other evidence that would expose the illegal activities of Cobra Industries. In the episode \\"The Enemy of My Enemy,\\" Breaker is mentioned to have some informants working for him to supply any info to G.I. Joe, if those informants aren't killed by one of Cobra Commander's operatives first. In the episode \\"Revelations\\" Pt. 2, Breaker was seen in the company of General Abernathy and the Falcons when the Joes and Professor Patrick O'Hara arrived with the right evidence that would clear their names.

The proclamation declared martial law and promised freedom for slaves of American revolutionaries who left their owners and joined the royal forces, becoming Black Loyalists. According to historians, the proclamation was designed for practical and militaristic reasons rather than moral reasons or humanitarianism.To Make Our World Anew, Volume I: A History of African Americans to 1880, p. 120 Formally proclaimed on November 15, its publication prompted between 800 and 2000 slaves (from both patriot and loyalist owners) to run away and enlist with Dunmore. It also raised a furor among Virginia's slave-owning elites (again of both political persuasions), to whom the possibility of a slave rebellion was a major fear. The proclamation ultimately failed in meeting Dunmore's objectives; he was forced out of the colony in 1776, taking about 300 former slaves with him. The 1779 Philipsburg Proclamation applied to all the colonies. During the course of the war, between 80,000 and 100,000 slaves escaped from the plantations.Rough Crossings; Britain, the Slaves & the American Revolution: Simon Schama Page19 Background John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, originally from Scotland, was the royal governor of the Colony of Virginia from 1771 to 1775. During his tenure, he worked proactively to extend Virginia's western borders past the Appalachian Mountains, despite the British Royal Proclamation of 1763. He notably defeated the Shawnee nation in Dunmore's War, gaining land south of the Ohio River. As a widespread dislike for the British crown (as a result of the American Revolution) became apparent, however, Dunmore changed his attitude towards the colonists; he became frustrated with the lack of respect towards the British Crown. Dunmore's popularity worsened after, following orders, he attempted to prevent the election of representatives to the Second Continental Congress. On April 21, 1775, he seized colonial ammunition stores, an action that resulted in the formation of an angry mob. The colonists argued that the ammunition belonged to them, not to the British Crown. That night, Dunmore angrily swore, \\"I have once fought for the Virginians and by God, I will let them see that I can fight against them.\\" This was one of the first instances that Dunmore overtly threatened to institute martial law. While he had not formally passed any rulings, news of his plan spread through the colony rapidly. A group of slaves offered their services to the royal governor not long after April 21. Though he ordered them away, the colonial slaveholders remained suspicious of his intentions. As colonial protests became violent, Dunmore fled the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg and took refuge aboard the frigate HMS Fowey at Yorktown on June 8, 1775. For several months, Dunmore replenished his forces and supplies by conducting raids and inviting slaves to join him. When Virginia's House of Burgesses decided that Dunmore's departure indicated his resignation, he drafted a formal proclamation now named after him, signing it on Nov 7. It was publicly proclaimed a week later. Dunmore's Proclamation In the official document, he declared martial law and adjudged all revolutionaries as traitors to the crown. Furthermore, the document declared \\"all indentured servants, Negroes, or others...free that are able and willing to bear arms...\\" Dunmore expected such a revolt to have several effects. Primarily, it would bolster his own forces, which, cut off from reinforcements from British-held Boston, numbered only around 300. Secondarily, he hoped that such an action would create a fear of a general slave uprising amongst the colonists and would force them to abandon the revolution. Colonial reaction The Virginia Convention was outraged and responded on December 14, 1775 with an unambiguous declaration that all fugitive slaves would be executed: Newspapers such as The Virginia Gazette published the proclamation in full, and patrols were organized to look for any slaves attempting to take Dunmore up on his offer. The Gazette not only criticized Dunmore for offering freedom to only those slaves belonging to revolutionaries who were willing to serve him, but also questioned whether he would be true to his word, suggesting that he would sell the escaped slaves in the West Indies. The paper therefore cautioned slaves to \\"Be not then...tempted by the proclamation to ruin your selves.\\" As very few slaves were literate, this was more a symbolic move than anything. It was also noted that Dunmore himself was a slaveholder. On December 4, the Continental Congress recommended to Virginian colonists that they resist Dunmore \\"to the uttermost...\\" On December 13, the Virginia Convention responded in kind with a proclamation of its own, declaring that any slaves who returned to their masters within ten days would be pardoned, but those who did not would be 'hanged without the benefit of clergy.' Estimates of the number of slaves that reached Dunmore vary, but generally range between 800 and 2,000. The escaped slaves Dunmore accepted were enlisted into what was known as Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment. The only notable battle in which Dunmore's regiment participated was the Battle of Great Bridge in early December 1775, which was a decisive British loss. Dunmore's strategy was ultimately unsuccessful as his forces were decimated by a smallpox outbreak less than a year later. When Dunmore ultimately left the colony in 1776 he took 300 of the former slaves with him. In 1779, British General Sir Henry Clinton issued the Philipsburg Proclamation, which freed slaves owned by revolutionaries throughout the rebel states, even if they did not enlist in the British Army. It resulted in a significantly larger number of runaways. It is estimated that up to 100,000 attempted to leave their owners and join the British over the course of the entire war. At the end of the war, the British relocated about 3,000 former slaves to Nova Scotia. Even though the numbers were small compared to the total slave population, more American slaves found their freedom through these proclamations than any other means until the Civil War.

The group's motto is \\"A person is what he is and not what he looks like\\".  History  The club claims to have a history in Piobbico, Italy, from 1879. It was launched again in 1963 as a marriage agency for the town's single women. The World Association of Ugly People club campaigns against discrimination in the workplace based on looks. It attempts to make society more aware of ugly people's problems. It also helps people overcome their phobias and, in some cases, to find partners. In 2007, the group unveiled a monument dedicated to ugly people in Piobbico's town square. The monument depicts an unknown person looking at his reflection in a mirror.  Traditions  The club's emblem is the head of a wild boar. The club's crest features a reclining man smoking a pipe with the slogan: \\"Ugliness is a virtue, beauty is slavery\\". The club's patron is Vulcan from Roman mythology. At birth Vulcan was so ugly that his mother threw him over a cliff. He survived and became a skilled blacksmith. For providing Achilles with superior weapons, he was admitted to Mount Olympus where he married the beautiful Venus, goddess of love.Support for the Ugly = President = The members of the World Association of Ugly People elect their president annually during the Festival of the Ugly. This event is hosted by the small town of Piobbico in the Marche region of Italy every year on the first Sunday of September.

A pressurised fluid, typically compressed air, or a centrifugal wheel is used to propel the blasting material (often called the media). The first abrasive blasting process was patented by Benjamin Chew Tilghman on 18 October 1870. There are several variants of the process, using various media; some are highly abrasive, whereas others are milder. The most abrasive are shot blasting (with metal shot) and sandblasting (with sand). Moderately abrasive variants include glass bead blasting (with glass beads) and plastic media blasting (PMB) with ground-up plastic stock or walnut shells and corncobs. Some of these substances can cause anaphylactic shock to individuals allergic to the media.Travis McEwan, \\"Edmonton worker allergic to walnuts dies after inhaling particles at worksite,\\" CBC News, 23 October 2017. (Retrieved 2017-10-25) A mild version is sodablasting (with baking soda). In addition, there are alternatives that are barely abrasive or nonabrasive, such as ice blasting and dry-ice blasting. Types =Sandblasting= Sand blasting is also known as abrasive blasting, which is a generic term for the process of smoothing, shaping and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds; the effect is similar to that of using sandpaper, but provides a more even finish with no problems at corners or crannies. Sandblasting can occur naturally, usually as a result of particles blown by wind causing aeolian erosion, or artificially, using compressed air. An artificial sandblasting process was patented by Benjamin Chew Tilghman on 18 October 1870. Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or work piece. Nozzles come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well. =Wet abrasive blasting= One of the original pioneers of the wet abrasive (vapourmatting) process was Norman Ashworth who found the advantages of using a wet process a strong alternative to dry blasting. The process is available in all conventional formats including hand cabinets, walk-in booths, automated production machinery and total loss portable blasting units. Advantages include the ability to use extremely fine or coarse media with densities ranging from plastic to steel and the ability to use hot water and soap to allow simultaneous degreasing and blasting. The reduction in dust also makes it safer to use silicacious materials for blasting, or to remove hazardous material such as asbestos, radioactive or poisonous products. Process speeds are generally not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media, in part because the presence of water between the media and the substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the surface and the media, reducing breakdown rates. Reduced impregnation of blasting material into the surface, dust reduction and the elimination of static cling can result in a very clean surface. However wet blasting of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface recontamination also allows the use of single equipment for multiple blasting operations‚Äîe.g., stainless steel and mild steel items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems. =Bead blasting= Bead blasting paint from a concrete curb. Mixing particles with water substantially reduces dust. Bead blasting is the process of removing surface deposits by applying fine glass beads at a high pressure without damaging the surface. It is used to clean calcium deposits from pool tiles or any other surfaces, remove embedded fungus, and brighten grout color. It is also used in auto body work to remove paint. In removing paint for auto body work, bead blasting is preferred over sand blasting, as sand blasting tends to create a greater surface profile than bead blasting. Bead blasting is often used in creating a uniform surface finish on machined parts. It is additionally used in cleaning mineral specimens, most of which have a Mohs hardness of 7 or less and would thus be damaged by sand. =Wheel blasting= In wheel blasting, a spinning wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless blasting operation because there is no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high- efficiency blasting operation with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, cut wire, grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel blast machines propel plastic abrasive in a cryogenic chamber, and is usually used for deflashing plastic and rubber components. The size of the wheel blast machine, and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted as well as on the expected result and efficiency. The first blast wheel was patented by Wheelabrator in 1932. In China, the first blast wheel was built around the 1950s, Qinggong Machinery is one of the earliest manufacturers of blast wheel. =Hydro-blasting= Hydro blasting is not a form of abrasive blasting as no abrasive media is used. Hydro-blasting, commonly known as water blasting, is commonly used because it usually requires only one operator. In hydro-blasting, a highly pressured stream of water is used to remove old paint, chemicals, or buildup without damaging the original surface. This method is ideal for cleaning internal and external surfaces because the operator is generally able to send the stream of water into places that are difficult to reach using other methods. Another benefit of hydro-blasting is the ability to recapture and reuse the water, reducing waste and mitigating environmental impact. =Micro- abrasive blasting= Micro-abrasive blasting is dry abrasive blasting process that uses small nozzles (typically 0.25 mm to 1.5 mm diameter) to deliver a fine stream of abrasive accurately to a small part or a small area on a larger part. Generally the area to be blasted is from about 1 mm2 to only a few cm2 at most. Also known as pencil blasting, the fine jet of abrasive is accurate enough to write directly on glass and delicate enough to cut a pattern in an eggshell. The abrasive media particle sizes range from 10 micrometres up to about 150 micrometres. Higher pressures are often required. The most common micro-abrasive blasting systems are commercial bench-mounted units consisting of a power supply and mixer, exhaust hood, nozzle, and gas supply. The nozzle can be hand-held or fixture mounted for automatic operation. Either the nozzle or part can be moved in automatic operation. =Automated blasting= Automated blasting is simply the automation of the abrasive blasting process. Automated blasting is frequently just a step in a larger automated procedure, usually involving other surface treatments such as preparation and coating applications. Care is often needed to isolate the blasting chamber from mechanical components that may be subject to dust fouling. = Dry-ice blasting = In this type of blasting, air and dry ice are used. Surface contaminants are dislodged by the force of frozen carbon dioxide particles hitting at high velocity, and by slight shrinkage due to freezing which disrupts adhesion bonds. The dry ice sublimates, leaving no residue to clean up other than the removed material. Dry ice is a relatively soft material, so is less destructive to the underlying material than sandblasting. =Bristle blasting= Bristle blasting, unlike other blasting methods, does not require a separate blast medium. The surface is treated by a brush-like rotary tool made of dynamically tuned high-carbon steel wire bristles. Repeated contact with the sharp, rotating bristle tips results in localized impact, rebound, and crater formation, which simultaneously cleans and coarsens the surface. =Vacuum blasting= Vacuum blasting is a method that generates very little dust and spill, as the blast tool does dry abrasive blasting and collects used blast media and loosened particles from the surface to be treated, simultaneously. Blast media consumption is relatively low with this method, as the used blast media is automatically separated from dust and loosened particles, and reused several times. Equipment Device used for adding sand to the compressed air (top of which is a sieve for adding the sand) =Portable blast equipment= Mobile dry abrasive blast systems are typically powered by a diesel air compressor. The air compressor provides a large volume of high pressure air to a single or multiple \\"blast pots\\". Blast pots are pressurized, tank-like containers, filled with abrasive material, used to allow an adjustable amount of blasting grit into the main blasting line. The number of blast pots is dictated by the volume of air the compressor can provide. Fully equipped blast systems are often found mounted on semi-tractor trailers, offering high mobility and easy transport from site to site. Others are hopper-fed types making them lightweight and more mobile. In wet blasting, the abrasive is introduced into a pressurized stream of water or other liquid, creating a slurry. Wet blasting is often used in applications where the minimal dust generation is desired. Portable applications may or may not recycle the abrasive. =Blast cabinet= A sand-blasting cabinet A blast cabinet is essentially a closed loop system that allows the operator to blast the part and recycle the abrasive. It usually consists of four components; the containment (cabinet), the abrasive blasting system, the abrasive recycling system and the dust collection. The operator blasts the parts from the outside of the cabinet by placing his arms in gloves attached to glove holes on the cabinet, viewing the part through a view window, turning the blast on and off using a foot pedal or treadle. Automated blast cabinets are also used to process large quantities of the same component and may incorporate multiple blast nozzles and a part conveyance system. There are three systems typically used in a blast cabinet. Two, siphon and pressure, are dry and one is wet: * A siphon blast system (suction blast system) uses the compressed air to create vacuum in a chamber (known as the blast gun). The negative pressure pulls abrasive into the blast gun where the compressed air directs the abrasive through a blast nozzle. The abrasive mixture travels through a nozzle that directs the particles toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. Tungsten carbide is the liner material most often used for mineral abrasives. Silicon carbide and boron carbide nozzles are more wear resistant and are often used with harder abrasives such as aluminum oxide. Inexpensive abrasive blasting systems and smaller cabinets use ceramic nozzles. * In a pressure blast system, the abrasive is stored in the pressure vessel then sealed. The vessel is pressurized to the same pressure as the blast hose attached to the bottom of the pressure vessel. The abrasive is metered into the blast hose and conveyed by the compressed gas through the blast nozzle. * Wet blast cabinets use a system that injects the abrasive/liquid slurry into a compressed gas stream. Wet blasting is typically used when the heat produced by friction in dry blasting would damage the part. =Blast room= A blast room is a much larger version of a blast cabinet. Blast operators work inside the room to roughen, smooth, or clean surfaces of an item depending on the needs of the finished product. Blast rooms and blast facilities come in many sizes, some of which are big enough to accommodate very large or uniquely shaped objects like rail cars, commercial and military vehicles, construction equipment, and aircraft. Each application may require the use of many different pieces of equipment, however, there are several key components that can be found in a typical blast room: * An enclosure or containment system, usually the room itself, designed to remain sealed to prevent blast media from escaping * A blasting system; wheel blasting and air blasting systems are commonly used * A blast pot ‚Äì a pressurized container filled with abrasive blasting media * A dust collection system which filters the air in the room and prevents particulate matter from escaping * A material recycling or media reclamation system to collect abrasive blasting media so it can be used again; these can be automated mechanical or pneumatic systems installed in the floor of the blast room, or the blast media can be collected manually by sweeping or shoveling the material back into the blast pot Additional equipment can be added for convenience and improved usability, such as overhead cranes for maneuvering the workpiece, wall-mounted units with multiple axes that allow the operator to reach all sides of the workpiece, and sound-dampening materials used to reduce noise levels. Media In the early 1900s, it was assumed that sharp- edged grains provided the best performance, but this was later shown to be incorrect.1919 Popular Science article on types of minerals found to be suitable for sandblasting ‚Äì Little Grains of Sand, Popular Science monthly, February 1919, page 64, scanned by Google Books Mineral: Silica sand can be used as a type of mineral abrasive. It tends to break up quickly, creating large quantities of dust, exposing the operator to the potential development of silicosis, a debilitating lung disease. To counter this hazard, silica sand for blasting is often coated with resins to control the dust. Using silica as an abrasive is not allowed in Germany, Belgium, Russia, Sweden and United Kingdom for this reason. Silica is a common abrasive in countries where it is not banned. Another common mineral abrasive is garnet. Garnet is more expensive than silica sand, but if used correctly, will offer equivalent production rates while producing less dust and no safety hazards from ingesting the dust. Magnesium sulphate, or kieserite, is often used as an alternative to baking soda. Agricultural: Typically, crushed nut shells or fruit kernels. These soft abrasives are used to avoid damaging the underlying material such when cleaning brick or stone, removing graffiti, or the removal of coatings from printed circuit boards being repaired. Synthetic: This category includes corn starch, wheat starch, sodium bicarbonate, and dry ice. These \\"soft\\" abrasives are also used to avoid damaging the underlying material such when cleaning brick or stone, removing graffiti, or the removal of coatings from printed circuit boards being repaired. Sodablasting uses baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) which is extremely friable, the micro fragmentation on impact exploding away surface materials without damage to the substrate. Additional synthetic abrasives include process byproducts (e.g., copper slag, nickel slag, and coal slag), engineered abrasives (e.g., aluminum oxide, silicon carbide or carborundum, glass beads, ceramic shot/grit), and recycled products (e.g., plastic abrasive, glass grit). Metallic: Steel shot, steel grit, stainless steel shot, cut wire, copper shot, aluminum shot, zinc shot. Many coarser media used in sandblasting often result in energy being given off as sparks or light on impact. The colours and size of the spark or glow varies significantly, with heavy bright orange sparks from steel shot blasting, to a faint blue glow (often invisible in sunlight or brightly lit work areas) from garnet abrasive.  Safety  Cleaning operations using abrasive blasting can present risks for workers' health and safety, specifically in portable air blasting or blast room (booth) applications. There is a large amount of dust created through abrasive blasting from the substrate and abrasive. Although many abrasives used in blasting rooms are not hazardous in themselves, (steel shot and grit, cast iron, aluminum oxide, garnet, plastic abrasive and glass bead), other abrasives (silica sand, copper slag, nickel slag, and staurolite) have varying degrees of hazard (typically free silica or heavy metals). However, in all cases their use can present serious danger to operators, such as burns due to projections (with skin or eye lesions), falls due to walking on round shot scattered on the ground, exposure to hazardous dusts, heat exhaustion, creation of an explosive atmosphere, and exposure to excessive noise. Blasting rooms and portable blaster's equipment have been adapted to these dangers. Blasting lead-based paint can fill the air with lead particles which can be harmful to the nervous system. In the US the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates engineered solutions to potential hazards, however silica sand continues to be allowed even though most commonly used blast helmets are not sufficiently effective at protecting the blast operator if ambient levels of dust exceed allowable limits. Adequate levels of respiratory protection for blast operations in the United States is approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Typical safety equipment for operators includes: * Positive pressure blast hood or helmet ‚Äì The hood or helmet includes a head suspension system to allow the device to move with the operator's head, a view window with replaceable lens or lens protection and an air-feed hose. * Grade‚ÄëD air supply (or self- contained oil-less air pump) ‚Äì The air feed hose is typically attached to a grade‚ÄëD pressurized air supply. Grade‚ÄëD air is mandated by OSHA to protect the worker from hazardous gases. It includes a pressure regulator, air filtration and a carbon monoxide monitor/alarm. An alternative method is a self- contained, oil-less air pump to feed pressurized air to the blast hood/helmet. An oil-less air pump does not require an air filter or carbon monoxide monitor/alarm, because the pressurized air is coming from a source that cannot generate carbon monoxide. * Hearing protection ‚Äì ear muffs or ear plugs * Body protection ‚Äì Body protection varies by application but usually consists of gloves and overalls or a leather coat and chaps. Professionals would wear a cordura/canvas blast suit (unless blasting with steel abrasives, then they would use a leather suit). In the past, when sandblasting was performed as an open-air job, the worker was exposed to risk of injury from the flying material and lung damage from inhaling the dust. The silica dust produced in the sandblasting process would cause silicosis after sustained inhalation of the dust. In 1918, the first sandblasting enclosure was built, which protected the worker with a viewing screen, revolved around the workpiece, and used an exhaust fan to draw dust away from the worker's face.Making Things Easier for the Sand-Blaster, Popular Science monthly, December 1918, page 76, scanned by Google Books Silicosis is still a risk when the operator is not completely isolated from the sandblasting apparatus. Sandblasting also may present secondary risks, such as falls from scaffolding or confinement in a small space. Carbon monoxide poisoning is another potential risk, from the use of small gasoline-powered engines in abrasive blasting. Several countries and territories now regulate sandblasting such that it may only be performed in a controlled environment using ventilation, protective clothing and breathing air supply. =Worn-look jeans= Many consumers are willing to pay extra for jeans that have the appearance of being used. To give the fabrics the right worn look sandblasting is used. Sandblasting has the risk of causing silicosis to the workers, and in Turkey, more than 5,000 workers in the textile industry suffer from silicosis, and 46 people are known to have died from it. Silicosis was shown to be very common among former denim sandblasters in Turkey in 2007. A 2015 study confirmed that silicosis is almost inevitable among former sandblasters. Sweden's Fair Trade Center conducted a survey among 17 textile companies that showed very few were aware of the dangers caused by manually sandblasting jeans. Several companies said they would abolish this technique from their own production. In 2013, research claimed that in China some factories producing worn-look jeans are involved in varied non-compliance with health and safety regulations.  Applications  The lettering and engraving on most modern cemetery monuments and markers is created by abrasive blasting. Sandblasting can also be used to produce three-dimensional signage. This type of signage is considered to be a higher-end product as compared to flat signs. These signs often incorporate gold leaf overlay and sometimes crushed glass backgrounds which is called smalts. When sandblasting wood signage it allows the wood grains to show and the growth rings to be raised, and is a popular way to give a sign a traditional carved look. Sandblasting can also be done on clear acrylic glass and glazing as part of a store front or interior design. Sandblasting can be used to refurbish buildings or create works of art (carved or frosted glass). Modern masks and resists facilitate this process, producing accurate results. Sandblasting techniques are used for cleaning boat hulls, as well as brick, stone, and concrete work. Sandblasting is used for cleaning industrial as well as commercial structures, but is rarely used for non- metallic workpieces.

The name Bollewick with its components (round, bellied) and wick (German suffix wig, wik = place or village, borrowed from Latin vicus = village) means Runddorf. From the early settlement of the area remained two megalithic tombs near the village. Bollewick was built as part of Nedebuh ( now N√§tebow ) in the 13th century by the knight of Werle Konrad B√ºne. The first mention dates from January 21, 1261.750 year anniversary The village was then about 1200 meters further west on the almost circular Wackstower lake. The original site was abandoned probably due to the high groundwater level at the lake shore. Already at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, the village stood desolate. Bollewick was built as a long-stretched linear settlement from the 18th century on the present site. After frequent change of ownership and gradual reconstruction, the community was increasingly resettled in the early 1930s.  Attractions  * The Bollewick barn was built in 1881 and is a landmark of the municipality. It is the largest fieldstone barn in Germany, with a 125 m √ó 34 m area under the roof. Until 1991 barn was used for agriculture and since was renovated and converted into an event center with hotel and rows of shops. * The early Gothic, cross-ribbed vaulted brick church in N√§tebow.

Background Probably Franciscan in origin, it was brought to Britain by French friars in the 13th century. It is said to have originally consisted of 27 stanzas, with each following stanza beginning with the consecutive letter of the alphabet. Surviving manuscripts may be found in a c. 1361 Dublin Troper (a music book for use at Mass) and a 13th or 14th century vellum Sequentiale that may have been connected with the Church of Addle, Yorkshire. Its lyrics also appear in the works of John Audelay (perhaps a priest, he definitely spent the last years of his life at Haughmond Abbey, where he wrote for the monks), in a group of four Marian poems. It appears in Geoffrey Chaucer's Miller's Tale, where the scholar Nicholas sings it in Latin to the accompaniment of his psaltery: :And over all there lay a psaltery :Whereon he made an evening's melody, :Playing so sweetly that the chamber rang; :And Angelus ad virginem he sang; :And after that he warbled the King's Note: :Often in good voice was his merry throat.

Brant, he was sired by the outstanding North American stud and graded stakes race winner Mr. Prospector out of the graded stakes race winning Rambunctious mare Jameela. Racing career Guided by Hall of Fame trainer LeRoy Jolley, Gulch was a precocious two-year-old, winning the Grade I Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga Race Course with √Ångel Cordero Jr. astride by 3¬Ω lengths. He was undefeated that year going into the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, having won five starts in New York, but placed fifth to Capote, behind Alysheba and Bet Twice. At three, prepping for the Kentucky Derby, Gulch won the Wood Memorial with Jos√© A. Santos aboard. He also took the Grade II Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack. Ridden by Willie Shoemaker in the 1987 Kentucky Derby, however, he raced wide in the stretch and placed sixth behind Alysheba. He also ran in the Preakness Stakes, where he finished fourth. He was third in the Belmont Stakes, in front of Alysheba but behind the winner, Bet Twice. In between the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes, he ran in and won the Metropolitan Handicap. He would go on to win the race again the next year. Racing at four in 1988, he was transferred to trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Lukas shortened most of his races to 1‚Öõ mile or less, and Gulch won the Metropolitan Handicap, the Carter Handicap, and, in a battle of the sexes, placed a very close second in the Whitney Handicap to Personal Ensign. He also won the Breeders' Cup Sprint that fall and was named 1988's U.S. Outstanding Sprint Horse. Retirement Retired in 1989, Gulch stood at stud at Lane's End Farm. In spring 2010, Lane's End donated him to the Old Friends Equine retirement facility in Georgetown, Kentucky. Following the death of Ogygian on March 14, 2015, Gulch became the oldest living horse at Old Friends. On January 17, 2016, he was euthanized at the age of 31.

It is named for Monticello, the historic home of Thomas Jefferson, located near the center of the area. The Monticello AVA includes most of the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene, Orange, and Nelson. The area is nestled along the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains and encompasses the small ridge known as the Southwest Mountains. There are approximately 30 varieties of grapes grown in the Monticello AVA. However, the most notable grapes grown in the area include Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay and Viognier. The hardiness zone is 7a except in some higher vineyards which are 6b. History The earliest recorded attempts at winemaking in the area occurred in the 1770s, when Thomas Jefferson provided financial support to Italian winemaker, Philip Mazzei, who made a small quantity of wine from the native grapes, but without much success. Jefferson gave Mazzei significant acreage less than south of Monticello for the purpose of growing grapes. The area was planted in 1774. In 1776, with the advent of the Revolutionary war, Jefferson and George Washington dispatched Mazzei back to Italy to solicit war funding from the Duke of Tuscany. As was the practice at that time, Mazzei rented his home, in this instance to the Hessian cavalry officer Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, a prisoner of war who had been captured at Saratoga and was imprisoned in the Charlottesville barracks. Riedesel moved his entire staff up to Mazzei's home and turned their horses out to pasture in the infant vineyards. The vineyards were destroyed.

Among the owners of the village were the knights of Grambow, the families of Pritzbuer, Helmuth von Pederstorff and the aristocratic family von Bl√ºcher. At times, there was a glassworks in today's district Kn√ºppeldamm. The Fincken church dates back to 1748. It is probably the only church in the country church (Landeskirche) of Mecklenburg, which was leased by the Protestant parish to the community. Together they successfully raised money to maintain the building, and as a result, in 2009, the ceiling of the church room was renovated. { Church in Fincken Church in Fincken ‚Äì Interior } In the early 1930s Fincken and other places in the area were settled with many farmers.

It ends in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The bikeway was named on July 17, 1978 in memory of Claire Saltonstall, the daughter of Senator William L. Saltonstall. Claire was killed by an automobile in 1974 while she was riding her bicycle. Senator Saltonstall was a sponsor of bicycle safety legislation and was instrumental in developing the bikeway. Dual signs were erected along the route shortly after the bikeway opened, one with a picture of a bicycle in a green background and the green number 1 below the picture, and another rectangular sign with the words Claire Saltonstall Bikeway below that. Few of the original signs survive today, however, and new signs were erected in the summer of 2018. Route Description This back road bikeway follows various state parkways, highways, and town roads and bike paths. Nearly all of the roads along the bikeway are paved and leave enough room to comfortably ride in a bike lane. The only exception is on the Sagamore Bridge where you must walk your bicycle due to state safety regulations. It passes near many state parks south of Boston, including Blue Hills Reservation, Ames Nowell State Park, Pilgrim Memorial State Park, Myles Standish State Forest, Scusset Beach State Reservation, Nickerson State Park, and Cape Cod National Seashore. Turn by turn directions are given for the three major sections of the bikeway: Greater Boston, Metro South and SE Mass, and Cape Cod going from Boston to Cape Cod. Boston Area The first 13 miles of the bikeway begin along the banks of the Charles River near Boston University. The route passes by the school over US 20 and follows its way into the Fenway neighborhood. The bikeway follows down the Riverway bike paths, passing the Longwood Medical Area, down to the Emerald Necklace. The route intersects at Route 9 and continues down the Jamaciaway. The bikeway has a short congruency with the Arborway before exiting at Centre Street. Going southward, the bikeway flows from Centre Street to VFW Parkway. You must then exit to West Roxbury Parkway at the rotary and pass by the Bellevue MBTA station. Going northward, the bikeway passes by the Bellevue stop and merges onto Centre Street. The route continues down the West Roxbury Parkway, Enneking Parkway, and Turtle Pond Parkway before turning onto the Neponset Valley Parkway, which runs through the Readville section of the city. The bikeway exits onto Blue Hill Avenue onto Route 138 and the route makes its way past the Blue Hills Reservation and I-93 into Canton. Blue Hills to Sagamore Bridge The route then travels for 55 miles in metro-south Boston and in suburbs in Southeastern Massachusetts. The route travels past the Blue Hills on MA 138 in Milton and continues into Canton, then turns down Randolph St. which becomes Canton St. in Randolph. It is a concurrent with MA 28 into Avon, where it exits onto E. High St. heading towards Boundary St. and eventually N. Quincy St. in Brockton. It intersects MA 123 and MA 27 before continuing straight to the access road for Massasoit Community College. At the end of the access road, it turns left onto Thatcher St and continues as Elm St. in East Bridgewater. It then turns onto Central St. and intersects at MA 18 as it continues toward Chestnut St., Bridge St., and Crescent St. It then follows down Washington St. until its next turn onto Pond St. which leads into Halifax. It then turns onto Elm St. and continues to Pine St. where it turns east on MA 106 for a short while and then turns onto Carver St. It eventually turns into South St. then onto Franklin St., continuing into Plympton. It travels down Center St. towards MA 58 where it is joined going south into the town center before turning onto Mayflower St. It continues on Colchester Rd. and Brook St. before becoming Elm St. in Kingston where it joins MA 80 for four miles heading down into Plymouth. It turns onto Carver St. and continues past the big intersection (use the rightmost lane) before turning onto Summer St. toward downtown Plymouth. It turns onto MA 3A for half a mile before exiting onto South St. and eventually becoming Long Pond Rd. It passes under MA 3 and continues down toward the Myles Standish State Forest and Plymouth South High School before merging left onto Hedges Pond Rd., where the route will re-meet Route 3A and continue straight onto State Rd. towards the Sagamore Bridge in Bourne. Riders must use the Sagamore Bridge to cross the Cape Cod Canal, and they must walk their bicycles across the bridge. Access to the bridge is available by going straight on Canal Street just past the Sagamore Park and Ride lot on the right. Cape Cod The bikeway continues following back roads and bike paths for 67 miles on Cape Cod starting in Bourne, coming off the Sagamore Bridge onto Adams St. and Sandwich St. which becomes MA 6A. The route turns onto MA 130 heading into Sandwich and passes under US 6, then turns onto Service Rd. passing MA 149 and continuing into Barnstable. It joins MA 132 for a short concurrency before turning onto Phinney's Ln. as it rejoins MA 6A. It continues into Yarmouth and Dennis before turning onto Sentucket Road and Mayfair Road, then joins the Cape Cod Rail Trail through the towns of Harwich, Brewster, Orleans, Eastham, and Wellfleet. The bikeway then makes its way around US 6 through side streets in Truro and finally comes to an end down Commercial Street MA 6A in downtown Provincetown.

He was most recently the assistant general manager for the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) and general manager of the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League. He was the director of amateur scouting for the Pittsburgh Penguins. Prior to that, he was general manager of the Florida Panthers of the NHL. He was one of the founders of the Ottawa Senators NHL club in Ottawa, Ontario. He later became the Senators' second general manager. Career Born in Brockville, Ontario, Randy Sexton attended St. Lawrence University from 1978 until 1982 on a hockey scholarship after playing for the Cornwall Royals. He served as team captain during his final two seasons, earning awards including All-American honors, Senior Male Athlete of the Year, Most Valuable Player and the Brian P. Doyle Leadership Award. From 1983-1985 he served as an assistant coach with St. Lawrence, while also handling scouting and recruiting responsibilities. He later earned a master's degree in business administration (MBA) from Clarkson University. In 1989, Sexton was vice-president of Terrace Investments, a commercial development firm in Ottawa. Bruce Firestone, then president & CEO, developed the idea of reviving NHL hockey in Ottawa, adopting for the club the old Ottawa Senators name. In the original plan, their privately financed arena would anchor a new 'West Terrace' 'mini-city' land development in Kanata, Ontario on class \\"A\\" farmland. Sexton, along with Firestone and Cyril Leeder were the principal persons behind the successful drive to win a new NHL franchise in 1990. Sexton would later be named general manager by majority owner Rod Bryden in 1993 and served until 1995. He was Ottawa's general manager at the 1993 NHL Entry Draft where he selected Alexandre Daigle. He would sign Daigle to a record-breaking salary for a rookie. The contract would lead the league to put restrictions on rookie contracts. He was fired in December 1995 due to the poor performance of the hockey club in the 1995‚Äì96 season. Sexton then turned to sports marketing with the firm Capital Sports Management, which provided strategic advice to the Senators. When the Senators built the Bell Sensplex ice rink facility in 2004, he was named executive director. On January 27, 2007, Sexton was hired as the assistant general manager of the Florida Panthers, serving under then-general manager Jacques Martin, the former head coach of the Ottawa Senators. His responsibilities included overseeing scouting operations, player development, hockey administration and contract negotiations. Sexton was appointed the Panthers' general manager on October 2, 2009, after Jacques Martin resigned to become the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens. Sexton was replaced by former Chicago Blackhawks general manager Dale Tallon after a disappointing 2009‚Äì10 season. On July 3, 2010, Sexton was hired by the Pittsburgh Penguins as an assistant director of amateur scouting. From 2013, he served as the Penguins' co-director of amateur scouting until he was elevated to the position of sole director of amateur scouting in 2015. In 2017 he was named assistant general manager of the Buffalo Sabres and general manager of the Rochester Americans. https://www.tsn.ca/sexton-to-join-sabres-as-assistant-gm-1.788293 On June 16th 2020 he was fired from the Buffalo Sabres. https://www.dkpittsburghsports.com/2020/06/16/buffalo-sabres-fire-jason- botterill-randy-sexton-terry-kim-pegula-tlh/ Personal life Sexton's son, Ben, currently plays for the Penguins organization.

The complex will include housing, shops, office space, a hotel, a library, and a community college (which would share the same building as the library). In addition, a new garage has been constructed on the Metro station lot to replace some of the parking spaces that the Metro will lose to the town center. The Town Center project faced a large number of legal hurdles prior to beginning construction. However, construction finally began, and some of the project is already complete. As of early summer 2012, the construction of what is now known as Owings Mills Metro Centre continues, even as lawmakers continue to argue about details of the final project. Two nearby projects have created a potential fight for a limited market, creating a sense for some neighbors that when the project is complete, it may find itself competing with a glut of other available retail space. In 2004, a developer proposed a mixed-use project next to the Owings Mills Town Center. It would have overlooked a lake which was cancelled in the 1980s by the Army Corps of Engineers due to environmental concerns. The proposal included a series of mid-rise condominium buildings, office space, and a residential component. Metro Centre at Owings Mills is a mixed-use Transit-Oriented Development that incorporates all aspects of an active, modern lifestyle into a single location. With commercial office and retail space, residential units, educational facilities, and a full-service hotel, Metro Centre blends the role of shopper, employee, and resident to create a highly productive and centralized project. Featuring an on-site Metro Station and direct access to all major highways in Metropolitan Baltimore, Metro Centre at Owings Mills is a regional real estate destination that‚Äôs connected with all of Baltimore and the Mid-Atlantic to ensure a nonstop flow of people.  Residential  As of 2020, two apartment complexes have been completed, Metro Crossing Apartments and The Met at Metro Centre. Over 1,700 total residential units are planned for the site.  Retail  Metro Centre is designed to be a one-stop retail and dining destination for customers to get all their errands done in one place, enjoy a leisurely shopping trip, and grab a bite to eat with quick takeout options or sit-down bars and restaurants. With over 1.2 million people using the Owings Mills Metro Stop, living, working, or passing through the area, this high traffic mixed-use community is an ideal place to set up shop. Metro Centre at Owings Mills offers modern retail and restaurant space that encircles the public square, with additional availability throughout the community. Current tenants include: Subway, Suya Spot, Title Boxing Club, Eggspectation, Club Pilates, and World of Beer.  Office  The first of two proposed 4-story office buildings was completed in 2018. The site will feature a total of 1.2 million square feet of office space.  Hospitality  In 2019, construction began on the Marriott Owings Mills Metro Centre Hotel & Conference Center. The Marriott Owings Mills Metro Centre Hotel & Conference Center will offer 229 luxury rooms in addition to a 6,700 SF Ballroom, 4,150 sf outdoor event terrace, boardroom with connected outdoor terrace, 7 meeting rooms, full-service upscale American restaurant, kosher kitchen, lobby bar & lounge, coffee Shop, upscale fitness center, event hub for conference center, and covered portico entrance.

The original members were Liam Cody, Chris Tomkins, Jo Stanley and Samantha Stone. Stone left in 1994 and was replaced by Barbara Joseph. Joseph left a year later. Jo Stanley stopped performing with the Gorskys in 1999 when she began on Melbourne radio network, Fox FM. Liam Cody died after a long battle with cancer on 28 August 2007. Chris Tomkins continues publishing the GORSKYS.COMedy website.  Radio  The Gorskys wrote and performed sketches for independent radio, Melbourne's PBS-FM from 1993‚Äì95. They went on to write and perform sketches for ABC radio including a short series entitled \\"Taxi\\" in which the regular taxi driver characters would pick up and have a discussion with a bizarre passenger each episode.

Television  The Gorskys first opportunity to create television sketches came when Jo Stanley (with Jodie J Hill) began hosting \\"Boob Tube\\", an RMITV produced comedy variety show on Melbourne's public station C31 Melbourne. Liam and Chris also appeared on ABC-TV's \\"E-biz\\" program. In 2003 The Gorskys \\"Adventures of Terrence and Spider:Professional Bouncers\\" was picked up for broadcast as interstitials on Foxtel's The Comedy Channel (Australia) throughout 2003‚Äì04.  Music  The Gorskys always incorporated original and parody comedy songs into their live shows. In 1999 the Gorskys released a tongue-in-cheek track entitled \\"New Millennium\\" which foretold the end of the world on 1 January 2000 (due to the millennium bug). The groups' website crashed on 12 September 2001 (the day after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York) when panicked googlers discovered the lyrics page for \\"New Millennium\\" which included references to \\"planes falling out of the sky\\" and \\"stock market crash\\". \\"New Millennium\\" was released with 4 other tracks on the album \\"Licence to Fish\\".

The municipality Mollenstorf is belonged to the district Ave.  History  Like Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the area around Mollenstorf should be settled too early by Neolithic cultures. This has been proven by countless land discoveries. Far from the road from Mollenstorf to Grobviel, there are three Bronze Age burial mounds preserved as archaeological monuments. Presumably this place was formerly known as Mollenstorp, Mollenstorf and 1558 Mollenstorf. The church was first mentioned in 1335 and is an early Gothic building in the shape of a rectangle in which the cemetery is built. A free-standing bell tower has two bells from the 14th and 15th centuries on the western side of the church. In 1764 he bought Justus von Gundlach Gut Mollenstorf. Until 1945, he was in possession of the family. A large two-storey mansion was built around 1880. In 1897 houses of farm workers and barn were built.

Description The 2-step is a fundamental dance move that is often one of the first footwork sequence learned by breakdancers. Many breakdance moves can begin from the 2-step position. This move sets up the direction of movement and builds up momentum when dancing. This move allows the dancer to stay low and in contact with the ground, which places him in an optimal position for performing other dance moves. This move is launched from the third step of the basic 6-step and involves the dancer hopping with a crouched leg over the other straightened leg while simultaneously rotating the dancer's body over the swinging leg in a twisting movement similar to a swipe. The move leaves the dancer in a position similar to the fourth step of the 6-step, but facing 180 degrees in the opposite direction. When dancing 2-step is often used as a move by itself or as a transition into other moves such as powermoves, freezes, toprock and much more. Step-by-step ::This description is for clockwise rotation. As the name implies, there are a total of two steps in this dance move. A standard version begins in a push up position. # From the push up position, kick your right leg to the left side as if you were going to a 3-step position. # Pull your right leg back so that your legs make a v-shape. This should look like step 3 of a 6-step. # From that position straighten your left leg and sweep it around your right, when it passes in front of your body shift your weight from your right hand to your left hand. # Without stopping after step 3 lower your right hand and use your right leg to force your body upwards into the air, while you are in the air shift your weight onto your right hand while twisting your torso. Extend your right leg forward and you should land at 180 degrees of your previous position. Once you have these steps down you should combine steps two and three and do the moves simultaneously. Variants The 2-step is a move based on the 6-step. The 2-step can be down on the knuckles of the hand as well as the palm. Notes External links * 2-step demonstration on YouTube.

Portrayed as one of the protagonist's first friends, Takeshi Yamamoto is introduced as a 14-year-old starting pitcher for his school's baseball team. Apart from the manga and anime, Yamamoto has also appeared in other media from the Reborn! franchise including video games. Yamamoto's character has been well received by readers since his introduction, ranking as one of the most popular characters in every official Shonen Jump poll of the series. Publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on his character. Merchandise based on his appearance has also been released including key chains and action figures. Character outline =Personality= Rarely seen angry, Yamamoto has a warm and friendly personality and is a peacemaker that occurs between his comrades. He is popular among his classmates, especially girls, and loves to play baseball (in the manga) to the point of attempting suicide when he is unable to play. Because of baseball, Yamamoto focuses on protecting his energy and his body in baseball and battle. However, as the series progresses, he decides not to focus on protecting his body so he can protect his friends and family using all of his strength. He does not like to lose and is ridden with guilt and regret upon defeat. Yamamoto remains calm during life-or-death struggles. In addition, he is a fast learner and understands a situation better than anyone. This leads Reborn to claim he is a \\"born hitman\\". However, Yamamoto is oblivious to the fact that he and his friends are mafioso, believing that they are playing a mafia game and that Reborn's weapons are just toys made with advanced technology. He is also optimistic to the point of na√Øvet√®; although many of the opponents he meets during the series attempt to kill him, Yamamoto searches for a way to defeat them without mortal injury, such as using the back of his blade or not dealing a killing blow, and attempts to save his opponents as they are about to die. Even after accepting his role as Tsuna's Rain Guardian and the Vongola's swordsman, he continues to balance his life between baseball and swordsmanship, only devoting himself to swordsmanship when he needs to protect his friends. =Weapons and abilities= Due to his baseball training, Yamamoto possesses a strong body and the best reflexes and stamina of all the Vongola, giving him a natural advantage. He is ranked as the second strongest (after Hibari Kyoya) Namimori student by the young statistician, Futa. Reborn also said that among all the guardians, he has one of the highest chances of being a great hitman. Also characters like Hibari have been shown to have interest in Yamamoto's battles, and Squalo has also shown to have interest in his development to the point of willingly tutoring him. He is able to dodge bullets shot at close-range and from a far distance. Yamamoto originally uses a bat that he received from Reborn. When swung over, , the bat changes into a katana. After training under his father, Yamamoto receives , a shinai that changes into a katana while using the . His training in the series' alternate future allows him to create an affinity between the Shigure Kintoki and his Rain Flame, something his adult self could not accomplish, due to the irregular nature of the blade, a high concentration of Rain flames from the Vongola Ring were needed to create that affinity. Yamamoto then learns to fuse his swallow box weapon, called or the \\"Rondine di Pioggia\\" (Italian: Swallow of the Rain), with the Shigure Kintoki. This, along with the three short swords his Akita Inu Vongola box weapon carries on its back, creates the quadruple irregular blade . The three short swords can be used for aerial combat, ranged attacks, flying or propulsion. Kojir≈ç is also capable of creating heavy rainfall. Yamamoto utilizes the Shigure Soen Ryu (style) he learned from his father. Because the style will be passed on to only the worthy students, the forms are taught once and the student is expected to memorize. The students are then able to create a form in addition to those they learned, signifying the student's true worthiness to succeed the style. Because of the nature of the Shigure Soen Ryu, weaker branches deteriorate and other branches disappear because there is no worthy successor. This leads Yamamoto to believe the style is flawless and invincible. Yamamoto was taught eight forms: four defensive and four offensive. He then creates another three: two offensive, the first being used in his fight against Squalo. The technique he created is called \\"Duplicate Rain\\". The other, involves using his Kojir≈ç box weapon to create a strong current of rain flames and water, later called \\"Scontro di Rondine\\" (Clash of the Swallow in Italian), and one that combines all the forms. He also uses Squalo's attack \\"Attacco di Squalo\\" (Italian: Attack of the Shark), which causes a moment of paralysis after a strong sword swing. When combined with a Rain Flame's attribute of tranquility, the attack causes full body paralysis. He later gains the Vongola Gear Rain Necklace, which in its Cambio Form gives him two swords, utilising his both his box weapons to create a 12th Shigure Soen Ryu technique designed to counter illusions.Chapter 326-327 Appearances =In Reborn!= Adult Yamamoto as depicted in the future Shortly after his introduction, Yamamoto breaks his arm during baseball practice. Because he can no longer play baseball, he is driven to commit suicide. However, he is stopped by Tsuna. He is subsequently recruited into the Vongola Mafia family by Reborn, but he believes Reborn is playing a game. After Mukuro Rokudo and his subordinates begin attacking Namimori Middle School students, Yamamoto accompanies Tsuna to defeat Mukuro, but is defeated during a battle with Mukuro's stand-in Lancia. Later, Yamamoto is defeated by the Varia Superbi Squalo who tries to steal the Vongola Rings. Yamamoto is then named the holder of the Rain Ring, signifying his role as Tsuna's Rain Guardian, and thus battles Squalo again in the Vongola Tournament. To avoid another defeat, he trains under his father and learns the Shigure Soen Ryu. He becomes the official successor of the style after defeating Squalo with a new form of his own. After Tsuna and Hayato Gokudera are transported to the story's alternate future (nearly ten years later), they are taken to the Vongola's secret hideout by an adult Yamamoto. However, the adult Yamamoto is soon replaced by his younger self. After he is defeated by Gamma, a commander of the rival Millefiore Mafia family, and is saved by an adult Kyoya Hibari, Yamamoto undergoes training with Reborn, after which he creates two new Sigure Soen Ryu forms and learns the secrets of the Arcobaleno. After Yamamoto is defeated by Genkishi during the attack on a Millefiore base, an older Squalo returns from Italy to train Yamamoto and convince him to devote himself to swordsmanship. He is chosen to be one of the combatants in the Choice game, easily defeating a disguised Genkishi and failing to defeat the target in time to win the game. After the Vongola escape from the Millefiore, they are attacked shortly after, and Squalo fights one of the Six Funeral Wreaths in order to give the Vongola enough time to flee. Yamamoto leaves the group to help Squalo, and he later rejoins the Vongola to assist them in the fight against the Funeral Wreaths. After defeating Byakuran and returning to the past, the guardians are soon told of Tsuna's inheritance ceremony and are introduced to the Shimon family. Whilst initially getting along with Shimon member Kaoru Mizuno, he was grievously injured by Kaoru, who thought that Yamamoto had discovered the Shimon Family's secret. However, he is seemingly visited by Byakuran and mysteriously manages to recover just in time to assist Tsuna and the others fight against Daemon Spade on Shimon Island. =In other media= Besides his appearance in the original manga series and its anime adaptation, Yamamoto has appeared in other Reborn! works, including all of the series' video games. He also appears as a supportive character in two crossover video games which feature Tsuna and Reborn fighting against several characters from other manga, including Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars. On January 23, 2008, Pony Canyon released a character CD entitled , which features both Yamamoto and Gokudera. It contains duets and individual songs sung by both voice actors: Suguru Inoue and Hidekazu Ichinose. Reception Yamamoto has been popular with the Reborn! reader base, having ranked as the third most popular character in the first official Shonen Jump poll of the series, losing to Hayato and Tsuna, who took first and second respectively. He ranked as the sixth most popular hero in the second poll of the series, which was divided into heroes and villains. In the third poll of the series, Yamamoto ranked as the fifth most popular male character. Yamamoto then placed in both popularity polls the fourth time around, which was divided into current characters, where he placed eighth, and as characters who fans would most like to see in their future forms, where he placed twentieth. In a review of volume one, Yamamoto was viewed by manganews.com to be just as \\"crazy\\" as Reborn, Gokudera or Lambo. However, manga-sanctuary.com saw his rivalry with Gokudera and his belief that the mafia is a game as repetitious. Manganews.com also notes that the limited use of the Dying Will Bullet in the fifth volume allows the author to develop Yamamoto's character and that the introduction of antagonists in the eighth volume proves he is \\"worthy\\" to be a sh≈çnen manga character. The training of Tsuna's companions in the tenth volume is praised because Yamamoto is able to adopt a specific fighting style. In review of volume 12, he is noted to have \\"class and charisma\\" he did not have in previous volumes. However, he is still perceived to be na√Øve in the following volume. Despite this, Yamamoto's fight with Squalo was noted to be \\"monumental\\" by Emmanuel Bahu-Leyser of animeland.com.

Developed by Carlo Harpes in 1995, the attack is a generalization of linear cryptanalysis. Harpes originally replaced the bit sums (affine transformations) of linear cryptanalysis with more general balanced Boolean functions. He demonstrated a toy cipher that exhibits resistance against ordinary linear cryptanalysis but is susceptible to this sort of partitioning cryptanalysis. In its full generality, partitioning cryptanalysis works by dividing the sets of possible plaintexts and ciphertexts into efficiently-computable partitions such that the distribution of ciphertexts is significantly non-uniform when the plaintexts are chosen uniformly from a given block of the partition. Partitioning cryptanalysis has been shown to be more effective than linear cryptanalysis against variants of DES and CRYPTON.

Its aim was to explore properties of charm and bottom quarks. Its construction started in 1979, the detector was commissioned in 1982 and operated until 1992.ARGUS Fact Sheet, exposed in the detector hall at DESY The ARGUS detector was a hermetic detector with 90% coverage of the full solid angle. It had drift chambers, a time-of-flight system, an electromagnetic calorimeter and a muon chamber system. It is the first experiment that observed the mixing of the B mesons (in 1987). DESY preprint 87-029 The ARGUS distribution is named after the experiment.

This butterflyfish is one of the three species that make up the genus Chelmon and all have long beaks.  Description  These fish are easily identified by the yellow banding and long snout. The young fish are similar in appearance to adult fish. Butterflyfish grow up to 20 cm in length. The fish appears taller than its length because of its compressed, deep-bodied form with a long dorsal and posterior fins as well as its vertical yellow stripes on a white background. The snout is long and slender, and the dark eye of the fish is less conspicuous than the dark eye-spot on the dorsal fin. The base of the tail features a dark band that runs perpendicular to the tail. Butterflyfish may be distinguished from the similar C. marginalis by their color pattern and number of dorsal fin rays.  Habitat  Copperband butterflyfish are found at depths of 1‚àí25 metres either alone or in pairs. These fish form monogamous pairs during breeding. They are usually found on coral reefs or rocky shorelines, and also in estuaries and silty inner reefs. This species is territorial and oviparous.  In the aquarium  Copperband butterflyfish can grow to 8 inches (20 cm) but in a home aquarium are usually half that size. They do well at a normal reef temperature range of 75 to 84 ¬∞F (24 to 29 ¬∞C), with a tank size of at least 75 gallons and plenty of live rock to graze on. This species can be considered reef safe. It will eat many invertebrates, including parasitic forms such as tubeworms, Calliactis parasitica and common glass anemone (Aiptasia, parasitic anemone). Many aquarists introduce the Copperband Butterfly just to get rid of these pests without giving consideration to their long term needs for survival.Tristan Lougher (2006). What Fish?: A Buyer's Guide to Marine Fish. Interpet Publishing. . Given a choice, Aiptasia is the least favored food. The butterflyfish preys on all tube and substrate worms, clams, and mollusks. This is not a recommended fish for inexperienced aquarists, as it requires excellent tank conditions to thrive or even survive.

It was owned and managed by General Growth Properties (now Brookfield Office Properties). While its main entrance was off Red Run Boulevard between Painters Mill Road and Owings Mills Boulevard, the mall was also accessible from the exit ramps of I-795. It was originally known as Owings Mills Town Center. The mall was demolished and reopened in 2019 as Mill Station. The mall's final anchor store was JCPenney, which closed its doors on April 8, 2016. Previous anchors were Bambergers, Hecht's, Macy's, Boscov's, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Sears. IFL (International Furniture Liquidators) was temporarily located in the space vacated by Lord & Taylor. Sticks 'n Stuff, a furniture retailer, was temporarily located in the Sears building until it was demolished in 2004. The mall experienced the closures of several national stores, leaving many vacancies in this once upscale shopping mall. History The outside of Owings Mills Mall The mall was announced as early as 1981, with vague plans that compared it to the White Marsh Mall in size. By late 1983, a summer 1986 opening had been announced as well as the fact that the mall was to feature 3 department store anchors with plans for two more. Anchors Saks Fifth Avenue, Bambergers, and Hecht's were announced in 1984. The mall opened on July 28th, 1986 with the mall 95% leased and 80% of stores open. The area was identified as a primary growth center in 1979 by Baltimore County and originally intended to be built around a lake. The Rouse Company planned to develop the mall and surrounding area similar to its town center project in Columbia, Maryland. Environmental regulations changed during the time between the development of Columbia and Owings Mills and the Army Corps of Engineers concluded the lake would have a negative environmental impact. The mall was built, but the area does not include the waterfront focal point initially planned. = Baltimore Metro Subway station = The Owings Mills Metro Subway Station was opened by the Baltimore Metro Subway one year after Owings Mills Mall opened. Shuttle bus service with a 10 minute round trip was provided between the mall and the station. This shuttle bus service was discontinued in June 1992, leaving a less frequent bus service that provided this link only every 30 to 60 minutes. Alternatively, a one mile walk was possible between the mall and the Metro station which ran alongside an unused auxiliary parking lot of the mall, then down a hill through grass and vegetation on a winding asphalt pathway, before reaching one of the Metro parking lots. = Christina Brown murder = At 2:18 PM on September 25, 1992, Christina Marie Brown was found dead from a gunshot wound to the back of the head along the vegetation lined portion of the path between the mall and the Metro station. She was found ten minutes after leaving work as an employee of a cleaning company under contract to Saks Fifth Avenue at the mall, and was believed to have been traveling to the Metro station, en route to her home in Baltimore City. Brown was shot after she resisted a robbery attempt, and her purse, containing about $120, was taken. The pathway was closed on November 25, 1992, in response to Brown's murder. The murder received heavy local media attention, which led to a long-standing perception that Owings Mills Mall was unsafe. After the closure of the trail, a walk between the mall and metro became impractical for most, thereby requiring the use of regular bus service. In 1997, bus service between the two locations was improved. The ease of public transportation allowed visitors from inner city urban areas to get to and from this mall much more easily than other suburban malls in the Baltimore metropolitan area. The inside of Owings Mills Mall Decline and closure The mall was quite popular throughout the mid-late eighties and well into the '90s. Exclusive and upscale stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Williams Sonoma, and Benetton were tenants. As a result of the renovations at other local Baltimore area suburban malls Towson Town Center and The Mall in Columbia, crime committed in and around the mall, and the shift in the socio-economic climate of the community surrounding the mall, Owings Mills Mall had steadily lost business since that time. Saks Fifth Avenue closed in 1996, and was replaced with JCPenney.https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs- xpm-1995-11-03-1995307035-story.htmlhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/schuminweb/21411649303 Owings Mills Mall received growing competition as other local malls have expanded. Towson Town Center added Nordstrom in 1991 and that was the final blow to Owings Mills Mall upscale status. The Rouse Company purchased Towson Town Center in 1998. The Rouse Company and General Growth Properties have continued to promote Towson Town Center and The Mall in Columbia as premier malls, while leaving Owings Mills Mall stuck in the middle. An expansion in 1998 added Sears and Lord & Taylor, but Sears closed in 2001 and Lord & Taylor in 2002.https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs- xpm-2001-01-14-0101130399-story.htmlbs-xpm-2002-02-23-0202230250-story.html Hecht's was rebranded to Macy's in 2006, and Boscov's replaced the former Macy's. However, Boscov's announced in 2008 that this location would close as part of a plan to close 10 locations.https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2008/08/04/daily11.htmlhttps://fineartamerica.com/featured/4-former- bambergers-macys-boscovs-building-at-owings-mills-mall-ben-schumin.html This left JCPenney and Macy's as the remaining anchors. An October 2010 story on the mall in the Baltimore Sun stated that the mall was 22.6% vacant. WBAL-TV reported on November 10, 2011, that Owings Mills Mall would be demolished in 2013, with a new \\"outdoor style\\" mall similar to the revamped Hunt Valley Towne Centre to be completed by 2014. An October 2014 story in the Baltimore Business Journal stated that the mall was \\"about half vacant.\\" In late September 2015, the interior of the mall was closed, leaving only the Macy's and JCPenney and out-parcel restaurants and movie theater in operation. Macy's closed in November 2015, and JCPenney announced on January 13, 2016, that would close its Owings Mills location in the Spring. Fixtures from the mall were auctioned in March 2016. Demolition of the mall was proceeding in August 2016. Redevelopment as Mill Station As of February 2017, the mall was completely demolished, and readied for redevelopment. On December 5, 2017 it was announced that the property would be redeveloped as a lifestyle center called Mill Station. The $108 million project will be 575,000 square feet and anchored by Costco, Lowe's, and Dick's Sporting Goods. There will be at least 30 total tenants. Construction is set to begin in early 2018 and is expected to be completed in early 2019. The existing 17-screen AMC Theatres, originally a General Cinema opened in 1998, will be fully remodeled. Costco opened in October 2018, and Lowe's opened in January 2019, A.C. Moore closed in March of 2020 as part of bankruptcy. Peripheral properties Owings Mills Restaurant Park opened next to the mall in 1998; it is a collection of five sit-down restaurants such as Red Lobster and the Olive Garden. A mixed-use, transit- oriented development first called Owings Mills Metro Centre (now Metro Centre at Owings Mills), exists alongside Mill Station.

Early life and marriage Richard Crawshay was born in Normanton in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Initially starting work aged 16, working for Mr Bicklewith of York Yard, Thames Street, London (to whom he was apprenticed) in a bar iron warehouse in London, he became sole proprietor of the business on Bicklewith's retirement in 1763. He married Mary Bourne in 1763 and they had a son William and three daughters, Anne, Elizabeth and Charlotte. Charlotte married Benjamin Hall, and became the mother of Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover. Iron importation and ironworks proprietorship By the 1770s he was a leading London iron merchant, dealing mainly in Swedish and Russian iron.G. G. L. Hayes, 'Introduction' in C. Evans (ed.), The letterbook of Richard Crawshay, 1799-1797 (South Wales Record Society, 1990). The firm was Crawshay and Moser in 1774,Kent's Directory (1774). but Crawshay, Cornwell and Moser in 1784.Bailey's British Directory (1784). The business still existed as R & W Crawshay in 1816.Holden's Directory (1816-7). By 1775, he was acting as Anthony Bacon's agent for supplying iron cannon to the Board of Ordnance and was from 1777 a partner in that business (casting cannon at Cyfarthfa Ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil). This continued until Bacon had to give up government contracts in 1782,The National Archives, WO 47/84, 345; WO 47/89, 734; WO 47/100, 295; and passim (original pagination) because he was a member of Parliament. In 1786, following the death of Anthony Bacon, he took over the whole Cyfarthfa Ironworks, in partnership with William Stevens (a London merchant) and James Cockshutt, who had previously managed the forge and boring mill for David Tanner. In May 1787 he took out a licence from Henry Cort for his puddling process, but the rolling mill needed was not completed until 1789. He solved the problems of the puddling process by using an iron plate for the furnace ceiling and sea-washed sand for the floor. In 1791 he terminated the partnership, which had made little profit. He continued the business alone, and had two blast furnaces, 8 puddling furnaces, 3 melting fineries, 3 balling furnaces, and a rolling mill in 1794. A blast furnace was built by 1796, and a fourth in 1796.L. Ince, South Wales Iron Industry (1993), 60-62. There were 6 by 1810.P. Riden and J. G. Owen, British Blast Furnace Statistics (Merton Priory Press, 1995), 12. He thus developed Cyfarthfa into one of the most important ironworks in South Wales. Crawshay was very ambitious and imperious in manner, being called 'The Tyrant' by some, but was without social pretension. He was active in protecting the interests of the iron trade and was a major promoter of the Glamorganshire Canal which immensely improved transport of iron to Cardiff Docks.

Before the third Swedish crusade, the islands paid tax to Novgorod; after the crusade they became Swedish. In 1721 they became part of Russia, and in 1812 they were restored to the Grand Duchy of Finland with the province of Vyborg. In independent Finland they belonged to the parish then called Koivisto (Swedish: Bj√∂rk√∂). The main settlement on the islands was then called Saarenp√§√§ (Krasnoostrovskiy). After World War II, they were ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union. The whole historical Finnish population was expelled and replaced by a population of Soviet origin from September 1944 onwards. Place names were russified after 1947 concurrently with the rest of the formerly Finnish Karelian Isthmus occupied in 1944. The islands gave their name to the Treaty of Bj√∂rk√∂ (1905).

A ballonet is an air bag inside the outer envelope of an airship which, when inflated, reduces the volume available for the lifting gas, making it more dense. Because air is also denser than the lifting gas, inflating the ballonet reduces the overall lift, while deflating it increases lift. In this way, the ballonet can be used to adjust the lift as required. Ballonets may typically be used in non-rigid or semi-rigid airships, commonly with multiple ballonets located both fore and aft to maintain balance and to control the pitch of the airship. The image illustrates the principle of a balloon within a balloon. The outer balloon represents the airship's outer envelope or gasbag, while the red inner balloon represents the ballonet. In an airship the ballonet would be much smaller relative to the size of the gasbag; for example, in the French airship Lebaudy Patrie the volume of the ballonet was approximately one-fifth that of the envelope. History La France, the first successful airship The ballonet was first described in 1783 by Jean Baptiste Meusnier, then a lieutenant in the French Army. However his own airship project was unsuccessful. In 1784 professor Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers built an elongated, steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals. Their design incorporated Meusnier's internal ballonnet (air cell), a rudder, and oars for propulsion, which proved useless. On July 15 the brothers flew it for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon accompanied by M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres. The absence of a lifting gas release valve meant that the Duke had to slash the envelope to prevent it rupturing when they reached an altitude of about 4,500 metres (15,000 ft).Federal Aviation Administration - F.A.Aviation News, October 2001, Balloon Competitions and Events Around the Globe, Page 15Federation Aeronautique Internationale, Ballooning Commission, Hall of Fame, Robert Brothers. It was not until after Meusnier's death that the first successful application took flight. On 8 August 1884 the first practical airship, La France, flew for the first time.Walker, P.; Early Aviation at Farnborough, Vol. I: Balloons, Kites and Airships, Macdonald (1971), Page 176. Ballonet air valves were originally of a butterfly type, actuated by springs. If pressure rose in the ballonet, a spring would pressure the spindle of the butterfly valve to turn, relieving the pressure. In more recent implementations, the valves are actuated electrically either by a linear actuator (driven open/closed) or a linear solenoid (spring return), the latter being the favored fail-to-safe arrangement.

Games hosted by UC Davis are held at Aggie Stadium. Games hosted by Sacramento State are held at Hornet Stadium.

For a few decades starting in 1961, the winning team received the Causeway Carriage, an authentic 19th century carriage, as the trophy. Today, the Carriage is no longer exchanged between the two teams. The carriage was donated by Sac State alumnus Jeri Striezik in 1960 to serve as the perpetual trophy for the schools. It was refurbished at the prison in Folsom, California. It was transported to the winning campus at the losing school's expense.

JCE will also release other East Asian films, particularly Hong Kong films. Origins Chan began his film career starring in films for director and producer Lo Wei in 1976. Lo's films were released by the Lo Wei Motion Picture Company, a subsidiary of Golden Harvest. After limited success, Chan was loaned out to Seasonal Films in 1978 for a 2-picture deal. Working with director Yuen Woo- ping and producer Ng See-Yuen, Chan made had his first real successes in the industry, with Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master. Chan made a couple of further films for Lo Wei, but together they were unable to replicate the success of Chan's Seasonal Films releases.

It is tundra consisting mostly of very low-growing grasses, rushes, forbs, mosses, lichens, and liverworts. These plants either mostly or completely cover the surface of the ground. The soils are typically moist, fine-grained, and often hummocky.CAVM Team, 2003, Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map. Scale 1:7,500,000. Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Map No. 1. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Anchorage, Alaska. History Mesolithic humans occupied the island as early as 6000 BCE. Tools of stone, bone, antler, and ivory have been found, as well as wooden arrow shafts and a sledge runner. Animal remains suggest a culture dependent on the hunting of polar bears and reindeer. Evidence published in 2017 suggests that the early inhabitants of Zhokhov Island were among the first humans to selectively breed dogs. Findings indicate that larger dogs may have been bred for hunting and smaller dogs weighing to were bred for pulling sleds. DNA extracted from a 9,500-year-old dog, Zhokhov, named after the island, contributed significant genetic material to the Greenland Dog, the Alaskan Malamute and the Siberian Husky. In modern times, Zhokhov Island was discovered by the 1910‚Äì1915 Russian Arctic Ocean Hydrographic Expedition under Boris Vilkitsky on the ships Vaygach and Taymyr. It was originally named Novopashenniy Island, after Piotr Alekseyevich Novopashenniy (1881‚Äì1950) Captain of icebreaker Vaygach, but in 1926 it was renamed after Lieutenant Alexey Zhokhov, a member of the expedition.Starokadomski, L.

In his early twenties, Fox was performing in Boulder, Colorado, when he heard that his act had been stolen by a competing magician. He was inspired to begin swallowing swords in order to have \\"an act people couldn't copy easily\\". It took him eight months to master the technique, although he injured himself on several occasions learning it. Fox estimated in 1999 he was one of only twenty professional sword swallowers in the United States, noting there were many more than when he began. Fox could swallow up to 22 inches of steel. Besides swallowing regular swords, his act included swallowing a retractable tape measure, a giant screwdriver and a neon glowing sword plugged into an outlet. His act also included eating fire-until he learned that the chemicals used in the trick could seep into his liver. Fox appeared at such venues as comedy clubs, casinos, and tattoo conventions, as well as special events such as an Aerosmith album release party. His television appearances include the Late Show with David Letterman, a 1992 Jonathan Winters television special, and a Maalox commercial in which he swallowed light bulbs.\\"Open Up and Say AHHH!\\" CNN Live Today. 2002-09-03 He was featured in the 2003 documentary Traveling Sideshow: Shocked and Amazed by Jeff Krulik.

Evinrude's father had emigrated from Norway in 1882 and had developed the first commercially feasible outboard motor, thus creating a new industry and form of recreation. In 1927, Evinrude joined the family firm, Elto Outboard Motor Company after two years at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Ole Evinrude died on July 12, 1934 and Ralph Evinrude took over running the company. In 1936, Elto Outboard Motor Company merged with Waukegan, Illinois-based Johnson Motor Company to form Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC). In 1936, the Board of Directors of OMC elected Evinrude president and director. In 1953, he was elected vice-chairman of the board and chairman of OMC's Executive Committee. He became chairman of OMC in 1963. During his 55-year career in the family business, Evinrude collaborated with manufacturing giants such as Milwaukee based Briggs and Stratton, and expanded the company's product line to include boats, lawnmowers, snowmobiles, and chain saws, and expanded operations worldwide. In 1982 when Evinrude retired as chairman, OMC had more than 9,000 persons employed in operations throughout the world. Evinrude was married 3 times.

The boat was a \\"Nootkan\\" (Nuu-chah-nulth) canoe which was already old when she was obtained by captain John Voss in April 1901. The boat was built in the early 19th century as a dugout canoe made from a large red cedar log. Tilikum was purchased for $80 in silver from a native woman (Voss describes her as a \\"siwash\\") in a transference ceremony allegedly sealed by a bottle of rye whiskey - the name Tilikum means \\"friend\\" in Chinook jargon. Apparently, John Voss and his companion in this venture, Norman Luxton, were inspired by the voyage of Joshua Slocum, who sailed the sloop Spray around the world a few years earlier and wrote a best selling book about his adventures. The boat was refitted - reinforced, covered and rigged with sail, in total, and readied for her voyage. Tilikum was sailed out of Oak Bay harbour on May 20, 1901, captained by Voss and mated by Luxton. After 10,000 miles (about 16000 km) and five months on the Pacific Ocean, Tilikum struck a reef and Luxton was thrown from the boat. His whole body was badly cut by coral. The boat limped into harbour at Penrhyn Island in the Cook Islands on 2 September 1901, and Luxton left the trip entirely in Suva, Fiji on 17 October 1901. Tilikum was crewed by 10 more men between that time and when she finally pulled into harbour on the Thames in London, England in September, 1904. On 25 October 1901, after leaving Suva, the mate, Louis Begent, the binnacle, and the compass were lost in 'large breaking seas'. Voss was now alone without a compass, from Sydney. Tilikum arrived in Melbourne on 13 March 1902 and was exhibited in full rig in Collins Street. She was moved to another vantage point at the Exhibition Buildings, but during loading onto a 'wagon', the hook broke and she was damaged, with splits appearing in five different places. Voss repaired her himself using thin steel ribs. She was then sailed on Lake Wendouree, Ballarat, and presented with a new set of sails by local yachtsmen, before travelling to Geelong to be returned to the sea. Voss was nominated as a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London after lecturing in Britain about the voyage, but he never completed the process to officially become a fellow. Captain John Voss published his sailing memoir as The Venturesome Voyages of Captain Voss in 1913. Many years after the voyage, Norman Luxton wrote his own version of the journey with Voss in his Tilikum Journal. This manuscript was edited by his daughter Eleanor and was published after Luxton's death as Tilikum: Luxton's Pacific Crossing in 1971. Tilikum changed hands a number of times in London, losing her bowsprit and masts over time. In 1929, the Furness Shipping Line returned Tillikum to Victoria, British Columbia. She underwent restoration beginning in 1936 by the Thermopylae Club before she was moved into the Maritime Museum in 1965, where she remained until 2015. The Tilikum is currently on display at the Ogden Point cruise ship terminal in Victoria, B.C.

The highway runs from Liberty Road near Randallstown north to Bond Avenue near Glyndon. Maryland Route 940 (MD 940) is the designation for the state highway portion of Owings Mills Boulevard between Red Run Boulevard and MD 140 that is centered on Owings Mills Boulevard's interchange with Interstate 795 (I-795) in Owings Mills in western Baltimore County. Owings Mills Boulevard was first constructed in the mid- to late 1980s. The highway was extended both north and south in the early 1990s and in the early 2000s. Owings Mills Boulevard was extended south in two sections, with the latter section completed to MD 26 in 2016. Route description Owings Mills Boulevard begins at MD 26 (Liberty Road) in Randallstown. The highway heads north as a four-lane divided highway through intersections with Wynands Road and Lyons Mill Road to Lakeside Boulevard. There, Owings Mills Boulevard expands to six lanes and crosses over Red Run on its way to Red Run Boulevard. Red Run Boulevard leads to the former Owings Mills Mall and to Painters Mill Road, which provides access to the Owings Mills station of MTA Maryland's Baltimore Metro SubwayLink. At Red Run Boulevard, Owings Mills Boulevard becomes state-maintained as MD 940 and reduces to two through lanes in each direction. Sign for MD 940 on the road connecting MD 940 to MD 140 Owings Mills Boulevard meets I-795 (Northwest Expressway) at a full interchange that includes fly-over ramps from northbound I-795 to southbound Owings Mills Boulevard and from southbound Owings Mills Boulevard to southbound I-795. The interchange also includes direct ramps from I-795 in the direction of Baltimore for Owings Mills Mall and direct ramps from I-795 in the direction of Reisterstown to the Baltimore Metro Subway station. The first intersection north of I-795 is for Dolfield Road. There is no direct access from the ramp from northbound I-795 to northbound Owings Mills Boulevard to westbound Dolfield Road; that movement requires a U-turn at the following intersection. Owings Mills Boulevard continues onto a bridge over Gwynns Falls and an industrial area paralleling CSX's Hanover Subdivision. At the north end of the bridge, MD 940 reaches its northern terminus at a two-way, four-lane ramp from Owings Mills Boulevard to MD 140 (Reisterstown Road). Owings Mills Boulevard continues north as a county highway, crossing over MD 140. Owings Mills Boulevard crosses Gwynns Falls a second time, reduces to a five-lane highway with center turn lane, and passes a shopping center. The highway crosses the creek a third time and then begins to parallel both the creek and the railroad line. Owings Mills Boulevard passes the Owings Mills campus of Stevenson University and intersects Gwynnbrook Avenue and Bonita Avenue before reaching its northern terminus at Bond Avenue. The roadway continues north as two-lane Central Avenue toward MD 128 in Glyndon. The MD 940 part of Owings Mills Boulevard is a component of a loop of the National Highway System that is an intermodal passenger transport connection between I-795 and the Baltimore Metro Subway station. The loop also includes MD 140 from Owings Mills Boulevard to Painters Mill Road, Painters Mill Road south to Red Run Boulevard, and Red Run Boulevard west to Owings Mills Boulevard. History Owings Mills Boulevard at the I-795 interchange in Owings Mills Owings Mills Boulevard was under construction from Red Run Boulevard to MD 140 by 1985 and completed in 1987; the highway was built contemporaneously with I-795. The completed portion of the boulevard officially became a state highway by 1989. Owings Mills Boulevard was extended as a county highway in both directions in 1991. On the northern end, the highway crossed over MD 140 and took over the course of Bonita Avenue to where Bonita veers away from the railroad. The southern end of the highway was moved to Lakeside Boulevard. Owings Mills Boulevard was extended south to Lyons Mill Road in 2002 and north from Bonita Avenue to Bond Avenue in 2003. Construction on Owings Mills Boulevard's extension south to Winands Road as a four-lane divided highway began in 2010. The portion of the highway between Lyons Mill Road and Winands Road opened August 6, 2012. Construction on the next phase of the highway to MD 26 in Randallstown began in 2013, and the extension opened June 16. 2016. Owings Mills Boulevard was temporarily co-named Ravens Boulevard in the weeks surrounding Super Bowl XXXV in 2001 to honor the Baltimore Ravens, whose training complex was located at the site of what is now the Owings Mills campus of Stevenson University near Gwynnbrook Avenue. The Ravens moved to their current team facility near Randallstown in 2004.

Her writings for stage and television also attracted attention in the 1950s. Early life, education and early career Arden was born Norah Patricia Morris at 47 Twmpath Road, Pontypool, Monmouthshire.Jane Arden at babylonwales.blogspot.com. She studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, England, and began her career in the late 1940s on television and in the cinema. She appeared in a television production of Romeo and Juliet in the late 1940s, and then starred in two British crime films: Black Memory (1947) directed by Oswald Mitchell ‚Äì which provided South African-born actor Sid James with his first screen credit (billed as Sydney James) ‚Äì and Richard M. Grey's A Gunman Has Escaped (1948). There are copies of both films in the BFI National Archive, but that of A Gunman Has Escaped is incomplete. Writing and theatre In the 1950s Arden married the director Philip Saville, and after a short spell in New York, where she began writing, the couple settled in Hampstead and had two sons. Arden then wrote several plays and television scripts, some of which her husband directed. Her stage play Conscience and Desire, and Dear Liz (1954) attracted interest, and her comedy television drama Curtains For Harry (1955), starring Bobby Howes and Sydney Tafler, was transmitted on 20 October 1955 by the newly established ITV network. The latter featured the Carry On actress Joan Sims. Arden's co-writer on this piece was the American Richard Lester, who was then working as a television director. Arden worked with some leading figures of British theatre and cinema in the late 1950s. In 1958, her play The Party, an intense family drama set in Kilburn, was directed at London's New Theatre by Charles Laughton. It turned out to be Laughton's last appearance on the London stage, while providing Albert Finney with his first. Her television drama The Thug (1959) provided a powerful early role for the actor Alan Bates. In 1964, Arden appeared with Harold Pinter in In Camera, a television production of Jean-Paul Sartre's Huis Clos, directed by Saville. Feminism, film and radical theatre Arden's work became increasingly radical following her growing interest and involvement in feminism and the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s. This is particularly evident from 1965 onwards, starting with the television drama The Logic Game, which she wrote and starred in. The Logic Game, directed by Saville, also starred the British actor David de Keyser, who worked alongside Arden again in the film Separation (1967). Arden, again, wrote the screenplay and the film was directed by her creative partner Jack Bond (born 1937). Separation, which was photographed in atmospheric black and white by Aubrey Dewar, also featured music by the chart- topping British group Procol Harum. Arden and Bond had previously worked on the documentary film Dal√≠ in New York (1966), which mainly consists of the surrealist artist Salvador Dal√≠ and Arden walking the streets of New York City discussing Dal√≠'s work. This film was resurrected and shown at the 2007 Tate Gallery Dal√≠ exhibition. Arden's television work in the mid-1960s included appearances in Saville's Exit 19, Jack's Russell's The Interior Decorator, and the satirical programme That Was the Week That Was, hosted by David Frost. Arden's work in experimental theatre in the late 1960s and the 1970s coincided with her return to cinema as an actor, writer and director (or co-director). The play Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven (1969), starring Victor Spinetti, and Sheila Allen, played to full houses for six weeks at London's Arts Lab. It was described by Arthur Marwick in his book The Sixties as \\"perhaps the most important single production\\" at the venue during that period. Also around this time Arden wrote the drama The Illusionist. In 1970, Arden formed the radical feminist theatre group Holocaust and then wrote the play A New Communion for Freaks, Prophets and Witches. The play would later be adapted for the screen as The Other Side of the Underneath (1972). Arden directed the film and appeared in it uncredited; screenings at film festivals, including the 1972 London Film Festival, caused a considerable stir. The film depicts a woman's mental breakdown and rebirth in scenes at times violent and highly shocking; the writer and critic George Melly described it as \\"a most illuminating season in Hell\\",Vertigo Magazine: Unknown pleasures: By Sean Kaye-Smith. Retrieved August 2007. while the BBC Radio journalist David Will declared the film to be \\"a major breakthrough for the British cinema\\". Throughout her life, Arden's interest in other cultures and belief systems increasingly took the form of a personal spiritual quest. Following The Other Side of the Underneath, there were two further collaborations with Jack Bond in the 1970s: Vibration (1974), described by Geoff Brown and Robert Murphy in their book Film Directors in Britain and Ireland (British Film Institute 2006) as \\"an exercise in meditation utilising experimental film and video techniques\\",Horizon Information Portal: Summary. and the futuristic Anti-Clock (1979), which featured Arden's songs on the soundtrack and starred her son Sebastian Saville. The latter opened the 1979 London Film Festival. In 1978, Arden published the book You Don't Know What You Want, Do You?, and supported its publication with public readings and discussions, such as that at the King's Head Theatre in London on 1 October 1978. Although loosely defined as poetry, the book is also a radical social and psychological manifesto which has been compared with R. D. Laing's Knots. By this time, Arden had moved on from feminism to a view that all people needed to be set free from the tyranny of rationality. Personal life She had two sons with Philip Saville: Sebastian and Dominic. =Death and legacy= Arden took her own life at Hindlethwaite Hall in Coverdale, Yorkshire, on 20 December 1982. In July 2008, Arden was one of the topics discussed in the Conference of 1970s British Culture and Society held at the University of Portsmouth. In 2009, the British Film Institute restored the three major feature films Arden made with her creative associate Jack Bond: Separation (1967), The Other Side of the Underneath (1972) and Anti-Clock (1979). The films became available on DVD and Blu-ray in July 2009. Bond was involved in the restoration and reissue processes, and the release of the films was accompanied by exhibition of the restored features at the National Film Theatre and The Cube Microplex in Bristol. Her books ‚Äì poetry and plays ‚Äì remain out of print. As a tribute to Arden, the experimental-music group Hwyl Nofio, fronted by Steve Parry from Pontypool, included the song \\"Anti-Clock\\" on their album Dark (2012).

They were introduced to address the deficiencies of derived categories (such as the non-functoriality of the cone contruction) and provide at the same time a language for homotopical algebra. Derivators were first introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in his long unpublished 1983 manuscript Pursuing Stacks. They were then further developed by him in the huge unpublished 1991 manuscript Les D√©rivateurs of almost 2000 pages. The manuscript has been edited for on-line publication by Georges Maltsiniotis. The theory has been further developed by several other people, including Heller, Franke, Keller and Groth.  Motivations  One of the motivating reasons for considering derivators is the lack of functoriality with the cone construction with triangulated categories. Derivators are able to solve this problem, and solve the inclusion of general homotopy colimits, by keeping track of all possible diagrams in a category with weak equivalences and their relations between each other. Heuristcally, given the diagram > \\\\bullet \\\\to \\\\bullet which is a category with two objects and one non-identity arrow and a functor > F:(\\\\bullet \\\\to \\\\bullet) \\\\to A to a category A with a class of weak-equivalences W, and satisfying the right hypotheses, should have an associated functor > C(F): \\\\bullet \\\\to A[W^{-1}] where the target object is unique up to weak equivalence in \\\\mathcal{C}[W^{-1}]. Derivators are able to encode this kind of information and provide a diagram calculus to use in derived categories and homotopy theory.  Definition  = Prederivators = Formally, a prederivator \\\\mathbb{D} is a 2-functor > \\\\mathbb{D}: \\\\text{Ind}^{op} \\\\to \\\\text{CAT} from a suitable 2-category of indices to the category of categories. Typically such 2-functors come from considering the categories \\\\underline{\\\\text{Hom}}(I^{op}, A) where A is called the category of coefficients. For example, \\\\text{Ind} could be the category of small categories which are filtered, whose objects can be thought of as the indexing sets for a filtered colimit. Then, given a morphism of diagrams > f:I \\\\to J denote f^* by > f^*:\\\\mathbb{D}(J) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{D}(I) This is called the inverse image functor. In the motivating example, this is just precompositition, so given a functor F_I \\\\in \\\\underline{\\\\text{Hom}}(I^{op}, A) there is an associated functor F_J = F_I \\\\circ f. Note these 2-functors could be taken to be > \\\\underline{\\\\text{Hom}}(-,A[W^{-1}]) where W is a suitable class of weak equivalences in a category A.  Indexing categories  There are a number of examples of indexing categories used in this construction * The 2-category \\\\text{FinCat} of finite categories, so the objects are categories whose collection of objects are finite sets. * The ordinal category \\\\Delta can be categorified into a two category, where the objects are categories with one object, and the functors come form the arrows in the ordinal category. * Another option is to just use the category of small categories. * In addition, associated to any topological space X is a category \\\\text{Open}(X) which could be used as the indexing category. * This can be generalized to any topos T, so the indexing category is the underlying site. = Derivators = Derivators are then the axiomatization of prederivators which come equipped with adjoint functors > \\\\begin{matrix} f^? & f_! & f^*& f_*& f^! \\\\end{matrix} where f_! is left adjoint to f^* and so on. Heuristically, f_* should correspond to inverse limits, f_! to colimits. References * Les D√©rivateurs: Texte d'Alexandre Grothendieck. √âdit√© par M. K√ºnzer, J. Malgoire, G.

He was born in Ballyforan, County Roscommon in 1920. His father, Thomas Francis McQuillan worked as a part of Royal Irish Constabulary, and became a school teacher, while his mother Annie (nee Fallon) was a national school teacher who came from a Republican family. McQuillan was educated at Roscommon CBS, Summerhill College, Sligo, and St Clement's Redemptorist college, Limerick.John (Jack) McQuillan by Lawrence William White, Cambridge Dictionary of Irish Biography/RIA. He was a member of the Roscommon Gaelic football team that won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 1943 and 1944. He began a career as an officer in the Irish Army though resigned to work as a local government official. He was elected to D√°il √âireann on his first attempt as a Clann na Poblachta Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Roscommon constituency at the 1948 general election. After fellow Clann na Poblachta TD, No√´l Browne resigned as Minister for Health, McQuillan resigned from Clann na Poblachta in support of Browne and sat as an independent TD. He was re-elected at the 1951, 1954 and 1957 general elections as an independent TD. On 16 May 1958, the National Progressive Democrats party was founded with No√´l Browne and McQuillan as the party's leaders. Between 1958 and 1961, 7 of the 9 motions discussed in Private Member's Time had been proposed by one of them. In 1961 and 1962 they asked 1,400 parliamentary questions, 17% of the total. The Taoiseach Se√°n Lemass paid them a unique compliment by referring to them as \\"the real opposition\\". Both were re-elected at the 1961 general election. In October 1963 both men joined the Labour Party. This new arrangement did not prove electorally beneficial to McQuillan as he lost his seat in Roscommon at the 1965 general election. However, he was elected to Seanad √âireann by the Administrative Panel. He resigned the Labour Party whip in 1967 and did not seek re-election at the 1969 general election, and retired from his Roscommon County Council seat in 1974. When the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1977, McQuillan joined as a trustee of the new party but later resigned. Remaining close to No√´l Browne he lobbied hard for him to get the Labour Party nomination to contest the 1990 presidential election for the Labour Party. However, Mary Robinson was the preferred candidate of Dick Spring.

In other words, it is about identifying and describing the subject of documents. Indexes are constructed, separately, on three distinct levels: terms in a document such as a book; objects in a collection such as a library; and documents (such as books and articles) within a field of knowledge. Subject indexing is used in information retrieval especially to create bibliographic indexes to retrieve documents on a particular subject. Examples of academic indexing services are Zentralblatt MATH, Chemical Abstracts and PubMed. The index terms were mostly assigned by experts but author keywords are also common. The process of indexing begins with any analysis of the subject of the document. The indexer must then identify terms which appropriately identify the subject either by extracting words directly from the document or assigning words from a controlled vocabulary.F. W. Lancaster (2003): \\"Indexing and abstracting in theory and practise\\". Third edition. London, Facet . page 6 The terms in the index are then presented in a systematic order. Indexers must decide how many terms to include and how specific the terms should be. Together this gives a depth of indexing.  Subject analysis  The first step in indexing is to decide on the subject matter of the document. In manual indexing, the indexer would consider the subject matter in terms of answer to a set of questions such as \\"Does the document deal with a specific product, condition or phenomenon?\\".G.G. Chowdhury (2004): \\"Introduction to modern information retrieval\\". Third Edition. London, Facet. . page 71 As the analysis is influenced by the knowledge and experience of the indexer, it follows that two indexers may analyze the content differently and so come up with different index terms. This will impact on the success of retrieval. = Automatic vs. manual subject analysis = Automatic indexing follows set processes of analyzing frequencies of word patterns and comparing results to other documents in order to assign to subject categories. This requires no understanding of the material being indexed. This therefore leads to more uniform indexing but this is at the expense of the true meaning being interpreted. A computer program will not understand the meaning of statements and may therefore fail to assign some relevant terms or assign incorrectly. Human indexers focus their attention on certain parts of the document such as the title, abstract, summary and conclusions, as analyzing the full text in depth is costly and time-consuming F. W. Lancaster (2003): \\"Indexing and abstracting in theory and practice\\". Third edition. London, Facet . page 24 An automated system takes away the time limit and allows the entire document to be analyzed, but also has the option to be directed to particular parts of the document.  Term selection  The second stage of indexing involves the translation of the subject analysis into a set of index terms. This can involve extracting from the document or assigning from a controlled vocabulary. With the ability to conduct a full text search widely available, many people have come to rely on their own expertise in conducting information searches and full text search has become very popular. Subject indexing and its experts, professional indexers, catalogers, and librarians, remains crucial to information organization and retrieval. These experts understand controlled vocabularies and are able to find information that cannot be located by full text search. The cost of expert analysis to create subject indexing is not easily compared to the cost of hardware, software and labor to manufacture a comparable set of full-text, fully searchable materials. With new web applications that allow every user to annotate documents, social tagging has gained popularity especially in the Web. One application of indexing, the book index, remains relatively unchanged despite the information revolution. = Extraction/Derived indexing = Extraction indexing involves taking words directly from the document. It uses natural language and lends itself well to automated techniques where word frequencies are calculated and those with a frequency over a pre-determined threshold are used as index terms. A stop-list containing common words (such as \\"the\\", \\"and\\") would be referred to and such stop words would be excluded as index terms. Automated extraction indexing may lead to loss of meaning of terms by indexing single words as opposed to phrases. Although it is possible to extract commonly occurring phrases, it becomes more difficult if key concepts are inconsistently worded in phrases. Automated extraction indexing also has the problem that, even with use of a stop-list to remove common words, some frequent words may not be useful for allowing discrimination between documents. For example, the term glucose is likely to occur frequently in any document related to diabetes. Therefore, use of this term would likely return most or all the documents in the database. Post-co-ordinated indexing where terms are combined at the time of searching would reduce this effect but the onus would be on the searcher to link appropriate terms as opposed to the information professional. In addition terms that occur infrequently may be highly significant for example a new drug may be mentioned infrequently but the novelty of the subject makes any reference significant. One method for allowing rarer terms to be included and common words to be excluded by automated techniques would be a relative frequency approach where frequency of a word in a document is compared to frequency in the database as a whole. Therefore, a term that occurs more often in a document than might be expected based on the rest of the database could then be used as an index term, and terms that occur equally frequently throughout will be excluded. Another problem with automated extraction is that it does not recognise when a concept is discussed but is not identified in the text by an indexable keyword.J. Lamb (2008): Human or computer produced indexes? [online] Sheffield, Society of Indexers. Accessed 15 January 2009. = Assignment indexing = An alternative is assignment indexing where index terms are taken from a controlled vocabulary. This has the advantage of controlling for synonyms as the preferred term is indexed and synonyms or related terms direct the user to the preferred term. This means the user can find articles regardless of the specific term used by the author and saves the user from having to know and check all possible synonyms.C. Tenopir (1999): \\"Human or automated, indexing is important\\". Library Journal 124(18) pages 34-38. It also removes any confusion caused by homographs by inclusion of a qualifying term. A third advantage is that it allows the linking of related terms whether they are linked by hierarchy or association, e.g. an index entry for an oral medication may list other oral medications as related terms on the same level of the hierarchy but would also link to broader terms such as treatment. Assignment indexing is used in manual indexing to improve inter-indexer consistency as different indexers will have a controlled set of terms to choose from. Controlled vocabularies do not completely remove inconsistencies as two indexers may still interpret the subject differently.  Index presentation  The final phase of indexing is to present the entries in a systematic order. This may involve linking entries. In a pre-coordinated index the indexer determines the order in which terms are linked in an entry by considering how a user may formulate their search. In a post-coordinated index, the entries are presented singly and the user can link the entries through searches, most commonly carried out by computer software. Post-coordination results in a loss of precision in comparison to pre-coordination D. Bodoff and A. Kambil, (1998): \\"Partial coordination. I. The best of pre-coordination and post- coordination.\\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 49(14), 1254-1269.  Depth of indexing  Indexers must make decisions about what entries should be included and how many entries an index should incorporate. The depth of indexing describes the thoroughness of the indexing process with reference to exhaustivity and specificity D.B. Cleveland and A.D. Cleveland (2001): \\"Introduction to indexing and abstracting\\". 3rd Ed. Englewood, libraries Unlimited, Inc. . page 105 = Exhaustivity = An exhaustive index is one which lists all possible index terms. Greater exhaustivity gives a higher recall, or more likelihood of all the relevant articles being retrieved, however, this occurs at the expense of precision. This means that the user may retrieve a larger number of irrelevant documents or documents which only deal with the subject in little depth. In a manual system a greater level of exhaustivity brings with it a greater cost as more man-hours are required. The additional time taken in an automated system would be much less significant. At the other end of the scale, in a selective index only the most important aspects are covered.B.H. Weinberg (1990): \\"Exhaustivity of indexes: Books, journals, and electronic full texts; Summary of a workshop presented at the 1999 ASI Annual Conference\\". Key Words, 7(5), pages 1+. Recall is reduced in a selective index as if an indexer does not include enough terms, a highly relevant article may be overlooked. Therefore, indexers should strive for a balance and consider what the document may be used. They may also have to consider the implications of time and expense. = Specificity = The specificity describes how closely the index terms match the topics they represent J.D. Anderson (1997): Guidelines for indexes and related information retrieval devices [online]. Bethesda, Maryland, Niso Press. 10 December 2008. An index is said to be specific if the indexer uses parallel descriptors to the concept of the document and reflects the concepts precisely.D.B. Cleveland and A.D. Cleveland (2001): \\"Introduction to indexing and abstracting\\". 3rd Ed. Englewood, libraries Unlimited, Inc. . page 106 Specificity tends to increase with exhaustivity as the more terms you include, the narrower those terms will be. Indexing theory Hj√∏rland (2011)Hj√∏rland, Birger (2011). The Importance of Theories of Knowledge: Indexing and Information retrieval as an example. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62(1,), 72-77. found that theories of indexing are at the deepest level connected to different theories of knowledge: * Rationalist theories of indexing (such as Ranganathan's theory) suggest that subjects are constructed logically from a fundamental set of categories. The basic method of subject analysis is then \\"analytic-synthetic\\", to isolate a set of basic categories (=analysis) and then to construct the subject of any given document by combining those categories according to some rules (=synthesis). * Empiricist theories of indexing are based on selecting similar documents based on their properties, in particular by applying numerical statistical techniques. * Historicist and hermeneutical theories of indexing suggest that the subject of a given document is relative to a given discourse or domain, why the indexing should reflect the need of a particular discourse or domain. According to hermeneutics is a document always written and interpreted from particular horizon. The same is the case with systems of knowledge organization and with all users searching such systems. Any question put to such a system is put from a particular horizon. All those horizons may be more or less in consensus or in conflict. To index a document is to try to contribute to the retrieval of ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù documents by knowing about those different horizons. * Pragmatic and critical theories of indexing (such as Hj√∏rland, 1997)Hj√∏rland, B. (1997). Information Seeking and Subject Representation. An Activity-theoretical approach to Information Science. Westport & London: Greenwood Press. is in agreement with the historicist point of view that subjects are relative to specific discourses but emphasizes that subject analysis should support given goals and values and should consider the consequences of indexing one way or another. These theories believe that indexing cannot be neutral and that it is a wrong goal to try to index in a neutral way. Indexing is an act (and computer based indexing is acting according to the programmers intentions). Acts serve human goals. Libraries and information services also serve human goals, why their indexing should be done in a way that supports these goals as much as possible. At a first glance this looks strange because the goals of libraries and information services is to identify any document or piece of information. Nonetheless is any specific way of indexing always supporting some kind of uses at the expense of other. The documents to be indexed intend to serve some specific purposes in a community. Basically the indexing should intend serving the same purposes. Primary and secondary documents and information services are parts of the same overall social system. In such a system different theories, epistemologies, worldviews etc. may be at play and users need to be able to orient themselves and to navigate among those different views. This calls for a mapping of the different epistemologies in the field and classification of the single document into such a map. Excellent examples of such different paradigms and their consequences for indexing and classification systems are provided in the domain of art by √òrom (2003)√òrom, Anders (2003).

After turning professional in 1936, the club appointed Mick O'Brien as their manager who led them to immediate success in winning the Southern League. His sudden departure left the club managerless for 11 matches until Scott Duncan was placed in charge, remaining with the club for almost 18 years. Duncan retired in 1955 and was replaced by Alf Ramsey who led Ipswich to further success in the league. This included back-to-back league championships, winning the Second Division in the 1960‚Äì61 season followed by taking the First Division title in 1961‚Äì62 season. Ramsey was appointed England manager in 1963 and went on to win the 1966 World Cup. Managerial turnover at Ipswich was low with only six full-time appointments in 46 years, but after Bobby Robson left the club in 1982 to manage England, the club employed six full-time managers in the following 25 years. David Sheepshanks became chairman of the club in 1995 taking over a club recently relegated from the Premier League and in financial difficulty. Under George Burley, the club failed in three play-offs before finally winning promotion back to the top flight in 2000 after a 4-2 win over Barnsley at Wembley Stadium. Relegation followed two seasons later after a brief spell in Europe and Burley was replaced by Joe Royle. After nearly four seasons, Royle left the club and in June 2006, Sheepshanks appointed former Ipswich player Jim Magilton as the manager of the team. Magilton was sacked nearly three years later after failing to lead the club to either play-offs or promotion. He was succeeded by Roy Keane, who had managed Sunderland to the Championship title two years previously, who became only the club's 13th full-time manager during their 74-year professional status. He was sacked on 7 January 2011 and was replaced by Ian McParland in a caretaker capacity before Paul Jewell took over as manager on 13 January 2011. Jewell left the club by mutual consent in October 2012, with Ipswich bottom of the Championship, and leaving Chris Hutchings in a caretaker role. After a single match, Hutchings was replaced by Mick McCarthy on a full-time basis. On 29 March 2018, the club announced that Mick McCarthy's contract, which was due to expire at the end of the 2017-18 season, would not be extended. McCarthy announced that he was quitting during the post-match press conference following a 1-0 victory over Barnsley on 10 April 2018. He was replaced until the end of the season by Bryan Klug as a caretaker manager. On 30 May 2018, Paul Hurst was announced as manager; he and his assistant at Shrewsbury Town, Chris Doig, signed three-year contracts. Less than five months later, on 25 October 2018, Paul Hurst was sacked, with Ipswich having won one match from fourteen league games. Former Norwich City manager Paul Lambert was appointed two days later. Ipswich's relegation to the third tier of English football was confirmed on 13 April 2019, the first time since 1957.

The community is under administration of the small city of Barth. Saal has first been documented in a deed of the city of Barth in the year of 1255. At this time there was an already abandoned Slavic castle by the mouth of the Saal creek into the Saal ‚Äúbodden‚Äù. The population around 1255 consisted of indigenous Slav, migrants from Westphalia and Denmark. The first church already existed and was completely made of wood and sanctified to the ‚ÄúHoly Cross‚Äù. From today's village Tempel, at the time a commandery, knights templar arrived at Saal. The order of knights was in search to expanding Northeast, and had to take provisions securing its continuity as the Holy Land was lost. The order induced the erection of the church, which until this date dominates impressively the scenery and gives a different impression of Gothic architecture. Everything at this church is characterized by ‚Äòshiftings‚Äô: windows, portals. The frayed walls are evidence of both planned or symbolic annexes and continued constructions. The entry to the underground walkway, behind the altar, can still be seen. It is said to end somewhere by the ‚Äúbodden‚Äù. Underneath the bell tower (1731) standing aside from the actual church, is a hollow space, which however, had never been explored. According to the legend a part of the templar treasure was brought here around 1300. One of the templar stole a part of the treasure and hid it in one of the column foundations. It was said to be the vanished imperial regalia of John Lackland, which he lost in unclear circumstances in 1216. Legend: Until 1309 the templar rebuilt the castle at the ‚Äûbodden‚Äú and used it as a port facility. Today, only the castle ramparts testify of the once great times. The Vitalian Brotherhood under Stoertebeker (.../succession order of the templar in Portugal) had used the castle until 1391 and are said to have brought the treasure under the bell tower to this place. After they were involved in a fight with the Danes on the Ribnitz Sea, they had to flee and never returned to Saal. The treasure is said to be still somewhere there. Today the templar in Saal are forgotten; only Stoertebeker is sometimes spoken about. Suggestion: Who ever comes to Saal, should not miss visiting an ancient stone circle, the apostle stones.
