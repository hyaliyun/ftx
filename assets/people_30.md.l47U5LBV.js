When the First Fleet arrived in January 1788, King was detailed to colonise Norfolk Island for defence and foraging purposes. As Governor of New South Wales, he helped develop livestock farming, whaling and mining, built many schools and launched the colony's first newspaper. But conflicts with the military wore down his spirit, and they were able to force his resignation. Early years and establishment of Norfolk Island settlement Philip Gidley King was born at Launceston, England on 23 April 1758, the son of draper Philip King, and grandson of Exeter attorney-at-law John Gidley.Phillip 1970, p. 50 He joined the Royal Navy at the age of 12 as captain's servant, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1778. King served under Arthur Phillip who chose him as second lieutenant on HMS Sirius for the expedition to establish a convict settlement in New South Wales. On arrival, in January 1788, King was selected to lead a small party of convicts and guards to set up a settlement at Norfolk Island, leaving Sydney on 14 February 1788 on board HMS Sirius. On 6 March 1788, King and his party landed with difficulty, owing to the lack of a suitable harbour, and set about building huts, clearing the land, planting crops, and resisting the ravages of grubs, salt air and hurricanes. More convicts were sent, and these proved occasionally troublesome. Early in 1789 he prevented a mutiny when some of the convicts planned to take him and other officers prisoner, and escape on the next boat to arrive. Whilst commandant on Norfolk Island, King formed a relationship with the female convict Ann Inett ‚Äì their first son, born on 8 January 1789, was named Norfolk. (He went on to become the first Australian- born officer in the Royal Navy and the captain of the schooner Ballahoo.) Another son was born in 1790 and named Sydney. Following the wreck of Sirius at Norfolk Island in March 1790, King left and returned to England to report on the difficulties of the settlements at New South Wales. Ann Inett was left in Sydney with the boys; she later married another man in 1792, and went on to lead a comfortable and respected life in the colony. King, who had probably arranged the marriage, also arranged for their two sons to be educated in England, where they became officers in the navy. Whilst in England King married Anna Josepha Coombe (his first cousin) on 11 March 1791 and returned shortly after on HMS Gorgon to take up his post as Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island, at an annual salary of ¬£250. King's first legitimate offspring, Phillip Parker King, was born there in December 1791, and four daughters followed. On his return to Norfolk Island, King found the population of nearly one thousand torn apart by discontent after the strict regime of Major Robert Ross. However, he set about enthusiastically to improve conditions. He encouraged settlers, drawn from ex-convicts and ex-marines, and he listened to their views on wages and prices. By 1794 the island was self- sufficient in grain, and surplus swine were being sent to Sydney. The number of people living off the government store was high, and few settlers wanted to leave. In February 1794 King was faced with unfounded allegations by members of the New South Wales Corps on the island that he was punishing them too severely and ex-convicts too lightly when disputes arose. As their conduct became mutinous, he sent twenty of them to Sydney for trial by court-martial. There Lieutenant-Governor Francis Grose censured King's actions and issued orders which gave the military illegal authority over the civilian population. Grose later apologised, but conflict with the military continued to plague King. Governor of New South Wales Suffering from gout, King returned to England in October 1796, and after regaining his health, and resuming his naval career, he was appointed to replace Captain John Hunter as the third Governor of New South Wales. King became governor on 28 September 1800. He set about changing the system of administration, and appointed Major Joseph Foveaux as Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island. His first task was to attack the misconduct of officers of the New South Wales Corps in their illicit trading in liquor, notably rum. He tried to discourage the importation of liquor, and began to construct a brewery. However, he found the refusal of convicts to work in their own time for other forms of payment, and the continued illicit local distillation, increasingly difficult to control. He continued to face military arrogance and disobedience from the New South Wales Corps. He failed to receive support in England when he sent an accused officer John Macarthur back to face a court-martial. King had some successes. His regulations for prices, wages, hours of work, financial deals, and the employment of convicts brought some relief to smallholders, and reduced the numbers 'on the stores'. He encouraged construction of barracks, wharves, bridges, houses, etc. Government flocks and herds greatly increased, and he encouraged experiments with vines, tobacco, cotton, hemp, and indigo. Whaling and sealing became important sources of oil and skins, and coal mining began. He took an interest in education, establishing schools to teach convict boys to become skilled tradesmen. He encouraged smallpox vaccinations, was sympathetic to missionaries, strove to keep peace with the indigenous inhabitants, ordered the printing of Australia's first book, New South Wales General Standing Orders, and encouraged the first newspaper, the Sydney Gazette. Exploration led to the survey of Bass Strait and Western Port, and the discovery of Port Phillip, and settlements were established at Hobart and Port Dalrymple in Van Diemen's Land. While still aware that Sydney was a convict colony and always alert to the ebb and flow of the rebellious Irish political prisoners he established his own body guard. He gave opportunities to emancipists, considering that ex-convicts should not remain in disgrace forever. He appointed emancipists to positions of responsibility, regulated the position of assigned servants, and laid the foundation of the 'ticket of leave' system for deserving prisoners. Although he directly profited from a number of commercial deals, cattle sales, and land grants, he was modest in his dealings compared with most of his subordinates. Most famously he quelled the Castle Hill Rebellion in March 1804. The increased animosity between King and the New South Wales Corps led to his resignation and replacement by William Bligh in 1806, and he returned to England. Here his health failed and he died on 3 September 1808. Although he worked hard for the good of New South Wales and left it very much better than he found it, the abuse from the officers harmed his reputation, and illness and the hard conditions of his service eventually wore him down. Of all the members of the First Fleet, Philip Gidley King perhaps made the greatest contribution to the early years of the colony. Artist King is also remembered for his art works, several of which survive. An engraving by William Blake, entitled A Native Family of New South Wales, and published in John Hunter's Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island (1793) was made from one of his watercolors. The original sketch is among the Banks Papers held by the Mitchell Library, Sydney, along with several others, unsigned but clearly by the same artist.

The station was created by volunteers back in 2001 to broadcast a special two week licence in conjunction with the Midsummer Festival which was located on Botany Bay near the M61. History The name \\"Chorley FM\\" is commonly associated with a fictional radio station featured in the comedy programmes That Peter Kay Thing, Phoenix Nights and Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere. The fictional station uses a logo based on Century FM in the 1990s. The real-life station Chorley FM, based at Steeley Lane in Chorley, operated for short periods of time each year from 2000 under a temporary licence (RSL). On 9 September 2005, Chorley FM Limited was awarded a five-year licence to broadcast round the clock to the local community, and was extended for a further five years in 2011. It also broadcasts worldwide via the Internet at www.chorley.fm. The station's target objective was to broadcast to the local population and provide an opportunity to get involved and gain valuable experience in radio and the media. Shortly after being granted its licence, Chorley FM created a competition in association with the Chorley Citizen newspaper, asking members of the community to design a logo for the station to use throughout its life, which was won by then 15-year-old, Rhys Griffiths. The logo, however, was changed to the current station logo during a full station re-branding exercise completed in February 2008 and then another re-brand in January 2012. The station launched its full live output on 24 November 2006 on the frequency 102.8 FM, as well as streaming online via the station website. In February 2008 Chorley FM saw a re-launch and implemented a new daytime music policy consisting of modern chart music, R&B;, commercial dance, Indie rock and a few 80s, 90s chart classics. As of May 2011, the music policy relaxed, playing a wider variety of music. From 6pm, more specialist shows are common-place, comprising many forms of Dance music not covered by other radio stations including underground House, Old Skool / Retro House, Garage, Techno, Scouse House, Drum & Bass and Hardstyle. Other shows include the Flat Iron Show (featuring local unsigned bands), a Rock music show, Folk and Irish Music show, Camp classics & 80's Anthems and a sports show. Chorley FM identified two objective target audiences. 15 to 25 year olds and the local LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender) community. In late 2007, Chorley FM won the 'Community Service Award' at the National LGBT Health Summit and drew particular mention to the 'Breakout' Show targeted at the LGBT community of Chorley.The Lesbian and Gay Foundation, 2007, More LGBT Programmes were included in the schedule, such as 'Camp Classics & 80's Anthems' which played mainly 80s music from the LGBT scene. In late 2008 Chorley FM worked in Conjunction with Search for a Star (Launched as a joint project with the Daily Star), a talent contest in partnership with Bobby Ball and Casey-Lee Jolleys. The show, hosted by Chorley FM's Nathan Hill and Steven Normyle with celebrity judges that included Bobby Ball, Casey-Lee Jolleys, X-Factor's Rowetta and Garry Bushell. Live theatre style shows took place weekly on the Blackpool North Pier. 2009 saw the station continue to grow with some media attention; including a number of inclusions in reports on Granada Reports and a behind- the-scenes look into volunteering as a young person at Chorley FM as part of the national BBC Blast project. In 2011 the station was awarded a five-year renewal of its community radio licence. In 2014 Ofcom told the station that it was not meeting its key commitments. Ofcom's interpretation of the commitments was that the station should exclusively serve the two target groups. The station announced dialogue with Ofcom regarding a change to the original commitments, on the basis that it was always intended to include specific content for the target groups within a diverse schedule rather than all output be exclusively for them. From March 2015 the station began broadcasting commentary from Chorley F.C. games, linking in with internet-based \\"Magpies Live\\", to further their involvement in the local community. This was welcomed by the local community and the town, and will continue to give coverage to the \\"Magpies\\" throughout the 2015/16 season, and beyond, in the Vanarama National League North. Also in 2015 Ofcom approved changes to the key commitments broadening the target audience to include the whole population of Chorley.http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/chorley-fm-change- request/statement/ New shows and community features including Business Lunch were rolled out. Closure The station's broadcasting equipment was made out of bounds and broadcasting ceased unexpectedly after a statement was released by the managing director on 1 August.https://www.lep.co.uk/business/chorley- fm-surrenders-radio-licence-after-going-off-the-air-1-9940459 On 14 August 2019, Chorley FM officially surrendered its community radio licence to Ofcom, ending the station's ability to come back on air. This followed a police investigation into allegations of sexual assault at the station that had not been investigated by the Managing Director at the time. Mr Stuart Clutton was contacted for comment on the matter by the local press but issued a no comment response.https://www.lep.co.uk/news/crime/police-probe-launched-into-sex- assault-claims-at-chorley-fm-radio-station-1-9632816 The complaint made by a former director of the station also included several complaints of sexual harassment.

For example, time goes slower at the ISS, lagging approximately 0.01 seconds for every 12 earth months passed. For GPS satellites to work, they must adjust for similar bending of spacetime to coordinate properly with systems on Earth. Time dilation is a difference in the elapsed time as measured by two clocks due to there existing between them either a relative velocity or a difference in gravitational potential between their locations. After compensating for varying signal delays due to the changing distance between an observer and a moving clock (i.e. Doppler effect), the observer will measure the moving clock as ticking slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer's own reference frame. A clock that is close to a massive body (and which therefore is at lower gravitational potential) will record less elapsed time than a clock situated further from the said massive body (and which is at a higher gravitational potential). These predictions of the theory of relativity have been repeatedly confirmed by experiment, and they are of practical concern, for instance in the operation of satellite navigation systems such as GPS and Galileo. Time dilation has also been the subject of science fiction works. History Time dilation by the Lorentz factor was predicted by several authors at the turn of the 20th century.. Joseph Larmor (1897), at least for electrons orbiting a nucleus, wrote \\"... individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio: \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\". Emil Cohn (1904) specifically related this formula to the rate of clocks. In the context of special relativity it was shown by Albert Einstein (1905) that this effect concerns the nature of time itself, and he was also the first to point out its reciprocity or symmetry.. See also: English translation. Subsequently, Hermann Minkowski (1907) introduced the concept of proper time which further clarified the meaning of time dilation. Velocity time dilation From the local frame of reference of the blue clock, the red clock, being in motion, is perceived as ticking slower Extract of page 60 (exaggerated). Special relativity indicates that, for an observer in an inertial frame of reference, a clock that is moving relative to them will be measured to tick slower than a clock that is at rest in their frame of reference. This case is sometimes called special relativistic time dilation. The faster the relative velocity, the greater the time dilation between one another, with the rate of time reaching zero as one approaches the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s). Theoretically, time dilation would make it possible for passengers in a fast-moving vehicle to advance further into the future in a short period of their own time. For sufficiently high speeds, the effect is dramatic. For example, one year of travel might correspond to ten years on Earth. Indeed, a constant 1 g acceleration would permit humans to travel through the entire known Universe in one human lifetime. With current technology severely limiting the velocity of space travel, however, the differences experienced in practice are minuscule: after 6 months on the International Space Station (ISS), orbiting Earth at a speed of about 7,700 m/s, an astronaut would have aged about 0.005 seconds less than those on Earth.-25 microseconds per day results in 0.00458 seconds per 183 days The cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev and Sergei Avdeyev both experienced time dilation of about 20 milliseconds compared to time that passed on Earth. =Simple inference of velocity time dilation= Left: Observer at rest measures time 2L/c between co-local events of light signal generation at A and arrival at A. Right: Events according to an observer moving to the left of the setup: bottom mirror A when signal is generated at time t'=0, top mirror B when signal gets reflected at time t'=D/c, bottom mirror A when signal returns at time t'=2D/c Time dilation can be inferred from the observed constancy of the speed of light in all reference frames dictated by the second postulate of special relativity. This constancy of the speed of light means that, counter to intuition, speeds of material objects and light are not additive. It is not possible to make the speed of light appear greater by moving towards or away from the light source. Consider then, a simple vertical clock consisting of two mirrors and , between which a light pulse is bouncing. The separation of the mirrors is and the clock ticks once each time the light pulse hits either of the mirrors. In the frame in which the clock is at rest (diagram on the left), the light pulse traces out a path of length and the period of the clock is divided by the speed of light: :\\\\Delta t = \\\\frac{2 L}{c} From the frame of reference of a moving observer traveling at the speed relative to the resting frame of the clock (diagram at right), the light pulse is seen as tracing out a longer, angled path. Keeping the speed of light constant for all inertial observers, requires a lengthening of the period of this clock from the moving observer's perspective. That is to say, in a frame moving relative to the local clock, this clock will appear to be running more slowly. Straightforward application of the Pythagorean theorem leads to the well-known prediction of special relativity: The total time for the light pulse to trace its path is given by: :\\\\Delta t' = \\\\frac{2 D}{c} The length of the half path can be calculated as a function of known quantities as: :D = \\\\sqrt{\\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{2}v \\\\Delta t'\\\\right )^2 + L^2} Elimination of the variables and from these three equations results in: :\\\\Delta t' = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} which expresses the fact that the moving observer's period of the clock \\\\Delta t' is longer than the period \\\\Delta t in the frame of the clock itself. Because all clocks that have a common period in the resting frame should have a common period when observed from the moving frame, all other clocksmechanical, electronic, optical (such as an identical horizontal version of the clock in the example)should exhibit the same velocity dependent time dilation. =Reciprocity= Time UV of a clock in S is shorter compared to Ux‚Ä≤ in S‚Ä≤, and time UW of a clock in S‚Ä≤ is shorter compared to Ux in STransversal time dilation. The blue dots represent a pulse of light. Each pair of dots with light \\"bouncing\\" between them is a clock. For each group of clocks, the other group appears to be ticking more slowly, because the moving clock's light pulse has to travel a larger distance than the stationary clock's light pulse. That is so, even though the clocks are identical and their relative motion is perfectly reciprocal. Given a certain frame of reference, and the \\"stationary\\" observer described earlier, if a second observer accompanied the \\"moving\\" clock, each of the observers would perceive the other's clock as ticking at a slower rate than their own local clock, due to them both perceiving the other to be the one that is in motion relative to their own stationary frame of reference. Common sense would dictate that, if the passage of time has slowed for a moving object, said object would observe the external world's time to be correspondingly sped up. Counterintuitively, special relativity predicts the opposite. When two observers are in motion relative to each other, each will measure the other's clock slowing down, in concordance with them being in motion relative to the observer's frame of reference. While this seems self-contradictory, a similar oddity occurs in everyday life. If two persons A and B observe each other from a distance, B will appear small to A, but at the same time A will appear small to B. Being familiar with the effects of perspective, there is no contradiction or paradox in this situation. The reciprocity of the phenomenon also leads to the so- called twin paradox where the aging of twins, one staying on Earth and the other embarking on a space travel, is compared, and where the reciprocity suggests that both persons should have the same age when they reunite. On the contrary, at the end of the round-trip, the traveling twin will be younger than their sibling on Earth. The dilemma posed by the paradox, however, can be explained by the fact that the traveling twin must markedly accelerate in at least three phases of the trip (beginning, direction change, and end), while the other will only experience negligible acceleration, due to rotation and revolution of Earth. During the acceleration phases of the space travel, time dilation is not symmetric. =Experimental testing= Doppler effect * The stated purpose by Ives and Stilwell (1938, 1941) of these experiments was to verify the time dilation effect, predicted by Larmor‚ÄìLorentz ether theory, due to motion through the ether using Einstein's suggestion that Doppler effect in canal rays would provide a suitable experiment. These experiments measured the Doppler shift of the radiation emitted from cathode rays, when viewed from directly in front and from directly behind. The high and low frequencies detected were not the classically predicted values: ::\\\\frac{f_0}{1 - v/c} \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad \\\\frac{f_0}{1+v/c} \\\\, :The high and low frequencies of the radiation from the moving sources were measured as: ::\\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c} } f_0 = \\\\gamma \\\\left(1 + v/c\\\\right) f_0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c} } f_0 = \\\\gamma \\\\left(1 - v/c\\\\right) f_0 \\\\, :as deduced by Einstein (1905) from the Lorentz transformation, when the source is running slow by the Lorentz factor. * Hasselkamp, Mondry, and Scharmann (1979) measured the Doppler shift from a source moving at right angles to the line of sight. The most general relationship between frequencies of the radiation from the moving sources is given by: ::f_\\\\mathrm{detected} = f_\\\\mathrm{rest}{\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{v}{c} \\\\cos\\\\phi\\\\right)/\\\\sqrt{1 - {v^2}/{c^2}} } :as deduced by Einstein (1905). For () this reduces to . This lower frequency from the moving source can be attributed to the time dilation effect and is often called the transverse Doppler effect and was predicted by relativity. * In 2010 time dilation was observed at speeds of less than 10 meters per second using optical atomic clocks connected by 75 meters of optical fiber. Moving particles *A comparison of muon lifetimes at different speeds is possible. In the laboratory, slow muons are produced; and in the atmosphere, very fast moving muons are introduced by cosmic rays. Taking the muon lifetime at rest as the laboratory value of 2.197 Œºs, the lifetime of a cosmic-ray-produced muon traveling at 98% of the speed of light is about five times longer, in agreement with observations. An example is Rossi and Hall (1941), who compared the population of cosmic-ray-produced muons at the top of a mountain to that observed at sea level. *The lifetime of particles produced in particle accelerators appears longer due to time dilation. In such experiments the \\"clock\\" is the time taken by processes leading to muon decay, and these processes take place in the moving muon at its own \\"clock rate\\", which is much slower than the laboratory clock. This is routinely taken into account in particle physics, and many dedicated measurements have been performed. For instance, in the muon storage ring at CERN the lifetime of muons circulating with Œ≥ = 29.327 was found to be dilated to 64.378 Œºs, confirming time dilation to an accuracy of 0.9 ¬± 0.4 parts per thousand. =Proper time and Minkowski diagram= In the Minkowski diagram from the first image on the right, clock C resting in inertial frame S‚Ä≤ meets clock A at d and clock B at f (both resting in S). All three clocks simultaneously start to tick in S. The worldline of A is the ct-axis, the worldline of B intersecting f is parallel to the ct-axis, and the worldline of C is the ct‚Ä≤-axis. All events simultaneous with d in S are on the x-axis, in S‚Ä≤ on the x‚Ä≤-axis. The proper time between two events is indicated by a clock present at both events. It is invariant, i.e., in all inertial frames it is agreed that this time is indicated by that clock. Interval df is therefore the proper time of clock C, and is shorter with respect to the coordinate times ef=dg of clocks B and A in S. Conversely, also proper time ef of B is shorter with respect to time if in S‚Ä≤, because event e was measured in S‚Ä≤ already at time i due to relativity of simultaneity, long before C started to tick. From that it can be seen, that the proper time between two events indicated by an unaccelerated clock present at both events, compared with the synchronized coordinate time measured in all other inertial frames, is always the minimal time interval between those events. However, the interval between two events can also correspond to the proper time of accelerated clocks present at both events. Under all possible proper times between two events, the proper time of the unaccelerated clock is maximal, which is the solution to the twin paradox. =Derivation and formulation= Lorentz factor as a function of speed (in natural units where c = 1). Notice that for small speeds (less than 0.1), Œ≥ is approximately 1. In addition to the light clock used above, the formula for time dilation can be more generally derived from the temporal part of the Lorentz transformation. Let there be two events at which the moving clock indicates t_{a} and t_{b}, thus: :t_{a}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{t_{a}-\\\\frac{vx_{a}}{c^{2}}}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}},\\\\ t_{b}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{t_{b}-\\\\frac{vx_{b}}{c^{2}}}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} Since the clock remains at rest in its inertial frame, it follows x_{a}=x_{b}, thus the interval \\\\Delta t^{\\\\prime}=t_{b}^{\\\\prime}-t_{a}^{\\\\prime} is given by: : \\\\Delta t' = \\\\gamma \\\\, \\\\Delta t = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\\\, where Œît is the time interval between two co-local events (i.e. happening at the same place) for an observer in some inertial frame (e.g. ticks on their clock), known as the proper time, Œît‚Ä≤ is the time interval between those same events, as measured by another observer, inertially moving with velocity v with respect to the former observer, v is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving clock, c is the speed of light, and the Lorentz factor (conventionally denoted by the Greek letter gamma or Œ≥) is: : \\\\gamma = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\\\, Thus the duration of the clock cycle of a moving clock is found to be increased: it is measured to be \\"running slow\\". The range of such variances in ordinary life, where even considering space travel, are not great enough to produce easily detectable time dilation effects and such vanishingly small effects can be safely ignored for most purposes. It is only when an object approaches speeds on the order of 30,000 km/s (1/10 the speed of light) that time dilation becomes important. Extract of page 87 =Hyperbolic motion= In special relativity, time dilation is most simply described in circumstances where relative velocity is unchanging. Nevertheless, the Lorentz equations allow one to calculate proper time and movement in space for the simple case of a spaceship which is applied with a force per unit mass, relative to some reference object in uniform (i.e. constant velocity) motion, equal to g throughout the period of measurement. Let t be the time in an inertial frame subsequently called the rest frame. Let x be a spatial coordinate, and let the direction of the constant acceleration as well as the spaceship's velocity (relative to the rest frame) be parallel to the x-axis. Assuming the spaceship's position at time being and the velocity being v0 and defining the following abbreviation: :\\\\gamma_0 = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}} the following formulas hold:See equations 3, 4, 6 and 9 of Position: :x(t) = \\\\frac {c^2}{g} \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\frac{\\\\left(gt + v_0\\\\gamma_0\\\\right)^2}{c^2}} -\\\\gamma_0 \\\\right) Velocity: :v(t) =\\\\frac{gt + v_0\\\\gamma_0}{\\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\frac{ \\\\left(gt + v_0\\\\gamma_0\\\\right)^2}{c^2}}} Proper time as function of coordinate time: :\\\\tau(t) = \\\\tau_0 + \\\\int_0^t \\\\sqrt{ 1 - \\\\left( \\\\frac{v(t')}{c} \\\\right)^2 } dt' In the case where v(0) = v0 = 0 and œÑ(0) = œÑ0 = 0 the integral can be expressed as a logarithmic function or, equivalently, as an inverse hyperbolic function: :\\\\tau(t) = \\\\frac{c}{g} \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{gt}{c} + \\\\sqrt{ 1 + \\\\left( \\\\frac{gt}{c} \\\\right)^2 } \\\\right) = \\\\frac{c}{g} \\\\operatorname {arsinh} \\\\left( \\\\frac{gt}{c} \\\\right) As functions of the proper time \\\\tau of the ship, the following formulae hold: Position: :x(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{c^2}{g} \\\\left( \\\\cosh \\\\frac{g \\\\tau}{c}-1 \\\\right) Velocity: :v(\\\\tau) = c \\\\tanh \\\\frac{g \\\\tau}{c} Coordinate time as function of proper time: :t(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{c}{g} \\\\sinh \\\\frac{g \\\\tau}{c} =Clock hypothesis= The clock hypothesis is the assumption that the rate at which a clock is affected by time dilation does not depend on its acceleration but only on its instantaneous velocity. This is equivalent to stating that a clock moving along a path P measures the proper time, defined by: :d \\\\tau = \\\\int_P \\\\sqrt {dt^2 - dx^2/c^2 - dy^2/c^2 - dz^2/c^2} The clock hypothesis was implicitly (but not explicitly) included in Einstein's original 1905 formulation of special relativity. Since then, it has become a standard assumption and is usually included in the axioms of special relativity, especially in the light of experimental verification up to very high accelerations in particle accelerators. Gravitational time dilation Time passes more quickly further from a center of gravity, as is witnessed with massive objects (like the Earth) Gravitational time dilation is experienced by an observer that, at a certain altitude within a gravitational potential well, finds that their local clocks measure less elapsed time than identical clocks situated at higher altitude (and which are therefore at higher gravitational potential). Gravitational time dilation is at play e.g. for ISS astronauts. While the astronauts' relative velocity slows down their time, the reduced gravitational influence at their location speeds it up, although to a lesser degree. Also, a climber's time is theoretically passing slightly faster at the top of a mountain compared to people at sea level. It has also been calculated that due to time dilation, the core of the Earth is 2.5 years younger than the crust. \\"A clock used to time a full rotation of the earth will measure the day to be approximately an extra 10 ns/day longer for every km of altitude above the reference geoid.\\" Travel to regions of space where extreme gravitational time dilation is taking place, such as near (but not beyond the event horizon of) a black hole, could yield time-shifting results analogous to those of near- lightspeed space travel. Contrarily to velocity time dilation, in which both observers measure the other as aging slower (a reciprocal effect), gravitational time dilation is not reciprocal. This means that with gravitational time dilation both observers agree that the clock nearer the center of the gravitational field is slower in rate, and they agree on the ratio of the difference. =Experimental testing= * In 1959 Robert Pound and Glen A. Rebka measured the very slight gravitational redshift in the frequency of light emitted at a lower height, where Earth's gravitational field is relatively more intense. The results were within 10% of the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, Pound and J. L. Snider measured a result within 1% of the value predicted by gravitational time dilation. (See Pound‚ÄìRebka experiment) * In 2010 gravitational time dilation was measured at the earth's surface with a height difference of only one meter, using optical atomic clocks. Combined effect of velocity and gravitational time dilation Daily time dilation (gain or loss if negative) in microseconds as a function of (circular) orbit radius r = rs/re, where rs is satellite orbit radius and re is the equatorial Earth radius, calculated using the Schwarzschild metric. At r ‚âà 1.497 there is no time dilation. Here the effects of motion and reduced gravity cancel. ISS astronauts fly below, whereas GPS and geostationary satellites fly above. Daily time dilation over circular orbit height split into its components High-accuracy timekeeping, low-Earth-orbit satellite tracking, and pulsar timing are applications that require the consideration of the combined effects of mass and motion in producing time dilation. Practical examples include the International Atomic Time standard and its relationship with the Barycentric Coordinate Time standard used for interplanetary objects. Relativistic time dilation effects for the solar system and the earth can be modeled very precisely by the Schwarzschild solution to the Einstein field equations. In the Schwarzschild metric, the interval dt_\\\\text{E} is given by:See equations 2 & 3 (combined here and divided throughout by c2) at pp. 35‚Äì36 in A version of the same relationship can also be seen at equation 2 in : dt_\\\\text{E}^2 = \\\\left( 1-\\\\frac{2GM_\\\\text{i}}{r_\\\\text{i} c^2} \\\\right) dt_\\\\text{c}^2 - \\\\left( 1-\\\\frac{2GM_\\\\text{i}}{r_\\\\text{i} c^2} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\frac{dx^2+dy^2+dz^2}{c^2} \\\\, where: :dt_\\\\text{E} is a small increment of proper time t_\\\\text{E} (an interval that could be recorded on an atomic clock), :dt_\\\\text{c} is a small increment in the coordinate t_\\\\text{c} (coordinate time), :dx, dy, dz are small increments in the three coordinates x, y, z of the clock's position, :\\\\frac{-G M_i}{r_i} represents the sum of the Newtonian gravitational potentials due to the masses in the neighborhood, based on their distances r_i from the clock. This sum includes any tidal potentials. The coordinate velocity of the clock is given by: :v^2 = \\\\frac{dx^2+dy^2+dz^2}{dt_\\\\text{c}^2} \\\\, The coordinate time t_c is the time that would be read on a hypothetical \\"coordinate clock\\" situated infinitely far from all gravitational masses (U=0), and stationary in the system of coordinates (). The exact relation between the rate of proper time and the rate of coordinate time for a clock with a radial component of velocity is: :\\\\frac{dt_\\\\text{E}}{dt_\\\\text{c}} = \\\\sqrt{ 1 + \\\\frac{2U}{c^2} - \\\\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \\\\left( \\\\frac{c^2}{2U} + 1 \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\frac{{v_\\\\shortparallel}^2}{c^2} } = \\\\sqrt{ 1 - \\\\left( \\\\beta^2 + \\\\beta_e^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\beta_\\\\shortparallel^2 \\\\beta_e^2}{1 - \\\\beta_e^2} \\\\right) } \\\\, where: :v_\\\\shortparallel is the radial velocity, :v_e = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{2 G M_i}{r_i} } is the escape speed, :\\\\beta = v/c, \\\\beta_e = v_e/c and \\\\beta_\\\\shortparallel = v_\\\\shortparallel/c are velocities as a percentage of speed of light c, :U = \\\\frac{-G M_i}{r_i} is the Newtonian potential; hence -U equals half the square of the escape speed. The above equation is exact under the assumptions of the Schwarzschild solution. It reduces to velocity time dilation equation in the presence of motion and absence of gravity, i.e. \\\\beta_e = 0. It reduces to gravitational time dilation equation in the absence of motion and presence of gravity, i.e. \\\\beta = 0 = \\\\beta_\\\\shortparallel. =Experimental testing= * Hafele and Keating, in 1971, flew caesium atomic clocks east and west around the Earth in commercial airliners, to compare the elapsed time against that of a clock that remained at the U.S. Naval Observatory. Two opposite effects came into play. The clocks were expected to age more quickly (show a larger elapsed time) than the reference clock, since they were in a higher (weaker) gravitational potential for most of the trip (c.f. Pound‚ÄìRebka experiment). But also, contrastingly, the moving clocks were expected to age more slowly because of the speed of their travel. From the actual flight paths of each trip, the theory predicted that the flying clocks, compared with reference clocks at the U.S. Naval Observatory, should have lost 40¬±23 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and should have gained 275¬±21 nanoseconds during the westward trip. Relative to the atomic time scale of the U.S. Naval Observatory, the flying clocks lost 59¬±10 nanoseconds during the eastward trip and gained 273¬±7 nanoseconds during the westward trip (where the error bars represent standard deviation). In 2005, the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom reported their limited replication of this experiment. The NPL experiment differed from the original in that the caesium clocks were sent on a shorter trip (London‚ÄìWashington, D.C. return), but the clocks were more accurate. The reported results are within 4% of the predictions of relativity, within the uncertainty of the measurements. * The Global Positioning System can be considered a continuously operating experiment in both special and general relativity. The in-orbit clocks are corrected for both special and general relativistic time dilation effects as described above, so that (as observed from the earth's surface) they run at the same rate as clocks on the surface of the Earth. Extract of page 306 Time dilation in popular culture Velocity and gravitational time dilation has been the subject of science fiction works, as it technically provides the means for forward time travel. These works are found in a variety of media. Interstellar is a film example. One key plot point in this movie is gravitational time dilation. The film depicts a planet close to a rotating black hole, on the surface of which one hour is equivalent to seven years on Earth, which is not realistic, although it is possible in theory. The rendering of the black hole itself was considered to be very realistic; its simulation was the result of a year of work by company Double Negative. Physicist Kip Thorne collaborated in making the film and explained its scientific concepts in the book The Science of Interstellar. There are more film examples, such as Passengers, Planet of the Apes, and Time Trap. Episodes \\"A Matter of Time\\" of Stargate SG-1 and \\"The Return: Part 1\\" of Stargate Atlantis are two samples from television series. \\"'39\\" by band Queen is a song representative. Tau Zero is a book example. At one point, the novel discusses velocity time dilation in terms of the tau factor, explaining that tau approximates zero when a spaceship moves at near speed of light; hence the title Tau Zero. Such high speed is attained by using a Bussard ramjet. The time dilation in this story is so extreme that the ship travels through galaxies in a blink and eventually outlives the universe. Scientific works related to time dilation have included this book in their references. There are more cases in literature, such as Mr Tompkins in Wonderland, Rocannon's World, and The Forever War. The story of X-O Manowar is one sample from comics. The open-source library of A Slower Speed of Light is a software exemplar.

It is also included on the commemorative plaque on the fa√ßade of the house where she lived at 8 Place de la Carri√®re, Nancy. Biography =Early life= Marie F√©licie √âlisabeth Marvingt was born at 6:30 p.m on 20 February 1875, in Aurillac, the prefecture of the French department of Cantal. Her father was F√©lix Constant Marvingt, a senior postmaster, and her mother was √âlisabeth Brusquin. They married in Metz on 16 July 1861 when he was 48 and she was 32. Before Marie was born, the couple lost three sons in infancy. The family, including younger brother Eug√®ne (born 1878), lived in Metz, at that time part of Germany, from 1880 to 1889. When Marie's mother died in 1889, the fourteen-year-old found herself in charge of the household, and the family moved to Nancy, where she remained for the rest of her life. F√©lix Marvingt was a local billiards and swimming champion, and a dedicated sports fan. With his only son in fragile health, he shared his love of sports with Marie and encouraged her already apparent abilities.Marie Marvingt#cite note-Ackerman, Gordon-6 By the age of four, she could swim 4 kilometers. She grew to also enjoy many other sports: mountaineering, riflery, gymnastics, horseback riding, fencing, tennis, skiing, luging, ice skating, boxing, martial arts, golf, hockey, and football. In 1890, at the age of 15, she canoed over 400 kilometers from Nancy to Koblenz, Germany. She had also learned a number of circus skills, and obtained a driver license by 1899. =Sporting successes= Marvingt became a world-class athlete who won numerous prizes in swimming, fencing, riflery, shooting, skiing, speed skating, luge and bobsledding. She was also a skilled mountaineer and between 1903 and 1910 she became the first woman to climb most of the peaks in the French and Swiss Alps including the Aiguille des Grands Charmoz and the Gr√©pon Pass from Chamonix in a single day. In 1905 she became the first Frenchwoman to swim the length of the Seine through Paris. The newspapers nicknamed her \\"the red amphibian\\" from the color of her swimming costume. In 1907 she won an international military shooting competition using a French army carbine and became the only woman ever awarded the palms du Premier Tireur by a French Minister of War. She dominated the 1908 to 1910 winter sports seasons at Chamonix, G√©rardmer, and Ballon d'Alsace, where she achieved first place on more than 20 occasions. On 26 January 1910, she won the L√©on Auscher Cup in the women's bobsledding world championship. She enjoyed cycling and rode from Nancy, France, to Naples, Italy, to see a volcanic eruption. In 1908 she was refused permission to participate in the Tour de France because the race was open only to men. Marvingt chose to cycle the course anyway, riding some distance behind the entrants. She successfully completed the grueling ride, a feat which only 36 of 114 male riders had managed that year. On 15 March 1910 the French Academy of Sports awarded her a gold medal \\"for all sports,\\" the only multi-sport medal they have ever awarded. =Achievements in early aviation= Ballooning Marie Marvingt ascended as a passenger in a free-flight balloon for the first time in 1901.Lahausse, Jean-Bernard et Sertelet, Romain: Biographie du Mois ‚Äì Mars 2013 (In French). http://www.verdun- meuse.fr/index.php?qs=fr/ressources/biographie-du-mois---mars-2013---marie- marvin. Accessed 27 April 2013. NOTE: A useful fresh biography that does not simply repeat all of the details recorded elsewhere. On 19 July 1907, she piloted one. On 24 September 1909, she made her first solo flight as a balloon pilot, and on 26 October 1909, Marvingt became the first woman to pilot a balloon (The Shooting Star) across the North Sea from Europe to England. She won prizes for ballooning in 1909, 1910, and 1911.A press photograph, Agence Rol, archived as a 13 x 18 cm negative on glass, shows Mlle Marvingt and Mlle Carton, aviatrixes, in front of a balloon basket on the racecourse at Longchamp, on the occasion of the award of the Grand prix de l'A√©ro Club de France, 26 June 1910 http://catalogue.bnf.fr/servlet/biblio?idNoeud=1&ID;=40490530&SN1;=0&SN2;=0&host;=catalogue Retrieved 9 April 2013 On 18 July 1914, competing in the 10th Grand Prix of the French Air Club, she became the first woman to cross the English Channel in a balloon. She earned her balloon pilot's license (#145) from the Stella Aero Club in 1910, the second woman to do so (the first was Marie Surcouf).Maggio, Rosalie, \\"The Shooting Star,\\" Marie Marvingt, Fianc√©e of Danger (McFarland, 2019), Fixed-wing powered flight In September 1909, Marie Marvingt experienced her first flight as a passenger in an aeroplane piloted by Roger Sommer.L'Est R√©publicain, \\"A Jarville Aviation,\\" September 11, 1909, p. 2; L'A√©rophile, \\"Roger Sommer √† Nancy,\\" October 1, 1909, p. 436. During 1910, she studied fixed-wing aviation with Hubert Latham, the Anglo-French rival of Louis Bl√©riot, in an Antoinette aeroplane.L'Est R√©publicain, \\"Mlle Marvingt -- Apprenti-Pilote,\\" December 1, 1909, p. 2. She piloted, soloed, and passed her license requirements on the difficult-to-fly Antoinette, the first woman to do so. Marie Marvingt received a pilot's license from the A√©ro-Club de France (Aero Club of France) on 8 November 1910.\\"Liste Num√©rique des Brevets des Pilotes Aviateurs d√©livr√©s avant le 2 aout 1914\\" (List of Pilots‚Äô Licences issued before 2 August 1914). http://www.vieillestiges.com/Historique/html/BrevetsPA-01.html Retrieved 9 April 2013 Licensed No. 281, she was the third Frenchwoman to be registered after Raymonde de Laroche (No. 36) and Marthe Niel (No. 226). In her first 900 flights she never \\"broke wood\\" in a crash, a record unequaled at that time. Marie flew in a number of air meets, bombed a German airbase twice as an unofficial pilot in World War I (see below), flew on reconnaissance missions in the \\"pacification\\" of North Africa, and was the only woman to hold four pilot's licenses simultaneously: balloon, airplane, hydroplane, helicopter (in her 80s, Marie flew a jet-engined helicopter,\\"Actualit√© de l'histoire\\" n¬∞84, mai 2006, page 64 and renewed her pilot's license). Femina Cup On 27 November 1910, Marie Marvingt set the world's first aviation records for women in time aloft and distance flown.Drigny, Georges, \\"La Fin de la Saison,\\" Le Sport Universel Illustr√©, December 4, 1910, p. 783; L¬í√âquipe, \\"Mlle Marvingt, D√©tentrice des Records F√©minins en A√©roplane,\\" octobre 1910. Until that time, women's activities had not been recorded. Marie insisted that this flight be officially timed, measured, and verified -- first, to establish the need to include women in the record books and, second, because she was competing for the Femina Cup.Drigny, Georges, \\"La Fin de la Saison,\\" Le Sport Universel Illustr√©, December 4, 1910, p. 783; L¬í√âquipe, \\"Mlle Marvingt, D√©tentrice des Records F√©minins en A√©roplane,\\" octobre 1910. Recently offered by Pierre Lafitte, owner of the women's magazine Femina, the Femina Cup was to be awarded to the Frenchwoman, duly licensed by the French Air Club, who by the end of 1910 had flown the longest distance in a nonstop flight. Although Marie made another flight bettering her own record, on 21 December 1910, H√©l√®ne Dutrieu, cycling champion and fourth woman in the world to obtain a pilot's license, flew even farther. Marie made a last attempt to win the Cup on 30 December 1910 but mechanical failure forced her to land short of her goal.L'Est R√©publicain, \\"Mlle Marvingt,\\" January 1-2, 1911, p. 1. H√©l√®ne Dutrieu won the cup. The importance of the Femina Cup lay in initiating recordkeeping for women and in introducing women in the air to the world; international interest had surrounded women competing for the Cup.Maggio, Rosalie, \\"Queen of the Air,\\" Marie Marvingt, Fianc√©e of Danger (McFarland, 2019). =Air ambulances= Marie Marvingt proposed the development of fixed- wing aircraft as air ambulances to the French government as early as 1910. With the help of Deperdussin company engineer Louis B√©chereau (who also designed the SPAD fighter), she drew up the first prototype for the first practical air ambulance. By means of her popular conferences, she raised money to purchase one for the French military and the Red Cross. In 1912 she ordered an air ambulance from Deperdussin, but before it could be delivered, the company went bankrupt when the owner, Armand Deperdussin, embezzled company money.The Deperdussin case, Flight, 12 April 1917: http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1917/1917%20-%200348.html Retrieved 15 April 2013. (In 1914 Marvingt was drawn by √âmile Friant with her proposed air ambulance.) Marvingt devoted the remainder of her long life to the concept of aeromedical evacuation, giving more than 3,000 conferences and seminars on the subject on at least four continents. She was co-founder of the French organization Les Amies De L'Aviation Sanitaire (Friends of Medical Aviation) and was also one of the organizers behind the success of the First International Congress on Medical Aviation in 1929. In 1931 she created the Challenge Capitaine-√âcheman (Captain √âcheman Challenge), which awarded a prize for the best civil aircraft transformable into an air ambulance. In 1934 she established a civil air ambulance service in Morocco and was subsequently awarded the M√©daille de la Paix du Maroc (Medal of Peace of Morocco). In the same year she developed training courses for the Infirmi√®res de l'Air (Nurses of the Air) and in 1935 became the first person certified as a Flight Nurse. In 1934 and 1935 she wrote, directed and appeared in two documentary films about the history, development and use of air ambulances: Les Ailes qui Sauvent (The Wings That Save) and Sauv√©s par la Colombe (Saved by the Dove). The Flying Ambulance Corps, operated by women pilots and staffed by doctors and trained nurses, was intended to rescue the wounded on the battlefield using aircraft, landing at designated ground stations with crews of nurses, stretcher-bearers, and effective medical aid. By 1939, it appeared vital again and Marie Marvingt had been working on this and similar schemes for nearly thirty years. While organizing \\"L'Aviation Sanitaire,\\" recruiting women pilots and nurses, she made several visits to the United States to confer with government officials. In France itself, she had been supported by authorities including Marshals Foch and Joffre. Her schemes caught the imagination of the young women of her country and at the start of WW II, this escalated. More than five hundred nurses with at least ten hours' flying experience joined a new corps of flying nurses, some of whom were also parachutists.French Wikipedia: :fr:Maryse Hilsz: Accessed 22 April 2013. Note: The connection between Marie Marvingt and Maryse Hilsz is mentioned in a newspaper article on the former, written in 1939 (The Sydney Morning Herald, 6 November 1939, Women's Supplement, Accessible through National Library of Australia), but it is not commonly mentioned in Marvingt citations and there are not a lot of data. There is at present no English Wikipedia Article on Hilsz On 30 January 1955, she received the Deutsch de la Meurthe grand prize from the F√©d√©ration Nationale d'A√©ronautique (French National Federation of Aeronautics) at the Sorbonne for her work in aviation medicine. =War activities= √âmile Friant's drawing of Marie Marvingt and her proposed air ambulance, 1914 During World War I, she disguised herself as a man and, with the connivance of a French infantry lieutenant, served on the front lines as a Chasseur 2i√®me Classe (Soldier, 2nd Class) in the 42i√®me Bataillon de Chasseurs √† Pied (42nd Battalion of Foot Soldiers). She was discovered and sent home but later participated in military operations with the Italian 3¬∫ Reggimento Alpini (3rd Regiment of Alpine Troops) in the Italian Dolomites at the direct request of Marshal Foch. She also served as a Red Cross surgical nurse, as a war correspondent on the Italian front, and as a probable gatherer of information for military authorities.Bulletin de la Meurthe et Moselle, \\"Mlle Marvingt,\\" August 12, 1917, p. 2. In 1915 Marvingt became the first woman in the world to fly combat missions when she became a volunteer pilot flying bombing missions over German-held territory and she received the Croix de guerre (Military Cross) for her aerial bombing of a German military base in Metz.Historic Wings ‚Äì Online Magazine; Article on H√©l√®ne Dutrieu Coupe Femina and Marie Marvingt:, Published on December 21, 2012: http://fly.historicwings.com/2012/12/helene- dutrieux-and-the-coupe-femina Retrieved 17 April 2013. Between the two World Wars she worked as a journalist, war correspondent, and medical officer with French Forces in North Africa. While in Morocco she came up with the idea of using metal skis for air ambulances so that they could land on desert sand. She also ran a ski school in the desert, teaching people to ski on sand dunes. In World War II, she resumed work as a Red Cross nurse with the rank of corporal, she continued her promotion of the ambulance-airplane, and she founded and maintained a home for wounded aviators. She also fought in the Resistance, for which she was given a medal with a star (indicating exceptional contributions). A plaque in Saint-Alv√®re reads: \\"Marie Marvingt, Resistance Fighter, Is Honored.\\" =Death and posthumous recognition= Marie Marvingt died on 14 December 1963, aged 88, in Laxou,Find a Grave Memorial: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44263640 a small commune in the Meurthe- et-Moselle department in northeastern France. Her funeral was on 17 December in Saint-Epvre, and she is buried in the Cimeti√®re de Pr√©ville, Nancy, France. In France, there are streets, gymnasia, schools, flying clubs, scout groups, and an apartment complex named after her. In 1987, she was named to the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame. France issued an airmail stamp in her honor on 29 June 2004. Several annual awards are given in her memory including those of the Soroptimist Club of Aurillac, France, and one sponsored by the French Aviation and Space Medicine Association (SOFRAMAS) through the United States Aerospace Medical Association. =Philately= In 2004, Marie Marvingt was commemorated by a French Airmail stampWikiTimbres.fr: http://www.wikitimbres.fr/timbres/6972/2004-marie-marvingt-1875-1963 bearing the face value of ‚Ç¨5.00. * Designed by Christophe Drochon and engraved by Andr√© Lavergne. * Date of issue 7 May 2004 ‚Äì Withdrawal date 8 May 2005. * Horizontal format, 47 x 27 mm; perforations included 52 x 31 mm. * Two bars phosphorescent. * Print Mixed ‚Äì Intaglio / offset; colour polychrome. * Perforations 13 x 13 1/2 * Issued in a souvenir sheet of ten. * Michel Catalogue No. 3832.

On reaching the catalogue number SARAH 100 the label celebrated its centenary by throwing a party and shutting itself down. In March 2015, NME declared Sarah to be the second greatest indie label of all time. Origins The label was formed in Bristol in 1987 by Clare Wadd and Matt Haynes and grew out of the fanzine scene at the time, Haynes having previously edited Are You Scared To Get Happy? and Wadd Kvatch. Both these fanzines had given away flexidiscs, with Are You Scared To Get Happy? being part of the Sha-la-la organisation, a record label set up solely to produce flexidiscs. Several Sarah releases were fanzines and flexidiscs as, along with the 7\\"s, it was thought they summed up the aesthetic and politics of the label better than 12\\" singles and albums. The label also refused to participate in the multi-formatting that was common at the time, or even include singles on albums, feeling that these practices were unfair on fans. In 1990 Wadd and Haynes told Melody Maker that it was \\"a record company run from a record buyer‚Äôs point of view ... you shouldn‚Äôt rip off the people who support you\\". Music Sarah Records was usually seen as being grounded in the C86 jangly indie-pop sensibility, though the late Seventies DIY scene and independent yet stylish and imaginative labels such as Postcard Records, Factory and Creation, plus the mid-Eighties fanzine culture, were bigger influences and many bands, notably The Field Mice and The Orchids, experimented with dance sounds. Other bands on the label included Heavenly, East River Pipe, The Hit Parade, Even As We Speak, Boyracer, Brighter, Blueboy, Another Sunny Day, Shelley and St. Christopher. Politics \\"It's just POLITICS, not as some distant unreal end, but as something encaptured in everyday life\\" declared the sleevenotes to the label's first compilation LP, Shadow Factory, and the label always saw itself as political, a response to its years of operation being \\"the years when CDs took over and vinyl died, when majors set up fake indies and indie became a genre not an ideology ... the years of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, of Clause 28 and the Poll Tax; the years when Lad Culture took hold.\\" Because much of the politics was represented by the label's actions rather than its music, this aspect of Sarah was often missed; but Wadd and Haynes always hoped that those buying the records would discover the politics ‚Äúby osmosis. One day, they‚Äôd suddenly stop and think, ‚ÄòHang on, why do I have to spend ¬£3.49 on this Pastels twelve-inch from Creation when the Sea Urchins seven-inch on Sarah only costs ¬£1.49 and they both have three songs on?‚Äô And then they‚Äôd set fire to the Houses of Parliament.‚Äù Haynes did admit, though, that \\"few people spotted that our sleeves didn‚Äôt use the female image as decoration, that singles didn‚Äôt appear on albums (except compilations), and that compilations didn‚Äôt include ‚Äòpreviously unreleased‚Äô tracks, so maybe our politics was too subtle.\\" The politics was also always tempered by humour: 12\\" singles were used as a self-consciously hyperbolic metaphor for capitalism, the capitalist mindset of record collectors was mocked by randomly distributing postcards that formed a jigsaw of Bristol Temple Meads railway station in the sleeves of ten 7\\"s whose labels featured photos of consecutive stations on the local Severn Beach Line, and the label announced its Autumn 1992 release schedule by taking out quarter-page adverts in the music press denouncing capitalism and the refusal of bands to accept responsibility for their own marketing practices. Bristol Being based in Bristol was very important to Sarah; despite neither being from Bristol, both Wadd and Haynes loved the city and wanted to make the political point that to run a successful record label you didn't have to move to London. Each 7\\" single featured a picture of the city on its centre label, the label's compilation albums were named after places in and around Bristol (and numbered after the buses that went there) and the city's road layout provided the board for Saropoly ‚Äì the board game about running an indie record label (packaged as a 7\\" single) that was the label's fiftieth release. Press response Although Sarah releases received fifteen Singles of the Week in NME and Melody Maker, the UK press was mostly hostile, something Wadd and Haynes attributed to the largely male journalists missing the point, being annoyed by it, or worrying that liking a label with a girl's name, co-run by a woman, would bring their own masculinity into question. The maleness and sexism of the music press was a major issue for Sarah. As Wadd wrote in a letter to Melody Maker, \\"your treatment of women reinforces the status quo of a woman‚Äôs role being largely decorative ‚Äì an object, a stage- prop to be placed at the front of photos ‚Ä¶ a puppet to smile and dance while the boys at the back (the 'brains') pull the strings. It‚Äôs hard enough for a woman to carve herself an independent role in music. Stupid basic things like going to gigs on your own and getting back afterwards have to be considered on top of society‚Äôs everyday constraints ‚Ä¶ Add to that the implicit criterion that to succeed you need to be physically desirable. What about the not-so- beautiful, the women who aren‚Äôt so confident about their appearance/sexuality? ‚Ä¶ You end up with half the population having no creative input. Yet even that is eerily disguised because it‚Äôs always the purely stereotypical (and therefore hardly qualifying as positive discrimination) FEMALE image within a band that the male writer/camera seeks out.\\" The label was always better received outside the UK, with bands playing to big audiences in Europe and Japan, and, after the label had ended, the attitude of the UK press gradually shifted. In March 2015, NME put Sarah at number 2 in its list of greatest indie labels of all time, saying \\"Sarah‚Äôs legacy is in thinking gloriously big, and believing that a label is more than a catalogue of disparate releases.\\" Ending and Aftermath =A Day For Destroying Things= Sarah ceased operations in August 1995 with the release of There and Back Again Lane, a booklet telling the story of the label along with a CD of representative tracks. A party was held on the Thekla, a boat moored in Bristol's Floating Harbour, and half-page adverts entitled \\"A Day For Destroying Things\\" were taken out in both NME and Melody Maker. \\"We don't do encores\\", the advert announced, and the label has stuck by this sentiment, with no further releases. =Retrospective Film, Book and Exhibition= A film about the label, My Secret World, made by Lucy Dawkins for Yes Please! Productions, was previewed at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol on 3 May 2014 as part of the exhibition Between Hello and Goodbye: The Secret World of Sarah Records and had its official premiere at the Hackney Picturehouse in London on 12 April 2015. A book, Popkiss: The Life and Afterlife of Sarah Records, by Michael White, was published by Bloomsbury on 19 November 2015. =Shinkansen Recordings= After Sarah ended, Haynes established Shinkansen Recordings in 1996. Named after the Japanese \\"bullet train\\", the label was originally going to be called \\"Metropolitan\\", but there was already a record label of that name. Shinkansen released new recordings by ex-Sarah artists (including Blueboy and Harvey Williams) as well as other acts including Fosca, Trembling Blue Stars and Tompot Blenny. Haynes went on to edit a zine, Smoke: a London Peculiar, dedicated to writing and art inspired by London.

Brett was best known as a panelist on the 1970s game show Match Game and for her recurring role as Blanche Madison opposite her real-life husband, actor Jack Klugman, on The Odd Couple. Personal life Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, Somers grew up near Portland, Maine. At age 18, she moved to New York City to pursue a career in acting,Andrew Gans \\"DIVA TALK: A Chat with \\"Match Game\\" Star Brett Somers\\" , Playbill, July 11, 2003. settling in Greenwich Village. Her chosen first name, Brett, came from the lead female character in Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. Her chosen last name, Somers, was reportedly her mother's maiden name. After settling in New York she married Robert Klein and had a daughter, Leslie, before their eventual divorce. She married actor Jack Klugman in 1953 and had two sons, Adam and David. Adam shares his July 11 birthday with Brett. It was long reported that Somers and Klugman separated in 1974 but remained legally married until her death; this false belief was furthered by the fact that Klugman waited until after Somers died to marry his second wife. However, California court records indicate the couple actually divorced in August 1977.\\"Jack Klugman dies\\", CNN, December 24, 2012; accessed July 9, 2015.

December 14, 1980. \\"She has been a member of the Actors' Studio for more than 25 years - proudly noting she joined the same year as James Dean.\\" Somers began her career in theater and made many of her initial television appearances in dramatic programs such as The Philco Television Playhouse, Kraft Television Theatre, Playhouse 90 and Robert Montgomery Presents. Her Broadway debut was in the play Maybe Tuesday. The show was a flop and closed after just five performances. She also appeared on stage in productions of Happy Ending, The Seven Year Itch and The Country Girl, the last opposite Klugman. She also amassed a number of film credits including A Rage to Live and Bus Riley's Back in Town. =Television credits= Somers made many appearances on episodic primetime television, including Love, American Style, The Defenders, Have Gun Will Travel, Ben Casey, CHiPs, The Love Boat, Barney Miller and The Fugitive. In 1973 she played Rhoda Morgenstern's Aunt Rose in the season four episode \\"Rhoda's Sister Gets Married\\" on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She had a recurring role as Blanche, the former wife of Oscar Madison (played by real-life spouse Jack Klugman) on the ABC sitcom The Odd Couple in the early 1970s. In 1973 she played Perry Mason's receptionist Gertie on The New Perry Mason, a short-lived revival of the classic TV series, with Monte Markham as Perry Mason. She played the role of Siress Belloby on the 1978 science-fiction series Battlestar Galactica. =Match Game= Somers was best known for her appearances as a panelist in the 1970s CBS game show Match Game. For her debut episodes she sat in the lower-left panel position, but for the remainder of her tenure she occupied the center seat of the upper tier, most often next to Charles Nelson Reilly, who joined as a regular around the same time as Brett and settled into the top-right seat. She was clearly left-handed as she was always seen writing her answers with her left hand. The show became known for somewhat outlandish and risque dialogue, sometimes being described as a game played at a cocktail party. Somers was a familiar on-screen presence, wearing enormous eyeglasses and various wigs. She played foil to Charles Nelson Reilly, Betty White, Scoey Mitchell, Fannie Flagg and many others. Somers was sometimes the subject of questions on Match Game, such as \\"You may or may not believe in reincarnation, but listen to this. In a previous life, Brett used to be a .\\" Somers was not originally considered for the celebrity panel. When spouse Jack Klugman appeared during the first week of the program in 1973 he suggested that the producers bring her aboard. She remained a regular panelist for the rest of the show's nine-year network and syndicated run. Her appearances on Match Game led radio personality Robin Quivers to impersonate her in parodies of such game shows on The Howard Stern Show. Quivers' impersonation of Somers was featured in the film Private Parts. Later life and death In 2002, she appeared with Charles Nelson Reilly and Betty White (via videolink) as part of a Match Game reunion on the CBS program The Early Show. She appeared with Reilly on Hollywood Squares during that show's \\"Game Show Week\\" in 2002. In 2006 she was a prominent interviewee in The Real Match Game Story: Behind The Blank on GSN and hosted the Match Game DVD as well. She appeared in a cabaret show An Evening with Brett Somers in 2003-04. In 2004PBS's \\"Magic Moments - The Best of '50s Pop at WorldCat. Retrieved June 16, 2019 she appeared on the PBS concert special \\"Magic Moments ‚Äì The Best of '50s Pop\\". In the two-minute segment, hosted by Wink Martindale, Somers was a member of a faux quiz-show panel with Dr. Joyce Brothers and Rip Taylor. During a 2002 interview Somers denied rumors that she had cancer. She reiterated that point in future interviews.Portantiere, Michael. \\"Somers in the City\\" , Theatremania.com, July 3, 2003. Somers had a naturally husky voice that might have caused the misconception that she suffered from a throat ailment. However, she was diagnosed with cancer in 2004. Following a period of remission, she died on September 15, 2007, at her home in Westport, Connecticut, at age 83. Her younger son, Adam, gave the cause of her death as stomach and colon cancer.

Model For many devices, a linear model is accurate only for small signal levels. For example, at 2 volts input, a typical audio amplifier might put out 20 V, meaning the linear gain is 10 V/V. For 3 V input, it might then output 30 V. However, the model implies that at 50 V input it would produce 500 V, which is not possible with most amplifiers. Mathematically, the input- output relationship of many devices should be described by a polynomial or Taylor series, as shown below. v = \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty a_ku^k For larger values of u, the higher order coefficients such as a_2 and a_3 come into play. Effects of nonlinearity Nonlinearity can have several effects, which are unwanted in typical situations. The a_3 term for example would, when the input is a sine wave with frequency \\\\omega, result in an extra sine wave at 3\\\\omega, as shown below. v = (a_1 + \\\\frac{3}{4}a_3) sin(\\\\omega t) - \\\\frac{1}{4}a_3 sin(3\\\\omega t) In certain situations, this spurious signal can be filtered away because the \\"harmonic\\" 3\\\\omega lies far outside the frequency range used, but in cable television, for example, third order distortion could cause a 200 MHz signal to interfere with the regular channel at 600 MHz.

The island was called the Isle of Pines () until 1978. It has an area and is south of the island of Cuba, across the Gulf of Bataban√≥. The island lies almost directly south of Havana and Pinar del R√≠o and is a Special Municipality (), not part of any province and is therefore administered directly by the central government of Cuba. The island has only one municipality, also named Isla de la Juventud. The largest of the 350 islands in the Canarreos Archipelago (Archipi√©lago de los Canarreos), the island has an estimated population of 83,544 (in 2019). The capital and largest city is Nueva Gerona in the north, and the second largest and oldest city is Santa Fe in the interior. Other communities include Columbia, La Demajagua (formerly Santa B√°rbara), Historical infos about Santa B√°rbara and La Demajagua on EcuRed Mac Kinley, Cuchilla Alta, Punta del Este, Sierra de Caballos and Sierra de Casas.  History  Little is known of the pre-Columbian history of the island, though a cave complex near the Punta del Este beach preserves 235 ancient drawings made by the native population. The island was first sighted by Europeans in 1494 during Christopher Columbus's second voyage to the New World. Columbus named the island La Evangelista, claiming it for Spain. The island was also known, at various points in its history, as Isla de Cotorras (Isle of Parrots) and Isla de Tesoros (Treasure Island). Pirate activity in and around the area left its trace in English literature; notably, Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, and Peter Pan by J. M. Barrie, each drawing on accounts of the island and its native and pirate inhabitants, by reflecting the long dugout canoes that both pirates and the indigenous peoples used, and the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus). Following its defeat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the Cuban War of Independence, Spain dropped all claims to Cuba under the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris. The Platt Amendment of 1901, which defined Cuba's boundaries for the purposes of U.S. authorities, left the U.S. position on sovereignty over the then Isla de Pinos undetermined. This led to competing claims to the island by the United States and Cuba. In 1907, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in Pearcy v. Stranahan, that control of the island was a political decision, not a judicial one. In 1916, a pamphlet titled Isle of Pines: American or What? called for the U.S. to annex or purchase the island to settle the issue. In 1904, Cuba and the United States negotiated and signed the Hay-Quesada Treaty, which recognized Cuba's sovereignty over the island. The U.S. Senate ratified this agreement on March 13, 1925, over the objections of some four hundred United States citizens and companies, who owned or controlled about 95% of the island's land.Cuba's Island of Dreams: Voices from the Isle of Pines and YouthNeagle, Michael E.

With the political and administrative reorganization of Cuban provinces in 1976, the island was given the status of \\"special municipality\\". Fidel Castro presided at a ceremony changing the name of the island from Isla de Pinos to Isla de la Juventud on 3 August 1978. This was the realization of a promise that he had made in 1967, when he said \\"Let‚Äôs call it the Isle of Youth when the youth have done something grand with their work here, when they have revolutionized the natural environment, when they see the fruits of their labor and have revolutionized society here.\\"  Geography and economy  Much of the island is covered in pine forests, which is the source of the island's large lumber industry (as well as its original name). The northern region of the island has low ridges from which marble is quarried, while the southern region is an elevated plain. Agriculture and fishing are the island's main industries, with citrus fruit and vegetables being grown. A black sand beach was formed by volcanic activity. The island has a mild climate but is known for frequent hurricanes. It is a popular tourist destination, with many beaches and resorts, including Bibijagua Beach. Until the Cuban government expropriated all foreign-owned property in the early 1960s, much land was owned by Americans, and the island contained a branch of the Hilton Hotels chain.  Demographics  In the 2012 official census, the Special Municipality of Isla de la Juventud had a population of 84,751. The racial makeup of the population was white 50,732 (59.9%), mestizo or mulatto 26,013 (30.7%) and black 8,006 (9.4%). 2012 Official Census  Province, City and ethnic group With a total area of , the Municipality had a population density of . \\"Caimaneros\\", The inhabitants of the south coast of the island are descended from settlers from the Cayman Islands, and Jamaica, and are English speaking Cubans.  Transportation  The main transportation to the island is by boat or aircraft. Hydrofoils (kometas) and motorized catamarans will make the journey from Bataban√≥ to Nueva Gerona in between two and three hours. A much slower and larger cargo ferry takes around six hours to make the crossing but is cheaper.  Presidio Modelo  Presidio Modelo in 2005 The Presidio Modelo was erected in 1926 and 1928. The model panopticon penitentiary is on the outskirts of Nueva Gerona. It was the place where, after leading a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in July 1953, Fidel Castro, along with his brother Ra√∫l Castro, was imprisoned by the regime of Fulgencio Batista from 1953 to 1955. Following the Cuban Revolution, the same facility was used to imprison the new regime's enemies and political dissidents. They included Huber Matos, an officer in the revolutionary army who attempted to resign and who said he was tortured there. Armando Valladares wrote a memoir describing the prison's harsh conditions and cruel treatment of political prisoners.Armando Valladares, Against All Hope (New York: Knopf, 1986) Presidio Modelo ceased functioning as a prison in 1967. It has been declared a national monument and its hospital rooms converted into a museum.

Retrieved May 22, 2018. (; born January 14, 1952) is an American columnist for The New York Times and an author. During the 1970s and the early 1980s, Dowd worked for Time magazine and the Washington Star, where she covered news and sports and wrote feature articles. Dowd joined The New York Times in 1983 as a Metropolitan Reporter, and became an op-ed writer for the newspaper in 1995. In 1999, Dowd was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for her series of columns on the Bill Clinton oral sex scandal. Early life and career Dowd was born the youngest of five children in Washington, D.C. Her mother, Margaret \\"Peggy\\" (Meenehan), was a housewife, and her father, Mike Dowd, worked as a Washington, D.C. police inspector. Dowd graduated from (now defunct) Immaculata High School in 1969.Schmalzbauer 2003, p. 18; \\"Singularly acerbic pen sets Dowd apart as Clinton critic; N.Y. Times' pundit keeps caustic watch on Washington\\". The Washington Times. September 25, 1996. She received a B.A. in English in 1973 from The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Dowd began her career in 1974 as an editorial assistant for the Washington Star, where she later became a sports columnist, metropolitan reporter, and feature writer. When the newspaper closed in 1981, she went to work at Time. In 1983, she joined The New York Times, initially as a metropolitan reporter. She began serving as correspondent in the Times Washington bureau in 1986. In 1991, Dowd received a Breakthrough Award from Columbia University. In 1992, she was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for national reporting, and in 1994 she won a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. New York Times columnist Dowd became a columnist on The New York Times op-ed page in 1995, replacing Anna Quindlen, who left to become a full-time novelist. Dowd was named a Woman of the Year by Glamour magazine in 1996, and won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize, for distinguished commentary. She won The Damon Runyon Award for outstanding contributions to journalism in 2000, and became the first Mary Alice Davis Lectureship speaker (sponsored by the School of Journalism and the Center for American History) at the University of Texas at Austin in 2005. In 2010, Dowd was ranked #43 on The Daily Telegraphs list of the 100 most influential liberals in America; in 2007, she was ranked #37 on the same list. Dowd's columns have been described as letters to her mother, whom friends credit as \\"the source, the fountain of Maureen's humor and her Irish sensibilities and her intellectual take.\\" Dowd herself has said, \\"She is in my head in the sense that I want to inform and amuse the reader.\\" Dowd's columns are distinguished by an acerbic, often polemical writing style. Her columns display a critical and irreverent attitude towards powerful, mostly political, figures such as former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Dowd also tends to refer to her subjects by nicknames. For example, she has often referred to Bush as \\"W.\\" and former Vice President Dick Cheney as \\"Big Time\\". She has called former President Barack Obama \\"Spock\\" and \\"Barry\\". Dowd's interest in candidates' personalities earned her criticism early in her career: \\"She focuses too much on the person but not enough on policy.\\" Dowd, who perceives her columns to be an exploration of politics, Hollywood, and gender-related topics, often uses popular culture to support and metaphorically enhance her political commentary. In a Times video debate, she said of the North Korean government, \\"... you could look at a movie like Mean Girls and figure out the way these North Koreans are reacting; you know it's like high school girls with nuclear weapons‚Äîthey just want some attention from us, you know?\\" Dowd's columns have also been described as often being political cartoons that capture a caricatured view of the current political landscape with precision and exaggeration. For example, in the run- up to the 2000 presidential election Dowd wrote that Democratic candidate \\"Al Gore is so feminized and diversified and ecologically correct that he's practically lactating,\\" while referring to the Democratic party as the \\"mommy party\\". In a Fresh Dialogues interview years later she said, \\"I was just teasing him a little bit because he was so earnest and he could be a little righteous and self important. That's not always the most effective way to communicate your ideas, even if the ideas themselves are right. I mean, certainly his ideas were right but he himself was ‚Äì sometimes ‚Äì a pompous messenger for them.\\" In January 2014, Dowd said she ate about one-quarter of a cannabis-infused chocolate bar, while touring the legalized recreational cannabis industry. She said she was later told she should have only eaten one- sixteenth, which was not in the instructions on the label. She then described her negative experiences with legal cannabis in a June 3, 2014, The New York Times op-ed. In September 2014, Dowd followed up on this story with another New York Times op-ed, this time describing a discussion of using consumable cannabis with her \\"marijuana Miyagi\\" Willie Nelson. On March 4, 2014, Dowd published a column about the dominance of men in the film industry; in it, she quoted Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. According to BuzzFeed, \\"leaked emails from Sony\\" suggested that Dowd had promised to provide the draft column to Pascal's husband, former Times reporter Bernard Weinraub, prior to the column's publication. BuzzFeed said the column \\"painted Pascal in such a good light that she engaged in a round of mutual adulation with Dowd over email after its publication.\\" Both Dowd and Weinraub have denied that Weinraub ever received the column. On December 12, 2014, Times public editor Margaret Sullivan concluded, \\"While the tone of the email exchanges is undeniably gushy, I don't think Ms. Dowd did anything unethical here.\\" In August 2014, it was announced that Dowd would become a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine. Her first article under the new arrangement was published more than a year later. = Misogynistic portrayals of women in politics = Dowd has been accused of sexism by numerous figures, including Clark Hoyt, then-public editor of The New York Times. A 2017 study which examined sexualized shaming of Monica Lewinsky in mainstream news coverage noted that in Dowd's extensive coverage of Monica Lewinsky, she repeatedly \\"mocked and disparaged her.\\" A 2009 study of sexism towards Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin in the 2008 election noted that Dowd had disparaged Palin as a \\"Barbie\\" over her pageantry past. Numerous other commentators have criticized Dowd for having an obsession with Bill and especially Hillary Clinton.Msopine, \\"Maureen Dowd - From respected columnist to Mean Girl\\", Daily Kos, April 23, 2013.Arthur Chu, \\"Maureen Dowd vs. Hillary Clinton, MRAs and the Honey Badger Brigade: The dazzling glare of sexism and the alluring 'gender-blind' lie\\", Salon, April 24, 2015.Brennan Suen, \\"New York Times' Maureen Dowd Writes Yet Another Anti-Clinton Column\\", Media Matters, July 10, 2016. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Dowd published an article titled \\"Can Hillary Clinton Cry Herself Back to the White House?\\", which a 2016 study said \\"[serves] to reinforce the stereotype that tears and visible emotions are feminine traits and signs of weakness\\". Dowd also published a column where she likened Clinton to the \\"Terminator\\", a ruthless cyborg where \\"unless every circuit is out, she'll regenerate enough to claw her way out of the grave\\"; a 2013 study argued that portrayals such as these sought to portray Clinton and her presidential bid as improper and unnatural. According to then-public editor of The New York Times Clark Hoyt, Dowd's columns about Clinton were \\"loaded with language painting her as a 50-foot woman with a suffocating embrace, a conniving film noir dame and a victim dependent on her husband\\". A 2014 analysis by the left-leaning advocacy group Media Matters of 21 years of Maureen Dowd's columns about Hillary Clinton found that of the 195 columns by Dowd since November 1993 containing significant mentions of Clinton, 72 percent (141 columns) were negative towards Clinton. During the 2016 presidential election, Dowd penned a controversial New York Times op-ed, titled \\"Donald the Dove, Hillary the Hawk.\\" Dowd argued that Trump held dovish foreign policy beliefs, citing his purported opposition to the invasion of Iraq. However, prior to the publication of the op-ed, it had been reported that Trump did in fact support the invasion, and there were no statements on the record opposing it. Throughout Trump's presidency, critics of his foreign policy referenced the Dowd op-ed, claiming that many of the actions taken by Trump were entirely inconsistent with the narrative put forth by Dowd. In 2018, Daniel W. Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, wrote that Trump's foreign policy was clearly hawkish and stated, \\"Yes, I'm extremely angry. I have no right to ask that anyone who told you in 2016 that Trump was going to be the more dovish president should probably not talk about foreign policy for a good long while. But dear God, it would be nice.\\" Personal life Dowd formerly dated Aaron Sorkin, the creator and producer of The West Wing. She has also been briefly connected with the actor Michael Douglas and is an ex-companion of her fellow Times columnist John Tierney. Honors In 2012, NUI Galway awarded her an honorary doctorate.

Publicized as a possible resolution to the decades-long love triangle between Archie Andrews and his longtime sweethearts Betty and Veronica, Love Showdown received more publicity than any other event in Archie history. The story, written by Bill Golliher and Dan Parent, was originally published in Archie #429, Betty #19, Betty and Veronica #82, and Veronica #39. The storyline was also collected in trade paperback form, one of Archie Comics first attempts in compilation reprints. This is the arc which contributed to Cheryl Blossom's notoriety as a notable Archie Comics character, resulting in having her spun off into her own mini- series after the arc's conclusion. Plot =Chapter 1= When Betty and Jughead see Archie acting all lovesick they think Veronica got to him, but when she arrives she denies even seeing him today. They decide to investigate and discover that some girl has written a letter to him. They try to find out who it is, but the letter is blown away by the wind and after running all over Riverdale it is burned in a fire. The girls then demand Archie to tell them who wrote the letter, but he has his father take him away by telling him to clean out the garage to keep them in suspense. Later, Reggie tricks both girls that the other one wrote the letter to Archie and before he can tell them who really wrote the letter they stop him. They then end their friendship and both decide to get Archie for herself. =Chapter 2= Betty decides to get rid of all the pictures she has of her and Veronica and gives back all the clothes she borrowed. Seeing her upset, Mr. Cooper gives her two tickets to the Lodge's Foundation Summer Charity Dance next week and advises her to invite Archie. Betty calls Archie to invite him to the dance, and he accepts. She even decides to help fix his car to prove she is more handy to have around then Veronica. While working on the car, Veronica shows up for her date with Archie for the Lodge's Foundation Summer Charity Dance, and tells Betty she got tickets with the wrong date.

Upon realizing this, Betty decides to crash the dance. =Chapter 3= While dancing with Archie, Veronica learns that Betty has come to the dance and is getting a lot of attention thanks to her dress. After Betty upstages Veronica due to her dance moves, Veronica decides she has to find new ways to get Archie's attention.

Archie tells them that her family moved back to town and discover that she was the one who sent the letter to Archie. Upon having enough of Betty and Veronica's immature behavior, Archie chooses Cheryl over them. Special Although the publicity surrounding Love Showdown implied a resolution to the long-running Betty vs. Veronica dilemma, a 48-page follow-up story (Archie's Love Showdown Special) returned the love triangle to its former status quo.\\"Archie's Love Showdown Special: Did You Know?\\", archiecomics.com. =Plot= Desperate to get Archie back from Cheryl, the girls convince Ethel to disguise herself as a Pembrooke Academy student to convince her to stop seeing Archie.

Early life Jan Neruda was born in Prague, Bohemia; son of a small grocer who lived in the Mal√° Strana district. Initially, they lived on √öjezd Street and later, when he was four, moved to Ostruhov√° Street (now called , in his honor), where they owned a house known as ‚ÄúU Dvou Slunc≈Ø‚Äù (At the Two Suns). His studies began in 1845 at the local Grammar school then, in 1850, continued at the Academic Grammar School in Clementinum. His favourite writers at the time were Heine, Byron, Shakespeare, Karel Hynek M√°cha and V√°clav Bolem√≠r Nebesk√Ω. After graduation he tried to study law, but he failed. He worked as a clerk for a short time, but was unhappy, so he decided to study philosophy and philology at Charles University. He then worked as a teacher until 1860, when he became a freelance journalist and writer. He started his career at N√°rodn√≠ listy (National Sheets). Later, he worked for Obrazy ≈æivota (Pictures of Life) and ' (Time). He also contributed to ' (Blossoms) and Lum√≠r. He became the de facto leader of a generation of writers that included Karolina Svƒõtl√°, V√≠tƒõzslav H√°lek, Adolf Heyduk and Karel Sabina; devoted to continuing the legacy of Karel Hynek M√°cha. They published their works in the literary almanac M√°j. By 1871, various groups had labeled Neruda as a \\"Traitor to the Nation\\", so he decided to spend some time away; visiting Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Hungary and Egypt. He kept detailed records of these journeys, which provide an interesting testimony to his life and times, with various insights that prove him to be a good observer. From 1883 to his death he lived on Vladislavova Street, 1382/14 in Nov√© Mƒõsto, Prague. Personal life Neruda was a loner and an introvert, although he was a friend of composer Bed≈ôich Smetana. Neruda never married, but he had close relationships with Anna Holinov√° and Karol√≠na Svƒõtl√°. Holinov√° was his first love. Many of his poems were meant for her. Through her father, Neruda was able to meet Bo≈æena Nƒõmcov√° and Karel Jarom√≠r Erben, famous Czech nationalist writers. His second love was Svƒõtl√°, a married woman who was also a writer. They supported each other emotionally with their works. She also supported him financially. When he found himself deeply in debt, she sold a precious brooch and lent him the money. Unfortunately her husband, , found out about it and forced him to give up the relationship. He also had to give him all the letters they had written to each other. These letters became the source for the movie called P≈ô√≠bƒõh l√°sky a cti (The Story of Love and Honor). Throughout his life, the poet had been in material need, although he was an extremely prolific and respected journalist. Once a week, for example, he wrote a column for the National Papers, worked as a theater officer and literary critic, and edited several popular science journals. He had a close relationship with his mother. Her death in 1869 greatly affected him and brought a sadder tone to his works. Career In his work, Neruda supported the Czech National Revival and promoted Czech nationalism. He participated in all the central cultural and political struggles of his generation, and gained a reputation as a sensitive critic. Neruda became, along with V√≠tƒõzslav H√°lek, one of the most prominent representatives of the new literary trends. Death Neruda's grave. Beginning in 1880, he suffered from a swelling of his veins, which contributed to a number of diseases that afflicted him for the rest of his life. In the winter of 1888, he shattered his kneecap when he slipped on some ice. From that time on, he relied on messengers to deliver his articles to N√°rodn√≠ listy. He died on August 22, 1891, from an inflammation of his digestive tract caused by intestinal cancer. He was buried at Vy≈°ehrad Cemetery in Prague. His funeral became the occasion for an expression of Czech nationalist sentiment.  Works  = Poetry = *H≈ôbitovn√≠ kv√≠t _√≠_ (‚ÄúGraveyard Flowers‚Äù) - His first poetry. It was published in 1858. The entire book is pessimistic, skeptical and hopeless. Verses are growing out of disappointment with contemporary life, societies, the inactivity of the Nation, resistance of the set morality. There is also a social issue, dealing with poverty. He does not trust love or people. Feelings of loneliness, fervor. *Knihy ver≈°≈Ø (‚ÄúBooks of Verses‚Äù)- published in 1867. He moderates his pessimism, finds the point of his life - at work and sacrifice to the whole Nation. It shows love for his parents.This book is much more readable than other books, the poems are of good quality. Even here we find his gloomy social ballads. This book consists of three parts: 1. Kniha ver≈°≈Ø v√Ωpravn√Ωch (‚ÄúBook of Narrative Verses‚Äù), 2. Kniha ver≈°≈Ø lyrick√Ωch a sm√≠≈°en√Ωch (‚ÄúBook of Lyrical and Mixed Verses‚Äù) 3. Kniha ver≈°≈Ø ƒçasov√Ωch a p≈ô√≠le≈æitostn√Ωch (‚ÄúBook of Time and Occasional Verses‚Äù). *P√≠snƒõ kosmick√© (‚ÄúCosmic songs‚Äù) - published in 1878. In this books he is again discovering the meaning of his life, trying to be optimistic, responding to the development of science and technology. It celebrates cosmic bodies and human desire for knowledge. There is a materialistic understanding of the world. This work expresses feelings of the Generation called M√°jovci. *Balady a romance (\\"Ballads and Romances)\\" - published between 1878-1883. He confuses ballads with romances so that they often sound like the opposites. The ballads often process national themes from the Bible or old legends, and the subject of mother-son relationships appears. Some of the favourite ballads or romances are for example Romance ≈°tƒõdroveƒçern√≠ (‚ÄúChristmas Romance‚Äù), Romance o Karlu IV. (‚ÄúRomance about Charles IV.‚Äù), Balada ƒçesk√° (‚ÄúCzech Ballad‚Äù) or Balada o du≈°i K. H. Borovsk√©ho (‚ÄúBallad about the soul of K. H. Borovsk√Ω‚Äù). *Prost√© motivy (\\"Plain Themes / Simple Motifs\\") - published in 1883. This is his intimate diary. Natural theme is really important here. The human life coincides with a cycle of seasons. Spring = youth, summer = maturity, autumn = old age, winter = death. He describes this period. *Zpƒõvy p√°teƒçn√≠ (\\"Friday Songs\\") - published in 1896. This is his top work. This book came out after his death, prepared by Jaroslav Vrchlick√Ω. The life of the nation is compared to the Great Fate, showing the belief that the resurrection will come. It speaks of great love for the nation and reflects on national history - it turns to Hussitism. Parts of this book are V zemi kalichu (‚ÄúIn the country of the cup‚Äù), Andƒõl str√°≈æn√Ω (‚ÄúGuardian angel‚Äù), Ecce homo and L√°ska (‚ÄúLove‚Äù). = Prose = *Arabesky- This is his first prosaic book published in 1864. This is a set of short stories, whose core consists of stories from the late 1850s and early 1860s. In the forefront of these short stories there is no plot, but descriptive characteristics, reflection and dialogue. Significant is humor, irony, sarcasm. In the foreground there are peculiar figurines that are captured in contrast to the environment they are included in. These are people from the periphery that society has eliminated. Neruda uncovers their sad and tragic moments, presenting them as full-fledged, emotionally rich. This puts them in opposition to prejudice and a time of conventional view. Neruda uses his own experiences and familiar environments, gives readers only cuts from the lives of characters. Stories Mƒõla Gusto! and Za p≈Øl hodiny (‚ÄúWithin half an hour‚Äù) when sexual and erotic motifs appear at that time, they were added after Neruda's death. *R≈Øzn√≠ lid√© (‚ÄúDifferent People‚Äù) - Studies and pictures of the nature and fate of the people he met abroad. *Trhani- A novel about railroad workers. *Pra≈æsk√© obr√°zky (‚ÄúPictures of Prague‚Äù) - This book captures the lives of the poor. *Pov√≠dky malostr√°nsk√© (‚ÄúTales of the Lesser Quarter‚Äù) -This is his top prosaic work published in 1877. He created the picture of Prague's Lesser Quarter before 1848 on the basis of his own memories. Neruda's stories take the reader to its streets and yards, shops, churches, houses, and restaurants. It shows typical figures of Czech Bourgeoisie. With humor depicting their qualities, he criticizes local life. It uses the form of a novelistically integrated story, sometimes its narrative consists of a series of tiny shots of everyday life. Heroes are precisely characterized, each with a different expression. It was translated into English in 1957 by the novelist and mystery writer Ellis Peters. *Praha (‚ÄúPrague‚Äù) = Theatre plays = *≈Ωenich z hladu (‚ÄúGroom from hunger‚Äù) *Prodan√° l√°ska (‚ÄúSold love‚Äù) *Merenda nest≈ô√≠dm√Ωch *Francesca di Rimini *≈Ωena miluje srdnatost *J√° to nejsem (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not me‚Äù) = Feuilletons = *≈Ωerty hrav√© a drav√© (‚ÄúPlayful and predatory jokes‚Äù) *Studie kr√°tk√© a krat≈°√≠ (‚ÄúShort and shorter studies‚Äù) *Men≈°√≠ cesty (‚ÄúSmaller trips‚Äù) *Obrazy z ciziny (‚ÄúPictures from abroad‚Äù) = Journalism = *Obrazy z ciziny (‚ÄúPictures from abroad‚Äù) *Rodinn√° kronika (‚ÄúFamily chronicle‚Äù) Legacy *After his death, Ostruhov√° Street, which was the setting for many of his stories, was renamed in his honor. *The Chilean poet, Neftal√≠ Ricardo Reyes Basoalto, adopted the pseudonym Pablo Neruda, to express his admiration. *Andrew J.

The ruins consist of 23 standing Corinthian columns of the largest antebellum Greek Revival mansion ever built in the state. The mansion stood from 1861 to 1890, when it was destroyed by fire. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and was designated a Mississippi Landmark in 1985. History =Background= Windsor mansion was located on a plantation that covered . The mansion was constructed between 1859 and 1861 for Smith Coffee Daniell II, who was born in Mississippi and had acquired great wealth as a cotton planter by age 30. In 1849, Smith Daniell married his cousin Catherine Freeland (1830‚Äì1903). The couple had six children, with three surviving to adulthood. =Construction= Windsor mansion was built facing the Mississippi River and was located about east of the river. Although much of the basic construction of Windsor mansion was accomplished by those Smith Daniell enslaved, architect David Shroder supervised a crew of skilled artisans‚Äîcarpenters, plasterers, masons, and painters‚Äîfrom Mississippi, northeastern states, and Europe to do finishing work on the mansion. The footprint for Windsor mansion was set by 29 columns which supported a projected roof line that protected wide verandas on the second and third floors. The 29 columns were constructed of bricks that were covered with stucco. Each column was more than in diameter at their base and stood tall. The columns were constructed atop tall, paneled brick plinths that were almost square. Bricks were made in an onsite kiln. The fluted columns were crowned with ornate, iron Corinthian capitals, and the columns were joined at the height of the third floor by ornamental iron balustrades. Column capitals, balustrades, and four cast iron stairways were manufactured in St. Louis and shipped down the Mississippi River to the Port of Bruinsburg, about west of Windsor mansion. =Description= Windsor mansion was constructed as a three-story block, consisting of a ground floor basement, with living quarters on the second and third floors. The main block was on each side. A three-story ell projected from the east side of the main block. The ell measured by . Archeological examination suggests that outer walls were constructed of wood covered in stucco. When completed, the mansion contained three hallways and 23 to 25 rooms, each with its own fireplace. A featured innovation for that time period was the inclusion of two interior bathrooms supplied with rainwater from a tank in the attic. In 1861, cost of construction was about $175,000 (equal to $ today). The ground floor basement contained a school room, doctor's office, dairy, commissary, and storage rooms. The second floor had a hallway flanked by the master bedroom, a bathroom, two parlors, a study and a library. In the ell off the second floor was the dining room. Connected to the dining room by a dumbwaiter was the kitchen, located on the ground floor. The third floor contained an additional bath and eight more bedrooms. Eight chimneys extended from the slate-covered roof, and a domed cupola with glass walls was constructed above the attic, over the main block of the mansion. On April 12, 1861, Smith Daniell died at age 34, just weeks after construction of the mansion was completed. =Civil War era= Once the American Civil War began in 1861, Confederate forces used the Windsor mansion cupola as an observation platform and signal station. In the spring of 1863, as part of his Vicksburg campaign, Ulysses S. Grant and 17,000 Union troops landed at the port of Bruinsburg and took control of Windsor mansion. Following the Battle of Port Gibson, the mansion was used by Union troops as a hospital and as an observation station. The Daniell family was allowed to live on the third floor of the mansion during the Union occupation. Sketch of Windsor mansion (May 1, 1863) Windsor mansion survived the war and continued to be used by the Daniell family as a home and for social gatherings in the area. During Reconstruction, the family derived income by leasing part of their vast land holdings. For more than 100 years, the outward appearance of Windsor mansion was a matter of conjecture. But in the early 1990s, an 1863 sketch of Windsor mansion was discovered in the papers of a former Union officer, Henry Otis Dwight, of the 20th Ohio Infantry. Historians believe that Henry Dwight made the sketch while his unit was encamped on the grounds of the mansion. =Fire= On February 17, 1890, a fire started on the third floor when a guest dropped ashes from a cigarette or cigar into construction debris left by carpenters who were making repairs. Windsor mansion was destroyed leaving only the columns, balustrades, cast iron stairways, and pieces of bone china. Historic site Windsor Ruins in 2007 Cast iron stairway from Windsor Ruins When Catherine Daniell died in 1903, her daughter, Priscilla Daniell, inherited the mansion property. Priscilla married Joseph Magruder, and the mansion site remained in the Magruder family until 1974, when they donated , containing the mansion ruins, to the state of Mississippi. The historic site contains 23 standing columns and 5 partial columns; it is administered by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. Through the years, three of the cast iron stairways, that survived the 1890 fire, disappeared from the site. The fourth stairway was moved to Alcorn State University and serves as the entrance to Oakland Memorial Chapel. North of Windsor ruins is a cemetery where members of the Daniell and Freeland families have been buried since the early 19th century. The earliest grave is that of Frisby Freeland (1747 ‚Äì 1819), an American Revolutionary War soldier. In popular culture Windsor's ruins have appeared in two motion pictures‚ÄîRaintree County (1957) and Ghosts of Mississippi (1996).

Capt. John Yossarian is a fictional character, the protagonist of Joseph Heller's satirical 1961 novel Catch-22 and its 1994 sequel Closing Time. In Catch-22, Yossarian is a 28-year-old captain in the 256th Squadron of the Army Air Forces where he serves as a B-25 bombardier stationed on the small island of Pianosa off the Italian mainland during World War II. Yossarian's exploits have previously been thought to be based on the experiences of the author. Heller was also a bombardier in the Army Air Corps, stationed on an island off the coast of Italy during the war. Heller later documented in his autobiography \\"Now & Then\\" the elements of Yossarian which came from his experiences (specifically the episodes where Yossarian attends to Snowden during the Avignon mission). Heller noted that he derived the name Yossarian from a wartime friend and fellow bombardier, Francis Yohannan. Yohannan made the military his career, continuing to serve through the Vietnam War, placing him at odds with Yossarian's feelings towards the military and as noted in his obituary \\"(Yohannan) turned aside calls from reporters who asked if he was the real-life Yossarian.\\" A possible source for Yossarian's narrative adventure and efforts to be relieved of his combat duties is Lt. Julius Fish, another bombardier and wartime friend to both Francis Yohannan and Joseph Heller.  Name  Yossarian's first name appears to be \\"John,\\" since late in Catch-22 Colonel Korn says to him \\"Call me Blackie, John. We're pals now.\\" Catch-22 introduces Yossarian as an American soldier in World War II with Assyrian heritage, although Closing Time clarifies this to be a joke and that his heritage and surname are in fact Armenian. The exotic name \\"Yossarian\\" was chosen by Heller to emphasize his protagonist's detachment from mainstream military culture. Yossarian's name is described as \\"an odious, alien, distasteful name, that just did not inspire confidence.\\" It was \\"...not at all like such clean, crisp, honest, American names as Cathcart, Peckem and Dreedle.\\" As to the origins of the name, \\"Heller admitted in later years that the name 'Yossarian' was derived from the name of one of his Air Force buddies, Francis Yohannan ‚Äì an Assyrian ‚Äì but that the character of Yossarian himself was 'the incarnation of a wish' (Now and Then 175-6).Scoggins, Michael C.: \\"Joseph Heller‚Äôs Combat Experiences in Catch-22\\"; War, Literature and the Arts, vol. 15; pg. 223. United States Air Force Academy, 2003. (available here ) When asked how he felt about the war, Heller wrote, \\"Much differently than Yossarian felt and much differently than I felt when I wrote the novel ‚Ä¶ In truth I enjoyed it and so did just about everyone else I served with, in training and even in combat.\\"  Character sketch  = Motivation = Throughout the novel, Yossarian's main concern is the idea that people are trying to kill him, either directly (by attacking his plane) or indirectly (by forcing him to fly missions) and he goes to great lengths to stay alive. = Goals = Yossarian's motivation is to \\"live forever or die in the attempt.\\" To survive the war, Yossarian employs a number of strategems * Postponing dangerous missions by any means possible (e.g. poisoning the squadron and moving the bomb line during the \\"Great Big Siege of Bologna\\"). * Constantly checking into the hospital with contrived liver complaints (\\"a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice\\"), including the fictitious \\"Garnett-Fleischaker syndrome\\" and by exploiting the fact he always runs a temperature of 101 degrees fahrenheit (38 degrees celsius). * Ordering his pilot to perform harsh evasive action in the face of flak, something he will not trust anyone else to do. * \\"Plotting an emergency heading into Switzerland\\" so he can be interned for the duration of the war \\"under conditions of utmost ease and luxury.\\" Yossarian, like many of the other soldiers, tries to escape the realities of war by getting drunk, gorging himself in the mess hall and having sex, although events in the novel make it easy to believe he would do these things anyway. = Relationships and conflicts = Yossarian is in continual conflict with the military policy \\"Catch-22,\\" a circularly-reasoned bureaucratic trap which his superiors use to justify many of their illogical demands. The bulk of Catch-22 concerns Yossarian's relationships with the other officers in his squadron, such as the neurotic Hungry Joe, the war profiteer Milo, the idealistic Nately and selfish Doc Daneeka. There are many characters Yossarian hates and likes. His best friends are Dunbar, Chaplain Tappman, Nately, Hungry Joe, McWatt and Orr. Yossarian is greatly saddened when Clevinger and Orr disappear, despite frequently arguing with these characters. He hates the majority of his superiors for putting him in harm's way, especially the sadistic Joe McCarthy- like careerist Captain Black and the egomaniacal Colonel Cathcart, who continually raises the number of missions required before the aircrews can rotate back home as well as volunteering his aircrews for the most dangerous missions, to make himself look good to his superiors. Yossarian shows particular grief for the men that die during the novel, particularly Snowden, McWatt, Nately, Dobbs and Hungry Joe or those who disappear: Orr, Clevinger and Dunbar. While the book tells us nothing of Yossarian's relationship with Snowden, it is Yossarian's doomed attempt to save Snowden and his witnessing the latter's gruesome death that forms the emotional centre of the book. = Epiphany = At the end of the novel, Yossarian accepts a deal with Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn rather than face a court-martial for going AWOL in Rome. The deal allows Yossarian to go home but only if he pretends to be \\"pals\\" to Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn; to \\"become one of the boys.\\" Korn explains this means the Army is \\"going to glorify you and send you home a hero, recalled by the Pentagon for morale and public-relations purposes.\\" It allows Yossarian to get out of the war, without any more contribution to the low morale which has been spreading through the Group because of him and to make the colonels look good to their superiors. Yossarian finds this deal \\"odious\\" as it lets down all the others in the squadron who were relying on his dissent to force their commanders to treat them better and admits he did it \\"in a moment of weakness.\\" When he learns the \\"official report\\" had twisted the event of Nately's whore stabbing him into Yossarian taking a knife wound from a Nazi assassin to protect the colonels, Yossarian resents being manipulated as \\"part of the deal.\\" Yossarian's epiphany comes when he hears of Orr‚Äôs escape to neutral Sweden, the culmination of Orr's many attempts to escape combat duty (constantly crashing his plane, the prostitute hitting him over the head, etc.) which Yossarian had interpreted as incompetence; Orr had offered hints of this intention in exchanges between the two. Yossarian realizes it is possible to defeat (or at least escape) the military and the Catch-22 that supports it. Yossarian justifies his desertion by stating \\"I‚Äôm not running away from my responsibilities. I‚Äôm running to them. There‚Äôs nothing negative about running away to save my life.\\" In Catch-22 Throughout the book, Yossarian's main concern is the idea that people are trying to kill him, either directly (by attacking his plane) or indirectly (by forcing him to fly missions). His suspicion develops into paranoia after his attempts to find answers by using logic and reason are thwarted by a combination of vague bureaucracy, transparent yet contradicting Army regulations and personality conflicts. He is unable to fly the required number of missions to be discharged from duty, because his superiors keep increasing the number of missions. He cannot obtain a Section 8 by pretending to be insane because his superiors see his desire to get out of flying as a sign of perfect sanity (hence Catch-22). Yossarian boycotts flying missions as much as possible, either through feigning illness or inventing an excuse to return to base (like a busted intercom.) The novel begins with Yossarian staying in the hospital due to an invented liver condition. He busies himself by arbitrarily censoring letters and signing them Washington Irving, Irving Washington, or (as gets the Chaplain into trouble with authorities) A. T. Tappman, the Chaplain's name (R. O. Shipman in the original version of the book and in British Editions). Whenever on leave, Yossarian and his friends carouse, drink, and sleep around as much as they can, knowing and fearing they could be killed on the next mission. One of the prostitutes they employ becomes Nately's unofficial girlfriend (she is referred to only as \\"Nately's Whore\\" and \\"Nately's Girl\\"). Despite Nately's repeated advances, she spurns him cruelly until he, instead of sleeping with her, lets her get a good night's sleep. By the next morning she has fallen deeply in love with him. When Nately is killed, she blames Yossarian for his death; she manifests a towering rage and tries to kill Yossarian several times during the remainder of the narrative in an impossible manner (constantly tracking Yossarian down, even after he dumped her hundreds of miles behind enemy territory.) =Yossarian's tentmates= The squadron houses its soldiers in large tents. At the start of the novel Yossarian is assigned to a tent with Orr and a third officer referred to as \\"The Dead Man in Yossarian's Tent\\"Lt. Muddwho was sent on a mission immediately upon his arrival and died in combat before he ever even got the official chance to check in. His belongings remain on the bed where he threw them; due to the illogical bureaucratic procedures the armed forces are shown to follow, the belongings cannot be officially removed since Mudd had never officially arrived. Yossarian and Orr get along well and Orr customizes the tent making it much more comfortable. After Orr is declared M.I.A. and presumed dead, four new officers are assigned to the tent but Yossarian cannot tolerate them. Sergeant Towser offers Yossarian the option of being assigned to the same tent as Nately but he refuses to leave. The new tentmates call Yossarian \\"Yo-Yo\\" and are afraid of him and go out of their way to help him, always offering him the warmest expressions of goodwill and generally behaving with intolerable conviviality. They are rambunctious because of their young age and lack of military experience. They tend to like those whom Yossarian hates and fears and do not mind the increasing number of missions. They do what Yossarian and the Air Force were unable to doget rid of The Dead Man in Yossarian's Tentby throwing his belongings into the woods. = Snowden = Snowden is a member of Yossarian's flight during a mission and acts as catalyst for the fundamental change in Yossarian's mentality and outlook. After their aircraft is hit by anti-aircraft fire, Snowden is mortally wounded and Yossarian attempts to help by treating a serious leg wound with white bandages and sulfanilamide powder. Eventually Yossarian notices bleeding from Snowden's armpit and realises he has another wound under his flak suit. As Yossarian rips open the flak suit, a fatal wound beneath exposes Snowden's internal organs which fall out onto the floor. A huge chunk of flak had ripped straight through his ribs from behind. Yossarian is horrified at the sight. Snowden is about to die but is able to tell Yossarian he is cold. Yossarian covers Snowden in a parachute and comforts him by saying \\"there, there.\\" Snowden's death embodies Yossarian's desire to evade death; by seeing Snowden's entrails spilling over the plane, he feels that \\"Man was matter, that was Snowden‚Äôs secret. Drop him out a window and he‚Äôll fall. Set fire to him and he‚Äôll burn. Bury him and he‚Äôll rot, like other kinds of garbage. That was Snowden‚Äôs secret. Ripeness was all.\\" The experience on the plane dramatically changes Yossarian's attitude towards life. He looks only to protect his life and to an extent the lives of his friends. Yossarian turns against the military and refuses to wear a uniform, his justification being he simply \\"doesn't want to,\\" perhaps because he was traumatized and depressed by Snowden's death. The excuse Captain Korn gives to General Dreedle is that Snowden died in one uniform and his remains had soaked into Yossarian's, and all of Yossarian's other articles of clothing were in the laundry. General Dreedle says \\"That sounds like a lot of crap to me.\\" Yossarian replies, \\"It is a lot of crap, sir.\\" = Finale = By the end of the book, just about every other member of his squadron has been killed, disappeared, gone AWOL, or otherwise removed. When Yossarian learns from Captain Black that Nately's Whore's kid sister has been evicted by the Military Police, he flies with Milo to Rome, AWOL, to try to save her. He can't find her and ends up walking through the street observing all the horrors that come with war. He gets back to the officers' apartment, where Aarfy has raped and murdered Michaela. When the MPs finally come, they do not arrest Aarfy and instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL. Yossarian is forced by Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn into an odious deal whereby if he acts as their \\"pal\\" he will be allowed to go home. The deal is designed so the rest of the squadron will not believe Yossarian will be sent home because he has \\"turned into such a stubborn son of a bitch\\" and refused to fly but because ‚Äì being a hero from the Ferrara mission in which he went into the flak zones a second time without support ‚Äì he is being sent home as a P.R. representative for the Army. On leaving the colonels, Yossarian is badly injured when Nately's whore stabs him and he is rushed to hospital where he recovers and is visited by the Chaplain and Major Danby., who confirms the deal with the colonels is still on but Yossarian wishes not to take it as it lets the rest of the squadron down. While Yossarian is trying to work out how to escape this Catch-22, the Chaplain runs in to announce the missing Orr is alive and well and has rowed his way to neutral Sweden, escaping the war. This gives a new lease on life to the Chaplain, Major Danby and more so to Yossarian who now sees the genius of Orr's plans and makes him determined to escape the war. As Yossarian leaves, Nately's whore again tries to kill him but Yossarian jumps out of the way and runs off. Closing Time hints the idealistic escape did not occur, with Yossarian saying that when he went home, he was made a major. While Korn and Cathcart are not mentioned, there are implications that perhaps Yossarian took their deal in the end. This reflects more the character of the older Yossarian, who by his late sixties has become a part of the society he spurned in his youth. Film portrayal In Mike Nichols' 1970 film adaptation of the novel Yossarian was played by Alan Arkin, while in the 1973 television series pilot Catch-22, based on the novel and the 1970 film, he was played by Richard Dreyfuss. Christopher Abbot plays Yossarian in George Clooney's 2019 mini- series for Hulu. The miniseries portrays Yossarian with his desire to leave the war intact, but stooping to various lows that harm his fellow soldiers as well as some of his superiors. He has no qualms meeting Cathcart's demands when offered the chance to permanently leave the war and it is only Scheisskopf's intervention that forces him to stay. The ending has him resigning himself to his missions, albeit without clothes.

Some species have specialised calcified \\"clubs\\" that can strike with great power, while others have sharp forelimbs used to capture prey. They branched from other members of the class Malacostraca around 340 million years ago. Mantis shrimps typically grow to around in length. A few can reach up to . The largest mantis shrimp ever caught had a length of ; it was caught in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida, in the United States. A mantis shrimp's carapace (the bony, thick shell that covers crustaceans and some other species) covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. Varieties range in color from shades of brown to vivid colors, with more than 450 species of mantis shrimps being known. They are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood, as many species spend most of their lives tucked away in burrows and holes. Called \\"sea locusts\\" by ancient Assyrians, \\"prawn killers\\" in Australia,\\"Mantis shrimps\\", Queensland Museum and now sometimes referred to as \\"thumb splitters\\"‚Äîbecause of the animal's ability to inflict painful gashes if handled incautiously‚Äîmantis shrimps have powerful claws that are used to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning, or dismembering. Ecology Around 451 species of mantis shrimps have currently been discovered worldwide; all living species are in the suborder Unipeltata which arose around 193 million years ago. These aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea bed. They rarely exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, nocturnal, or active primarily at twilight, depending on the species. Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey. Although some live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and subtropical waters in the Indian and Pacific Oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii. Habitat Mantis shrimp live in burrows where they spend the majority of their time. The two different categories of mantis shrimp ‚Äì spearing and smashing ‚Äì favor different locations for burrowing. The spearing species build their habitat in soft sediments and the smashing species make burrows in hard substrata or coral cavities. These two habitats are crucial for their ecology since they use burrows as sites for retreat and as locations for consuming their prey. Burrows and coral cavities are also used as sites for mating and for keeping their eggs safe.Stomatopod body size undergoes periodic growth which necessitates finding a new cavity or burrow that will fit the animal's new diameter. Some spearing species can modify their pre-established habitat if the burrow is made of silt or mud, which can be expanded. Claws Squilla mantis, showing the spearing appendages Mantis shrimp from the front The mantis shrimp's second pair of thoracic appendages has been highly adapted for powerful close-range combat. The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised club-like appendage. A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust, hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three subregions: the impact region, the periodic region, and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type of claws they possess: *Smashers possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims. *Spearers are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey. Both types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their raptorial claws at the prey, and can inflict serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400 g (102,000 m/s2 or 335,000 ft/s2) and speeds of from a standing start. Because they strike so rapidly, they generate vapor-filled bubbles in the water between the appendage and the striking surface‚Äîknown as cavitation bubbles. The collapse of these cavitation bubbles produces measurable forces on their prey in addition to the instantaneous forces of 1,500 newtons that are caused by the impact of the appendage against the striking surface, which means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike; first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow. Even if the initial strike misses the prey, the resulting shock wave can be enough to stun or kill. Smashers use this ability to attack snails, crabs, molluscs, and rock oysters, their blunt clubs enabling them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. Spearers, however, prefer the meat of softer animals, such as fish, which their barbed claws can more easily slice and snag. The appendages are being studied as a microscale analogue for new macroscale material structures. Eyes The front of Lysiosquillina maculata, showing the stalked eyes The eyes of the mantis shrimp are mounted on mobile stalks and can move independently of each other. They are thought to have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and have the most complex visual system ever discovered. Compared to the three types of photoreceptor cells that humans possess in their eyes, the eyes of a mantis shrimp have between 12 and 16 types of photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, some of these shrimp can tune the sensitivity of their long-wavelength colour vision to adapt to their environment. This phenomenon, called \\"spectral tuning\\", is species-specific. Cheroske et al. did not observe spectral tuning in Neogonodactylus oerstedii, the species with the most monotonous natural photic environment. In N. bredini, a species with a variety of habitats ranging from a depth of 5 to 10 m (although it can be found down to 20 m below the surface), spectral tuning was observed, but the ability to alter wavelengths of maximum absorbance was not as pronounced as in N. wennerae, a species with much higher ecological/photic habitat diversity. The diversity of spectral tuning in Stomatopoda is also hypothesized to be directly linked to mutations on the opsin gene's chromophore binding pocket. Despite the impressive range of wavelengths that mantis shrimp have the ability to see, they do not have the ability to discriminate wavelengths less than 25 nm apart. It is suggested that not discriminating between closely positioned wavelengths allows these organisms to make determinations of its surroundings with little processing delay. Having little delay in evaluating surroundings is important for Mantis shrimp since they are territorial and frequently in combat. Closeup of a mantis shrimp showing the structure of the eyes Each compound eye is made up of tens of thousands of ommatidia, clusters of photoreceptor cells. Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the midband. The number of omatidial rows in the midband ranges from two to six. This divides the eye into three regions. This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye. In other words, each eye possesses trinocular vision and therefore depth perception. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of form and motion, like the eyes of many other crustaceans. Mantis shrimp can perceive wavelengths of light ranging from deep ultraviolet (UVB) to far-red (300 to 720 nm) and polarized light. In mantis shrimp in the superfamilies Gonodactyloidea, Lysiosquilloidea, and Hemisquilloidea, the midband is made up of six omatodial rows. Rows 1 to 4 process colours, while rows 5 and 6 detect circularly or linearly polarized light. Twelve types of photoreceptor cells are in rows 1 to 4, four of which detect ultraviolet light. Rows 1 to 4 of the midband are specialised for colour vision, from deep ultraviolet to far red. Their UV vision can detect five different frequency bands in the deep ultraviolet. To do this, they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different colour filters.Mantis shrimp wear tinted shades to see UV light. Latimes.com (2014-07-05). Retrieved on 2015-10-21. They are not currently believed to be sensitive to infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich - a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum, about 490 to 550 nm. Rows 5 and 6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment, the ninth class, and are specialised for polarization vision. Depending upon the species, they can detect circularly polarized light, linearly polarised light, or both. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye. Some species have at least 16 photoreceptor types, which are divided into four classes (their spectral sensitivity is further tuned by colour filters in the retinas), 12 for colour analysis in the different wavelengths (including six which are sensitive to ultraviolet light) and four for analysing polarised light. By comparison, most humans have only four visual pigments, of which three are dedicated to see colour, and human lenses block ultraviolet light. The visual information leaving the retina seems to be processed into numerous parallel data streams leading into the brain, greatly reducing the analytical requirements at higher levels. Six species of mantis shrimp have been reported to be able to detect circularly polarized light, which has not been documented in any other animal, and whether it is present across all species is unknown. Some of their biological quarter-waveplates perform more uniformly over the visual spectrum than any current man-made polarising optics, and this could inspire new types of optical media that would outperform the current generation of Blu-ray Disc technology. The species Gonodactylus smithii is the only organism known to simultaneously detect the four linear and two circular polarisation components required to measure all four Stokes parameters, which yield a full description of polarisation. It is thus believed to have optimal polarisation vision. It is the only animal known to have dynamic polarisation vision. This is achieved by rotational eye movements to maximise the polarisation contrast between the object in focus and its background. Since each eye moves independently from the other, it creates two separate streams of visual information. The midband covers only about 5 to 10¬∞ of the visual field at any given instant, but like most crustaceans, mantis shrimps' eyes are mounted on stalks. In mantis shrimps, the movement of the stalked eye is unusually free, and can be driven up to 70¬∞ in all possible axes of movement by eight eyecup muscles divided into six functional groups. By using these muscles to scan the surroundings with the midband, they can add information about forms, shapes, and landscape, which cannot be detected by the upper and lower hemispheres of the eyes. They can also track moving objects using large, rapid eye movements where the two eyes move independently. By combining different techniques, including movements in the same direction, the midband can cover a very wide range of the visual field. The huge diversity seen in mantis shrimp photoreceptors likely comes from ancient gene duplication events. One interesting consequence of this duplication is the lack of correlation between opsin transcript number and physiologically expressed photoreceptors. One species may have six different opsin genes, but only express one spectrally distinct photoreceptor. Over the years, some mantis shrimp species have lost the ancestral phenotype, although some still maintain 16 distinct photoreceptors and four light filters. Species that live in a variety of photic environments have high selective pressure for photoreceptor diversity, and maintain ancestral phenotypes better than species that live in murky waters or are primarily nocturnal. =Suggested advantages of visual system= Close-up of the trinocular vision of Pseudosquilla ciliata What advantage sensitivity to polarisation confers is unclear; however, polarisation vision is used by other animals for sexual signaling and secret communication that avoids the attention of predators. This mechanism could provide an evolutionary advantage; it only requires small changes to the cell in the eye and could be easily lead to natural selection. The eyes of mantis shrimps may enable them to recognise different types of coral, prey species (which are often transparent or semitransparent), or predators, such as barracuda, which have shimmering scales. Alternatively, the manner in which they hunt (very rapid movements of the claws) may require very accurate ranging information, which would require accurate depth perception. During mating rituals, mantis shrimps actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments. Females are only fertile during certain phases of the tidal cycle; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may, therefore, help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give these shrimps information about the size of the tide, which is important to species living in shallow water near the shore. The capacity to see UV light may enable observation of otherwise hard-to- detect prey on coral reefs. Their visual experience of colours is not very different from humans; the eyes are actually a mechanism that operates at the level of individual cones and makes the brain more efficient. This system allows visual information to be preprocessed by the eyes instead of the brain, which would otherwise have to be larger to deal with the stream of raw data, thus requiring more time and energy. While the eyes themselves are complex and not yet fully understood, the principle of the system appears to be simple. It is similar in function to the human eye, but works in the opposite manner. In the human brain, the inferior temporal cortex has a huge number of colour- specific neurons, which process visual impulses from the eyes to create colourful experiences. The mantis shrimp instead uses the different types of photoreceptors in its eyes to perform the same function as the human brain neurons, resulting in a hardwired and more efficient system for an animal that requires rapid colour identification. Humans have fewer types of photoreceptors, but more colour-tuned neurons, while mantis shrimps appears to have fewer colour neurons and more classes of photoreceptors. A publication by researchers from the University of Queensland stated that the compound eyes of mantis shrimp can detect cancer and the activity of neurons, because they are sensitive to detecting polarised light that reflects differently from cancerous and healthy tissue. The study claims that this ability can be replicated through a camera through the use of aluminium nanowires to replicate polarisation-filtering microvilli on top of photodiodes. In February 2016, the shrimps were found to be using a form of reflector of polarised light not seen in nature or human technology before. It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and microscopically thin, and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.New type of optical material discovered in the secret language of the mantis shrimp. Bristol University ( 17 February 2016) Behaviour Drawing of a mantis shrimp by Richard Lydekker, 1896 Mantis shrimps are long-lived and exhibit complex behaviour, such as ritualised fighting. Some species use fluorescent patterns on their bodies for signalling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. They can learn and remember well, and are able to recognise individual neighbours with which they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed complex social behaviours to defend their space from rivals. In a lifetime, they can have as many as 20 or 30 breeding episodes. Depending on the species, the eggs can be laid and kept in a burrow, or they can be carried around under the female's tail until they hatch. Also depending on the species, males and females may come together only to mate, or they may bond in monogamous, long-term relationships. In the monogamous species, the mantis shrimps remain with the same partner up to 20 years. They share the same burrow and may be able to coordinate their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (bi parental care). In Pullosquilla and some species in Nannosquilla, the female lays two clutches of eggs - one that the male tends and one that the female tends. In other species, the female looks after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as plankton. Although stomatopods typically display the standard types of movement seen in true shrimp and lobsters, one species, Nannosquilla decemspinosa, has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, N. decemspinosa is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for movement when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. N. has been observed to roll repeatedly for , but specimens typically travel less than . Culinary uses H·∫≠u L·ªôc, Thanh H√≥a, Vietnam In Japanese cuisine, the mantis shrimp species Oratosquilla oratoria, called , is eaten boiled as a sushi topping, and occasionally raw as sashimi. Mantis shrimps are abundant along Vietnam's coast, known in Vietnamese as b·ªÅ b·ªÅ or t√¥m t√≠t. In regions such as Nha Trang, they are called b√†n ch·∫£i, named for its resemblance to a scrub brush. The shrimp can be steamed, boiled, grilled, or dried, used with pepper, salt and lime, fish sauce and tamarind, or fennel. In Cantonese cuisine, the mantis shrimp is known as \\"pissing shrimp\\" () because of their tendency to shoot a jet of water when picked up. After cooking, their flesh is closer to that of lobsters than that of shrimp, and like lobsters, their shells are quite hard and require some pressure to crack. Usually, they are deep fried with garlic and chili peppers. In the Mediterranean countries, the mantis shrimp Squilla mantis is a common seafood, especially on the Adriatic coasts (canocchia) and the Gulf of C√°diz (galera). In the Philippines, the mantis shrimp is known as tatampal, hipong-dapa, pitik-pitik, or alupihang-dagat, and is cooked and eaten like any other shrimp. In Hawaii, some mantis shrimp have grown unusually large in the contaminated water of the Grand Ala Wai Canal in Waikiki. The dangers normally associated with consuming seafood caught in contaminated waters are present in these mantis shrimp. Aquaria Some saltwater aquarists keep stomatopods in captivity.A Load of Learnin' About Mantis Shrimps, by James Fatherree, in ReefKeeping online magazine. The peacock mantis is especially colourful and desired in the trade. While some aquarists value mantis shrimps, others consider them harmful pests, because: *They are voracious predators, eating other desirable inhabitants of the tank. *Some rock-burrowing species can do more damage to live rock than the fishkeeper would prefer. The live rock with mantis shrimp burrows are actually considered useful by some in the marine aquarium trade and are often collected. A piece of live rock not uncommonly conveys a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, it may feed on fish and other inhabitants, and is notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank, While there are accounts of this shrimp breaking glass tanks, they are rare and are usually the result of the shrimp being kept in too small of a tank. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it if they try to make a home within it.

Schlosser is an artist, cartoonist, comedian, journalist, musician, poet, singer, and songwriter based in Madison, Wisconsin. He plays humorous novelty, gospel, and political songs and draws cartoons currently for the Madison Street Pulse newspaper, where he also submits poems and interviews people. Schlosser also paints and has participated in various art projects. Schlosser was named Arthur after his father and grandfather but his grandfather might have originally been named Otto but because of his German accent when he said his name they thought he said Arthur.  Childhood  Schlosser was born in Chicago and grew up listening to novelty musicians like Allen Sherman and Tiny Tim, as well as funny songs by The Beatles and The Monkees. When Art was 11, he, his mother, and his sisters moved to Madison, Wisconsin after his parents got a divorce. As a child in Madison, his mother continued to play weird and funny songs for him, sometimes playing strange sound effects on one recorded player to go with the songs. As a teenager, Art Paul joined a work experience play group that encouraged Art to be creative. In this group, there were a couple of fans of The Beatles, one of whom encouraged Art Paul to write lyrics. It was from that time on that Art started to write. Art would listen to the Dr Demento radio show as well as other strange records that he discovered at the local library, and then try to write some lyrics he was inspired to write after listening to the songs. Also as a child he was encouraged to draw cartoons by his sister Mary.  State Street  Upon discovering that it is legal to busk on State Street, Art Paul tried it out on a warm day late in February 1986 and received a couple of dollars for his effort. Since then Art Paul has been a street musician and busker as well as an outsider artist on State Street in Madison, Wisconsin. He usually performs his original songs or parodies on an acoustic guitar and kazoo. He also sometimes plays electronic keyboard or ukulele. He is best known for his funny music, especially \\"Have A Peanut Butter Sandwich\\", which made the Funny Five of the Dr Demento radio show four times in 2001 and Vote for Me/It's a Joke which was on the Funny Five of the Dr Demento radio in 2003. While he sings mostly humorous songs, Art Paul has also written on the topics of politics and religion. In 2007, Art Paul Schlosser received a Madison Area Music Award (MAMA) for best compilation for his CD Art Paul Schlosser. In 2009, he won two more Madison Area Music Awards for Unique Song (\\"Have A Peanut Butter Sandwich,\\" the remix version, which was remixed by Animalien) and for Unique Album (Leftovers).  Appearances  Art Paul's music has been played on oddball radio programs, including Greasy Kid Stuff, The Mad Music Hour, Dave's Gone By and the Dr. Demento Show, and he has appeared on his own public-access television show as well as WGN-TV news. * On April 1, 1994, Schlosser perform with Horace Pinker and Jawbreaker (band) at the Beloit Sports Arena * On July 30, 2009, Stephen Colbert mentioned Schlosser on the Colbert Report in order to emphasize that any artist can get their songs on iTunes, no matter what the quality of their work may be.{host.madison.com/entertainment/music/stephen-colbert-tips-his-hat-to-art- paul-schlosser/article_2a011b25-acd2-5abd-ac1e-37a843c38447.html} * On June 27, 2010, Schlosser appeared on the internet radio show The Bastard Den on Infernal Rock Radio at www.infernalrockradio.com.

Pigs race down the track. Pig racing is a sport in which juvenile pigs race around in a small, enclosed area of either dirt, fake grass, gravel track or steel-framed enclosures. This racing is usually purely for entertainment or charity, and betting is rarely part of it, as the races are family-friendly events. It is often an attraction at county fairs but is also practised in many backyard setups. Pig racing can be found in Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  Equipment  The pigs are equipped with vests to differentiate each pig from another. To distinguish the pigs racing, the vests are either colour-coded or have numbers on them. Puppet jockeys are sometimes attached to the vests for entertainment purposes. The course includes a variety of obstacles which the pigs have to race through, such as tunnels, tyre ramps, hay bales and a series of locked gates. The course distance can vary in length depending on the type of race. The race can be a normal race on the track or a race with obstacles. Most races at the end of the finishing line have a prize waiting for the winning pig, usually food.  Countries  = Australia = Pig racing is practised in Australia. The MTV Promotions Pig Racing hosts pig racing events which cover all Major Royal Shows and have been running since 1993. The pigs are trained through a 4-week course to prepare them mentally and physically for the race. The pigs run a track in a space and there are two races within the 15-minute show production. The pigs get ready at the starting gates while their coloured vests are fitted on them and they wait for the whistle to be blown before they start to race. Noah's Farm Thoroughbred Pig Racing hosts pig races for entertainment purposes and fundraisers for organisations. The pigs are raised in free-range conditions and begin training for races when they are approximately 5 to 6 weeks of age. For the race, five pigs are pitted against each other wearing coloured jackets. The track dimensions are , and 15 to 20 small square bales of hay are used as obstacles. The race begins with a bugle call as the pigs begin to position themselves in their starting box and wait for the commencement of the race. The crowd counts down from five and then the starting gate opens once the count is finished. On the course, the pigs face tyres, gates and a maze of hay bales. The pigs start to race when they are around 4 weeks old an after being weaned, they continue racing until they are around 12 to 15 weeks old. For each race, a \\"Race Steward\\" is picked from the crowd to oversee the pig race. Children are allowed to name each pig, and the best name wins a prize. The 2003 Easter Show in Melbourne held a pig racing event in Olympic Boulevard. The race featured nine pigs racing around a track. =Ireland= The festival in Portlaoise is known for pig-racing, and it has also been tried in Durrow for their St. Patrick's day parade in 2009. =United Kingdom= Pig racing is practised in the United Kingdom. The South of England Rare Breeds Centre holds regular pig races in the summer. Natasha Raskin has also commented that Hall Park in Oswestry is also famous for pig racing. Piglet racing has become popular at the Royal Norfolk Show, which has a course of about with three jumps with various breeds participating. A proposal by the Winchester Cheese and Chilli Festival in August 2018 to stage a steeplechase for six rare-breed pigs over hurdles was abandoned after a campaign group, \\"Pigs Don't Race\\", got 46,873 signatures in an online campaign. The charity Animal Aid was quoted as noting \\"to run in front of potentially loud crowds in scorching heat...caused these sensitive animals undue stress, in addition to the distress and heat produced through transportation\\". The organisers said they withdrew the event due to continued hot temperatures and after consultations with relevant parties. Joseph's Amazing Racing Pigs has five different breeds of pigs for racing: Tamworths, Gloucester Old Spots, Saddlebacks, Berkshires, and Oxford Sandy and Blacks. The track dimensions are of roped off grass area for the track and a display area for the pigs to interact with the audience. The pigs are encouraged to race down the track by the handlers, who shake a bucket of food for the pigs. The pigs are weaned for approximately 10 to 12 weeks and are raised naturally and are not given growth hormones or antibiotics. Once the pigs become too big to race, they are returned to where they came from and new sets of pigs replace them. Pennywell Farm in South Devon, England holds pig races every day. They use specially-bred pigs called miniature pigs, which they started breeding in 1992. The average pig weighs at birth. =United States= A pig race in the United States. Pig racing is most popular in the Southern United States. The city of Charlotte, North Carolina will occasionally host pig races before other sporting events. The annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo bills itself as the largest in the world, and the second-largest fair or festival of any kind in North America. Besides the pro rodeo events and livestock exhibitions, pig racing is featured. The minor league baseball team the St. Paul Saints hosts pig races at their stadium during select home games. The newest pig-racing show travelling the United States is called Hot Dog Pig Races, which includes pig racing and dachshunds. You can find them at fairs and festivals such as Meadowlands State Fair, New Jersey; Ocean County Fair, New Jersey; Dundalk Heritage Festival, Maryland; and the Pig Gig Bay City, Michigan. All-Alaskan Racing Pigs, Sue Wee Pigs and Ugly Pig Racing are other shows travelling the United States. The Bear Creek Saloon and Steakhouse in Bear Creek, Montana, has hosted pig races during the summer season since 1992.Bear Creek Saloon - Bearcreek. VirtualMontana. 18 March 2009. The All- Alaskan Racing Pig hosts pig racing events in the northwest United States with pigs racing on a dash course and hurdle course. During every show, two teams of four pigs race on flat tracks and high hurdles. At the end of each show, there is a championship round. The race is mainly for entertainment purposes, as it is only for 'pure fun'. They use Gloucestershire Old Spots to race and begin training when they are about 10 weeks old. They travel with 10 pigs, eight for daily races and two spares. The pigs race four times a day. Bob Hale Racing Stables holds pig races at the Michigan State Fair in which 19 pigs race in seven free daily shows. The pigs race around a oval track with bars as obstacles to jump over. The pigs are trained and take four 8-hour days to complete a lap. The pigs run from the starting line to the paddock, where there is food. Once they finish eating the food, the pigs are put back on the starting line and the food on the paddock is replenished. They run to get the food again. The pigs are checked by vets if any of them catch a disease after a carnival or event. Vogel's Pig Racing hosts pig racing events at many state fairs. The pigs are three months old and race around a series of red pens set up like a circular racetrack. The pigs can be trained to run in three days. The pigs are split into three divisions: men's, women's and Nascar at the South Dakota State Fair in Huron. Three pigs compete in each division, weighing around each. At the end of the finish line, there would be an Oreo waiting for the pig who crosses the finish line first. Leader Area Pig Races hosts county fairs, special events, and benefits from Memorial Day to Labour Day. They use five pigs at a time to race on a circular track. The pigs are named after a person in the crowd, and the prizes won by the winning pig are awarded to both the pig and the person from the crowd. Originally it was supposed to be a gambling/betting race, but the state of Minnesota wouldn't allow gambling on pigs, so it became a family-friendly event. It takes two weeks to train the pigs for racing. The first week of training is teaching the pigs to run around the track by bribing them with doughnuts at the finish line. The second week is devoted to getting the pigs used to large crowds. The Swifty Swine Productions showcases pig racing events at the Franklin County Show located in Greenfield, Ohio. The pig race is held at the 'Pork Chop International Speedway' track course featuring two races, one with baby pigs and the other with full-grown pigs. Both piglets and full-grown pigs are given names spun off of celebrities' names, such as Brad Pig, Kevin Bacon, Justin Beiboar and Elvis Pigsley. Once the gate opens, the pigs race around a track, competing for an Oreo cookie on a silver plate at the end of the finish line. The races are held on Saturdays and Sundays. After each race, the pigs return to their trailer to take a nap and wait for the next race. However, if they do not return to the trailer, they stay behind to take photos with the public. The races are sponsored by the Greenfield Farmers Cooperative Exchange. The PigTuckey Derby is a pig race held in Denver Down Farm every fall. The Bengston's Pumpkin Farm and Fall Fast often holds pig races. The pigs wear a coloured, numbered bib when racing around the track. International Pig racing also occurs in the Pig Olympics. 12 pigs participate in the race from seven countries with each pig wearing a numbered bib. Betting occurs in the Pig Olympics. After the pigs participate in the Pig Olympics, 'they go on to produce a new generation of sport pigs'.  Controversy  There are some controversies with pig racing, as many see it as a cruel sport. Many people protest to have pig racing events cancelled. One animal rights activist started an online petition to stop the pig racing event in the Arklow Seabreeze Festival held in Wicklow, Ireland, from happening, which was signed by over 2,400 people. The pigs race in an hour-long event, running the course five times for a total distance of around . The festival committee was quoted as saying \\"the welfare of the pigs is of utmost concern and important to us...a pig handler is also present to ensure no harm or cruelty is inflicted on any of his pigs\\". The race still went ahead as the festival committee defended the event by saying that many other Irish festivals hold pig races. Another case was seen at the Paddington Tavern in Brisbane, Australia, where animal rights activists protested and called to have the pig racing event cancelled. However, the event had the support of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). The Comet Pub in Santry's hosts pig races at the Comet 4th of July Festival in Dublin, Ireland. The pig race is the main event of the festival, and all money raised is donated to two charities. In 2018, the pig racing event gained the public's awareness, which resulted in protests to cancel the event. This was due to the heat on the day of the race, which was , as the public had concerns for the well-being of the pigs racing under the heat. For the event, the pub was supported by the Gardai, the Dublin City Council, and the Dublin Fire Brigade. A vet from the Department of Agriculture agreed to supervise the race to ensure that the pigs were okay. The pigs wore puppet jockeys on their back, and during the race, they ran down a ramp and up to the pub while jumping over hurdles. Six pigs participated in the race. Protesters claimed that it was cruel for the pigs to be put on a noisy track with the sun on their skin. In response, the pub noted that \\"It's done in fun, it's not done in a dangerous way\\".

He is believed to have been in charge of many decisions that were supposed to be the emperor's responsibility during Emperor Xuanzong's later years, and was believed to have been richer than many of the nobility of the era. Despite this, however, he was often viewed as a positive example of eunuch participation in politics for his personal loyalty to Emperor Xuanzong, which withstood despite its putting himself in personal danger later, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong (when Emperor Xuanzong was Taishang Huang (retired emperor)) as it drew jealousy from fellow eunuch Li Fuguo. Further, during the years of his highest power, he was also said to make no improper influences on governance, and therefore drew no anger from the intelligentsia. Late in Emperor Suzong's reign, he was exiled upon Li Fuguo's urging. After a pardon in 762, he was returning from exile, when he heard of Emperors Xuanzong's and Suzong's deaths. Mourning Emperor Xuanzong bitterly, he grew ill and died.  Background  Gao Lishi was born in 684, when Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) was successively regent over her sons Emperor Zhongzong (Li Zhe/Li Xian) and Emperor Ruizong (Li Dan). He was from Pan Prefecture (ÊΩòÂ∑û, roughly modern Maoming, Guangdong). His original family name was Feng (È¶Æ), and he was reportedly a great-grandson of the early Tang local government official Feng Ang (È¶ÆÁõé). In 698, a local official, Li Qianli (ÊùéÂçÉÈáå), submitted two young eunuchs to Wu Zetian, who had by that point taken the throne as Empress regnant as tribute; one was Lishi (who had not yet taken the name of Gao at this point), and one was named Jin'gang (ÈáëÂâõ). Wu Zetian favored Lishi for his intelligence and kept him as an attending eunuch. Later, however, Lishi committed a minor fault, and she had him battered and expelled from her presence. An older eunuch, Gao Yanfu (È´òÂª∂Á¶è), took Lishi as an adoptive son (and thus had Lishi take his own name of Gao), and as Gao Yanfu had previously served Wu Zetian's powerful nephew Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang, he had Gao Lishi serve Wu Sansi. After about a year, Wu Zetian summoned him back to her palace, and he again attended her. He eventually grew to be exceedingly tall. As he was careful, he was put in charge of announcing imperial edicts, and was eventually promoted to be Gongwei Cheng (ÂÆÆÈóà‰∏û), a highly ranked eunuch. During the subsequent return to the throne by Emperor Zhongzong, Gao Lishi cultivated a friendship with Emperor Zhongzong's nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi, the son of Li Dan the Prince of Xiang (Emperor Zhongzong's brother and former emperor). In 705, after Emperor Zhongzong's sudden death, Li Longji and Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping overthrew Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei and returned Li Dan to the throne. Li Longji was created crown prince, and he retained Gao on his staff.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  In 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong. However, Emperor Ruizong retained most of the imperial authority as Taishang Huang (retired emperor), and Princess Taiping, through him, continued to exert great influence on governance. As of 713, it was said that five of the seven chancellors at the time -- Dou Huaizhen, Cen Xi, Xiao Zhizhong, Cui Shi, and Lu Xiangxian‚Äîwere recommended by her (although Lu was not considered a follower of hers). With Emperor Xuanzong and Princess Taiping locked into a power struggle, Zhang Shuo, from his post at Luoyang, had a messenger present Emperor Xuanzong with his swordZizhi Tongjian, vol. 210.‚Äîmeaning to tell him that it was time to take decisive action. Meanwhile, it was said that Princess Taiping, Dou, Cen, Xiao, and Cui; along with other officials Xue Ji, Li Jin (ÊùéÊôâ) the Prince of Xinxing (a grandson of Li Deliang (ÊùéÂæ∑ËâØ), a cousin of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu), Li You (ÊùéÁå∑), Jia Yingfu (Ë≥àËÜ∫Á¶è), Tang Jun (ÂîêÊôô); the generals Chang Yuankai (Â∏∏ÂÖÉÊ•∑), Li Ci (ÊùéÊÖà), and Li Qin (ÊùéÊ¨Ω); and the monk Huifan (ÊÉ†ÁØÑ), were plotting to overthrow Emperor Xuanzong. It was further said that they discussed, with the lady-in-waiting Yuan to poison the gastrodia elata that Emperor Xuanzong routinely took as an aphrodisiac. When this alleged plot was reported to Emperor Xuanzong by Wei Zhigu, Emperor Xuanzong, who had already received advice from Wang Ju (ÁéãÁêö), Zhang Yue, and Cui Riyong to act first, did so. He convened a meeting with his brothers Li Fan (ÊùéÁØÑ) the Prince of Qi, Li Ye (ÊùéÊ•≠) the Prince of Xue, Guo, along with a number of his associates ‚Äî the general Wang Maozhong (ÁéãÊØõ‰ª≤), the officials Jiang Jiao (ÂßúÁöé) and Li Lingwen (Êùé‰ª§Âïè), his brother-in-law Wang Shouyi (ÁéãÂÆà‰∏Ä), Gao Lishi, and the military officer Li Shoude (ÊùéÂÆàÂæ∑) ‚Äî and decided to act first. On July 29,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Xuanzong had Wang Maozhong take 300 soldiers to the imperial guard camp to behead Chang and Li Ci. Then, Jia, Li You, Xiao, and Cen were arrested and executed as well. Dou and Princess Taiping committed suicide. Emperor Ruizong turned over imperial authority to Emperor Xuanzong and thereafter was no longer involved in important decisions. As a result of Gao's participation in this action against Princess Taiping and her party, Emperor Xuanzong awarded him by making him a general of the imperial guards, as well as the acting head of the eunuch bureau (ÂÖß‰æçÁúÅ, Neishi Sheng). Gao's general commission made Gao the first eunuch in Tang history to carry the third rank in Tang's nine-rank system, and this was viewed as the start of the rise of eunuchs. Afterwards Gao became one of Emperor Xuanzong's closest confidants, and it was often Gao that Emperor Xuanzong sent to communicate his wishes with key officials. For example, later in 713, when the chancellor Yao Chong was initially surprised and dismayed when Emperor Xuanzong refused to discuss the commissions of low-level officials with him, Gao spoke with Emperor Xuanzong and was told that the reason was not that he was displeased with Yao, but rather that these were decisions that Yao himself, as chancellor, had the authority to make. After Gao informed Yao this, Yao's apprehensions were dissolved. In 726, when Zhang Shuo was accused of corruption and arrested, it was Gao that Emperor Xuanzong sent to visit Zhang to see how he was doing, and it was at Gao's subsequent intercession that Zhang's punishment was reduced. In 730, when Emperor Xuanzong was beginning to be apprehensive about Wang Maozhong's power and arrogance, it was Gao who suggested that he act first, and in spring 731, Emperor Xuanzong exiled Wang and his associates, and subsequently forced Wang to commit suicide. Thereafter it was said that Gao was particularly trusted by Emperor Xuanzong, who remarked, \\"If Gao Lishi is here, I can sleep securely.\\" Gao therefore rarely returned to his own home, and the petitions submitted to Emperor Xuanzong were first screened by Gao before he would pass them on to Emperor Xuanzong‚Äîand Gao ruled on the less important matters himself, causing his power to rise immensely. He spent much effort to support his adoptive parents Gao Yanfu and Gao Yanfu's wife.While both Gao Yanfu and Gao Lishi were eunuchs, it was customary at the time for eunuchs to marry. He also had the commander (jiedushi) of Lingnan Circuit locate his birth mother Lady Mai and send her to the capital Chang'an, so that he could support her. When Lady Mai died, the general Cheng Boxian (Á®ã‰ºØÁçª) and the official Feng Shaozheng (È¶ÆÁ¥πÊ≠£), who had sworn to be brothers with Gao Lishi, both mourned her deeply. Gao Lishi's father-in-law L√º Xuanwu (ÂëÇÁéÑÊô§) was promoted quickly, as were his brothers and sons, and when Gao Lishi's wife Lady L√º died, the officials and the ordinary citizens all mourned her, to impress Gao. However, it was said that while Gao was powerful, he was careful and modest, and therefore continuously drew trust from Emperor Xuanzong. Among officials and generals who ingratiated him and had him help their advancements were Yuwen Rong, Li Linfu, Li Shizhi, Gai Jiayun (ËìãÂòâÈÅã), Wei Jian (ÈüãÂ†Ö), Yang Shenjin (Ê•äÊÖéÁüú), Wang Hong (ÁéãÈâ∑), Yang Guozhong, An Lushan, An Sishun, and Gao Xianzhi. The intelligentsia at the time blamed him for the advancement of some of the more power-hungry officials, but also recognized that whenever officials associated with him were charged with crimes, he would not improperly intercede to save them. In 737, Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Wu, trying to have her son Li Mao (ÊùéÁëÅ) the Prince of Shou made crown prince, made false accusations against Li Ying the Crown Prince, as well as two other princes, Li Yao (ÊùéÁë§) the Prince of E and Li Ju (ÊùéÁêö) the Prince of Guang. Li Ying, Li Yao, and Li Ju were deposed and then forced to commit suicide. Consort Wu died later that year, but Li Linfu, who was then chancellor and who was allied with her, continued to lobby on Li Mao's behalf. Instead, Emperor Xuanzong was considering an older son, Li Yu the Prince of Zhong, but could not decide quickly, and was depressed over the matter as well as his killing of three of his own sons. He could not sleep well or eat well. Gao asked him the reason, and he responded, \\"You are my old servant. Can you not tell?\\" Gao responded, \\"Is it that the position of young master [(i.e., crown prince)] has not been decided?\\" He responded, \\"Yes.\\" Gao responded, \\"You do not need to trouble your heart. Just select the oldest one, and no one would dare to dispute it.\\" Emperor Xuanzong therefore made up his mind, and he selected Li Yu (whose name was later changed to Li Heng) as crown prince. Meanwhile, it was customary for Tang emperors to rotate their residences between Chang'an and the eastern capital Luoyang, depending on the amount of harvests for the year, as it was easier to transport food supplies to Luoyang than Chang'an. However, after Emperor Xuanzong last returned to Chang'an from Luoyang in 736, he did not visit Luoyang again. Li Linfu knew that he, in his more advanced age (he was 49 as of 736), tired of the rotation, and therefore expended effort to build up food supplies within the Guanzhong region, centered around Chang'an. By 744, on one occasion, Emperor Xuanzong commented to Gao: Gao, who did not trust Li Linfu, responded: Emperor Xuanzong was displeased, and Gao bowed and stated, \\"I am insane. I did not know what I said, and I should be killed.\\" Emperor Xuanzong tried to make light of the situation by holding a feast for Gao, but Gao did not dare to discuss governmental matters with Emperor Xuanzong after this point. In 746, there was an occasion when Emperor Xuanzong's new favorite concubine, Consort Yang Yuhuan, angered Emperor Xuanzong by being jealous and rude to him, and he had her sent to the mansion of her cousin Yang Xian (Ê•äÈäõ). Later that day, however, his mood was such that he could not eat, and the servants were battered by him for minor offenses. Gao knew that he missed Consort Yang, and Gao requested that the treasures in Consort Yang's palace be sent to her. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and further sent imperial meals to her as well. That night, Gao requested that Emperor Xuanzong welcome Consort Yang back to the palace, a request that Emperor Xuanzong easily agreed to. Thereafter, she was even more favored, and no other imperial consort drew the favor of Emperor Xuanzong. Meanwhile, it was said that Li Linfu did not have a good relationship with Li Heng the Crown Prince. Gao often protected Li Heng from the machinations, however, and Li Heng's position was never actually endangered. As a result, Li Heng referred to Gao as an older brother. The other princes and dukes referred to him as \\"father,\\" and Emperor Xuanzong's sons-in-law referred to him as \\"master.\\" By 748, he was given the very high general rank of Piaoqi Da Jiangjun (È©ÉÈ®éÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç) and was also carrying the title of Duke of Bohai. In 750, there was another occasion at which Consort Yang offended Emperor Xuanzong with her words, and he sent her back to her clan. The official Ji Wen (ÂêâÊ∫´) told Emperor Xuanzong that he overreacted, and Emperor Xuanzong regretted his actions. He against sent imperial meals to her, and she wept to the eunuchs delivering the meal, stating: She cut off some of her hair and had the hair taken back to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong had Gao escort her back to the palace, and thereafter loved her even more. In 752, when associates of Wang Hong's brother Wang Han (ÁéãÈä≤) plotted treason and rose in rebellion inside Chang'an, the troops commanded by Yang Guozhong (Consort Yang's cousin) and Wang Hong were initially unable to crush Wang Han's associates, but Gao then arrived with reinforcements and crushed the rebellion decisively. In the aftermaths, when Wang Hong hesitated at asking for punishment for his brother, Yang Guozhong accused Wang Hong of being complicit, and both Wang Hong and Wang Han were executed. Later that year, when Emperor Xuanzong, seeing that Geshu Han, the commander of Longyou Circuit (Èö¥Âè≥, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai), had poor relations with An Lushan, then the commander of Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Beijing) and An Sishun (whose uncle was An Lushan's stepfather), then the commander of Shuofang Circuit (ÊúîÊñπ, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), and wanted to improve relations between these three key border troop commanders, he summoned all three to the capital and had Gao host a feast for the three of them, trying to get them to resolve their unpleasantries. However, instead, at the feast, Geshu and An Lushan got into an argument, which only stopped after Gao gazed at Geshu, stopping him from responding to An Lushan's insults. By 754, Yang Guozhong, who was then chancellor, was beginning to repeatedly accuse An Lushan of plotting rebellion, claiming that if Emperor Xuanzong summoned An to the capital, An would surely not come. Instead, when Emperor Xuanzong summoned An to the capital in early 754, An came. Emperor Xuanzong considered making him chancellor as well‚Äîeven having the official Zhang Ji (ÂºµÂûç, Zhang Shuo's son) draft an edict to that effect‚Äîbut eventually did not do so. When An was set to return to Fanyang, Emperor Xuanzong had Gao hold a feast for An to send him off. After the feast, Gao observed to Emperor Xuanzong that An was somewhat displeased, perhaps because he had found out that he was originally set to be made chancellor but was not. Emperor Xuanzong, believing Zhang Ji and his brothers Zhang Jun (ÂºµÂùá) and Zhang Shu (ÂºµÂü±) to have leaked the news, demoted all of them. Meanwhile, there was a war in the southwest between Tang forces and Nanzhao, which was not going well for Tang, and 200,000 soldiers had died in the conflict. Yang Guozhong, however, was hiding the truth from Emperor Xuanzong and declaring that there had been numerous victories. In response, Emperor Xuanzong told Gao: Gao responded, however, as he saw trouble brewing: Emperor Xuanzong began to be concerned, but took no decisive action, instead stating, \\"Do not speak further. Let me think about these things.\\" At the time, Yang Guozhong was also hiding a major flood from Emperor Xuanzong. Once, when Emperor Xuanzong was alone with Gao, he stated, \\"The rains would not stop. Speak what you will.\\" Gao responded, \\"Since Your Imperial Majesty trusted all power to the chancellors, the rewards and punishments are out of hand, and the yin and yang are out of alignment. How would I dare to speak?\\" Meanwhile, Yang Guozhong repeatedly tried to provoke An into rebelling, including arresting and executing staff members at An's mansion in Chang'an. In 755, An finally did. In 756, after Geshu was defeated by An's forces, after being forced by Yang Guozhong to engage An, Tong Pass, the last major defense against An's forces, fell to An. Yang Guozhong suggested fleeing to Chengdu, the capital of Jiannan Circuit, of which Yang Guozhong was commander. On July 14,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Xuanzong, keeping the news secret from the people of Chang'an, took the imperial guards to escort him, Consort Yang, her family, and his immediate clan members, and exited Chang'an, heading toward Chengdu. Attending him were Yang Guozhong, his fellow chancellor Wei Jiansu, the official Wei Fangjin (È≠èÊñπÈÄ≤), the general Chen Xuanli (Èô≥ÁéÑÁ¶Æ), and some eunuchs and ladies in waiting close to him, including Gao. On July 15,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Xuanzong's train reached Mawei Station (È¶¨Âµ¨È©õ, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The imperial guards were not fed and were angry at Yang Guozhong. Chen also believed that Yang Guozhong provoked this disaster and planned to carry him‚Äîand reported his plans to Li Heng through Li Heng's eunuch Li Fuguo, but Li Heng was hesitated and gave no approval. Meanwhile, emissaries of the Tibetan Empire, who had followed Emperor Xuanzong south, were meeting with Yang Guozhong and complaining that they were also not fed. The imperial guard soldiers took this opportunity to proclaim that Yang Guozhong was planning treason along with the Tibetan emissaries, and they killed him, along with his son Yang Xuan (Ê•äÊöÑ), the Ladies of Han and Qin, and Wei Fangjin. Wei Jiansu was also nearly killed, but was spared at the last moment with severe injuries. The soldiers then surrounded Emperor Xuanzong's pavilion, and refused to scatter even after Emperor Xuanzong came out to comfort them and order them to scatter. Chen publicly urged him to put Consort Yang to death‚Äîwhich Emperor Xuanzong initially declined. After Wei Jiansu's son Wei E (ÈüãË´§) and Gao Lishi spoke further, Emperor Xuanzong finally resolved to do so. He therefore had Gao take Consort Yang to a Buddhist shrine and strangle her there.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 218. After he showed the body to Chen and the other imperial guard generals, the guard soldiers finally scattered and prepared for further movement. The imperial guards eventually escorted Emperor Xuanzong to Chengdu. Gao continued to attend to him there. For Gao's faithfulness, Emperor Xuanzong created him the Duke of Qi.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  Li Heng, however, broke away from Emperor Xuanzong's party and fled to Shuofang instead, and was proclaimed emperor there (as Emperor Suzong) later in 756, a proclamation that Emperor Xuanzong recognized, as he assumed the title of Taishang Huang and had only relatively limited authority thereafter. In 757, after Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an, he welcomed Emperor Xuanzong back to Chang'an. Gao Lishi accompanied Emperor Xuanzong back to the capital, and was rewarded with the honorific title Kaifu Yitong Sansi (ÈñãÂ∫úÂÑÄÂêå‰∏âÂè∏). After Emperor Xuanzong's return to Chang'an, he took residence at Xingqing Palace (ËààÊÖ∂ÂÆÆ), which was converted from his residence as an imperial prince. Gao and Chen Xuanli attended to him, as did Emperor Xuanzong's younger sister Li Chiying (ÊùéÊåÅÁõà) the Princess Yuzhen, the lady in waiting Ru Xianyuan (Â¶Ç‰ªôÂ™õ), and the eunuchs Wang Cheng'en (ÁéãÊâøÊÅ©) and Wei Yue (È≠èÊÇÖ). Meanwhile, Li Fuguo had become very powerful, but these attendants of Emperor Xuanzong did not respect him. To retaliate, Li Fuguo began to try to convince Emperor Suzong that Emperor Xuanzong and his attendants were plotting to seize power back. In 760, with Emperor Suzong's tacit, although not explicit, approval, on one occasion when Emperor Xuanzong was out riding, Li Fuguo intercepted him and forced him to move back to the main palace. Even on that occasion, however, Gao would not submit to Li Fuguo, and even yelled at Li Fuguo to force him to get off his horse and to escort Emperor Xuanzong on foot, along with Gao. Soon after Emperor Xuanzong was forcibly moved, Li Fuguo forced Chen to retire, Li Chiying to return to her temple (she had become an ordained Taoist nun in 711), and exiled Gao, Wang, Wei, and Ru. In Gao's case, he was exiled to Wu Prefecture (Â∑´Â∑û, roughly modern Huaihua, Hunan).  Death  In spring 762, Emperor Suzong, then seriously ill, declared a general pardon. Gao Lishi was therefore allowed to return to Chang'an, and he began to undertake the journey. While he was on the way back to Chang'an, however, on May 5,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Xuanzong died, followed by Emperor Suzong on May 16.ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ When Gao reached Lang Prefecture (ÊúóÂ∑û, roughly modern Changde, Hunan), he heard of the two emperors' deaths, and he, mourning Emperor Xuanzong bitterly, spit up blood and died soon afterwards. Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong, who became emperor after Emperor Suzong's death, recognizing Gao's faithfulness and prior protection of Emperor Suzong, posthumously restored his titles and further bestowed honors, and buried him near Emperor Xuanzong's tomb.

He was the first native-born Australian to achieve a reputation overseas, and a leading advocate for self-government for the Australian colonies. Birth William Charles Wentworth was born on 13 August 1790 to D'Arcy Wentworth and Catherine Crowley. D'Arcy was the impecunious distant offspring of the aristocratic Wentworth family. D'Arcy was born in Ireland in 1762, but had left to train as a surgeon in London. To maintain his lifestyle he apparently became a highwayman, but soon found himself in trouble with the law. After being acquitted four times of highway robbery, to avoid a further prosecution, D'Arcy took the position of assistant surgeon to the new colony of New South Wales. He boarded the Neptune sometime in December 1789. On board the ship was a seventeen-year-old girl from Ireland, who was being transported to Sydney following a conviction for stealing some clothing. On board ship, D'Arcy Wentworth and Catherine Crowley became lovers. The Neptune arrived in Sydney as part of the Second Fleet on 29 June 1790. D'Arcy and Catherine, now heavily pregnant, departed for Norfolk Island on the Surprize. While anchored off Norfolk Island in August, possibly the 13th, Catherine gave birth to a son whom she named William. Although born less than nine months after they first met, D'Arcy acknowledged the boy as his. There has always been confusion about the date and circumstances of Wentworth's birth. The text of his obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 May 1872, says about the year 1792. Burke's Colonial Gentry, 1891‚Äì1896, Page 96, says he was born in 1793, describes his mother as Catherine Parry, and that she was the wife of D'Arcy. In the biography \\"William Charles Wentworth\\" by A C V Melbourne, he says that he was born in 1792. His mother is believed to have been a Catherine Williams, who had been a convict on the Neptune, where D'arcy first became acquainted with her. The date 26 October 1793 was celebrated as his birth date for some years. His coffin had attached to it a plate of pure silver which bore the simple inscription, William Charles Wentworth, born 26 October 1793 died March, 20th, 1872. Early life In 1796 D'Arcy and Catherine Wentworth moved from Norfolk Island to Sydney, with the young William. The family lived at Parramatta, where his father became a prosperous landowner. Catherine died at Parramatta in 1800. In 1803 William along with his brother, was sent to England, where he was educated at a school in Greenwich. In about 1807, D'Arcy Wentworth sold at the Brush Farm (near Eastwood) to Gregory Blaxland for ¬£1,500. William returned to Sydney in 1810, where he was appointed acting Provost Marshal by Governor Lachlan Macquarie, and given a land grant of on the Nepean River. On 15 October 1810, at Hyde Park, now in the centre of Sydney, Wentworth rode his father's horse Gig to victory in the first official horse races on Australian soil.Sydney Sydney Gazette & NSW Advertiser Crossing the Blue Mountains William Charles Wentworth ‚Äì Journal of his expedition across the Blue Mountains. Held at the State Library of New South Wales. In 1813 Wentworth, along with Gregory Blaxland and William Lawson, led the expedition which found a route across the Blue Mountains west of Sydney and opened up the grazing lands of inland New South Wales. Wentworth kept a journal of the exploration which begins by describing the first day of the journey: > On the Eleventh of May our party consisting of Mr. Gregory Blaxland, > Lieutenant Lawson and Myself with four servants quitted Mr. Gregory > Blaxland's farm on the South Creek and on the 29th of the June Month > descended from the Mountain into forest land having travelled as nearly as I > can compute about 60 Miles from Mr. Chapman's farm on the Nepean River > although I do not imagine that we made more than 40 Miles of Westing. In the journal, Wentworth describes the landscapes they were exploring: > A country of so singular a description could in my opinion only have been > produced by some Mighty convulsion in Nature ‚Äì Those immense unconnected > perpendicular Masses of Mountain which are to be seen towards its Eastern > Extremity towering above the Country around, seem to indicate that the whole > of this tract has been formed out of the Materials of the primitive > mountains of which these masses are the only parts that have withstood the > violence of the concussion.' The town of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains commemorates his role in the expedition. As a reward he was granted another . He then combined farming with sandalwood trading in the South Pacific, where the captain of the ship died at Rarotonga and Wentworth safely brought the ship back to Sydney. Studying in England Wentworth returned to England in 1816. There he was admitted to the bar, travelled in Europe, and studied at Cambridge University, initially matriculating in Magdalene College. In 1819 Wentworth published the first book written by an Australian: A Statistical, Historical, and Political Description of the Colony of New South Wales and Its Dependent Settlements in Van Diemen's Land, With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America, in which he advocated an elected assembly for New South Wales, trial by jury and settlement of Australia by free emigrants rather than convicts. Wentworth successfully completed his legal studies by 1822 and was called to the bar. In 1823 he was admitted to Peterhouse, Cambridge. That year he also published an epic poem Australasia, which contains lines now famous in Australia:Frank Welsh, Great Southern Land: A New History of Australia, Penguin Books, 2005, p.27 () :And, O Britannia!... may this ‚Äî thy last-born infant ‚Äî then arise, :To glad thy heart, and greet thy parent eyes; :And Australasia float, with flag unfurl'd, :A new Britannia in another world! Political life William Charles Wentworth (Thomas Woolner, 1854) Wentworth returned to Sydney in 1824, accompanied by Robert Wardell. D'Arcy Wentworth died in 1827 and William inherited his property, becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colony. He bought land in eastern Sydney and built a mansion, Vaucluse House, from which the modern suburb takes its name. However, because his parents had never married, and his mother had been a convict, and his wife was the daughter of two convicts, Francis Cox and Frances Morton, he could not become a member of Sydney's \\"respectable\\" class, known as \\"the exclusives\\". Embittered by this rejection, he placed himself at the head of the \\"emancipist\\" party, which sought equal rights and status for ex-convicts and their descendants. A wild but gifted orator and a vitriolic journalist, Wentworth became the colony's leading political figure of the 1820s and '30s, calling for representative government, the abolition of transportation, freedom of the press and trial by jury. He became a bitter enemy of Governor Ralph Darling and the exclusives, led by the wealthy grazier John Macarthur and his friends. Macarthur's opposition to Wentworth was personal as well as political. Macarthur had broken up the relationship between his daughter Elizabeth and Wentworth, as he would not allow his daughter to marry someone with convict parents. Wentworth became Vice- President of the Australian Patriotic Association and founded a newspaper, The Australian, the colony's first privately owned paper, to champion his causes (this paper has no connection with the current Australian). With a liberal editorial leaning, the paper was in frequent conflict with Governor Darling, who was recalled in 1831. Under successive governors of differing opinions, Wentworth continued to exercise a powerful influence. By 1840 the political climate in New South Wales had changed. With the abolition of transportation and the establishment of an elected Legislative Council, the dominant issue became the campaign to break the grip of the squatter (pastoral) class over the colony's lands, and on this issue Wentworth sided with his fellow landowners against the democratic party, who wanted to break up the squatters' runs for small farmers. He was elected to the Council in 1843 for City of Sydney and soon became the leader of the conservative party, opposed to the liberals led by Charles Cowper. In 1852 he founded the University of Sydney, where his son afterwards founded bursaries in his honour. In 1853 Wentworth chaired the committee to draft a new constitution for New South Wales, which was to receive full responsible self-government from Britain. His draft provided for a powerful unelected Legislative Council and an elected Legislative Assembly with high property qualifications for voting and membership. He also suggested the establishment of a colonial peerage drawn from the landowning class. This draft aroused the bitter opposition of the democrats and radicals such as Daniel Deniehy, who ridiculed Wentworth's plans for what he called a \\"bunyip aristocracy\\". The draft constitution was substantially changed to make it more democratic, although the Legislative Council remained unelected. With the establishment of responsible government in 1856 Wentworth retired from the Council and settled in England, where he founded the \\"General Association for the Australian Colonies\\", whose object was to obtain a federal assembly for the whole of Australia. He refused several offers of honours, and was a member of the Conservative Party in the 1860s. He died in England, but at his request his body was returned to Sydney for burial. He was given the colony's first state funeral on 6 May 1873, a day declared by the governor as a public holiday.The Dictionary of Sydney.

An eight-foot high statue of Wentworth, sculpted by Pietro Tenerani of Rome, stands at the University of Sydney. Another statue of Wentworth is located on the exterior of the Department of Lands building in Sydney. In 1963 he was honoured, together with Blaxland and Lawson, on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post depicting the Blue Mountains crossing,1963 postage stamp and again in 1974 on the anniversary of the first newspaper publication.1974 Postage stamp The Wentworth Building, where University of Sydney Union resides, was named after William Wentworth. Pastoralist and newspaperman Horatio Wills named his son Thomas Wentworth Wills in homage of Wentworth, who was a close friend of Horatio's and served as the Wills family's lawyer. Thomas went on to become a renowned cricketer and co-founder of Australian rules football. His clash with Darling was dramatised in the series The Patriots (1962).

She was the beloved consort of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang during his later years. She is known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. During the An Lushan Rebellion, as Emperor Xuanzong and his cortege were fleeing from the capital Chang'an to Chengdu, the emperor's guards demanded that he put Yang to death because they blamed the rebellion on her cousin Yang Guozhong and the rest of her family. The emperor capitulated and reluctantly ordered his attendant Gao Lishi to strangle Yang to death. Background Yang was born in 719 during the Tang Dynasty, early in the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Her great-great-grandfather Yang Wang (Ê•äÊ±™) was a key official during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, and, after the fall of the Sui Dynasty, served one of the contenders to succeed Sui, Wang Shichong; Yang Wang was then killed when Wang Shichong was defeated by Tang forces in 621.Book of Sui, vol. 56. Yang Wang was from Huayin (ËèØÈô∞; in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), but his clan subsequently relocated to Yongle (Ê∞∏Ê®Ç; in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). Yang's father Yang Xuanyan (Ê•äÁéÑÁê∞) served as a census official at Shu Prefecture (ËúÄÂ∑û; in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), and his family went there with him. He appeared to have had no sons, but had four daughters who were known to history ‚Äî Yang Yuhuan and three older sisters.Yang Yuhuan's three older sisters were described as having had birth ranks first, third, and eighth, implying that Yang Xuanyan might have had nine or more daughters, but it was also possible that their ranks were combined with their female cousins. Yang Xuanyan died when Yang Yuhuan was still young, so the latter was raised by her uncle Yang Xuanjiao (Ê•äÁéÑÁí¨), who was a low-ranking official at Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥ÂçóÂ∫ú; modern Luoyang). Princess and Taoist nun In 733, fourteen-year-old Yang Yuhuan married Li Mao, the Prince of Shou and the son of Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Wu. She thus carried the title of Princess of Shou. After Consort Wu died in 737, Emperor Xuanzong was greatly saddened by the death of his then- favorite concubine. Some time after that, however, Princess Yang somehow came into Xuanzong's favor and the Emperor decided to take her as his consort. However, since Princess Yang was already the wife of his son, Emperor Xuanzong stealthily arranged her to become a Taoist nun, with the tonsured name Taizhen, in order to prevent criticism that would affect his plan of making her his concubine. Yang then stayed, for a brief moment, as a Taoist nun in the palace itself, before Emperor Xuanzong made her an imperial consort after bestowing a new wife on his son Li Mao. Yang became the favorite consort of the Emperor. Imperial consort In 745, after Emperor Xuanzong gave the daughter of the general Wei Zhaoxun (ÈüãÊò≠Ë®ì) to Li Mao as his new wife and princess, he officially made Taizhen an imperial consort ‚Äî with the newly restored rank of Guifei, which was greater than the previously highest rank of Huifei, carried by Consort Wu. He bestowed posthumous honors on her father Yang Xuanyan and granted her mother the title of Lady of Liang. He also gave high offices to her uncle Yang Xuangui (Ê•äÁéÑÁè™) and cousins Yang Xian (Ê•äÈäõ) and Yang Qi (Ê•äÈå°). Her three older sisters were conferred the ranks of Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin, and it was said that whenever the noble women were summoned to imperial gatherings, even Emperor Xuanzong's highly honored sister Li Chiying (ÊùéÊåÅÁõà), the Princess Yuzhen, did not dare to take a seat more honorable than theirs. Emperor Xuanzong also gave his favorite daughter Princess Taihua (born of Consort Wu) to Yang Qi in marriage. The five Yang households ‚Äî those of Yang Xian, Yang Qi, and the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin ‚Äî were said to be exceedingly honored and rich, and all of the officials fought to flatter them. Also around the same time, her second cousin Yang Zhao (whose name was later changed to Yang Guozhong) was also introduced to Emperor Xuanzong by Consort Yang, and Yang Zhao began to be promoted due to his flattery of the emperor. Consort Yang became so favored that whenever she rode a horse, the eunuch Gao Lishi would attend her. 700 laborers were conscripted to sew fabrics for her. Officials and generals flattered her by offering her exquisite tributes. In 746, she angered Emperor Xuanzong by being jealous and rude to him, and he had her sent to her cousin Yang Xian's mansion. Later that day, however, his mood was such that he could not eat, and he battered his servants for minor offenses. Gao knew that he missed Consort Yang, and requested that the treasures in Consort Yang's palace be sent to her. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and sent imperial meals to her as well. That night, Gao requested that Emperor Xuanzong welcome Consort Yang back to the palace, a request that Emperor Xuanzong easily agreed to. Thereafter, she was even more favored, and no other imperial consort drew his favor. In 747, when the military governor (jiedushi) An Lushan arrived at the capital Chang'an to meet Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong showed him much favor and allowed him into the palace. He had An honor Consort Yang as mother and Consort Yang's cousins and sisters as his brothers and sisters. In 750, Consort Yang again offended Emperor Xuanzong with her words, and he sent her back to her clan. The official Ji Wen (ÂêâÊ∫´) told Emperor Xuanzong that he had overreacted, and Emperor Xuanzong regretted his actions. He again sent imperial meals to her, and she wept to the eunuchs delivering the meal, stating: She cut off some of her hair and had the hair taken back to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong had Gao escort her back to the palace, and thereafter loved her even greater. In 751, An again visited Chang'an. On An's birthday on 20 February, 751,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Xuanzong and Consort Yang rewarded him with clothing, treasures, and food. On 23 February, when An was summoned to the palace, Consort Yang, in order to please Emperor Xuanzong, had an extra-large infant wrapping made, and wrapped the obese An in it, causing much laughter among the ladies in waiting and eunuchs. When Emperor Xuanzong asked what was going on, Consort Yang's attendants joked that Consort Yang gave birth three days before and was washing her baby Lushan. Emperor Xuanzong was amused by the comic situation and rewarded both Consort Yang and An greatly. Thereafter, whenever An visited the capital, he was allowed free admittance to the palace, and there were rumors that he and Consort Yang had an affair, but Emperor Xuanzong discounted the rumors. In 752, when the chancellor Li Linfu, in light of Nanzhao incursions against Jiannan Circuit (ÂäçÂçóÈÅì; headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), of which Yang Guozhen served as commander remotely, wanted to send Yang Guozhong to Jiannan to defend against the Nanzhao attacks, Consort Yang interceded on Yang Guozhong's behalf, and Yang Guozhong did not actually report to Jiannan. Li Linfu soon died, and Yang Guozhong became chancellor. An Lushan's rebellion and Yang's death A modern statue of Yang Yang Guozhong and An Lushan soon were in conflict, and Yang Guozhong repeatedly acted provocatively, such as arresting and executing staff members from An's mansion in Chang'an. In 755, An finally rebelled and marched his troops toward the capital. In order to try to placate the populace, which believed that Yang Guozhong had provoked the rebellion, Emperor Xuanzong considered passing the throne to his crown prince, Li Heng. Yang Guozhong, who was not on good terms with the prince, feared this development, and persuaded Consort Yang and her sisters, the Ladies of Han, Guo, and Qin, to speak against it. Emperor Xuanzong, for the time being, did not abdicate the throne. In 756, General Geshu Han was forced by Yang Guozhong to engage An out of fear that the general himself might usurp the throne; Geshu Han was defeated and Tong Pass, the last major defense, fell to An's forces. Yang Guozhong then suggested fleeing to Chengdu, the capital of Jiannan Circuit. On 14 July,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Xuanzong, keeping the news secret from the people of Chang'an, used the imperial guards to escort him, Consort Yang, her family, and his immediate clan members, and left Chang'an, heading toward Chengdu. Attending him were Yang Guozhong, his fellow chancellor Wei Jiansu, the official Wei Fangjin (È≠èÊñπÈÄ≤), the general Chen Xuanli, and some eunuchs and ladies in waiting close to him. On 15 July, Emperor Xuanzong's cortege reached Mawei Courier Station (, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The imperial guards were not fed and became angry at Yang Guozhong. Chen also believed that Yang Guozhong had provoked this disaster and planned to accuse him; he reported his plans to Li Heng through Li Heng's eunuch Li Fuguo, but Li Heng was hesitant and gave no approval. Meanwhile, Tibetan emissaries, who had followed Emperor Xuanzong south, were meeting with Yang Guozhong and complaining that they also had not been fed. The soldiers of the imperial guard took this opportunity to proclaim that Yang Guozhong was planning treason along with the Tibetan emissaries, and they killed him, along with his son Yang Xuan (Ê•äÊöÑ), the Ladies of Han and Qin, and Wei Fangjin. Wei Jiansu was severely injured and nearly killed, but was spared at the last moment. The soldiers then surrounded Emperor Xuanzong's pavilion and refused to leave, even after Emperor Xuanzong came out to comfort them and order them to disperse. Chen publicly urged him to put Consort Yang to death ‚Äî which he initially declined. After Wei Jiansu's son Wei E (ÈüãË´§) and Gao Lishi spoke further, Emperor Xuanzong finally agreed. He had Gao take Consort Yang to a Buddhist shrine and strangle her. After he showed the body to Chen and the other imperial guard generals, the soldiers finally dispersed and prepared for further travel. Meanwhile, Yang Guozhong's wife Pei Rou (Ë£¥Êüî), son Yang Xi (Ê•äÊôû), the Lady of Guo, and the Lady of Guo's son Pei Hui (Ë£¥ÂæΩ) tried to flee, but were killed. Consort Yang was buried at Mawei, without a coffin, but with masses of fragrance wrapped in purple blankets. In 757, Prince Li Heng, who had taken the throne as Emperor Suzong, recaptured Chang'an and welcomed ex- Emperor Xuanzong, then Taishang Huang (retired emperor) back to the capital. Emperor Xuanzong went through Mawei on his way back to Chang'an. He wanted to locate Consort Yang's body and rebury her with honor. The official Li Kui spoke against it, pointing out that the imperial guard might again mutiny if he did so. However, Emperor Xuanzong secretly sent eunuchs to rebury her with a coffin. When they found the body, it had decomposed, but the fragrance bag buried with her was still fresh. The eunuchs returned with the fragrance bag, and upon its presentation to Emperor Xuanzong, he wept bitterly. When he returned to Chang'an, he had a painter create a picture of Consort Yang in a secondary palace, and often went there to view the portrait. Personal characteristics Yang was known for having a larger figure, in an era of Chinese history where such body types are preferred. Because of that, Yang is often compared and contrasted with Empress Zhao Feiyan, who is known for being a slender person. This, in turn, led to the Four-character idiom yanshou- huanfei (, literally \\"slender Yan, plump Huan\\"), describing the physical range of the types of beauties between Zhao and Yang. Modern-day description of Yang's physical size differs. She has been variously described as \\"rotund\\", \\"well rounded\\", \\"full-bodied\\", \\"portly\\", and \\"obese\\". However, some consider the description of Yang as an obese woman to be either a misinterpretation of ancient Chinese texts, or a misapplication of modern standards on body size. Lychee was a favorite fruit for Yang, and the emperor had the fruit, which was only grown in southern China, delivered by the imperial courier's fast horses, whose riders would take shifts day and night in a Pony Express-like manner, to the capital. Most historians believe the fruits were delivered from modern Guangdong, but some believe they came from modern Sichuan. A copy of the outline of her right hand still exists, having been carved on a large stone at the site of the Xi'an Palace. Yang was granted use of the Huaqing Pool which had been the exclusive private pool of previous Tang emperors. Fashion influence Yang is sometimes credited with the invention of the dudou, the traditional Chinese bodice or undershirt. Cultural depiction Yang's story has been often retold. While some literature describes her as the author of much misfortune, other writings sympathize with her as a scapegoat. In the following generation, a long poem, \\"Chang hen ge\\" (\\"Song of Everlasting Sorrow\\"), was written by the poet Bai Juyi describing Emperor Xuanzong's love for her and perpetual grief at her loss. It became an instant classic, known to and memorized by Chinese schoolchildren far into posterity. The story of Yang and the poem also became highly popular in Japan and served as sources of inspiration for the classical novel The Tale of Genji which begins with the doomed love between an emperor and a consort, Kiritsubo, who is likened to Yang. Noh plays have been staged based on her story. A Japanese rumour states that Yang had been rescued, escaped to Japan and lived her remaining life there. In Japanese, she is known as Y≈çkihi.

The city is located south of Santiago . Temuco's central place in Araucan√≠a with easy access to the Andean valleys, lakes and coastal areas makes it a hub for tourism, agricultural, livestock and forestry operations as well as a communication and trade centre for the numerous small towns of Araucan√≠a. Temuco has recently been regarded as a university city as it houses two large universities: University of the Frontier and Temuco Catholic University. Nobel laureates Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda both lived in Temuco for some time. Etymology Luma apiculata The word Temuco comes from the Mapudungun language, meaning \\"temu water\\"; \\"temu\\" is the common name of two native trees of the family Myrtaceae, Luma apiculata (also known as array√°n in Spanish) and Blepharocalyx cruckschankii. Both species are characterized by their orange-reddish bark and by having aromatic fruits and leaves which are commonly used by the Mapuche for medicinal purposes. While Blepharocalyx cruckschankii is endangered, Luma apiculata is relatively common and in Temuco it is possible to see it in the Cerro √ëielol Natural Monument (in its natural state) as well as in city gardens and sidewalks. The blend between the words \\"temu\\" and \\"co\\" (water), probably reflects the fact that these trees frequently grow beside water bodies. History The city was founded by Chilean army on February 24, 1881 as a fort during the Occupation of the Araucan√≠a. Manuel Recabarren, in charge of the project, named the place Fuerte (Fort) Recabarren. Formed as a military encampment, Temuco had in its origins the attributes of a camp, and a year after its founding, the first major streets started to form in the downtown area. On April 15, 1888, the first city officers were elected including the first mayor Jos√© del Rosario Mu√±oz. The city grew quickly; a census in 1895 indicated a population of 7,708 people, and when Cautin was declared a province, Temuco became its capital, with its population by that time of 16,037 people. Chilean poetry has deep roots in Temuco. Nobel laureates Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda (Neftal√≠ Reyes) both lived in Temuco. Mistral was the principal of an all-girls school where Neruda would visit her and show her his first verses when he was around 15 years old. In 2010 Temuco was affected by the earthquake on February 27 centered to the north. It was one of the most affected regions of Chile besides Santiago, Concepcion, Valpara√≠so and others. The earthquake registered 8.8 Mw on the moment magnitude scale. Though landlocked Temuco avoided the tsunamis the earthquake caused, many very strong aftershocks throughout the country followed, including a 7.1 MW earthquake northwest of the city. Nowadays, Temuco is a fast growing city with diversified commerce and services. Demographics Central Temuco According to the 2002 census by the National Statistics Institute (INE), Temuco had a communal population of 245,347 (117,071 men and 128,276 women). Of these, 232,528 (94.8%) lived in urban areas and 12,819 (5.2%) in rural areas. The population grew by 24.4% (48,111 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The INE projected the 2010 population to be 377,495, which makes it the second largest city south of Santiago (behind Concepci√≥n), and the fourth largest in the country. One of the distinctive features of Temuco is the strong presence of the Mapuche culture, who make up 23.1% of the population in the Temuco commune, and numerous German immigrant colonies (9.8%). Temuco proper has a population of 227,086. The locals are called temuquenses. Most inhabitants are of different origins. Temuco has a high percentage being of Basque ancestry other than Castilian and other Spanish nationalities. Thus, one can find indigenous, mainly Mapuche, who account for 13% of the population of Temuco, which makes it the city of Chile with the largest indigenous presence. There is also a large percentage of temuquences that are directly descended from European immigrants, many of whom arrived during 1883‚Äì1901 after the pacification of Araucan√≠a. These main European sources are from Switzerland, Spain, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Others - less numerous and from many other parts of Europe such as the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia, Armenia, Greece, Portugal, etc. - arrived after that first migration, especially during the World Wars. During the Spanish Civil War (1930s), a large percentage of Aragonese, Asturians, Catalans, Galicians, Navarrese and Basques reached a significant number of immigrants from Europe (mainly Spain). There are also small communities of Jews (i.e. from Russia, Poland, Macedonia, Hungary, and Central and Eastern Europe in general) and Arabs (i.e. from Lebanon, Syria and Palestine). This occurrence of immigration from Europe and, to a lesser extent, Jewish and Arabic areas helps to explain the various clubs, schools, and sections of the city of Temuco. There are East East Asian colonies of Chinese, Japanese and Koreans in Temuco, dating back to the end of the Korean War in the 1950s when thousands of Korean refugees settled through U.N. relocation programs to Chile. =Notable people= * Leonor Oyarz√∫n, former first lady of Chile * Gustavo Becerra-Schmidt, composer * Dagoberto Godoy, aviator * Pablo Neruda, 1971 winner of the Noble Prize in Literature * Marcelo Salas, retired footballer, chairman of local football club Deportes Temuco * Luis Salvadores Salvi, Chilean basketball player Geography Llaima volcano located in the Andes as seen from Temuco valley Temuco is located in a valley in the center- south of Chile, equidistant between the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Andes to the east. Morphologically, the city placement corresponds to Caut√≠n River-originated fluvial land masses that developed in a crushed form between two hills, √ëielol (350m) and Conunhueno (360m). Environment The city is surrounded by a landscape typical to central-southern Chile, consisting mostly of plantations of exotic species used in forestry along with prairies. The original ecosystem of the area consisting in temperate forest is present mostly in the √ëielol hill. Given that burning wood is the primary source of heat during the cold months in Temuco, air pollution is a recurrent problem during autumn and winter. As a consequence, Air quality in Temuco is the third lowest in Chile. News report February 2015] Air pollution worsens in southern Chilean city of Temuco]  Climate  Climatologically, Temuco lies at the border of Chile's central valley Mediterranean region, albeit with an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Cfb ). Through the year, cyclonic and anticyclonic influences alternate, with a distinct drier summer period (although not as dry as Santiago or other central valley cities, receiving just enough precipitation to avoid a Mediterranean climate classification). Its mean annual temperature is , with highest median during the warmest month of and lowest median during the coldest month of (Ciren-Corfo, 1992). Annual mean rain during 1961-1990 (Direcci√≥n Meteorol√≥gica de Chile, 1991) was (Capelli de Steffens et al., 1997). Administration As a commune, Temuco is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Miguel Becker Alvear (RN). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Temuco is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Germ√°n Becker (RN) and Ren√© Saffirio (PDC) as part of the 50th electoral district, (together with Padre Las Casas). The commune is represented in the Senate by Jos√© Garcia Ruminot (RN) and Eugenio Tuma Zedan (PPD) as part of the 15th senatorial constituency (Araucan√≠a-South). Sports Temuco, is as well known as \\"La ciudad del deporte\\" which means, the city of sports. Temuco hosts one of the newest as well as biggest stadiums in the country, the \\"German Becker\\" stadium; home to the local soccer team \\"Deportes Temuco\\". Official Deportes Temuco FC site This stadium has hosted numerous local sports events, as well as international ones. They are as follows: \\\\- FIFA U20 Women's World Cup in 2008 \\\\- WORLD RUGBY's U20 RUGBY WORLD TROPHY in 2013 \\\\- AMERICAN CUP's in 2015 Temuco was also one of the host cities of the official 1959 Basketball World Cup, where Chile won the bronze medal. Further to that, Temuco has numerous gyms and parks where people can go on their leisure time. Transport Terminal Rodoviario Buses and collective taxis are the most popular modes of mass transit. The bus fare is CLP$150 for students and $450 for adults; the colectivos charge $500 ($650 at night). Regular taxis are also available. La Araucan√≠a Airport is commercial air terminal for Temuco located to the south of the city, near the town of Freire, about 20 minutes south of Temuco. The railroad connects Temuco with Victoria to the north and points in between. Temuco does not have a rapid transit rail system. Long-haul buses run from the Terminal Rodoviario de la Araucania , at the northern approach to town. Private transport by car is commonly used which causes traffic congestion at peak hours. The recent proliferation of bike lanes has placed transportation by bicycle as an emerging trend. By 2017, 35 km of bike lanes are expected to be operative. Important places * Cerro √ëielol The √ëielol Hill houses the original temperate forest at this latitude in southern Chile as it was before the Spanish people colonised it. Currently, it has the status of natural monument and as such, it is a protected area. It has also a special meaning for the Mapuche people living in the Region, housing near the top a ceremonial area called La Patagua. We can also find a restaurant at the top of the Hill and a viewpoint of the east side of the city and Padre Las Casas, across the river. It is easily accessed by foot or car. The Southern Andean Volcano Observatory has its office there. * Central market The central market is one of the best places to get Mapuche crafts. It has a meat market and shops selling woodcrafts, artifacts, wool knits, and similar goods. A fire has recently affected its structure. Reconstruction is planned, but the original market is currently closed. * Feria Pinto alt=Edificio Marsano de 1923 - Frente.JPG One of the most traditional places in the city. Fresh fruits and vegetables are sold here in a daily basis. People from the city and from rural nearby towns come here for trade. * Alemania Avenue Is the principal artery in Temuco. Here we can find The Araucaria Museum building (19th century Chilean style); the Menchaca Lira Campus of Art Building (a Victorian Style building, recently restored); The English Alley, where we can find the Red Cross Building and not long ago a blue house which was dismantled to be rebuilt elsewhere (as a Heritage recovery project by the school of architecture of a known University of Temuco), both Neoclassical styled. Recently, Alemania Av. has become an important commercial centre. Several restaurants, night clubs, pubs, bistros, pharmacies, boutiques, banks, supermarkets and two shopping malls have been opened there. There is also a Casino and a five stars hotel in the same avenue. * Anibal Pinto Square The core of Downtown Temuco is the Main Square Anibal Pinto. Temuco's Main Square is the only one in Chile that was not built with a water fountain in its centre; an art gallery was built in 1981 as part of a total renewal. Compared to other main squares of southern Chile, Temuco's looks very modern. It was named one of Chile's most beautiful plazas. It is a tradition, in all creole cities in Chile, that some specific buildings must be in front of the main square; in Temuco, this tradition has been broken. Main Squares are supposed to be surrounded by: a Cathedral (which is in front of Temuco's main square, as traditionally), the Municipality (which also, is located in front of the square), a Theatre (there used to be a film theatre in front of it), a Fire Station (there is not a fire station in front of the square, as it should), a School (there is no school in front of the main square), and a Bank (there are four banks around the main square).

It is a normative discipline of sociology seeking to study the structures, environmental processes, changes and problems of an urban area and by doing so provide inputs for urban planning and policy making. In other words, it is the sociological study of cities and their role in the development of society.Dictionary reference Like most areas of sociology, urban sociologists use statistical analysis, observation, social theory, interviews, and other methods to study a range of topics, including migration and demographic trends, economics, poverty, race relations and economic trends. Urban sociology is one of the oldest sub-disciplines of sociology dating back to the mid-nineteenth century. The philosophical foundations of modern urban sociology originate from the work of sociologists such as Karl Marx, Ferdinand T√∂nnies, √âmile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel who studied and theorized the economic, social and cultural processes of urbanization and its effects on social alienation, class formation, and the production or destruction of collective and individual identities. These theoretical foundations were further expanded upon and analyzed by a group of sociologists and researchers who worked at the University of Chicago in the early twentieth century. In what became known as the Chicago School of sociology the work of Robert Park, Louis Wirth and Ernest Burgess on the inner city of Chicago revolutionized not only the purpose of urban research in sociology, but also the development of human geography through its use of quantitative and ethnographic research methods. The importance of the theories developed by the Chicago School within urban sociology have been critically sustained and critiqued but still remain one of the most significant historical advancements in understanding urbanization and the city within the social sciences.Martin, D.G., \\"Chicago School\\" in D. Gregory, R. Johnston, G. Pratt, M. Watts and S. Whatmore, eds., The Dictionary of Human Geography, London: Blackwell, 2009. Development and rise Urban sociology rose to prominence within North American academics through a group of sociologists and theorists at the University of Chicago from 1915 to 1940 in what became known as the Chicago School of Sociology. The Chicago School of Sociology combined sociological and anthropological theory with ethnographic fieldwork in order to understand how individuals interact within urban social systems.Flanagan, W., Contemporary Urban Sociology Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 1993.Wirth, L., Urbanism as a Way of Life The American Journal of Sociology: Volume 44, Number 1, 1938. Unlike the primarily macro-based sociology that had marked earlier subfields, members of the Chicago School placed greater emphasis on micro-scale social interactions that sought to provide subjective meaning to how humans interact under structural, cultural and social conditions. The theory of symbolic interaction, the basis through which many methodologically-groundbreaking ethnographies were framed in this period, took primitive shape alongside urban sociology and shaped its early methodological leanings. Symbolic interaction was forged out of the writings of early micro- sociologists George Mead and Max Weber, and sought to frame how individuals interpret symbols in everyday interactions. With early urban sociologists framing the city as a 'superorganism', the concept of symbolic interaction aided in parsing out how individual communities contribute to the seamless functioning of the city itself.Trepl, L., City and Ecology Capitalism Nature Socialism: Volume 7, Number 2, 1996. Scholars of the Chicago School originally sought to answer a single question: how did an increase in urbanism during the time of the Industrial Revolution contribute to the magnification of contemporary social problems? Sociologists centered on Chicago due to its 'tabula rasa' state, having expanded from a small town of 10,000 in 1860 to an urban metropolis of over two million in the next half-century. Along with this expansion came many of the era's emerging social problems ‚Äì ranging from issues with concentrated homelessness and harsh living conditions to the low wages and long hours that characterized the work of the many newly arrived European immigrants. Furthermore, unlike many other metropolitan areas, Chicago did not expand outward at the edges as predicted by early expansionist theorists, but instead 'reformatted' the space available in a concentric ring pattern.Burgess, E., \\"The growth of the city: an introduction to a research project,\\" in Park, R.E. (ed) The City, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 47‚Äì62, 1925. As with many modern cities the business district occupied the city center and was surrounded by slum and blighted neighborhoods, which were further surrounded by workingmens' homes and the early forms of the modern suburbs. Urban theorists suggested that these spatially distinct regions helped to solidify and isolate class relations within the modern city, moving the middle class away from the urban core and into the privatized environment of the outer suburbs.Sassen, S., New frontiers facing urban sociology at the millennium The British Journal of Sociology: Volume 51, Number 1, 2000. Due to the high concentration of first-generation immigrant families in the inner city of Chicago during the early 20th century, many prominent early studies in urban sociology focused upon the transmission of immigrants' native culture roles and norms into new and developing environments. Political participation and the rise in inter-community organizations were also frequently covered in this period, with many metropolitan areas adopting census techniques that allowed for information to be stored and easily accessed by participating institutions such as the University of Chicago. Park, Burgess and McKenzie, professors at the University of Chicago and three of the earliest proponents of urban sociology, developed the Subculture Theories, which helped to explain the often-positive role of local institutions on the formation of community acceptance and social ties.Park, R., The City: Suggestions for Investigation of Human Behavior in the Urban Environment Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984. When race relations break down and expansion renders one's community members anonymous, as was proposed to be occurring in this period, the inner city becomes marked by high levels of social disorganization that prevent local ties from being established and maintained in local political arenas. The rise of urban sociology coincided with the expansion of statistical inference in the behavioural sciences, which helped ease its transition and acceptance in educational institutions along with other burgeoning social sciences. Micro- sociology courses at the University of Chicago were among the earliest and most prominent courses on urban sociological research in the United States. Evolution of the discipline The evolution and transition of sociological theory from the Chicago School began to emerge in the 1970s with the publication of Claude Fischer's (1975) \\"Toward a Theory of Subculture Urbanism\\" which incorporated Bourdieu's theories on social capital and symbolic capital within the invasion and succession framework of the Chicago School in explaining how cultural groups form, expand and solidify a neighbourhood. The theme of transition by subcultures and groups within the city was further expanded by Barry Wellman's (1979) \\"The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers\\" which determined the function and position of the individual, institution and community in the urban landscape in relation to their community. Wellman's categorization and incorporation of community focused theories as \\"Community Lost\\", \\"Community Saved\\", and \\"Community Liberated\\" which center around the structure of the urban community in shaping interactions between individuals and facilitating active participation in the local community are explained in detail below: Community lost: The earliest of the three theories, this concept was developed in the late 19th century to account for the rapid development of industrial patterns that seemingly caused rifts between the individual and their local community. Urbanites were claimed to hold networks that were ‚Äúimpersonal, transitory and segmental‚Äù, maintaining ties in multiple social networks while at the same time lacking the strong ties that bound them to any specific group. This disorganization in turn caused members of urban communities to subsist almost solely on secondary affiliations with others, and rarely allowed them to rely on other members of the community for assistance with their needs. Community saved: A critical response to the community lost theory that developed during the 1960s, the community saved argument suggests that multistranded ties often emerge in sparsely-knit communities as time goes on, and that urban communities often possess these strong ties, albeit in different forms. Especially among low-income communities, individuals have a tendency to adapt to their environment and pool resources in order to protect themselves collectively against structural changes. Over time urban communities have tendencies to become ‚Äúurban villages‚Äù, where individuals possess strong ties with only a few individuals that connect them to an intricate web of other urbanities within the same local environment. Community liberated: A cross- section of the community lost and community saved arguments, the community liberated theory suggests that the separation of workplace, residence and familial kinship groups has caused urbanites to maintain weak ties in multiple community groups that are further weakened by high rates of residential mobility. However, the concentrated number of environments present in the city for interaction increase the likelihood of individuals developing secondary ties, even if they simultaneously maintain distance from tightly knit communities. Primary ties that offer the individual assistance in everyday life form out of sparsely-knit and spatially dispersed interactions, with the individual's access to resources dependent on the quality of the ties they maintain within their community.Wellman, B., The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers American Journal of Sociology: Volume 84, Number 4, 1979. Along with the development of these theories, urban sociologists have increasingly begun to study the differences between the urban, rural and suburban environment within the last half-century. Consistent with the community liberated argument, researchers have in large part found that urban residents tend to maintain more spatially-dispersed networks of ties than rural or suburban residents. Among lower-income urban residents, the lack of mobility and communal space within the city often disrupts the formation of social ties and lends itself to creating an unintegrated and distant community space. While the high density of networks within the city weakens relations between individuals, it increases the likelihood that at least one individual within a network can provide the primary support found among smaller and more tightly knit networks. Since the 1970s, research into social networks has focused primarily on the types of ties developed within residential environments. Bonding ties, common of tightly knit neighborhoods, consist of connections that provide an individual with primary support, such as access to income or upward mobility among a neighborhood organization. Bridging ties, in contrast, are the ties that weakly connect strong networks of individuals together. A group of communities concerned about the placement of a nearby highway may only be connected through a few individuals that represent their views at a community board meeting, for instance.Granovetter, M., \\"The Strength of Weak Ties\\", American Journal of Sociology,78(6), 1360‚Äì1380, 1973. However, as theory surrounding social networks has developed, sociologists such as Alejandro Portes and the Wisconsin model of sociological research began placing increased leverage on the importance of these weak ties.Portes, A., and Sensenbrenner, J.,\\"Embeddedness and immigration: notes on the social determinants of economic action,\\" American Journal of Sociology, 98, pp. 1320‚Äì1350, 1993. While strong ties are necessary for providing residents with primary services and a sense of community, weak ties bring together elements of different cultural and economic landscapes in solving problems affecting a great number of individuals. As theorist Eric Oliver notes, neighborhoods with vast social networks are also those that most commonly rely on heterogeneous support in problem solving, and are also the most politically active.Oliver, E., Democracy in Suburbia Connecticut: Princeton University Press, 2001. As the suburban landscape developed during the 20th century and the outer city became a refuge for the wealthy and, later, the burgeoning middle class, sociologists and urban geographers such as Harvey Molotch, David Harvey and Neil Smith began to study the structure and revitalization of the most impoverished areas of the inner city. In their research, impoverished neighborhoods, which often rely on tightly knit local ties for economic and social support, were found to be targeted by developers for gentrification which displaced residents living within these communities.Smith, N., The New Urban Frontier: Gentrification and the Revanchist City, London: Routledge, 1996. Political experimentation in providing these residents with semi-permanent housing and structural support ‚Äì ranging from Section 8 housing to Community Development Block Grant programs- have in many cases eased the transition of low-income residents into stable housing and employment. Yet research covering the social impact of forced movement among these residents has noted the difficulties individuals often have with maintaining a level of economic comfort, which is spurred by rising land values and inter-urban competition between cities in as a means to attract capital investment.Harvey, D., \\"\\"From Managerialism to Entrepreneurialism: The Transformation in Urban Governance in Late Capitalism\\". Geografiska Annaler. Series B, Human Geography, 71, pp. 3‚Äì17, 1989. Molotch, H., \\"The City as a Growth Machine: Toward a Political Economy of Place\\". American Journal of Sociology, 82(2), pp. 309‚Äì332, 1976. The interaction between inner-city dwellers and middle class passersby in such settings has also been a topic of study for urban sociologists. In a September, 2015 issue of \\"City & Community(C&C;),\\" the article discusses future plans and discusses research needed for the coming future. The article proposes certain steps in order to react to urban trends, create a safer environment, and prepare for future urbanization. The steps include: publishing more C&C; articles, more research towards segregation in metropolitan areas, focus on trends and patterns in segregation and poverty, decrease micro-level segregation, and research towards international urbanization changes. However, in a June, 2018 issue of C&C;, Mike Owen Benediktsson argues that spatial inequality, the idea of a lack of resources through a specific space, would be problematic for the future of urban sociology. Problems in neighborhoods arise from political forms and issues. He argues that attention should be more on the relationship between spaces rather than expansion of more urban cities. Criticism Many theories in urban sociology have been criticized, most prominently directed toward the ethnocentric approaches taken by many early theorists that lay groundwork for urban studies throughout the 20th century. Early theories that sought to frame the city as an adaptable ‚Äúsuperorganism‚Äù often disregarded the intricate roles of social ties within local communities, suggesting that the urban environment itself rather than the individuals living within it controlled the spread and shape of the city. For impoverished inner-city residents, the role of highway planning policies and other government-spurred initiatives instituted by the planner Robert Moses and others have been criticized as unsightly and unresponsive to residential needs. The slow development of empirically-based urban research reflects the failure of local urban governments to adapt and ease the transition of local residents to the short-lived industrialization of the city. Some modern social theorists have also been critical toward the apparent shortsightedness that urban sociologists have shown toward the role of culture in the inner city. William Julius Wilson has criticized theory developed throughout the middle of the twentieth century as relying primarily on structural roles of institutions, and not how culture itself affects common aspects of inner-city life such as poverty. The distance shown toward this topic, he argues, presents an incomplete picture of inner-city life. The urban sociological theory is viewed as one important aspect of sociology. The concept of urban sociology as a whole has often been challenged and criticized by sociologists through time. Several different aspects from race, land, resources, etc. have broadened the idea. Manuel Castells questioned if urban sociology even exists and devoted 40 years worth of research in order to redefine and reorganize the concept. With the growing population and majority of Americans living in suburbs, Castells believes that most researchers focus their work of urban sociology around cities, neglecting the other major communities of suburbs, towns, and rural areas. He also believes that urban sociologists have over complicated the term of urban sociology and should possibly create a more clear and organized explanation to their studies, arguing that a \\"Sociology of Settlements,\\" would cover most issues around the term. Many urban sociologists focus behind the concept behind human overpopulation. Perry Burnett, who studied at the University of Southern Indiana, researched behind the idea of Urban sprawl and city optimization for human population. Some sociologists would criticize that urbanization could range issues from racial discrimination to high income taxes. Burnett would counter the idea that urban overpopulation could actually benefit the efficiency of cities. His work would equate optimal resources, incomes, households, etc. to display that larger and more city sizes would be more beneficial through more equal income and land distribution.

Overview The structure resembles a cross- section of a swimming pool, essentially two concave ramps (or quarter-pipes), topped by copings and decks, facing each other across a flat transition, also known as a tranny. Originally half-pipes were half sections of a large diameter pipe. Since the 1980s, half-pipes contain an extended flat bottom between the quarter-pipes; the original style half-pipes are no longer built. Flat ground provides time to regain balance after landing and more time to prepare for the next trick. Half-pipe diagram Half-pipe applications include leisure recreation, skills development, competitive training, amateur and professional competition, demonstrations, and as an adjunct to other types of skills training. A skilled athlete can perform in a half-pipe for an extended period of time by pumping to attain extreme speeds with relatively little effort. Large (high amplitude) half-pipes make possible many of the aerial tricks in BMX, skating and skateboarding. For winter sports such as freestyle skiing and snowboarding, a half-pipe can be dug out of the ground or snow perhaps combined with snow buildup. The plane of the transition is oriented downhill at a slight grade to allow riders to use gravity to develop speed and facilitate drainage of melt. In the absence of snow, dug out half-pipes can be used by dirtboarders, motorcyclists, and mountain bikers. Performance in a half-pipe has been rapidly increasing over recent years. The current limit performed by a top-level athlete for a rotational trick in a half-pipe is 1440 degrees (four full 360 degree rotations). In top level competitions, rotation is generally limited to emphasize style and flow.  Origin  In the early 1970s, swimming pools were used by skateboarders in a manner similar to surfing ocean waves. In 1975, some teenagers from Encinitas, California, and other northern San Diego County communities began using water pipes in the central Arizona desert associated with the Central Arizona Project, a federal public works project to divert water from the Colorado River to the city of Phoenix. Tom Stewart, one of these young California skateboarders, looked for a more convenient location to have a similar skateboarding experience. Stewart consulted with his brother Mike, an architect, on how to build a ramp that resembled the Arizona pipes. With his brother's plans in hand, Tom built a wood frame half-pipe in the front yard of his house in Encinitas. In a few days, the press had gotten word about Tom's creation and contacted him directly. Tom then went on to create Rampage, Inc. and began selling blueprints for his half-pipe design. About five months later, Skateboarder magazine featured both Tom Stewart and Rampage. Little did Tom know that his design would go on to inspire countless others to follow in his foot steps.  Design  Mini ramp (no vertical) The character of a half-pipe depends on the relationship between four attributes: most importantly, the transition radius and the height, and less so, the degree of flat bottom and width. Extra width allows for longer slides and grinds. The flat bottom, while valued for recovery time, serves no purpose if it is longer than it needs to be. Thus, it is the ratio between height and transition radius that determines the personality of a given ramp, because the ratio determines the angle of the lip. On half-pipes which are less than vertical, the height, typically between 50% and 75% of the radius, profoundly affects the ride up to and from the lip, and the speed at which tricks must be executed. Ramps near or below of height sometimes fall below 50% of the height of their radius. Technical skaters use them for advanced flip tricks and spin maneuvers. Smaller transitions that maintain the steepness of their larger counterparts are commonly found in pools made for skating and in custom mini ramps. The difficulty of technical tricks is increased with the steepness, but the feeling of dropping in from the coping is preserved. Common mistake in the construction of ramps is constant radius in transitions: Most of the ramps are built with a quarter circle of constant radius for easy construction, but the best ramps are not constant radius but a parabola with little final vert (vertical). The parabola allows for easy big air with return still on the curve and not on the flat. Construction of a cycloid = Mathematics = A cycloid profile will theoretically give the fastest half-pipe if friction is neglected. It is then called a brachistochrone curve. Such a curve in its pure form has infinitely short verts and is œÄ times as wide as it is high. = Skateboarding, freestyle BMX, Scootering, and aggressive inline skating = Vert ramp at the 2010 Boardmasters Festival during the first skateboard free practice session Frame and support for skateboard, BMX, and inline skating half-pipes frequently consist of a 2x6x8\\" lumber (actual 38 x 140 x 184 mm) framework sheathed in plywood finished with sheets of masonite or Skatelite. Also, a metal frame finished in wood or metal is sometimes used. Most commercial and contest ramps are surfaced by attaching sheets of some form of masonite to a frame. Many private ramps are surfaced in the same manner but may use plywood instead of masonite as surface material. Some ramps are constructed by spot-welding sheet metal to the frame, resulting in a fastener-free surface. Recent developments in technology have produced various versions of improved masonite substances such as Skatelite, RampArmor, and HARD-Nox.Skatelite These ramp surfaces are far more expensive than traditional materials. Channels, extensions, and roll- ins are the basic ways to customize a ramp. Sometimes a section of the platform is cut away to form a roll-in and a channel to allow skaters to commence a ride without dropping in and perform tricks over the gap. Extensions are permanent or temporary additions to the height of one section of the ramp that can make riding more challenging. Creating a spine ramp is another variation of the half-pipe. A spine ramp is basically two quarter pipes adjoined at the vertical edge. Half-pipe at Riverside Skatepark (designed by Andy Kessler) Manhattan, NYC - 2019  Snow Half-pipes  Half- pipe in snow Half-pipes in snow were originally done in large part by hand or with heavy machinery. Pipes were cut into snow using an apparatus similar to a grain elevator. The inventor was Colorado farmer Doug Waugh who created the Pipe Dragon used in both the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics. The current method of half-pipe cutting is by use of a Zaugg Pipe Monster. Zaugg is based in Eggiwil, Switzerland. Zaugg Pipe Monsters have been used to build the Winter Olympic half-pipes, Winter X-Games, US Open Snowboarding Championship, the World Cup, and many, many more events around the world. The Pipe Monster uses five cutting edges called haspels to cut the snow, rather than a chain this also creates an elliptical shape that is safer and allows the rider to gain more speed. In winter sports, a halfpipe is called a superpipe. The tallest Snow Halfpipe in the world is currently located in LAAX, Switzerland. With a height of 6.90 m (22.6 ft) this Halfpipe has held the world record since the 2014/2015 Season and regularly hosts the LAAX Open. There are two major companies training snowcat operators and building half-pipes for events such as the X Games.

The institution A pronoia was a grant that temporarily transferred imperial fiscal rights to an individual or institution. These rights were most commonly taxes or incomes from cultivated lands, but they could also be other income streams such as water and fishing rights, customs collection, etc. and the various rights to a specific piece of geography could be granted to separate individuals. Grants were for a set period, usually lifetime, and revokable at will by the Emperor. When institutions, usually monasteries, received grants they were effectively in perpetuity since the institutions were ongoing. Grants were not transferable or (excluding certain exceptional cases late in the institution) hereditary; a pronoia gave the grantee possession, not ownership, which remained Imperial.\\"Economics in Late Byzantine World,\\" from Foundation of the Hellenic World http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html The limits and specifics of a pronoia were recorded in an Imperial document called praktika (\\"records\\"); holders of pronoia (the grantees, in other words) were called pronoiarios, and those working the income stream in question (for instance, farmers on the land) were called paroikoi in the documents. The word pronoia could refer to the grant itself (land, for instance), its monetary value, or the income it produced.\\"Economics in Late Byzantine World,\\" from Foundation of the Hellenic World http://www1.fhw.gr/chronos/10/en/o/oa/oa3.html Although pronoia were often used to reward military service or other loyalties, they carried no specific military obligation (in contrast to feudal fiefs), although the threat of revocation provided coercive power for the state. Early pronoia system The pronoetes was the holder of a pronoia. The Latin term to define this officer was curator and is to be identified with the curator domus divinae, the administrator of imperial lands since the time of Augustus.Frederick Lauritzen, Leichoudes' pronoia of the Mangana, Zbornik Radova Vizantinoloskog Instituta 55 (2018) 81-96 By the 11th century, Roman aristocrats had ceased to hold any significant power. Honorific titles and power were granted by the emperor and competition was fierce; the most desired grants were those that involved governance and tax collecting in various pieces of the Empire. By the reign of Constantine IX in the middle part of the century they had also begun to assert sovereignty over various parts of the empire, collecting taxes for themselves and often plotting rebellions against the emperor. In the late 11th century Alexius I attempted to reform the aristocracy, taking the pacifying measure of distributing Roman territory amongst its members. Doing so had the added benefit of removing them from Constantinople, making it harder for them to directly challenge the emperor's authority. Most pronoiai granted by Alexius, however, were to members of his own (Comnenus) family. Alexius simply legitimized the holding of land by aristocrats, and brought it under centralized state control. Pronoia in the 12th century Alexius' grandson Manuel I Comnenus continued to grant land to the aristocrats, but also extended pronoiai to aristocratic officers in the army, in place of giving them a regular salary. Pronoiai developed into essentially a license to tax the citizens who lived within the boundaries of the grant (the paroikoi). Pronoiars (those who had been granted a pronoia) became something like tax collectors, who were allowed to keep some of the revenue they collected. This idea was not completely new; centuries before, Heraclius had reorganized the empire's land into military districts called Themata. Under this system, military officers (strategoi) ran each district and collected rent from the peasants who farmed the land. However, the paroikoi, under either the Thema or pronoia system, were not serfs as peasants were in the feudal system of western Europe. They owed no particular loyalty or service to the strategos or pronoiar, as in both cases the emperor was still the legal owner of the land. The pronoiar was most likely not even a native of the land he had been granted. The size and value of the pronoia, the number of paroikoi, and the duties owed by them were recorded in praktika. A pronoiar would likely be able to collect trade revenue and part of the crop harvested on the land, and could also hold hunting rights and transportation rights. A praktika also recorded the duties owed by the pronoiar to the emperor. If necessary, the emperor could request military service, although the pronoiar could not force his taxpayers to join him. Pronoiars were often reluctant to give military service if they lived a prosperous life on their grant, and they had some autonomy if they chose not to serve. If they could gain the support of their taxpayers, they could lead rebellions against the empire, but these were not as dangerous as rebellions in the capital, which Alexius' system could now more successfully avoid. Neither Alexius, Manuel, or the other 12th century emperors seemed to worry about provincial rebellions, seemingly assuming that a pronoia grant would eventually appease a rebellious noble. During the Fourth Crusade, Alexius IV still thought this way, and granted Crete to Boniface of Montferrat, under the assumption that the Crusaders would go away if their leader had some land. Pronoia under the Palaeologan Dynasty After the Crusaders captured Constantinople in 1204, the pronoia system continued in the Empire of Nicaea, where the emperors ruled in exile. John III Ducas Vatatzes also gave pronoiai to the church and noblewomen, which had not been done before. When Constantinople was recaptured by Michael VIII Palaeologus in 1261, he allowed pronoiai to be inherited, which made the empire more like the feudal states in Europe. He also audited the pronoiai to make their values more realistic according to contemporary conditions, as the empire had lost much of its land and revenue since the 11th century. Under the Palaeologans, pronoiars could more easily be organized into military units if the emperor required their service. The emperor could also confiscate the revenues for whatever reason. Andronicus II Palaeologus, for example, used the money raised by the pronoiars to finance military expeditions against the Bulgarians, but he did not require them to provide military service themselves. During this time pronoiars could also attract followers by giving them pronoia grants of their own. Recruiting pronoiars to form an army helped unite the remnants of the empire after 1261. However, there were by this time only a few thousand pronoiars, and although they paid for their own expenses, the emperors could not afford a full army or navy to strengthen the empire's defenses. The impoverished empire had very little tax revenue, and pronoiars began to extract rents from the paroikoi, turning back to the old Thema system. The empire continued to lose land to the Ottoman Empire, and Constantinople was finally lost in 1453, but the Ottomans continued to use their own version of the pronoia system, called the timar system, which they had borrowed from the Eastern Romans during their conquests.

His biographer, the 19th-century historian J. H. Round, called him \\"the most perfect and typical presentment of the feudal and anarchic spirit that stamps the reign of Stephen.\\" That characterisation has been disputed since the later 20th century. Early career He succeeded his father, William, sometime before 1129, possibly as early as 1116. A key portion of the family patrimony in Essex was in the King's hands. William had incurred a debt to the crown, perhaps in part due to a large fine levied by Henry I due to his displeasure at the escape of an important political prisoner when William was in charge of the Tower of London. The King also held the substantial estate of Geoffrey's maternal grandfather Eudo le Dapifer to which Geoffrey laid claim. Geoffrey gained Eudo's lands and his father's offices during the shifting tides of fortunes of the two competitors for the English throne after King Henry I's death in 1135. He initially supported Stephen, who sometime in 1140 (most likely May of that year) made him Earl of Essex. By 1140 or 1141 Stephen had returned to him the lucrative manors in Essex. He founded a Benedictine priory (later Walden Abbey) at Walden, Essex and constructed a castle there. He also contributed to Hurley Priory in Berkshire, which had been founded by his grandfather Geoffrey de Mandeville I. After the defeat and capture of Stephen at Lincoln early in 1141, Earl Geoffrey, like many barons, acknowledged Stephen's rival Empress Matilda as his sovereign lady. She confirmed his custody of the Tower, forgave the large debts his father had incurred to the crown, granted him the Norman lands of Eudo le Dapifer, and appointed him Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire, Middlesex and London. When Stephen was released in December of that year, Earl Geoffrey returned to his original allegiance. There has been much scholarly debate over the dating of the charters he received from King Stephen and Empress Matilda. Depending on the order and timing of those documents, either Geoffrey appears to have been playing off one against the other to get what he wanted or his support was courted by the rival claimants to the throne. The king arrested the earl in 1143 and, threatened with execution, Geoffrey surrendered his castles of Pleshey and Saffron Walden as well as custody of the Tower of London to Stephen. In reaction, Earl Geoffrey launched a rebellion . Outlaw activity and death In 1143‚Äì1144 Earl Geoffrey maintained himself as a rebel and a bandit in the fen-country, using the Isle of Ely and Ramsey Abbey as his headquarters. He was besieged by King Stephen and met his death at Burwell, Cambridgeshire in September 1144 in consequence of an arrow wound received in a skirmish. Because he had died excommunicate, his body initially was denied burial at the monastery he had founded, Walden Priory. Wrapped in lead, it was accepted eventually by the Templar community in London for burial within the Temple Church in London. His son Geoffrey III arranged for an effigy to be placed on the floor, where it can still be seen today. Significance His career is interesting for several reasons. The charters he received from King Stephen and Empress Matilda illustrate the ambitions of English barons. The most important concessions are grants of offices and jurisdictions, which had the effect of making Mandeville almost a viceroy with full powers in Essex and Hertfordshire, Middlesex and London, but these were based on offices and jurisdictions his ancestors had held. His career as an outlaw exemplifies the worst excesses of the civil wars of 1140‚Äì1147, and it is possible that the deeds of Mandeville inspired the rhetorical description of this period in the Peterborough Chronicle, when \\"men said openly that Christ and his saints were asleep.\\" He had seized Ramsey Abbey (near Peterborough) in 1143, expelling the monks and using Ramsey as a base for forays into the surrounding region, sacking Cambridge and other smaller settlements.Alison Taylor, \\"Cambridge, the hidden history\\", (Tempus: 1999) , p75https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mandeville,_Geoffrey_de_(DNB00) Marriage and offspring Geoffrey married Rohese de Vere (c. 1110‚Äì1167 or after), daughter of Aubrey de Vere II and sister of the first earl of Oxford. He had four sons: * Arnulf/Ernulf de Mandeville, illegitimate, supported his father in rebellion and was exiled shortly after the earl's death. He returned to England, probably in the reign of King Henry II, and there witnessed several charters issued by his half brothers, the 2nd and 3rd earls of Essex.J. C.

The term is opposed to hardwood, which is the wood from angiosperm trees. Characteristics Softwood is wood from gymnosperm trees such as pines and spruces. Softwoods are not necessarily softer than hardwoods. In both groups there is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness, the range of density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods. Some hardwoods (e.g. balsa) are softer than most softwoods, while the hardest hardwoods are much harder than any softwood. The woods of longleaf pine, Douglas fir, and yew are much harder in the mechanical sense than several hardwoods. Softwoods are generally most used by the construction industry and are also used to produce paper pulp, and card products. In many of these applications, there is a constant need for density and thickness monitoring and gamma-ray sensors have shown good performance in this case. Certain species of softwood are more resistant to insect attack from woodworm, as certain insects prefer damp hardwood. As gymnosperms, softwood reproduces using cones and occasionally nuts. Examples of softwood trees and uses * Douglas fir - joinery, doors and heavy construction * Eastern white pine - furniture * European spruce - used throughout construction, panelling and cladding * Larch - used for cladding and boats * Lodgepole pine - roofing, flooring and in making chipboard and particle board * Parana pine - stair treads and joinery * Scots pine - construction industry, mostly for interior work * Sitka spruce - * Southern yellow pine - joinery, flooring and decking * Western hemlock - doors, joinery and furniture * Western red cedar (or red cedar) - furniture, decking, cladding, and roof shingles * Yew - interior and exterior furniture e.g. chairs, gate posts and wood turning Applications Softwood is the source of about 80% of the world's production of timber,United Nations with traditional centres of production being the Baltic region (including Scandinavia and Russia), North America and China.

For the 13th-century 3rd Earl of the second creation see William FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex. William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex (1st Creation) (died 14 November 1189) was a loyal councillor of Henry II and Richard I of England. William was the second son of Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex and Rohese de Vere, Countess of Essex. After his father's death while in rebellion (1144), William grew up at the court of the Count of Flanders. On the death of his elder brother Geoffrey late in 1166, he returned to England and became Earl of Essex, where he spent much time at the court of Henry II. He stayed loyal to the king during the Revolt of 1173‚Äì1174, known as the Revolt of the Young King. In 1177 William became a crusader, in company with Count Philip of Flanders. Philip attempted to intervene in the court politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem but was rebuffed, and the two fought for the Principality of Antioch at the siege of Harim. William returned to England in the autumn of 1178. In 1180 William married Hawise, daughter and heiress of William, Count of Aumale, a major Yorkshire lord, who had died the previous year. Earl William gained possession of her lands, both in Normandy and in England, along with the title of Count of Aumale (or Earl of Albemarle as it is sometimes called). William fought in the wars against the French toward the end of Henry II's reign, and was at the deathbed of that king in 1189. He carried the crown at the coronation of Richard I and enjoyed the favour of the new king. Richard I appointed him one of the two chief justiciars of England.Powicke, Handbook of British Chronology p. 69 But William died at Rouen a few months later on a mission to Normandy, without legitimate issue. He was buried at Mortemar Abbey in Normandy, founded by his Mandeville ancestors.Book of the Foundation of Walden, ed. D. Greenway and L. Watkiss (Oxford: 1999), p. 82. The heir to the vast Mandeville estate was William's elderly aunt, Beatrice de Say, n√©e Mandeville, who surrendered her claim to her second but surviving son, Geoffrey de Say. Geoffrey contracted to pay an unprecedentedly large relief for the Mandeville inheritance, but he rapidly fell into arrears. Geoffrey Fitz Peter, the husband of Beatrice's granddaughter and namesake, Beatrice de Say, was a prominent man at court and used his position to push his wife's claim. She was the eldest daughter of William de Say, Geoffrey's elder but deceased brother, William de Say. The king awarded the Mandeville estates and, eventually, the earldom of Essex to Geoffrey Fitz Peter by right of his wife.Greenway and Watkiss, eds., The Book of the Foundation of Walden Monastery.

In the same way that a sampler has much in common with a synthesizer, software samplers are in many ways similar to software synthesizers and there is great deal of overlap between the two, but whereas a software synthesizer generates sounds algorithmically from mathematically-described tones or short-term waveforms (i.e., less than 100 ms in length), a software sampler always reproduces samples, often much longer than a second, as the first step of its algorithm.  History  In the 1990s and 2000s the increases in computer power and memory capacity have made it possible to develop software applications that provide the same capabilities as hardware-based units. These are typically produced as plug-in instruments‚Äî-for example, using the VST system.

It was initially commissioned by the Roman Emperor Hadrian as a mausoleum for himself and his family. The building was later used by the popes as a fortress and castle, and is now a museum. The structure was once the tallest building in Rome. Hadrian's tomb Michael the Archangel, the angel from whom the building derives its name. Ponte Sant'Angelos Angel figures The tomb of the Roman emperor Hadrian, also called Hadrian's mole, was erected on the right bank of the Tiber, between AD 134 and 139. Originally the mausoleum was a decorated cylinder, with a garden top and golden quadriga. Hadrian's ashes were placed here a year after his death in Baiae in 138, together with those of his wife Sabina, and his first adopted son, Lucius Aelius, who died in 138. Following this, the remains of succeeding emperors were also placed here, the last recorded deposition being Caracalla in 217. The urns containing these ashes were probably placed in what is now known as the Treasury Room, deep within the building. Hadrian also built the Pons Aelius facing straight onto the mausoleum ‚Äì it still provides a scenic approach from the center of Rome and the left bank of the Tiber, and is renowned for the Baroque additions of statues of angels holding aloft instruments of the Passion of Christ. Decline Much of the tomb contents and decorations have been lost since the building's conversion to a military fortress in 401 and its subsequent inclusion in the Aurelian Walls by Flavius Honorius Augustus. The urns and ashes were scattered by Visigoth looters during Alaric's sacking of Rome in 410, and the original decorative bronze and stone statuary were thrown down upon the attacking Goths when they besieged Rome in 537, as recounted by Procopius. An unusual survivor, however, is the capstone of a funerary urn (probably that of Hadrian), which made its way to Saint Peter's Basilica, covered the tomb of Otto II and later was incorporated into a massive Renaissance baptistery.Porphyry Baptismal Font The use of spolia from the tomb in the post-Roman period was noted in the 16th century ‚Äì Giorgio Vasari writes: Legend holds that the Archangel Michael appeared atop the mausoleum, sheathing his sword as a sign of the end of the plague of 590, thus lending the castle its present name. A less charitable yet more apt elaboration of the legend, given the militant disposition of this archangel, was heard by the 15th-century traveler who saw an angel statue on the castle roof. He recounts that during a prolonged season of the plague, Pope Gregory I heard that the populace, even Christians, had begun revering a pagan idol at the church of Santa Agata in Suburra. A vision urged the pope to lead a procession to the church. Upon arriving, the idol miraculously fell apart with a clap of thunder. Returning to St Peter's by the Aelian Bridge, the pope had another vision of an angel atop the castle, wiping the blood from his sword on his mantle, and then sheathing it. While the pope interpreted this as a sign that God was appeased, this did not prevent Gregory from destroying more sites of pagan worship in Rome.Account of Pedro Tafur in The Travels of Pero Tafur (1435‚Äì1439), Chapter III. View from the top of the Castel Sant'Angelo towards the ancient city core of Rome. Papal fortress, residence and prison The popes converted the structure into a castle, beginning in the 14th century; Pope Nicholas III connected the castle to St Peter's Basilica by a covered fortified corridor called the Passetto di Borgo. The fortress was the refuge of Pope Clement VII from the siege of Charles V's Landsknechte during the Sack of Rome (1527), in which Benvenuto Cellini describes strolling the ramparts and shooting enemy soldiers. Leo X built a chapel with a Madonna by Raffaello da Montelupo. In 1536 Montelupo also created a marble statue of Saint Michael holding his sword after the 590 plague (as described above) to surmount the Castel.Rome (Eyewitness Travel Guides) DK Publishing, London (2003) p. 242 Later Paul III built a rich apartment, to ensure that in any future siege the pope had an appropriate place to stay. Montelupo's statue was replaced by a bronze statue of the same subject, executed by the Flemish sculptor Peter Anton von Verschaffelt, in 1753. Verschaffelt's is still in place and Montelupo's can be seen in an open court in the interior of the Castle. The Papal state also used Sant'Angelo as a prison; Giordano Bruno, for example, was imprisoned there for six years. Other prisoner were the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini and the magician and charlatan Cagliostro. Executions were performed in the small inner courtyard. As a prison, it was also the setting for the third act of Giacomo Puccini's 1900 opera Tosca; the eponymous heroine leaps to her death from the Castel's ramparts. Museum Decommissioned in 1901, the castle is now a museum: the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo. It received 1,234,443 visitors in 2016.

It later developed into a political party, which still exists today. The three most senior surviving leaders, Issa Sesay, Morris Kallon and Augustine Gbao, were convicted in February 2009 of war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Creation  The Revolutionary United Front initially coalesced as a group of Sierra Leoneans which led National Patriotic Front of Liberia elements across the border in an attempt to replicate Charles Taylor's earlier success in toppling the Liberian government.Adekeye Adebayo, Liberia's Civil War, 2002, p. 90, citing Paul Richards, Fighting for the Rainforest: War, Youth, and Resources in Sierra Leone, (Oxford, James Currey, 1996) and papers presented by Ibraham Abdullah, Patrick Muana, and David Keen at University College London, 21 October 2005. Full bibliographical information is at Adebayo, p. 98. The RUF was created by Foday Sankoh, of Temne background, and some allies, Abu Kanu, Rashid Mansaray, with substantial assistance from Charles Taylor of Liberia.David M. Crane , Special Court for Sierra Leone (February 5, 2004) At first, the RUF was popular with Sierra Leoneans, many of whom resented a Freetown elite seen as corrupt and looked forward to promised free education and health care and equitable sharing of diamond revenues. However, the RUF developed a reputation internationally for its terrible cruelty towards the civilian population during its decade-long struggle, especially its practice of hacking off limbs to intimidate and spread terror among the population, and its widespread use of child soldiers.David M. Crane When it was first formed, the RUF put forward the slogan, \\"No More Slaves, No More Masters. Power and Wealth to the People.\\" While its goal was clearly to change the government of Sierra Leone, the RUF gave little indication of what sort of government would replace it. The group did not advocate Marxism or any similar leftist ideology, nor did it advocate extreme nationalism or Fascism. It also did not claim to be a force fighting for a certain ethnic group or region. At one point, during ongoing peace negotiations in 1995, RUF published a pamphlet entitled \\"Footpaths to Democracy: Toward a New Sierra Leone\\", which contained some rhetorical references to social justice and pan-Africanism.  Coup  Foday Sankoh did not stand by his earlier promises of equitably sharing of diamond revenues and used these funds to buy arms for himself.Taylor Baines, , Global Policy Forum, (February 1, 2001) With the diamond mines under the control of the rebel party, the RUF became singularly focused on protecting its resource base. Sierra Leone's economy collapsed, with ordinary citizens trapped between the cruelty of RUF troops and starvation. After a coup by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) in 1997, the RUF and AFRC created a joint junta to control the country before being evicted from the capital by the invasion of a Nigerian-led West African force that reinstated the rule of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. The war is estimated to have cost the lives of 200,000 people.  Child soldiers  Child soldiers were heavily recruited in the Sierra Leone Civil War; a total of 11,000 are thought to have participated in the conflict., UN Most were used for attacks on villages and on guard duty at diamond fields as well as guarding weapons stockpiles. Today, about 2,000 are still left serving in the military of Sierra Leone. The RUF made extensive use of child soldiers, using horrific methods to numb their new recruits to barbarity.Peter Takirambudde, , Human Rights Watch (May 31, 2000) Thousands of abducted boys and girls were forced to serve as soldiers or as prostitutes,, BBC News and those chosen to be fighters were sometimes forced to murder their parents.Joseph Opala, , Washington Post (May 14, 2000) Guerrillas frequently carved the initials \\"RUF\\" on their chests,, Washington Post (September 19, 2001)Douglas Farah , Washington Post (April 8, 2000) and officers reportedly rubbed cocaine into open cuts on their troops to make them maniacal and fearless.Mar Roman, , The Associated Press (April 19, 2007), Amnesty International (31 August 2000) For entertainment, some soldiers would bet on the sex of an unborn baby and then slice open a woman's womb to determine the winner., The Economist (August 7th, 2003), Medical Foundation for the care of victims of torture The RUF abducted children aged 7 to 12, but were known to take children as young as 5 years old. The children were notoriously known by captains and civilians for their unquestionable obedience and enormous cruelty.  Atrocities  In response to the immediate execution of rebels by government forces, the RUF instituted a policy of cutting off the hands of captured soldiers with the intent of sending the message, \\"You don't hold your weapon against your brother.\\"Sorious Samura, , CNN (December 23, 2001) Brandishing machetes, RUF rebels amputated the hands, arms, and legs of tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans. The RUF indicated that the reason for these actions was that amputees could no longer mine diamonds, which might be used to support government troops., CNN (January 18, 2001) The election slogan at that time was that the people 'had power in their hands', so the RUF would hack the hands off to prevent voting. RUF members are also said to have practiced cannibalism., The Economist (January 7th, 1999) The government set up a refugee camp where they gathered amputees; the camp was situated next to the international hotels. They also helped fund the camps and gave them food and water., Monograph, No 80, (March 2003) Foreign intervention In March 1997, Sankoh fled to Nigeria, where he was put under house arrest, and then imprisoned. From this time until Sankoh's release in 1999, Sam Bockarie performed the task of director of military operations of the RUF. In 1999, an intervention by the USA, the United Kingdom, and other countries as well as the UN resulted in the signing of the Lom√© Peace Accord on 7 July 1999. Sankoh was allowed to return under the conditions of the agreement. However fighting again broke out, and the United Nations sent peacekeeping troops in hopes of integrating the RUF into a new national army. This intervention failed as well, and by 2000 they held 500 UN peacekeepers hostage until their release was negotiated by Taylor. The British and Guineans finally sent in a small professional force in 2001. The RUF was routed following several crushing defeats at the hands of the Indian and British special forces and the revolution ended. Sankoh was captured by a mob and handed to the British where he was indicted for multiple war crimes by a UN-backed court. In 2003 Sankoh died in prison before the trial took place. Four years later, during the sessions of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, prosecutors claimed that Charles Taylor had actively participated in directing the RUF's strategy from Liberia; among the allegations was that he had arranged to transport RUF commanders to Monrovia to meet with them personally.\\"Alleged Taylor-RUF Racket Detailed\\".

This conflict arose in 1982 and its effects are still seen today. British Columbia, the major Canadian exporter of softwood lumber to the United States, was most affected, reporting losses of 9,494 direct and indirect jobs between 2004 and 2009. The heart of the dispute is the claim that the Canadian lumber industry is unfairly subsidized by federal and provincial governments, as most timber in Canada is owned by the provincial governments. The prices charged to harvest the timber (stumpage fee) are set administratively, rather than through the competitive marketplace, the norm in the United States. In the United States, softwood lumber lots are privately owned, and the owners form an effective political lobby. The United States claims that the Canadian arrangement constitutes an unfair subsidy, and is thus subject to U.S. trade remedy laws, where foreign trade benefiting from subsidies can be subject to a countervailing duty tariff, to offset the subsidy and bring the price of the commodity back up to market rates. The Canadian government and lumber industry dispute this assertion, based on a number of factors, including that Canadian timber is provided to such a wide range of industries, and that lack of specificity makes it ineligible to be considered a subsidy under U.S. law. Under U.S. trade remedy law, a countervailable subsidy must be specific to a particular industry. This requirement precludes imposition of countervailing duties on government programs, such as roads, that are meant to benefit a broad array of interests. Since 1982, there have been four major iterations of the dispute.  Importance of lumber to Canada's economy  The softwood lumber industry is vital to the Canadian economy and has employed thousands of people. The forest industry has contributed to direct jobs for about 232,700 individuals. Indirectly, 289,000 people have been hired to work in other sectors that depend on Canada's forests. They include engineering, transportation, and construction. Such benefit from this industry can be seen in the nation's GDP, which added $21.2 billion in 2014. That accounted for around 1.3% of real GDP. Canada has the biggest trade surplus in relation to forest products ($21.7 billion in 2015). As the largest market, the U.S. is heavily dependent on Canada's lumber. The needs of the US outweigh the domestic supply. Canada has also been expanding rapidly into the Asian market, with China being the second-largest importer. The U.S. accounted for 69% of Canada's softwood lumber exports in 2015. This is an increased share of Canadian softwood lumber exports, which reached its lowest level in 2011, accounting for only 54%. China in that same year accounted for 21%. Softwood Lumber Agreement In April 2006, the United States and Canada announced that they had reached a tentative settlement to end the dispute. The Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA), which this became known as, went into full effect in October 2006. The conditions stated that the period for this agreement would last anywhere between seven and nine years. Both countries, in 2012, approved a two-year extension. Under the preliminary terms, the United States would lift countervailing and anti-dumping duties provided lumber prices continue to stay above a certain range. Below the specified range, a mixed export tax and quota regime would be implemented on imports of Canadian lumber. On Canada's part, the nation agreed to enforce regulations, such as in the form of taxes on lumber exports headed to the U.S. The provincial governments of Canada, specifically, were encouraged to make changes to their pricing systems. Such changes would allow for a non-subsidizing system. As a part of the deal, more than $5 billion in duty deposits collected would be returned. The SLA establishes a dispute settlement mechanism based around the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), a nongovernmental institution. Either country may initiate dispute settlement of matters arising under the SLA or implementation thereof. Hearings are to be open to the public, as are pleadings and other documents.John R. Crook, ed., American Journal of International Law, Contemporary Practice of the United States Relating to International Law: UNITED STATES AND CANADA ARBITRATE A SOFTWOOD LUMBER DISPUTE IN THE LONDON COURT OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, 102 Am. J. Int'l L. 192 (January 2008). The agreement states that hearings are to be held in either the United States or Canada (the venue is selected by the arbitration tribunal). The SLA also provides that decisions of an arbitration panel are binding on the two parties. Lumber I The beginnings of the softwood lumber dispute, commonly referred to as Lumber I, were in 1982, when the U.S. lumber industry petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce (DoC) to impose a countervailing duty. Ultimately, the DoC found that Canada's stumpage system was not specific to any single industry and thus not countervailable. While the DoC made this claim, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) believed that these Canadian imports did in fact hinder U.S. producers. The U.S. lumber industry chose not to appeal. Lumber II The second phase, Lumber II, began in 1986, when a U.S. lumber industry group, the U.S. Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, petitioned the Department of Commerce. The USITC once again arrived at the conclusion that Canada's exports unfairly impacted American producers. This time, the DoC did find Canadian forest programs to be countervailable and set a preliminary duty of 15%. Before the subsidy was imposed, the United States and Canada agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding that created a phased tariff. One of the terms of the MOU was that Canada levy an export tax on lumber traveling to the United States. Provinces that were affected had the chance to reduce this tax, if they performed any action meant to counterbalance their subsidies. British Columbia had the tax removed in 1987 while Quebec had it partly lifted in 1988. Lumber III Lumber III started in 1991 when Canada informed the United States it was withdrawing from the Memorandum of Understanding. In response, the Department of Commerce initiated a countervailing duty investigation, resulting in the DoC imposing countervailing duties. The Department of Commerce issued a final determination in May 1992, setting a countervailing duty rate of 6.51 percent. This time, the Department of Commerce's determination was reviewed by a binational panel organized under the Canada‚ÄìU.S. Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA), the predecessor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Prior to the signing of NAFTA, the DoC decision would have been reviewed by the United States Court of International Trade, but under CUSFTA, Canada had the option to have it reviewed by a binational panel, and they selected that option. The panel of three Canadians and two Americans found that the DoC's determination could not be supported by substantial evidence; which was a controversial decision, because the vote was along national lines, and the majority decision was based on the concept that U.S. law required the Department of Commerce to not only establish the existence of a subsidy, but also prove that the subsidy benefited the Canadian lumber industry. The U.S. Congress subsequently amended the law to explicitly state there was no \\"effects test\\". Additionally, the United States claimed that two of the Canadian panelists had conflicts of interests, and brought it before an extraordinary challenge committee. Again, this committee split along national lines. In 1996, the United States and Canada reached a five-year trade agreement, The Softwood Lumber Agreement, officially ending Lumber III. Under its terms, Canadian lumber exports to the United States were limited to 14.7 billion board feet (34.7 million cubic meters) per year. However, when the agreement expired on April 2, 2001, the two countries were unable to reach consensus on a replacement agreement. Lumber IV Many American homes are built of Canadian softwood lumber. Three days after the Softwood Lumber Agreements expired, the U.S. lumber industry petitioned the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties. In addition, the U.S. industry for the first time brought an anti-dumping claim, arguing Canadian lumber companies were also engaged in unfair price discrimination. On April 25, 2002, U.S. DoC announced it had determined subsidy and anti-dumping rates, of 18.79% and an 8.43% respectively, to give a combined rate of 27.22%, although specific companies were charged varying rates. By February 26, 2003, 15,000 workers had been laid off, primarily in British Columbia, as a result of the duties imposed by the United States. On May 27, the World Trade Organization issued a non-binding ruling in Canada's favor with regard to U.S. anti-dumping duties. The decision was appealed to a legally binding NAFTA panel. On August 13, the panel ruled that while the Canadian lumber industry could be considered subsidized, the DoC had improperly calculated duties based on U.S. stumpage prices: there was no \\"world market price\\" for timber, as the DoC had asserted, and it was therefore improper for DoC to calculate duties based on U.S. timber prices rather than Canadian market conditions. It accordingly ordered DoC to reassess its method of calculating duties. Two weeks later, a WTO panel similarly concluded that the U.S. had imposed improperly high duties on Canadian lumber. The panel agreed with the DoC's contention that provincial stumpage fees did provide a \\"financial benefit\\" to Canadian producers, but ruled that this benefit did not rise to the level that would constitute a subsidy, and could not justify the U.S. duties. On January 19, 2004, the WTO Appellate Body issued a final ruling with respect to the countervailing duty determination largely in Canada's favor (WTO Dispute 257). On August 11 of that same year, the Appellate Body issued a final ruling with respect to U.S. anti-dumping duties (WTO Dispute 264). In the meantime, because of an adverse WTO decision, the USITC reopened the administrative record, pursuant to a special provision in U.S. law, and issued a new affirmative threat of injury determination in December 2004. This new determination allowed the countervailing and anti-dumping duty tariffs to remain in place. Between June 7, 2004, and October 5, 2005, DoC submitted five revised estimates of justifiable duties to the NAFTA panel, each successively lower than the last, the last being 1.21%, but each time the NAFTA panel found errors with each one and ordered it to recalculate. On April 15, 2005, the Canadian Minister of Trade, Jim Peterson, announced that the federal government would provide Canadian softwood lumber associations with $20 million in compensation for their legal expenses stemming from the dispute with the United States. That same year, another NAFTA Chapter 19 panel reviewed a determination made by the USITC that the U.S. lumber industry was under a threat of injury due to Canadian imports. Since the United States ceded jurisdiction to the World Trade Organization, it was necessary for the U.S. government to establish that a domestic industry was suffering injury, or faced a threat of injury, before countervailing duties can be imposed. The NAFTA panel found the USITC's determination invalid. In addition, the panel made the controversial decision to deny the USITC to reopen the administrative record, ordering the USITC to issue a negative determination based on the existing record. Unlike the panel during the Lumber III stage, this panel's decision was unanimous. However, the U.S. government challenged its decision before an extraordinary challenge committee, which, on August 10, 2005, issued a unanimous decision against the United States, finding that the NAFTA panel's determination was not sufficiently invalid to require vacatur or remand, under the standards of NAFTA. On August 15, 2005, the United States said it would not abide by the NAFTA decision, because the Section 129 determination superseded the decision which was reviewed by the NAFTA panel. Two weeks later, on August 30, the WTO, which had previously ruled against the ITC, this time upheld their new Section 129 \\"threat of injury\\" ruling. In September 2005, a U.S. lumber industry associate filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, challenging the constitutionality of the NAFTA Chapter 19 dispute settlement system. On November 24, 2005, the U.S. Commerce Department announced it would comply with a separate NAFTA panel's order to cut a 16 percent duty on Canadian softwood lumber imports for now. The following month, the DoC announced recalculated countervailing and anti-dumping duties on softwood, totaling 10.8 percent. In March 2006, a NAFTA panel ruled in Canada's favor, finding that the subsidy to the Canadian lumber industry was de minimis, i.e., a subsidy of less than one percent. Under U.S. trade remedy law, countervailing duty tariffs are not imposed for de minimis subsidies. A tentative deal was reached in July 2006, in which Canada got $4 billion of the $5.3 billion it lost because of the penalties with no additional tariffs to be imposed. After initial opposition from several large Canadian lumber concerns, the Harper government, without specifying how many companies endorsed it, was confident that there would be enough support to culminate the deal. In August 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper brought the new deal to Parliament for discussion and a possible confidence vote. If the House of Commons had voted against the deal, it would have automatically forced a general election and annulled the deal. The Conservatives were in favor of the deal, while the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party were against, leaving the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois as the deciding party. On September 7, Bloc Qu√©b√©cois Leader Gilles Duceppe endorsed the softwood lumber deal, effectively neutralizing any chance of an election coming out of a non-confidence vote. Five days later, Canadian International Trade Minister David Emerson, along with U.S. counterpart Susan Schwab, officially signed the deal in Ottawa. Despite supporters' claims that it was the best deal possible, Elliott Feldman, an international and economic law specialist from the firm Baker & Hostetler in Washington, D.C. and a former director of the Canadian‚ÄìAmerican Business Council, criticized the deal as \\"one-sided\\" and a \\"bad deal for Canada\\". On September 19, 2006, the deal passed its first reading in the Canadian House of Commons with a 172‚Äì116 majority. On September 27, the Canadian Press reported that Canada did not meet an October 1 deadline imposed by itself to implement the agreement. Withdrawal of some of the 30 issues regarding the deal was the main reason for the delay on complying to the deal. On March 30, 2007, the United States requested formal consultations with Canada to resolve concerns regarding Canada's lack of implementation of the export measures. The following month, on April 19, formal consultations took place between the two governments On August 7, the United States, pursuant to a settlement mechanism established in the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA), initiated arbitration in the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA, a private body). The official request for arbitration took place on August 13. Canada responded to this request for arbitration on September 12. The next year, on January 18, the U.S. government filed a second arbitration request, this one focused on the provincial implementation programs of Ontario and Qu√©bec. Canada responded on February 18, 2008. On March 4, the LCIA ruled (in the first arbitration) that Canada was in violation of the 2006 SLA in its eastern provinces, but not in its western provinces. The panel had been made up of a Belgian arbitrator nominated by Canada, a British arbitrator named by the United States, and a panel president from Germany. On February 26, 2009, the LCIA announced its ruling in the second arbitration case: Canada was in breach of the softwood lumber agreement as a result of its failure to properly calculate quotas from January to June in 2007. The arbitration body ordered that sawmills in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan pay an additional ten percent export charge (up to $68.26 million). The tribunal imposed a 30-day deadline to rectify the breach. Looking ahead The Softwood Lumber Agreement expired on October 12, 2015. Canadian producers of softwood lumber now have unfettered access to the US softwood lumber market. There are several impediments that have kept Canada and the US from negotiating a new agreement to replace the SLA. One key factor is that Canada held a federal election campaign through the late summer and fall of 2015, and any decisions of considerable magnitude had to wait until after the election. Given the acrimonious history of the US‚ÄìCanada lumber trade prior to the SLA, the negotiation process will likely be lengthy. Some in Western Canada have expressed a desire to renew the SLA as it currently stands, while other are demanding revisions. Some officials in Quebec believe that the province has made the necessary changes to their forestry practices to make them exempt from any future agreement, much the same as the Maritime provinces. And some producers in Saskatchewan have expressed a desire to switch to the Option A system used in BC and Alberta, which assesses a larger tax but has no quota restrictions. Canadian ownership of US sawmills continues to climb with the count now reaching 40 mills, up from just two a decade earlier. West Fraser now owns more sawmills in the US South (16) than in Canada (13), Canfor Corp owns 11 sawmills in the South, one less than its Canadian total. Interfor owns 13 sawmills in the US ‚Äì nine in the South and four in the Northwest. It owns five sawmills in Canada. The growing trend of Canadian ownership of US mills is driven by the potential for a lumber trade conflict, by timber availability and lower labour costs in the US. Amid the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation in Western Canada, these firms' ability to grow is severely diminished without looking outside of Canada. Major industry organizations in the United States, on the other hand, do not want to renew the contract. Executive director of the U.S. Lumber Coalition Zoltan Van Heyningen has expressed his disapproval for the ongoing format of the agreement. One of the reasons for this is changing timber costs, which the U.S. believes has not been incorporated in B.C. lumber costs. The US Lumber Coalition is emphatic that, should negotiations fail, its legal standing to petition the US Commerce Department to file a new case is secure. In early March 2016, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Obama instructed their respective cabinet members responsible for international trade to explore all options for resolving the trade dispute. Canada's international trade minister, Chrystia Freeland, said that \\"what we have committed to is to make significant, meaningful progress towards a deal‚Äîto have the structure, the key elements there a 100 days from now\\". On 12 October 2016, a one-year moratorium on trade actions since the expiration of the deal ended. As of November 2016, Freeland had formally met with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman twelve times in the past year. During these talks, Canada sent ten proposals and papers to the United States, which sent four to Canada. In November 2016, CNN obtained a leaked memo from the Donald Trump transition team showing that Trump was being advised to include the softwood lumber dispute during any renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement and to get more favourable terms for the United States. On April 24, 2017, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his agency will impose new anti-subsidy tariffs averaging 20 percent on Canadian softwood lumber imports, a move that escalates a long-running trade dispute between the two countries. A Commerce Department fact sheet on the pending announcement seen by Reuters shows that West Fraser Mills will pay the highest duties at 24.12 percent, followed by Canfor Corp at 20.26 percent. Resolute FP Canada Ltd will pay a 12.82 percent duty, while Tolko Marketing and Sales and Tolko Industries will pay a 19.50 percent duty and J. D. Irving Ltd, will pay 3.02 percent. All other Canadian producers face a 19.88 percent duty, according to the document. On April 25, 2017, the Trump administration announced plans to impose duties of up to 24% on most Canadian lumber, charging that lumber companies are subsidized by the government.https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-canadian- lumber-20170425-story.html The duties are on the five firms: West Fraser Mills, Tolko Marketing and Sales, J. D. Irving, Canfor Corporation, and Resolute FP Canada. West Fraser Mills will pay the highest duty of 24%.https://money.cnn.com/2017/04/24/investing/canada-lumber-tariff- trump/index.html?iid=EL The preliminary determination directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require cash deposits for the duties on all new imports as well as softwood products imported over the past 90 days. To remain in effect, however, the duties need to be finalized by Commerce and then confirmed by the U.S. International Trade Commission after an investigation that includes testimony from both sides. In response, the Canadian federal government indicated that it was exploring the possibility of banning United States coal from being exported through Canadian ports and imposing a retaliatory tariff on lumber exports from Oregon. By November 2017, the U.S. International Trade Commission decided to levy heavy countervailing and anti- dumping duties on lumber imports, citing that the U.S. industry has been harmed by unfair practices. The decision was unanimous for the four-member trade panel, which ruled on the petition filed by the U.S. Lumber Coalition. Canada immediately lodged a legal challenge to the decision under NAFTA's Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism, with an official statement declaring that it was \\"unfair, unwarranted, and troubling.\\" Canada has previously won several NAFTA challenges involving softwood issues in the past. In March 2018, Canada escalated the dispute to the WTO, asking the international trade body to set up an adjudication panel to judge its dispute with the United States. Canadian representatives argued that talks with the U.S. have failed. On April 1, 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated the First Administrative Review (AR1) of antidumping duty and countervailing duty investigations of imports of certain softwood lumber products from Canada. The Department of Commerce its preliminary determination for the First Administrative Review on February 7, 2020. The preliminary determination included an assessment rate to be applied to exports during the period of review (April 28, 2017 through December 31, 2018) and a new cash deposit rate to be applied to new shipments upon completion of the review. The rates will only be applicable to companies covered by the First Administrative Review. On January 2, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced the Second Administrative Review (AR2) of antidumping duty and countervailing duty investigations of imports of certain softwood lumber products from Canada. The Second Administrative Review was initiated on March 10, 2020. An administrative review will be conducted each year, unless the case is settled, to recalculate the countervailing and antidumping duty rates for shipments during the period of review and to establish a new cash deposit rate for future shipments. A company will be subject to the review if there has been a specific request for a review of that company filed by interested parties with the Department of Commerce.

Old Goa was the second capital after Bijapur of the rule of Adil Shahi Dynasty. It was surrounded by a moat and contained the shah's palace, mosques, and temples. The city was captured by the Portuguese and was under Portuguese rule from 1510 as the administrative seat of Portuguese India. The viceroy's residence was transferred in 1759 to the future capital, Panjim (a village about 9 kilometres to its west). Few remnants, if any, of the pre-Portuguese period remain at Old Goa. During the mid-16th century, the Portuguese colony of Goa, especially Velha Goa, was the center of Christianisation in the East. The city was evangelized by all religious orders, since all of them had their headquarters there. The population was roughly 200,000 by 1543. Malaria and cholera epidemics ravaged the city in the 17th century and it was largely abandoned, only having a remaining population of 1,500 in 1775. It was then that the viceroy moved to Panjim. It continued to be the de jure capital of Goa until 1843, when the capital was shifted to Panjim (Ponnj√™ in Konkani, Nova Goa in Portuguese and Panaji in Hindi). The abandoned city came to be known as \\"Velha Goa\\" (in Portuguese, 'Old Goa'), to distinguish it from the new capital Nova Goa (Panjim) and probably also Goa Velha (also meaning \\"Old Goa\\"), which was the Portuguese name for the town on the old site of Govapuri. Velha Goa was incorporated into the Republic of India after its annexation in 1961, with the rest of Goa. It retains its religious significance in modern-day Goa, notably in its relations with Roman Catholicism. The Archbishop of Goa and Daman holds title as the Patriarch of the East Indies. Unlike the patriarchs and the major archbishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches, the Patriarch of the East Indies only enjoys honorary title and is fully subject to the Pope. He has a place in the Latin Church similar to the Patriarchs of Venice and Lisbon. This title was conferred upon the Archbishop of Goa as part of a settlement between the Holy See and the Portuguese government concerning the link between religious and political aspects of its territories. Churches of Old Goa Old Goa contains churches including the Se Cathedral (the seat of the Archbishop of Goa), the Church and Convent of St. Francis of Assisi, the Chapel of Our Lady of the Mount, the Church of St. Caetano and, notably, the Basilica of Bom Jesus which contains the relics of Saint Francis Xavier, who is celebrated every year on 3 December with novenas beginning on 24 November.

The revolution was named Xinhai (Hsin-hai) because it occurred in 1911, the year of the Xinhai () stem-branch in the sexagenary cycle of the traditional Chinese calendar.Li Xing. [2010] (2010). The Rise of China and the Capitalist World Order. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. , . p. 91. The revolution consisted of many revolts and uprisings. The turning point was the Wuchang uprising on 10 October 1911, which was the result of the mishandling of the Railway Protection Movement. The revolution ended with the abdication of the six-year-old Last Emperor, Puyi, on 12 February 1912, that marked the end of 2,000 years of imperial rule and the beginning of China's early republican era.Li, Xiaobing. [2007] (2007). A History of the Modern Chinese Army. University Press of Kentucky. , . pp. 13, 26‚Äì27. The revolution arose mainly in response to the decline of the Qing state, and its ineffective efforts to modernize China and confront foreign aggression. Many underground anti-Qing groups, with the support of Chinese revolutionaries in exile, tried to overthrow the Qing. The brief civil war that ensued was ended through a political compromise between Yuan Shikai, the late Qing military strongman, and Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Tongmenghui (United League). After the Qing court transferred power to the newly founded republic, a provisional coalition government was created along with the National Assembly. However, political power of the new national government in Beijing was soon thereafter monopolized by Yuan and led to decades of political division and warlordism, including several attempts at imperial restoration. The Republic of China in Taiwan and the People's Republic of China on the mainland both consider themselves the legitimate successors to the 1911 Revolution and honor the ideals of the revolution including nationalism, republicanism, modernization of China and national unity. 10 October is commemorated in Taiwan as Double Ten Day, the National Day of the ROC. In mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, the day is celebrated as the Anniversary of the 1911 Revolution.  Background  After suffering its first defeat to the West in the First Opium War in 1842, the Qing imperial court struggled to contain foreign intrusions into China. Efforts to adjust and reform the traditional methods of governance were constrained by a deeply conservative court culture that did not want to give away too much authority to reform. Following defeat in the Second Opium War in 1860, the Qing tried to modernize by adopting certain Western technologies through the Self- Strengthening Movement from 1861.Wang, Gabe T. [2006] (2006). China and the Taiwan Issue: Impending War at Taiwan Strait. University Press of America. , . p. 91. In the wars against the Taiping (1851‚Äì64), Nian (1851‚Äì68), Yunnan (1856‚Äì68) and the Northwest (1862‚Äì77), the traditional imperial troops proved themselves incompetent and the court came to rely on local armies.Wang, Ke- wen. [1998] (1998). Modern China: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism. Taylor & Francis publishing. , . p. 106. p. 344. In 1895, China suffered another defeat during the First Sino-Japanese War.Bevir, Mark. [2010] (2010). Encyclopedia of Political Theory. Sage Publishing. , . p. 168. This demonstrated that traditional Chinese feudal society also needed to be modernized if the technological and commercial advancements were to succeed. In 1898 the Guangxu Emperor was guided by reformers like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao for a drastic reform in education, military and economy under the Hundred Days' Reform. The reform was abruptly cancelled by a conservative coup led by Empress Dowager Cixi.Chang, Kang-i Sun, Owen, Stephen (2010). The Cambridge History of Chinese Literature, Volume 2. Cambridge University Press. , . p. 441. The Guangxu Emperor, who had always been a puppet dependent on Cixi, was put under house arrest in June 1898. Reformers Kang and Liang would be exiled. While in Canada, in June 1899, they tried to form the Emperor Protection Society in an attempt to restore the emperor. Empress Dowager Cixi mainly controlled the Qing dynasty from this point on. The Boxer Rebellion prompted another foreign invasion of Beijing in 1900 and the imposition of unequal treaty terms, which carved away territories, created extraterritorial concessions and gave away trade privileges. Under internal and external pressure, the Qing court began to adopt some of the reforms. The Qing managed to maintain its monopoly on political power by suppressing, often with great brutality, all domestic rebellions. Dissidents could operate only in secret societies and underground organizations, in foreign concessions or in exile overseas. Organization for revolution =Earliest groups= There were many revolutionaries and groups that wanted to overthrow the Qing government to re-establish Han-led government. The earliest revolutionary organizations were founded outside of China, such as Yeung Ku-wan's Furen Literary Society, created in Hong Kong in 1890. There were 15 members, including Tse Tsan-tai, who did political satire such as \\"The Situation in the Far East\\", one of the first ever Chinese manhua, and who later became one of the core founders of the South China Morning Post.South China morning post. 29 March 2011. Hong Kong played a key role in the life of Sun Yat-sen. Dr. Sun Yat-sen in London Sun Yat-sen's Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society) was established in Honolulu in 1894 with the main purpose of raising funds for revolutions.Lum, Yansheng Ma. Lum, Raymond Mun Kong. [1999] (1999). Sun Yat-sen in Hawaii: Activities and Supporters. University of Hawaii Press. , . pg 6‚Äì7 The two organizations were merged in 1894.Curthoys, Ann. Lake, Marilyn. [2005] (2005). Connected Worlds: History in Transnational Perspective. ANU Publishing. , . p. 101. =Smaller groups= The Huaxinghui (China Revival Society) was founded in 1904 with notables like Huang Xing, Zhang Shizhao, Chen Tianhua and Song Jiaoren, along with 100 others. Their motto was \\"Take one province by force, and inspire the other provinces to rise up\\".Platt, Stephen R. [2007] (2007). Provincial Patriots: The Hunanese and Modern China. Harvard University Press. , . p. 128. The Guangfuhui (Restoration Society) was also founded in 1904, in Shanghai, by Cai Yuanpei. Other notable members include Zhang Binglin and Tao Chengzhang.Goossaert, Vincent. Palmer, David A. [2011] (2011). The Religious Question in Modern China. University of Chicago Press. , . Despite professing the anti-Qing cause, the Guangfuhui was highly critical of Sun Yat-sen.Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998). Modern China: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism. Taylor & Francis Publishing. , . p. 287. One of the most famous female revolutionaries was Qiu Jin, who fought for women's rights and was also from Guangfuhui. There were also many other minor revolutionary organizations, such as Lizhi Xuehui (ÂãµÂøóÂ≠∏ÊúÉ) in Jiangsu, Gongqianghui (ÂÖ¨Âº∑ÊúÉ) in Sichuan, Yiwenhui (ÁõäËÅûÊúÉ) and Hanzudulihui (Êº¢ÊóèÁç®Á´ãÊúÉ) in Fujian, Yizhishe (ÊòìÁü•Á§æ) in Jiangxi, Yuewanghui (Â≤≥ÁéãÊúÉ) in Anhui and Qunzhihui (Áæ§Êô∫ÊúÉ/Áæ§Êô∫Á§æ) in Guangzhou.‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂ§ßÂ≠¶. ‰π¶Êä•ËµÑÊñô‰∏≠ÂøÉ.

This is the revolutionary group that would eventually develop a strong link with the later Communist Party. Sun Yat-sen with members of the Tongmenghui =Tongmenghui= Sun Yat-sen successfully united the Revive China Society, Huaxinghui and Guangfuhui in the summer of 1905, thereby establishing the unified Tongmenghui (United League) in August 1905 in Tokyo. While it started in Tokyo, it had loose organizations distributed across and outside the country. Sun Yat-sen was the leader of this unified group. Other revolutionaries who worked with the Tongmenghui include Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin. When the Tongmenhui was established, more than 90% of the Tongmenhui members were between 17 and 26 years of age.Et≈ç, Shinkichi. Schiffrin, Harold Z. [2008] (2008). China's Republican Revolution.

In Tokyo Liu Shipei proposed the overthrow of the Manchus and a return to Chinese classical values. In Paris Li Shizhen, Wu Zhihui and Zhang Renjie agreed with Sun on the necessity of revolution and joined the Tongmenghui, but argued that a political replacement of one government with another government would not be progress; revolution in family, gender and social values would remove the need for government and coercion. Zhang Ji was among the anarchists who defended assassination and terrorism as means toward revolution, but others insisted that only education was justifiable. Important anarchists included Cai Yuanpei, Wang Jingwei and Zhang Renjie, who gave Sun major financial help. Many of these anarchists would later assume high positions in the Kuomintang (KMT).

The online version is unpaginated. =Views= Many revolutionaries promoted anti-Qing/anti-Manchu sentiments and revived memories of conflict between the ethnic minority Manchu and the ethnic majority Han Chinese from the late Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644). Leading intellectuals were influenced by books that had survived from the last years of the Ming dynasty, the last dynasty of Han Chinese. In 1904, Sun Yat-sen announced that his organization's goal was \\"to expel the Tatar barbarians, to revive Zhonghua, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people.\\" (È©ÖÈô§ÈüÉËôú, ÊÅ¢Âæ©‰∏≠ËèØ, ÂâµÁ´ãÊ∞ëÂúã, Âπ≥ÂùáÂú∞Ê¨ä).Ë®àÁßãÊ•ì, Êú±ÊÖ∂ËëÜ.

Strata and groups The 1911 Revolution was supported by many groups, including students and intellectuals who returned from abroad, as well as participants of the revolutionary organizations, overseas Chinese, soldiers of the new army, local gentry, farmers and others. =Overseas Chinese= Assistance from overseas Chinese was important in the 1911 Revolution. In 1894, the first year of the Revive China Society, the first meeting ever held by the group was held in the home of Ho Fon, an overseas Chinese who was the leader of the first Chinese Church of Christ.Lee, Khoon Choy Lee. [2005] (2005). Pioneers of Modern China: Understanding the Inscrutable Chinese. World Scientific. , 9789812566188. Overseas Chinese supported and actively participated in the funding of revolutionary activities, especially the Southeast Asian Chinese of Malaya (Singapore and Malaysia).Gao, James Zheng.

Many of these groups were reorganized by Sun, who was referred to as the \\"father of the Chinese revolution\\". = Newly emerged intellectuals = In 1906, after the abolition of the imperial examinations, the Qing government established many new schools and encouraged students to study abroad. Many young people attended the new schools or went abroad to study in places like Japan.Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. . p. 96. p. 106. A new class of intellectuals emerged from those students, who contributed immensely to the 1911 Revolution. Besides Sun Yat- sen, key figures in the revolution, such as Huang Xing, Song Jiaoren, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin and Wang Jingwei, were all Chinese students in Japan. Some were young students like Zou Rong, known for writing the book Revolutionary Army, in which he talked about the extermination of the Manchus for the 260 years of oppression, sorrow, cruelty and tyranny and turning the sons and grandsons of Yellow Emperor into George Washingtons.Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. . p. 109. Before 1908, revolutionaries focused on coordinating these organizations in preparation for uprisings that these organizations would launch; hence, these groups would provide most of the manpower needed for the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. After the 1911 Revolution, Sun Yat-sen recalled the days of recruiting support for the revolution and said, \\"The literati were deeply into the search for honors and profits, so they were regarded as having only secondary importance. By contrast, organizations like Sanhehui were able to sow widely the ideas of resisting the Qing and restoring the Ming.\\"Complete works of Sun Yat-sen „ÄäÁ∏ΩÁêÜÂÖ®ÈõÜ„Äã First edition, page 920 =Gentry and businessmen= Prince Qing with some royal cabinet members The strength of the gentry in local politics had become apparent. From December 1908, the Qing government created some apparatus to allow the gentry and businessmen to participate in politics. These middle-class people were originally supporters of constitutionalism. However, they became disenchanted when the Qing government created a cabinet with Prince Qing as prime minister.Rhoads, Edward J. M. [2000] (2000). Manchus & Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861‚Äì1928. University of Washington Press. , . pg21. By early 1911, an experimental cabinet had thirteen members, nine of whom were Manchus selected from the imperial family.Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998). Modern China: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism. Taylor & Francis Publishing. , . p. 76. =Foreigners= Besides Chinese and overseas Chinese, some of the supporters and participants of the 1911 Revolution were foreigners; among them, the Japanese were the most active group. Some Japanese even became members of Tongmenghui. Miyazaki Touten was the closest Japanese supporter; others included Heiyama Shu and Ry≈çhei Uchida. Homer Lea, an American, who became Sun Yat-sen's closest foreign advisor in 1910, supported Sun Yat-sen's military ambitions. British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern also took part in the revolution.Lau, Kit-ching Chan. [1990] (1990). China, Britain and Hong Kong, 1895‚Äì1945. Chinese University Press. , . p. 37. Some foreigners, such as English explorer Arthur de Carle Sowerby, led expeditions to rescue foreign missionaries in 1911 and 1912. The far right wing Japanese ultra-nationalist Black Dragon Society supported Sun Yat-sen's activities against the Manchus, believing that overthrowing the Qing would help the Japanese take over the Manchu homeland and that Han Chinese would not oppose the take over. Toyama believed that the Japanese could easily take over Manchuria and Sun Yat-sen and other anti-Qing revolutionaries would not resist and help the Japanese take over and enlargen the opium trade in China while the Qing was trying to destroy the opium trade. The Japanese Black Dragons supported Sun Yat-sen and anti-Manchu revolutionaries until the Qing collapsed. The far right wing Japanese ultranationalist Gen'y≈çsha leader T≈çyama Mitsuru supported anti-Manchu, anti-Qing revolutionary activities including the ones organised by Sun Yat-sen and supported Japanese taking over Manchuria. The anti-Qing Tongmenghui was founded and based in exile in Japan where many anti-Qing revolutionaries gathered. The Japanese had been trying to unite anti-Manchu groups made out of Han people to take down the Qing. Japanese were the ones who helped Sun Yat-sen unite all anti-Qing, anti-Manchu revolutionary groups together and there were Japanese like T≈çten Miyazaki inside of the anti-Manchu Tongmenghui revolutionary alliance. The Black Dragon Society hosted the Tongmenghui in its first meeting. The Black Dragon Society had very intimate relations with Sun Yat-sen and promoted pan-Asianism and Sun sometimes passed himself off as Japanese and they had connections with Sun for a long time. Japanese groups like the Black Dragon Society had a large impact on Sun Yat-sen. According to an American military historian, Japanese military officers were part of the Black Dragon Society. The Yakuza and Black Dragon Society helped arrange in Tokyo for Sun Yat-sen to hold the first Kuomintang meetings, and were hoping to flood China with opium and overthrow the Qing and deceive Chinese into overthrowing the Qing to Japan's benefit. After the revolution was successful, the Japanese Black Dragons started infiltrating China and spreading opium. The Black Dragons pushed for the takeover of Manchuria by Japan in 1932. Sun Yat-sen was married to a Japanese, Kaoru Otsuki. = Soldiers of the new armies = The New Army was formed in 1901 after the defeat of the Qings in the First Sino-Japanese War. They were launched by a decree from eight provinces. New Army troops were by far the best trained and equipped. The recruits were of a higher quality than the old army and received regular promotions. Beginning in 1908, the revolutionaries began to shift their call to the new armies. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionaries infiltrated the New Army.Spence, Jonathan D. [1990] (1990). The Search for Modern China. W. W. Norton & Company Publishing. , . pp. 250‚Äì256.  Uprisings and incidents  The central focus of the uprisings were mostly connected with the Tongmenghui and Sun Yat-sen, including subgroups. Some uprisings involved groups that never merged with the Tongmenghui. Sun Yat-sen may have participated in 8‚Äì10 uprisings; all uprisings failed prior to the Wuchang Uprising. Flag of the First Guangzhou Uprising =First Guangzhou Uprising= In the spring of 1895, the Revive China Society, which was based in Hong Kong, planned the First Guangzhou Uprising (Âª£Â∑ûËµ∑Áæ©). Lu Haodong was tasked with designing the revolutionaries' Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. On 26 October 1895, Yeung Ku-wan and Sun Yat-sen led Zheng Shiliang and Lu Haodong to Guangzhou, preparing to capture Guangzhou in one strike. However, the details of their plans were leaked to the Qing government.Ë®àÁßãÊ•ì, Êú±ÊÖ∂ËëÜ. [2001] (2001). ‰∏≠ÂúãËøë‰ª£Âè≤, Volume 1. Chinese University Press. , . p. 464. The government began to arrest revolutionaries, including Lu Haodong, who was later executed. The First Guangzhou Uprising was a failure. Under pressure from the Qing government, the government of Hong Kong forbade these two men to enter the territory for five years. Sun Yat-sen went into exile, promoting the Chinese revolution and raising funds in Japan, the United States, Canada and Britain. In 1901, following the Huizhou Uprising, Yeung Ku-wan was assassinated by Qing agents in Hong Kong.South China morning post. 6 April 2011. Waiting may be over at grave of an unsung hero. After his death, his family protected his identity by not putting his name on his tomb, just a number: 6348. = Independence Army Uprising = In 1901, after the Boxer Rebellion started, Tang Caichang (ÂîêÊâçÂ∏∏) and Tan Sitong of the previous Foot Emancipation Society organised the Independence Army. The Independence Army Uprising (Ëá™Á´ãËªçËµ∑Áæ©) was planned to occur on 23 August 1900.Wang, Ke-wen. [1998] (1998). Modern China: an encyclopedia of history, culture, and nationalism. Taylor & Francis Publishing. , . p. 424. Their goal was to overthrow Empress Dowager Cixi to establish a constitutional monarchy under the Guangxu Emperor. Their plot was discovered by the governors-general of Hunan and Hubei. About twenty conspirators were arrested and executed. = Huizhou Uprising = On 8 October 1900, Sun Yat-sen ordered the launch of the Huizhou Uprising (ÊÉ†Â∑ûËµ∑Áæ©).Gao, James Zheng. [2009] (2009). Historical dictionary of modern China (1800‚Äì1949). Scarecrow Press. , . Chronology section. The revolutionary army was led by Zheng Shiliang and initially included 20,000 men, who fought for half a month. However, after the Japanese Prime Minister prohibited Sun Yat-sen from carrying out revolutionary activities on Taiwan, Zheng Shiliang had no choice but to order the army to disperse. This uprising therefore also failed. British soldier Rowland J. Mulkern participated in this uprising. = Great Ming Uprising = A very short uprising occurred from 25 to 28 January 1903, to establish a \\"Great Ming Heavenly Kingdom\\" (Â§ßÊòéÈ†ÜÂ§©Âúã).Èô≥Èå´Á•∫.

Thubten Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama, returned to Tibet in January 1913 from Sikkim, where he had been residing.Mayhew, Bradley and Michael Kohn. (2005). Tibet, p. 32. Lonely Planet Publications. . When the new ROC government apologised for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama to his former position, he replied that he was not interested in Chinese ranks, that Tibet had never been subordinated to China, that Tibet was an independent country, and that he was assuming the spiritual and political leadership of Tibet. Because of this, many have read this reply as a formal declaration of independence. The Chinese side ignored the response, and Tibet had thirty years free of interference from China. =Mongolian independence= At the end of 1911, the Mongols took action with an armed revolt against the Manchu authorities but were unsuccessful in the attempt.Onon, Urgunge Onon.

Qing governor (Ë¢ÅÂ§ßÂåñ) fled and handed over his resignation to Yang Zengxin, because he could not handle fighting the revolutionaries.Millward, James A. [2007] (2007). Eurasian crossroads: a history of Xinjiang. Columbia University Press p. 168, 440. In the morning of 8 January, a new Yili government was established for the revolutionaries, but the revolutionaries would be defeated at Jinghe in January and February. Eventually because of the abdication to come, Yuan Shikai recognized Yang Zengxin's rule, appointed him Governor of Xinjiang and had the province join the Republic. Eleven more former Qing officials would be assassinated in Zhenxi, Karashahr, Aksu, Kucha, Luntai and Kashgar in April and May 1912. The revolutionaries printed a new multi-lingual media. =Taiwan Uprising= In 1911, the Tongmenghui sent (ÁæÖÁ¶èÊòü) to the island of Taiwan to wrest it from Japanese control.[1981] (2007).

Yuan Shikai selected Tang Shaoyi as his representative. Tang left Beijing for Wuhan to negotiate with the revolutionaries. The revolutionaries chose Wu Tingfang.

They agreed that Yuan Shikai would force the Qing emperor to abdicate in exchange for the southern provinces' support of Yuan as the president of the Republic. After considering the possibility that the new republic might be defeated in a civil war or by foreign invasion, Sun Yat-sen agreed to Yuan's proposal to unify China under Yuan Shikai's Beijing government. Further decisions were made to let the emperor rule over his little court in the New Summer Palace.

Huang Xing favored a flag bearing the mythical \\"well-field\\" system of village agriculture. In the end, the assembly compromised: the national flag would be the banner of Five Races Under One Union.

About ten of the guards died, but Yuan himself was not seriously injured. He sent a message to the revolutionaries the next day pledging his loyalty and asking them not to organize any more assassination attempts against him. Imperial edict for abdication =Abdication of the emperor= Zhang Jian drafted an abdication proposal that was approved by the Provisional Senate. On 20 January, Wu Tingfang of the Nanking Provisional Government officially delivered the imperial edict of abdication to Yuan Shikai for the abdication of Puyi. On 22 January, Sun Yat- sen announced that he would resign the presidency in favor of Yuan Shikai if the latter supported the emperor's abdication.Boorman, Howard L. Howard, Richard C. Cheng, Joseph K. H. [1970] (1970). Biographical dictionary of Republican China, V. 3. Columbia University Press. , . Yuan then pressured Empress Dowager Longyu with the threat that the lives of the imperial family would not be spared if abdication did not come before the revolutionaries reached Beijing, but if they agreed to abdicate, the provisional government would honor the terms proposed by the imperial family. On 3 February, Empress Dowager Longyu gave Yuan full permission to negotiate the abdication terms of the Qing emperor. Yuan then drew up his own version and forwarded it to the revolutionaries on 3 February. His version consisted of three sections instead of two. On 12 February 1912, after being pressured by Yuan and other ministers, Puyi (age six) and Empress Dowager Longyu accepted Yuan's terms of abdication. =Debate over the capital= As a condition for ceding leadership to Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen insisted that the provisional government remain in Nanjing. On 14 February, the Provisional Senate initially voted 20‚Äì5 in favor of making Beijing the capital over Nanjing, with two votes going for Wuhan and one for Tianjin.(Chinese) ËÉ°Áª≥Ê≠¶ \\"Ê∞ëÂõΩÂÖÉÂπ¥ÂÆöÈÉΩ‰πã‰∫â\\" Ê∞ëÂõΩÊ°£Ê°à p.1 2010-12-08 The Senate majority wanted to secure the peace agreement by taking power in Beijing. Zhang Jian and others reasoned that having the capital in Beijing would check against Manchu restoration and Mongol secession. But Sun and Huang Xing argued in favor of Nanjing to balance against Yuan's power base in the north.

They were allegedly started by disobedient troops of Cao Kun, a loyal officer of Yuan. The disorder gave Yuan the pretext to stay in the north to guard against unrest. On 10 March, Yuan was inaugurated in Beijing as the provisional president of the Republic of China.(Chinese) ËÉ°Áª≥Ê≠¶ \\"Ê∞ëÂõΩÂÖÉÂπ¥ÂÆöÈÉΩ‰πã‰∫â\\" Ê∞ëÂõΩÊ°£Ê°à p. 2 2010-12-08 On 5 April, the Provisional Senate in Nanjing voted to make Beijing the capital of the Republic and convened in Beijing at the end of the month.

[1993] (1993). Autocratic tradition and Chinese politics: Zhengyuan Fu. Cambridge University Press. , . p. 154. The government based in Beijing, called the Beiyang Government, was not internationally recognized as the legitimate government of the Republic of China until 1928, so the period from 1912 until 1928 was known simply as the \\"Beiyang Period\\". The first National Assembly election took place according to the Provisional Constitution. While in Beijing, the Kuomintang was formed on 25 August 1912.Hsueh, Chun-tu. Xue, Jundu. [1961] (1961). Huang Hsing and the Chinese revolution. Stanford University Press. , . The KMT held the majority of seats after the election. Song Jiaoren was elected as premier. However, Song was assassinated in Shanghai on 20 March 1913, under the secret order of Yuan Shikai.Fu, Zhengyuan. [1993] (1993). Autocratic tradition and Chinese politics. Cambridge University Press. , . pp 153‚Äì154. Proposed Han monarchs and retention of aristocratic noble titles Some advocated that a Han be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, or the Ming dynasty imperial family descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace. The Duke Yansheng was proposed for replacing the Qing dynasty as Emperor by Liang Qichao. The Han hereditary aristocratic nobility like the Duke Yansheng, Marquis of Extended Grace, and the title of the Wujing Boshi (changed to \\"Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Nanzong Fengsi Guan\\" Â§ßÊàêËá≥ËÅñÂÖàÂ∏´ÂçóÂÆóÂ•âÁ•ÄÂÆò) and the titles held by the descendants of Mencius, Zengzi, and Yan Hui were retained by the new Republic of China and the title holders continued to receive their pensions. Legacy =Social influence= After the revolution, there was a huge outpouring of anti-Manchu sentiment through China, but particularly in Beijing where thousands died in anti-Manchu violence as imperial restrictions on Han residency and behavior within the city crumbled as Manchu imperial power crumbled. Anti-Manchu sentiment is recorded in books like A Short History of Slaves (Â•¥ÊâçÂ∞èÂè≤) and The Biographies of Avaricious Officials and Corrupt Personnel (Ë≤™ÂÆòÊ±°ÂêèÂÇ≥) by Laoli (ËÄÅÂêè). During the abdication of the last emperor, Empress Dowager Longyu, Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat-sen both tried to adopt the concept of \\"Manchu and Han as one family\\" (ÊªøÊº¢‰∏ÄÂÆ∂).Rhoads, Edward J. M. [2000] (2000). Manchus & Han: ethnic relations and political power in late Qing and early republican China, 1861‚Äì1928. University of Washington publishing. , . p. 266. People started exploring and debating with themselves on the root cause of their national weakness. This new search of identity was the New Culture Movement.Tanner, Harold M. [2010] (2010). \\"China: From the Great Qing Empire through the People's Republic of China 1644‚Äì2009\\" Volume 2 of China: A History. Hackett Publishing. , . p. 123. Manchu culture and language, on the contrary, has become virtually extinct by 2007. Unlike revolutions in the West, the 1911 Revolution did not restructure society. The participants in the 1911 Revolution were mostly military personnel, old-type bureaucrats, and local gentries. These people still held regional power after the 1911 Revolution. Some became warlords. There were no major improvements in the standard of living. The writer Lu Xun commented in 1921 during the publishing of The True Story of Ah Q, ten years after the 1911 Revolution, that basically nothing changed except \\"the Manchus have left the kitchen\\".Fenby, Jonathan. [2008] (2008). The History of Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power. . p. 143. The economic problems were not addressed until the governance of Chiang Ching-kuo in Taiwan and Deng Xiaoping on the mainland. The 1911 Revolution mainly got rid of feudalism (fengjian) from Late Imperial China. In the usual view of historians, there are two restorations of feudal power after the revolution: the first was Yuan Shikai; the second was Zhang Xun.Yan, Jiaqi Yan. Hong, David S. K. Mair, Denis C. [1992] (1992). Toward a democratic China: the intellectual autobiography of Yan Jiaqi. University of Hawaii Press. , . p. 189, 251. Both were unsuccessful, but the \\"feudal remnants\\" returned to China with the Cultural Revolution in a concept called guanxi, where people relied not on feudal relationships, but personal relationships, for survival.Yang, Mayfair Mei-hui. [1994] (1994). Gifts, favors, and banquets: the art of social relationships in China. Cornell University Press. , 9780801495922. Pg 146‚Äì147. While guanxi is helpful in Taiwan, on the mainland, guanxi is necessary to get anything done.Luo, Yadong. [2007] (2007). Guanxi and business. Volume 5 of Asia-Pacific business series. World Scientific. , . p. 26. Due to the effects of anti-Manchu sentiment after the revolution, the Manchus of the Metropolitan Banners were driven into deep poverty, with Manchu men too impoverished to marry so Han men married Manchu women, Manchus stopped dressing in Manchu clothing and stopped practicing Manchu traditions. =Historical significance= The 1911 Revolution overthrew the Qing government and four thousand years of monarchy. Throughout Chinese history, old dynasties had always been replaced by new dynasties. The 1911 Revolution, however, was the first to overthrow a monarchy completely and attempt to establish a republic to spread democratic ideas throughout China. Though in 1911 at the provisional government proclamation ceremony, Sun Yat- sen said, \\"The revolution is not yet successful, the comrades still need to strive for the future.\\" ().Èô∏ÈüªËë≠. [2006] (2006). ‰∏äÊµ∑Áé©ÂÖ®ÊåáÂçó. Travelcom press. , . p. 49. Since the 1920s, the two dominant parties‚Äìthe ROC and PRC‚Äìsee the 1911 Revolution quite differently.South China morning post. 29 March 2011. Replacing chairman Mao with Sun Yat-sen. Both sides recognize Sun Yat-sen as the Father of the Nation, but in Taiwan, they mean \\"Father of the Republic of China\\". On the mainland, Sun Yat-sen was seen as the man who helped bring down the Qing, a pre-condition for the Communist state founded in 1949. The PRC views Sun's work as the first step towards the real revolution in 1949, when the communists set up a truly independent state that expelled foreigners and built a military and industrial power. The father of New China is seen as Mao Zedong. In 1954, Liu Shaoqi was quoted as saying that the \\"1911 Revolution inserted the concept of a republic into common people\\". Zhou Enlai pointed out that the \\"1911 Revolution overthrew the Qing rule, ended 4000 years of monarchy, and liberated the mind of people to a great extent, and opened up the path for the development of future revolution. This is a great victory.\\" =Modern evaluation= Commemorative coin, minted in Taiwan in 2011 A change in the belief that the revolution had been a generally positive change began in the late 1980s and 1990s, but Zhang Shizhao was quoted as arguing that \\"When talking about the 1911 Revolution, the theorist these days tends to overemphasize. The word 'success' was way overused.\\" The success of the democracy gained from the revolution can vary depending on one's view. Even after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, for sixty years, the KMT controlled all five branches of the government; none were independent.South China morning post. Sun Yat-sen and the centenary of the 1911 Revolution. 4 July 2010. Yan Jiaqi, founder of the Federation for a Democratic China, has said that Sun Yat-sen is to be credited as founding China's first republic in 1912, and the second republic is the people of Taiwan and the political parties there now democratizing the region. Meanwhile, the ideals of democracy are far from realised on the mainland. For example, former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao once said in a speech that without real democracy, there is no guarantee of economic and political rights; but he led a 2011 crackdown against the peaceful Chinese jasmine protests. Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy activist who received the global 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, died in prison. Others, such as Qin Yongmin (Áß¶Ê∞∏Êïè) of the Democracy Party of China, who was only released from prison after twelve years, do not praise the 1911 Revolution. Qin Yongmin said the revolution only replaced one dictator with another, that Mao Zedong was not an emperor, but he is worse than the emperor.

It lies on the banks of the Mandovi River estuary in the Tiswadi sub-district (taluka). With a population of 114,759 in the metropolitan area, Panaji is Goa's largest urban agglomeration, ahead of Margao and Vasco da Gama. Panaji has terraced hills, concrete buildings with balconies and red-tiled roofs, churches, and a riverside promenade. There are avenues lined with gulmohar, acacia and other trees. The baroque Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church is located overlooking the main square known as Pra√ßa da Igreja. Panaji has been selected as one of hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission. Panaji was built with stepped streets and a seven kilometre long promenade on a planned grid system after the Portuguese relocated the capital from Velha Goa in the 17th century. It was elevated from a town to a city on 22 March 1843 making it the oldest civic institution in Asia (175 years). Etymology The city was renamed from Panjim in English to Panaji, its present official name in the 1980s. The Portuguese name was Pangim. The city is sometimes written as Ponnj√© in Romi Konkani. The city had been renamed Nova Goa (Portuguese for \\"New Goa\\") when it officially replaced the city of Goa (now Old Goa) as the capital of Portuguese India, though the Viceroy had already moved there in 1759. The justification of the modern word Panaji is derived from the words panjani and khali, which mean a boat and a small creek respectively, in Sanskrit. Thus the modern word Panjim is believed to be a corruption of the old word Panjanakhani as inscribed on the discovered Panjim copper-plates dated 1059 CE, belonging to the rule of Kadamba king Jayakesi I.Title: Gazetteer of the Union Territory Goa, Daman and Diu: district gazetteer, Volume 1; Publisher: Gazetteer Dept., Govt. of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu, 1979 (Original from the University of Michigan, Digitised: 30 August 2008) According to legend, this northern capital city was mentioned in a stone inscription of Kadamba king Jayakesi I dated 1054 CE as 'Panjanakhani', giving him the epithet of Padavalendra which is Kannada for lord of the western ocean.

Early life and career Born in Quebec City, Pettigrew has a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois- Rivi√®res (1972) and a Master of Philosophy degree in international relations from the University of Oxford (1976) where he studied at Balliol College. Prior to seeking elected office, Pettigrew was director of the Political Committee, NATO Assembly, in Brussels, from 1976 to 1978, executive assistant to the Leader of the Quebec Liberal Party from 1978 to 1981 and Foreign Policy Advisor to Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, from 1981 to 1984. Pettigrew was Vice-President of Samson B√©lair/Deloitte & Touche in Montreal from 1985 to 1995, where he acted as a business consultant to companies with dealings in international markets. Political career Pettigrew served in the Liberal cabinet of Jean Chr√©tien in various capacities and in the government of Paul Martin as Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the 2006 federal election he was defeated as the Member of Parliament for the Montreal- area electoral district of Papineau. Following the 1995 Quebec referendum Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien was committed to bringing in more star candidates from Quebec to his cabinet. He thus appointed Pettigrew and St√©phane Dion to cabinet, even before they were in the house. Pettigrew previously ran for parliament in the 1984 federal election in the riding of Kamouraska‚ÄîRivi√®re- du-Loup but was defeated by less than 7,000 votes by the Progressive Conservative candidate, Andr√© Plourde. Andr√© Ouellet was made head of Canada Post, opening the riding of Papineau‚ÄîSaint-Michel. Pettigrew was elected to Parliament in a March 25, 1996 by-election. He was re-elected in 1997 and 2000, representing the new riding of Papineau‚ÄîSaint-Denis. In 1996 he became Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for La Francophonie. Pettigrew in 2006 From 1996 to 1999, he also served as Minister of Human Resources Development. In that time, the Department of Human Resources Development represented more than half of the Canadian federal budget. Pettigrew negotiated with the provinces and the territories the National Child Benefit, the most important social program since Canada Pension Plan (1966), a 10 billions program by now. He implemented the new Employment Insurance Program which became balanced after years of deficit despite lowering the premiums. Under his watch, however, ineffective accounting practices at HRDC allegedly left millions of dollars unaccounted for. Pettigrew was fortunate to have been shuffled to the portfolio of International Trade. His successor Jane Stewart took the brunt of the \\"billion-dollar boondoggle\\" scandal. As Minister for International Trade, he promoted free trade and always characterized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as \\"a tremendous success\\".meeting with Thomas d'Aquino at the Summit of the Americas 2001 and a model to expand upon. He was a key participant in the World Trade Organization (WTO) trade talks, claiming that Canada's main goal of lowering agricultural subsidies would be of great benefit to the world's poorer nations. At the 2003 WTO Ministerial Conference in Canc√∫n, Pettigrew played an aggressive role as chair of the working group on the Singapore issues, controversial sectors of proposed liberalization which were bitterly opposed by some developing nation delegates, not to mention masses of protesters outside of the gates where the meetings were held. He also championed the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), and in the period leading up to the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in 2001, he spearheaded a campaign to allay growing public suspicion of the deal by promising the eventual release of the draft negotiating texts. After a delay due to translating the texts into the Portuguese language, the texts were made publicly available July 3, 2001. Throughout his mandate at International Trade, he was heavily embroiled in the US - Canada softwood lumber dispute. On December 12, 2003, he was appointed Minister of Health and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs by newly appointed Prime Minister Paul Martin. On July 20, 2004, he moved to his long-desired portfolio of Foreign Affairs minister, replacing Bill Graham. On April 26, 2005, the Montreal newspaper Le Devoir reported that the trilingual Pettigrew, who speaks English, French and Spanish, would leave Canadian politics to serve as the Secretary General of the Organization of American States. The newspaper suggested that Pettigrew had sufficient support among OAS members to win the job, although officially Canada supported the election of Luis Ernesto Derbez of Mexico in the 2005 OAS Secretary General election. Pettigrew has long been rumoured to be a possible leadership candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada or as a leader of the Liberal Party of Quebec. In 1999, Pettigrew wrote Pour une politique de la confiance (English translation: The New Politics of Confidence), a book on globalization and the art of governing. On June 17, 2005, an incident occurred at a conference in Montreal regarding the subject of Haiti, at one point during the conference, Pettigrew was splashed with a red substance by Yves Engler, a political activist associated with the group Haiti Action Montreal. As Engler threw the red substance on Pettigrew, he shouted \\"Pettigrew lies, Haitians die\\". Engler claimed that the red paint was meant to symbolize the blood on the hands of the Canadian state due to Canada's involvement in Haiti. Pettigrew told police that he wanted full charges pressed against Engler. However, a couple of days later, Pettigrew suddenly decided to drop all charges. Despite growing pressure, Pettigrew consistently stated that Canada would \\"stay the course\\" in Haiti. On December 28, 2005, Pettigrew was the victim of an attempted mugging while he was waiting for a train in the Montreal subway station. The accused, Frederick Estelle, has been charged with aggravated theft. At the 2004 election, Pettigrew was nearly defeated by a Bloc Qu√©b√©cois challenger ‚Äì only the second time that the Liberals' hold on the riding had been seriously threatened. At the 2006 election, Pettigrew was defeated by Bloc challenger Vivian Barbot. Post-political career On October 23, 2006, Deloitte Canada's Managing Partner and Chief Executive Alan MacGibbon announced that Pierre Pettigrew had been appointed as Executive Advisor for the firm's international activities. Pettigrew is a member of the Inter-American Dialogue. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Warwick in July 2008. He currently resides in Toronto.

His father was Angilbert. Life Nithard was born sometime around the year Charlemagne was crowned Imperator Augustus in December 800. He was probably raised either at the imperial palace, where his mother continued to live until the death of the emperor, or at the monastery of St. Riquier, where his father was lay abbot. He would have been educated most likely at the imperial schola, which offered the kind of high-quality instruction in both military and literary training he is known to have received.Bernard S. Bachrach, Early Carolingian Warfare: Prelude to Empire (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), p. 125 online. Nithard himself later became lay abbot of St Riquier in commendam. He served his cousin Charles the Bald in both war and peace, fighting at his side during the Carolingian civil war and at the battle of Fontenoy in June 841. It is probable that he died as the result of wounds received whilst fighting for him against the Northmen near Angoul√™me. The date of his death is disputed among scholars, but consensus is now for June 14, 844. In the 11th century his body, with the fatal wound still visible, was found in the grave of his father, Angilbert. Works Nithard's historical work consists of four books on the history of the Carolingian empire under the turbulent sons of the emperor Louis I, especially during the turbulent period between 838 and 843. The Historiae or De dissensionibus filiorum Ludovici pii (On the Dissensions of the Sons of Louis the Pious) is valuable for the light which it throws upon the causes which led to the disintegration of the Carolingian empire. Nithard's work has been described as a \\"nostalgic lament\\"{{subscriptionvia=Questia: > In the times of Charles the Great of good memory, who died almost thirty > years ago, peace and concord ruled everywhere because our people were > treading the one proper way, the way of the common welfare, and thus the way > of God. But now since each goes his separate way, dissension and struggle > abound. Once there was abundance and happiness everywhere, now everywhere > there is want and sadness The first three of these books were written before Nithard's appointment as lay-abbey of St-Riquier in the winter of 842, the fourth and final in spring of 843 after taking up office there. Although rough in style, partisan in character and sometimes incorrect in detail, the books are the work of a man who had an intimate knowledge of the events which he relates, who possessed a clear and virile mind, and who above all was not a recluse but a man of action. They are dedicated to Charles the Bald, at whose request they were written. His work as a military intellectual places him in the tradition of Xenophon, Julius Caesar, Ammianus Marcellinus, and Flavius Merobaudes. For the military historian, Nithard's description of the complex exercises of cavalry in Gaul is particularly valuable as a supplement to the account in the Tactical Handbook of Arrian as well as for its insight into Carolingian techniques.Bernard S. Bachrach, Early Carolingian Warfare: Prelude to Empire (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001), pp. 125‚Äì130.

Part of the Ozark Mountains, the Boston Mountains are a deeply dissected plateau. The ecoregion is steeper than the adjacent Springfield Plateau to the north, and bordered on the south by the Arkansas Valley. The Oklahoma portion of the range is locally referred to as the Cookson Hills. The Boston Mountains ecoregion has been subdivided into two Level IV ecoregions. Description The ecoregion is mountainous, forested, and underlain by Pennsylvanian sandstone, shale, and siltstone. It is one of the Ozark Plateaus; some folding and faulting has occurred but, in general, strata are much less deformed than in the Ouachita Mountains. Maximum elevations are higher, soils have a warmer temperature regime, and carbonate rocks are much less extensive than in the Ozark Highlands. Physiography is distinct from the Arkansas Valley. Upland soils are mostly Ultisols that developed under oak-hickory and oak-hickory- pine forests. Today, forests are still widespread; northern red oak, southern red oak, white oak, and hickories usually dominate the uplands, but shortleaf pine grows on drier, south- and west-facing slopes underlain by sandstone. Pastureland or hayland occur on nearly level ridgetops, benches, and valley floors. Population density is low; recreation, logging, and livestock farming are the primary land uses. Water quality in streams is generally exceptional; biochemical, nutrient, and mineral water quality parameter concentrations all tend to be very low. Fish communities are mostly composed of sensitive species; a diverse, often darter-dominated community occurs along with nearly equal proportions of minnows and sunfishes. During low flows, streams usually run clear but, during high flow conditions, turbidity in the Boston Mountains tends to be greater than in the Ouachitas. Summer flow in many small streams is limited or non-existent but isolated, enduring pools may occur. Geology and physiography The Boston Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger Ozark Plateaus province, which in turn is part of the larger Interior Highlands physiographic division. The area is underlain by Pennsylvanian sandstone, shale, and siltstone, where some folding and faulting has occurred. The sandstone beds become thinner, but more shaly in the west as the mountains decline in elevation. The range covers an area of .Gromadzki, Gregory and Richard Marston. \\"Boston Mountains\\". Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed September 27, 2016. The rocks of the region are essentially little disturbed, flat-lying sedimentary layers of the Paleozoic age. The highest ridges and peaks are capped by Pennsylvanian sandstone and shale. The deeply eroded valleys are cut into Mississippian limestones and below that layer Ordovician dolomites. General description The Boston Mountains form the southwestern part of the Ozark plateau where they are the highest portion of the Ozarks. Summits can reach elevations of just over with valleys to deep. Turner Ward Knob (TWK) is the highest named peak. Located in western Newton County, Arkansas, its elevation is . Nearby, five unnamed peaks have elevations at or slightly above . Two of these highest peaks are located west of Turner Ward Knob, one being the location of the Buffalo Lookout fire tower at .Fallsville, Arkansas, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1967 The other three highest peaks are located south-southwest of Turner Ward Knob along Arkansas Highway 16.Boston, Arkansas, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1973[NAD83 geographic coordinates for TWK are N35.8631¬∞, W093.4544¬∞.

Within a radius of a point just west of the summits discussed above are located the sources of the White River, the Buffalo River, the Kings River, War Eagle Creek, and Little Mulberry Creek. Other rivers and streams having their headwaters in the Boston Mountains include the Illinois River, the Mulberry River, Lee Creek, Frog Bayou, Big Piney Creek, Illinois Bayou, and the Little Red River. To the south, the Arkansas River valley separates the Boston Mountains from the Ouachita Mountains. In Arkansas, the Boston Mountains are found in the following counties: Boone, Carroll, Cleburne, Conway, Crawford, Franklin, Independence, Johnson, Madison, Newton, Pope, Searcy, Stone, Van Buren, and Washington. In Oklahoma, the Boston Mountains are found in these counties: Adair, Cherokee, Muskogee, Sequoyah, and Wagoner.

Funimation licensed the anime series for North American broadcast in 2003 under the name Case Closed with the characters given Americanized names. The anime premiered on Adult Swim but was discontinued due to low ratings. In March 2013, Funimation began streaming their licensed episodes of Case Closed; Crunchyroll simulcast them in 2014. Funimation also localized the first six Case Closed films, while Discotek Media localized the Lupin III crossover special and its film sequel. Meanwhile, the manga was localized by Viz Media, which used Funimation's changed title and character names. Shogakukan Asia made its own English language localized version of the manga which used the original title and Japanese names. The tank≈çbon volumes of the manga have sold over 230 million copies worldwide, making it the fifth- best-selling manga series. In 2001, the manga was awarded the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the sh≈çnen category. The anime adaptation has been well received and ranked in the top twenty in Animages polls between 1996 and 2001. In the Japanese anime television ranking, Case Closed episodes ranked in the top six on a weekly basis. Both the manga and the anime have had positive response from critics for their plot and cases. The manga has been sold in 25 countries, while the anime has been broadcast in 40 countries.  Plot  Jimmy Kudo (Japanese name: Shinichi Kudo) is a high school detective who sometimes works with the police to solve cases. During an investigation, he is attacked by members of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. They force him to ingest an experimental poison, but instead of killing him, the poison transforms him into a child. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father Richard (Kogoro Mori), who is a private detective. Throughout the series, he tags along on Richard's cases, but when he is able to solve one, he uses a tranquilizer needle to put Richard to sleep, and impersonates his voice using a voice changer to reveal the solution to the case. He also enrolls in a local elementary school where he makes friends with a group of classmates who form their own Junior Detective club (Detective Boys). While he continues to dig deeper into the Black Organization, he frequently interacts with a variety of characters, including his professor friend Dr. Agasa, Ran's friend Serena Sebastian (Sonoko Suzuki), a fellow teenage detective Harley Hartwell (Heiji Hattori), various police detectives from different regions, and Kaito Kid. Kudo later encounters an elementary school transfer student, Anita Hailey (Ai Haibara), who reveals herself to be the creator of the poison that shrunk him. She too had ingested the poison, but she is no longer affiliated with the Black Organization. She soon joins the Junior Detectives. During a rare encounter with the Black Organization, Conan helps the FBI plant a CIA agent, Kir, inside the Black Organization as a spy. In 2007, Aoyama hinted he had an ending planned out but does not intend to end the series yet.  Release  Case Closed was conceived in 1994, during the rise of mystery genre manga due to the publishing of the series The Kindaichi Case Files; the first chapter appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday on January 19. Aoyama cites the stories of Ars√®ne Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as influences on his work. When scripting each chapter, he ensures the dialogue remains simple and spends an average of four hours for each new case and twelve for more complicated ones. Aoyama's older brother is a scientist who helps him out with the \\"gimmicks\\" in the series. Each case spans several chapters (except for a handful of shorter cases that only span one), and is resolved at the end where characters explain the details of their solutions in simple terms; an online database consisting of all the cases from the manga was launched in 2007. Case Closed became the 21st longest running manga series, with over 1000 chapters released in Japan, and the first series with over 1000 chapters published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday. The individual chapters are collected into tank≈çbon volumes by Shogakukan; the first volume was released on June 18, 1994. Gosho Aoyama's assistants have also written an anthology series of Case Closed which are released irregularly. Viz Media announced its acquisition of the series for North America on June 1, 2004. Following Funimation's localization, Viz released the series as Case Closed and took their character names to keep consistency between the two media. Viz Media released the first volume in September 2004 and began releasing digital editions in 2013. Gollancz licensed and distributed 15 of Viz Media's volumes in the United Kingdom before ceasing publication of manga. (Viz Media has since re-released them). In 2014 Shogakukan Asia began its own English localization of the series for Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries as Detective Conan. \\\\- Go to \\"Detective Conan A Modern Day Sherlock Holmes \\" - - Release date 6 June 2014 The manga has also been localized in other regions such as China, France, Germany and Indonesia. (Localizations in Scandinavia ceased one by one, Finland being the last in 2013, when the publisher shut down the entire manga division.) = Spin-offs = A spin-off manga series, titled Detective Conan: Hannin no Hanzawa-san, by Mayuko Kanba, began in the July 2017 issue of Shogakukan's Sh≈çnen Sunday S, released on May 25, 2017. Another spin-off manga series, illustrated by Takahiro Arai with supervision by Aoyama, titled Detective Conan: Zero's Tea Time started in issue #24 of Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday on May 9, 2018. The story centers on the agent Toru Amuro. New chapters of the manga are only published when Case Closed is on hiatus. Another spin-off manga series by Arai, titled Detective Conan: Police Academy Arc Wild Police Story, began in the issue #44 of Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday, released on October 2, 2019.  Media adaptations = Anime = The anime version of Case Closed is produced by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and TMS Entertainment. Over 900 episodes have aired in Japan since the anime's premiere on January 8, 1996, making it the sixteenth longest anime series to date. Initially, Shogakukan collected and released the episodes on VHS video cassettes from June 1996 to October 2006. Four hundred and twenty-six episodes were released on VHS until Shogakukan abandoned the format and switched over to DVDs, starting over from the first episode. For the fifteenth anniversary of the anime series, the series was made available for video on demand. Case Closed was later broadcast in North America on NHK's cable network TV Japan. Crunchyroll began simulcasting the series in October 2014, starting with episode 754. In September 2020, Crunchyroll began streaming the first 43 episodes (the two-part episodes 11-12 considered as a single episode). In 2003, the first 104 episodes were licensed by Funimation for distribution in North America, under the title Case Closed because of legal considerations. The Case Closed anime has also been released in other languages such as French, German and Italian. Case Closed debuted on Cartoon Network as part of their Adult Swim programming block on May 24, 2004; no more than 50 episodes were licensed from Funimation due to low ratings. The Canadian channel YTV picked up the Case Closed series and broadcast 22 episodes between April 7, 2006, and September 2, 2006, before taking it off the air. Funimation made the series available with the launch of the Funimation Channel in November 2005; it was temporary available on Colours TV during its syndication with the Funimation Channel. Funimation lost the rights to the series in 2018. A separate English adaptation of the series by Animax Asia premiered in the Philippines on January 18, 2006, under the name Detective Conan. Because Animax were unable to obtain further TV broadcast rights, their version comprised only 52 episodes. The series continued with reruns until August 7, 2006, when it was removed from the station. The California-based channel United Television Broadcasting (UTB) aired Detective Conan with English subtitles from 2011 until 2014, until episode 421. Funimation also released DVDs of their dubbed series beginning August 24, 2004. Initially, the releases were done in single DVDs and future episodes were released in seasonal boxes; 130 episodes have been released in total. The seasonal boxes were later re-released in redesigned boxes called Viridian edition. Funimation began streaming Case Closed episodes in March 2013. Hanabee Entertainment licensed the series for distribution in Australia. In January 2016, 52 episodes of the anime appeared on Netflix, initially under its original title Detective Conan before changing to its English moniker Case Closed. The episodes are listed as \\"season one\\", although in reality they are episodes #748 to #799. The episodes are only available in Japanese, but are subtitled. The availability is likely part of Netflix's efforts to expand its anime catalog. As of 2018, the Detective Conan anime has been broadcast in 40 countries around the world.  Films  Twenty-three feature films based on the Case Closed series have been released. They are animated by TMS Entertainment and produced by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation, Nippon Television, ShoPro, and Toho.

The second OVA series, entitled Magic File, consists of yearly direct-to-DVD releases. The first Magic File was released on April 11, 2007, and contained four episodes from the anime series. The subsequent Magic File OVAs contained an original plot with background ties related to their respective Case Closed theatrical films, beginning with the twelfth film Detective Conan: Full Score of Fear.  Television special  A two-hour television special titled was produced by TMS Entertainment, Nippon Television, and Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and aired on March 27, 2009. It was first announced in the 9th issue of Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday in 2009.

Anime fans can expect bigger live performances, more perplexing puzzles and best of all, they will get a chance to be part of an original story in the Case Closed universe.  Reception  = Popularity = In 2006, the Japanese government used Conan in campaigns to help promote crime awareness among children. Targeting the same audience, Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs used Conan and his friends in two pamphlets: one to promote the ministry's mission, the other to introduce the 34th G8 summit held in the country in 2010. Several characters in the series featured in the sixth installment of the Anime, Heroes and Heroines commemorative stamp series issued by Japan Post in 2006. Aoyama and his creations are celebrated in his hometown Hokuei, Tottori; a museum with exhibits of his work is located there, and several bronze statues of Jimmy Kudo, Conan Edogawa, and Rachel Moore are installed in various locations throughout the town. It also has other tourist attractions related to Detective Conan, including a Detective Conan themed airport and train station, and it is promoted as Conan Town. In 2018, Detective Conan caught the attention of American late night talk show host Conan O'Brien, who discussed the character Detective Conan as well as Conan Town in his talk show Conan, and visited the town in September 2018. The animated adaptation of the series was also popular in Japan, appearing in the top six of Japanese TV Rankings at various times. The television series ranked among the top twenty in polls conducted by anime magazine Animage from 1996 to 2001. It also placed better than twenty-third in polls for the Top 100 anime conducted by Japanese television network TV Asahi in 2005‚Äì06. The series received considerable airtime in China; it was the second most broadcast animation there in 2004.  Sales  The Case Closed manga has sold over 200 million volumes in the world, making it the fifth best-selling manga series,„ÄåÂêçÊé¢ÂÅµ„Ç≥„Éä„É≥2ÂÑÑÂÜä‰∫ã‰ª∂„ÄçÂè∑Â§ñ„Çí‚ÄúÂÜçÁô∫Ë°å‚Äù „Äé„Çµ„É≥„Éá„ÉºS„Äè‰ªòÈå≤„Å´ ORICON NEWS having been sold in 25 countries. In Japan, individual volumes frequently appear on the lists of best-selling manga. Case Closed was the 19th best selling manga in 2011, with 2,120,091 copies sold. Nikkei Entertainment magazine published a list of top 50 manga creators by sales since January 2010, in its September 2011 issue; Gosho Aoyama, the author of Case Closed was ranked 16th, with 3,320,000 copies sold. It was the 17th best selling manga in 2012, with 2,430,572 copies sold. In 2013 Case Closed became the 24th best selling manga, with 1,966,206 copies sold.

The first volume of Case Closed appeared thrice in the top ten selling lists, right after its premiere, the same volume has also appeared in the Diamond Comic Distributors's ranking list. Later-published volumes have appeared on the New York Times Manga Best Sellers lists. = Critical reception = In the United States, Case Closed received praises from Mania.com's Eduardo M. Chavez and IGN's A. E. Sparrow for its stories‚Äîtelling the mysteries and how they were unfolded by the investigations of Conan and gang. Sparrow called the style of the series a mix of Scooby-Doo and Sherlock Holmes, while Chavez believed the manga had appeal to readers of all ages. Melissa Sternenberg from THEM Anime Reviews reviewed and praised its animation and plot. ActiveAnime's reviewers commented on complex character design and the \\"spirit\\" that the series has, indicating that fans of serialized mystery shows would rather enjoy it. The series is also said to better suit the more matured audience. In the United States, the dubbed series faced several negative reactions toward its changes to localize the content for international English-speaking audiences, mostly North American. Jeffrey Harris of IGN found it pointless to change the names of the characters, and Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger said that the changes of certain Japanese cultural references rendered several parts of the mysteries and their investigation illogical. The voice-overs proved to be a mixed bag for Carlo Santos, who reviewed the first DVD release of Case Closed for Anime News Network; he said that while the main characters sounded like \\"real people\\", the secondary ones \\"[came] off as caricatures\\". Lori Lancaster of Mania.com described Case Closed as \\"a clever series that had mysteries at every corner\\", noting the \\"bizarre\\" and \\"interesting\\" nature of each case. IGN's Chris Wyatt was positive to the manner the cases were set up, relating them to Agatha Christie's locked-room mysteries. He described the series as \\"Inspector Gadget meets Law & Order but in an anime style.\\" His colleague, Harris, however, expressed annoyance with repetitive elements in the show and the contrived methods the series uses to keep Conan's identity a secret from certain characters. = Accolades = It won the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award for the sh≈çnen category in 2001, and respondents in an online poll for Japanese citizens in their mid-twenties voted Case Closed as one of the top three manga they wanted to continue running in publication. In France, the series was nominated for the Angoul√™me Festival Graphic Novel award among the Japanese selection. The series ranked on About.com's top continuing manga series of 2010, under the title \\"Best Underappreciated Gem: Shonen\\" category. Several of the franchise's films were nominated for awards in their home country. The ninth film was nominated for the feature film category at the 5th Annual Tokyo Anime Awards, and the next five films were nominees for the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year in their respective years of release.

References Grand Unified Theory ","title":"Trinification"},{"id":"298070","text":"Law and economics or economic analysis of law is the application of economic theory (specifically microeconomic theory) to the analysis of law that began mostly with scholars from the Chicago school of economics. Economic concepts are used to explain the effects of laws, to assess which legal rules are economically efficient, and to predict which legal rules will be promulgated.David Friedman (1987). \\"law and economics,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 3, p. 144. There are two major branches of law and economics.Ronald Coase (1996). \\"Law and Economics and A.W. Brian Simpson,\\" Journal of Legal Studies, v. 25, p. 103-104. The first branch is based on the application of the methods and theories of neoclassical economics to the positive and normative analysis of the law. The second branch focuses on an institutional analysis of law and legal institutions, with a broader focus on economic, political, and social outcomes. History = Origin = The historical antecedents of law and economics can be traced back to the classical economists, who are credited with the foundations of modern economic thought. As early as the 18th century, Adam Smith discussed the economic effects of mercantilist legislation. David Ricardo opposed the British Corn Laws on the grounds that they hindered agricultural productivity. And Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat, in his influential book The Law, examined the unintended consequences of legislation. However, to apply economics to analyze the law regulating nonmarket activities is relatively new. A European law & economics movement around 1900 did not have any lasting influence.Kristoffel Grechenig & Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295‚Äì360; Martin Gelter & Kristoffel Grechenig, History of Law and Economics, forthcoming in Encyclopedia on Law & Economics. Harold Luhnow, the head of the Volker Fund, not only financed F. A. Hayek in the U.S. starting in 1946, but he shortly thereafter financed Aaron Director's coming to the University of Chicago in order to set up there a new center for scholars in law and economics. The University was headed by Robert Maynard Hutchins, a close collaborator of Luhnow's in setting up this \\"Chicago School\\". The University already had Frank Knight, George Stigler, Henry Simons, and Ronald Coase‚Äîa strong base of libertarian scholars. Soon, it would also have not just Hayek himself, but Director's brother-in-law and Stigler's friend Milton Friedman, and also Robert Fogel, Robert Lucas, Eugene Fama, Richard Posner, and Gary Becker. The historians Robert van Horn and Philip Mirowski described these developments, in their \\"The Rise of the Chicago School of Economics\\" chapter in The Road from Mont Pelerin (2009); and historian Bruce Caldwell (a great admirer of von Hayek) filled in more details of the account in his chapter, \\"The Chicago School, Hayek, and Neoliberalism\\", in Building Chicago Economics (2011). The field began with Gary Becker‚Äôs 1968 paper on crime (Becker also received a Nobel Prize). In 1972, Richard Posner, a law and economics scholar and the major advocate of the positive theory of efficiency, published the first edition of Economic Analysis of Law and founded the Journal of Legal Studies, both are regarded as important events. Gordon Tullock and Friedrich Hayek also wrote intensively in the area and influenced to spread of law and economics. = Founding = In 1958, Director founded The Journal of Law & Economics, which he co-edited with Nobel laureate Ronald Coase, and which helped to unite the fields of law and economics with far-reaching influence.Kristoffel Grechenig & Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295‚Äì360 In 1960 and 1961, Ronald Coase and Guido Calabresi independently published two groundbreaking articles, \\"The Problem of Social Cost\\" This issue was actually published in 1961. and \\"Some Thoughts on Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts\\". This can be seen as the starting point for the modern school of law and economics. In 1962, Aaron Director helped to found the Committee on a Free Society. Director's appointment to the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1946 began a half-century of intellectual productivity, although his reluctance about publishing left few writings behind. He taught antitrust courses at the law school with Edward Levi, who eventually would serve as Dean of Chicago's Law School, President of the University of Chicago, and as U.S. Attorney General in the Ford administration. After retiring from the University of Chicago School of Law in 1965, Director relocated to California and took a position at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. He died September 11, 2004, at his home in Los Altos Hills, California, ten days before his 103rd birthday. = Later development = In the early 1970s, Henry Manne (a former student of Coase) set out to build a center for law and economics at a major law school. He began at the University of Rochester, worked at the University of Miami, but was soon made unwelcome, moved to Emory University, and ended up at George Mason. The last soon became a center for the education of judges‚Äîmany long out of law school and never exposed to numbers and economics. Manne also attracted the support of the John M.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/gj-2019-0040 Calabresi, judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, wrote in depth on this subject; his book The Costs of Accidents: A Legal and Economic Analysis (1970) has been cited as influential in its extensive treatment of the proper incentives and compensation required in accident situations. Calabresi took a different approach in Ideals, Beliefs, Attitudes, and the Law (1985), where he argued, \\"who is the cheapest avoider of a cost, depends on the valuations put on acts, activities and beliefs by the whole of our law and not on some objective or scientific notion\\" (69). * Henry Manne, George Mason University = Important figures = Other important figures include: * Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist Gary Becker, a leader of the Chicago School of Economics * U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit judge Frank Easterbrook * Andrei Shleifer * Robert Cooter * Harold Demsetz * Hans-Bernd Sch√§fer * William Landes * W. Kip Viscusi * A. Mitchell Polinsky Positive and normative law and economics Economic analysis of law is usually divided into two subfields: positive and normative. =Positive law and economics= 'Positive law and economics' uses economic analysis to predict the effects of various legal rules. So, for example, a positive economic analysis of tort law would predict the effects of a strict liability rule as opposed to the effects of a negligence rule. Positive law and economics has also at times purported to explain the development of legal rules, for example the common law of torts, in terms of their economic efficiency. =Normative law and economics= Normative law and economics goes one step further and makes policy recommendations based on the economic consequences of various policies. The key concept for normative economic analysis is efficiency, in particular, allocative efficiency. A common concept of efficiency used by law and economics scholars is Pareto efficiency. A legal rule is Pareto efficient if it could not be changed so as to make one person better off without making another person worse off. A weaker conception of efficiency is Kaldor‚ÄìHicks efficiency. A legal rule is Kaldor‚ÄìHicks efficient if it could be made Pareto efficient by some parties compensating others as to offset their loss. Nonetheless, the possibility of a clear distinction between positive and normative analysis has been questioned by Guido Calabresi who, in his book on \\"The future of Law and Economics\\" (2016: 21-22), believes that there is an \\"actual - and unavoidable - existence of value judgments underlying much economic analysis\\" Silvestri P. (2019), ‚ÄúOn the (Methodological) Future of Law and Economics. The Uneasy Burden of Value Judgments and Normativity‚Äù, Global Jurist, 19 (3): 1-17. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1515/gj-2019-0026 Uri Weiss proposed this alternative: \\"It is common in law and economics to search for the law that will lead to the optimal outcome, providing the maximum size 'pie,' and to think about maximizing happiness instead of minimizing pain. We prefer another approach: We do not try to identify games that will lead to the optimal result but to prevent games in which it is in the best interests of the players to come to an unjust result\\"https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1827&context;=jdr. Relationship to other disciplines and approaches As used by lawyers and legal scholars, the phrase \\"law and economics\\" refers to the application of microeconomic analysis to legal problems. Because of the overlap between legal systems and political systems, some of the issues in law and economics are also raised in political economy, constitutional economics and political science. Approaches to the same issues from Marxist and critical theory/Frankfurt School perspectives usually do not identify themselves as \\"law and economics\\". For example, research by members of the critical legal studies movement and the sociology of law considers many of the same fundamental issues as does work labeled \\"law and economics\\", though from a vastly different perspective. The one wing that represents a non-neoclassical approach to \\"law and economics\\" is the Continental (mainly German) tradition that sees the concept starting out of the governance and public policy (Staatswissenschaften) approach and the German Historical school of economics; this view is represented in the Elgar Companion to Law and Economics (2nd ed. 2005) and‚Äîthough not exclusively‚Äîin the European Journal of Law and Economics. Here, consciously non-neoclassical approaches to economics are used for the analysis of legal (and administrative/governance) problems. Law and economics is closely related to jurimetrics, the application of probability and statistics to legal questions.

Judicial opinions use economic analysis and the theories of law and economics with some regularity, in the US but also, increasingly, in Commonwealth countries and in Europe. The influence of law and economics has also been felt in legal education, with graduate programs in the subject being offered in a number of countries. The influence of law and economics in civil law countries may be gauged from the availability of textbooks of law and economics, in English as well as in other European languages (Sch√§fer and Ott 2004; Mackaay 2013). Many law schools in North America, Europe, and Asia have faculty members with a graduate degree in economics. In addition, many professional economists now study and write on the relationship between economics and legal doctrines. Anthony Kronman, former dean of Yale Law School, has written that \\"the intellectual movement that has had the greatest influence on American academic law in the past quarter-century [of the 20th Century]\\" is law and economics.Anthony T. Kronman, The Lost Lawyer 166 (1993). Criticisms Despite its influence, the law and economics movement has been criticized from a number of directions. This is especially true of normative law and economics. Because most law and economics scholarship operates within a neoclassical framework, fundamental criticisms of neoclassical economics have been drawn from other, competing frameworks, though there are numerous internal critiques as well. Yet other schools of economic thought have emerged and have been applied to the work of law and economics in, for example, the work of Edgardo Buscaglia and Robert Cooter on \\"Law and Economics of Development\\". = Rational choice theory = Critics of the economic analysis of legal questions have argued that normative economic analysis does not capture the importance of human rights and concerns for distributive justice. Some of the heaviest criticisms of law and economics come from the critical legal studies movement, in particular Duncan Kennedy and Mark Kelman. Jon D. Hanson, of Harvard Law School, argues that our legal, economic, political, and social systems are unduly influenced by an individualistic model of behavior based on preferences, instead of a model that incorporates cognitive biases and social norms. = Pareto efficiency = Additional criticism has been directed toward the assumed benefits of law and policy designed to increase allocative efficiency when such assumptions are modeled on \\"first-best\\" (Pareto optimal) general-equilibrium conditions. Under the theory of the second best, for example, if the fulfillment of a subset of optimal conditions cannot be met under any circumstances, it is incorrect to conclude that the fulfillment of any subset of optimal conditions will necessarily result in an increase in allocative efficiency. Consequently, any expression of public policy whose purported purpose is an unambiguous increase in allocative efficiency (for example, consolidation of research and development costs through increased mergers and acquisitions resulting from a systematic relaxation of antitrust laws) is, according to critics, fundamentally incorrect, as there is no general reason to conclude that an increase in allocative efficiency is more likely than a decrease. Essentially, the \\"first-best\\" neoclassical analysis fails to properly account for various kinds of general-equilibrium feedback relationships that result from intrinsic Pareto imperfections. Another critique comes from the fact that there is no unique optimal result. Warren Samuels in his 2007 book, The Legal-Economic Nexus, argues, \\"efficiency in the Pareto sense cannot dispositively be applied to the definition and assignment of rights themselves, because efficiency requires an antecedent determination of the rights (23‚Äì4)\\". = Responses to criticism = Law and economics has adapted to some of these criticisms and been developed in a variety of directions. One important trend has been the application of game theory to legal problems. Other developments have been the incorporation of behavioral economics into economic analysis of law, and the increasing use of statistical and econometrics techniques.Martin Gelter & Kristoffel Grechenig, History of Law and Economics, forthcoming in Encyclopedia on Law & Economics. Within the legal academy, the term socio-economics has been applied to economic approaches that are self-consciously broader than the neoclassical tradition. Property rights, which are analyzed using economic analysis, are seen as fundamental human rights by defenders of law and economics.

Like all forms of consequentialism, welfarism is based on the premise that actions, policies, and/or rules should be evaluated on the basis of their consequences. Welfarism is the view that the morally significant consequences are impacts on human (or animal) welfare. There are many different understandings of human welfare, but the term \\"welfarism\\" is usually associated with the economic conception of welfare. Economists usually think of individual welfare in terms of utility functions, a perspective in which social welfare can be conceived as an aggregation of individual utilities or utility functions. Welfarist views have been especially influential in the law and economics movement. Steven Shavell and Louis Kaplow have argued in an influential book, Fairness versus Welfare that welfare should be the exclusive criteria by which legal analysts evaluate legal policy choices.Louis Kaplow and Steven Shavell, Fairness versus Welfare (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press 2002) Penal welfarism Penal welfarism is a theory in the study of criminal justice which holds that prisoners should have the right and the positive motivation to gain opportunities for advancement within the criminal justice system. David Garland, \\"The Crisis of Penal Modernism\\", The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society, pp. 53-73, University of Chicago Press (2002). Outcome utilitarianism, welfarism, and sum- ranking Amartya Sen (1979) provides the following two definitions: \\"Welfarism: The judgment of the relative goodness of alternative states of affairs must be based exclusively on, and taken as an increasing function of, the respective collections of individual utilities in these states.\\" \\"Sum- ranking: One collection of individual utilities is at least as good as another if and only if it has at least as large a sum total.\\" Sen makes the statement: \\"It is easily checked that welfarism and sum-ranking together are exactly equivalent to outcome utilitarianism.\\" He then proceeds to criticize outcome utilitarianism by criticizing each of its two components: first sum-ranking, and then welfarism.

His informal but polished style in both Chinese and English made him one of the most influential writers of his generation, and his compilations and translations of classic Chinese texts into English were bestsellers in the West. Youth Lin was born in 1895 in the town of Banzai, Pinghe, Zhangzhou, Fujian. The mountainous region made a deep impression on his consciousness, and thereafter, he would constantly consider himself a child of the mountains (in one of his books he commented that his idea of hell was a city apartment). His father was a Christian minister. His journey of faith from Christianity to Taoism and Buddhism, and back to Christianity in his later life was recorded in his book From Pagan to Christian (1959). Academic career and Shanghai intellectual world Lin studied for his bachelor's degree at Saint John's University in Shanghai, then received a half-scholarship to continue study for a doctoral degree at Harvard University. He later wrote that in the Widener Library he first found himself and first came alive, but he never saw a Harvard-Yale game. In financial difficulty, he left Harvard early and moved to work with the Chinese Labour Corps in France and eventually to Germany, where he completed his requirements for a doctoral degree in Chinese philology at the University of Leipzig. From 1923 to 1926, he taught English literature at Peking University. Enthusiastic about the success of the Northern Expedition, he briefly served in the new Nationalist government, but soon turned to teaching and writing. He found himself in the wake of the New Culture Movement which criticized China's tradition as feudal and harmful. Instead of accepting this charge, however, Lin immersed himself in the Confucian texts and literary culture which his Christian upbringing and English language education had denied him. His humor magazine Lunyu banyuekan (The Analects Fortnightly, 1932‚Äì40, 1945‚Äì49) featured essays by prominent writers such as Hu Shih, Lao She, Lu Xun, and Zhou Zuoren and attracted a wide readership. He was a key figure in introducing the Western concept of humor, which he felt China had lacked. Lin coined the term youmo (humor) in 1924 and used The Analects to promote his conception of humor as the expression of a tolerant, cosmopolitan, understanding and civilized philosophy of life.Christopher Rea, \\"The Age of Irreverence: A New History of Laughter in China\\" (California, 2015), chapter 6: \\"The Invention of Humor\\"Qian, Suoqiao, \\"Discovering 'Humor' in Modern China: The Launching of the Analects Fortnightly Journal and the 'Year of Humour' (1933),\\" in Chey and Davis, \\"Humour in Chinese Life and Letters: Classical and Traditional Approaches\\" (Hong Kong University Press, 2011), ch. 10. In 1933, Lu Xun attacked the Analects for being apolitical and dismissed Lin's elegant xiaopin wen Â∞èÂìÅÊñá, or small essays, as \\"bric a brac for the bourgeoisie.\\" Lu Xun nevertheless maintained a cordial relationship with Lin and continued to contribute to his journal.Kirk A. Denton, \\"Lu Xun Biography,\\" MCLC Resource Center, (2002) Lin's writings in Chinese were critical of the Nationalist government to the point that he feared for his life. Many of his essays from this time were later collected in With Love and Irony (1940). In 1933, he met Pearl Buck in Shanghai, who introduced him and his writings to her publisher, Richard Walsh, head of John Day publishers, who published Lin's works for many years. Lin's relation with Christianity changed over the years. His father was a second-generation Christian, but at Tsinghua, Lin asked himself what it meant to be a Christian in China. Being a Christian meant acceptance of Western science and progress, but Lin became angry that being a Christian also meant losing touch with China's culture and his own personal identity. On his return from study abroad, Lin renewed his respect for his father, yet he plunged into study of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism and did not identify himself as Christian until the late 1950s.Stacey Bieler, \\"Lin Yutang\\" Biographical Dictionary of Christianity in China Career after leaving China, and death Lin Yutang House in Taipei After 1935, Lin lived mainly in the United States, where he became known as a \\"wise and witty\\" popularizer of Chinese philosophy and way of life. Lin's first best sellers were My Country and My People () (1935) and The Importance of Living () (1937), written in English in a charming style. Others include Between Tears and Laughter () (1943), The Importance of Understanding (1960, a book of translated Chinese literary passages and short pieces), The Chinese Theory of Art (1967). The novels Moment in Peking (1939), A Leaf in the Storm (1940), and The Vermilion Gate () (1953) were well received epics of China in turmoil while Chinatown Family (1948) presented the lives of Chinese Americans in New York. Partly to avoid controversial contemporary issues, Lin in 1947 published The Gay Genius: The Life and Times of Su Tungpo, which presented the struggle between Su Dongpo and Wang Anshi as parallel to the struggle between Chinese liberals and totalitarian communists. Lin's political writings in English sold fewer copies than his cultural works and were more controversial. Between Tears and Laughter (1943) broke with the genial tone of his earlier English writings to criticize Western racism and imperialism. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Lin traveled in China and wrote favorably of the war effort and Chiang Kai-shek in Vigil of a Nation (1944). American China Hands such as Edgar Snow criticized the works. Lin's Mingkwai Chinese typewriter played a pivotal role in the Cold War machine translation research. Mechanics had been a long time avocation. Since Chinese is a character-based rather than an alphabet-based language, with many thousands of separate characters, it was difficult to employ modern printing technologies. Many doubted that a Chinese typewriter could be invented. Lin, however, worked on this problem for decades and eventually came up with a workable typewriter, brought to market in the middle of the war with Japan. The Mingkwai \\"Clear and Quick\\" Chinese-language typewriter played a pivotal role in the Cold War machine translation research. Lin also invented and patented several lesser inventions, such as a toothbrush that dispensed toothpaste. In the mid-1950s, he served briefly and unhappily as president (or chancellor) of the Nanyang University, which was newly created in Singapore specifically for Chinese studies as parallel to the English-oriented University of Singapore. He did not, however, choose to continue in that role when the faculty resisted his plans to demolish and rebuild the new school building (which though grand, was not \\"Western\\" enough), his demands to have sole control over finances, and a budget clearly beyond its means. Lin accepted a dismissal fee of $305,203, entirely contributed by Tan Lark Sye, to prevent depleting the university's funds. He would later claim that Nanyang University became a focus of the struggle for control of Singapore between the Communist-directed left and the liberal, social democratic right and that he was too old for the conflict. The episode left a bad taste in the Malayan Chinese community, who felt betrayed by his actions during and after the fiasco. After he returned to New York in the late 1950s, Lin renewed his interest in Christianity. His wife was a devout believer, and Lin admired her serenity and humility. After attending services with her at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church for several months, he joined the church and announced his return to the faith. His 1959 book From Pagan to Christian explained this move, which many of his readers found surprising. With his facility for both Chinese and English idiom, Lin presided over the compilation of a Chinese-English dictionary, Lin Yutang's Chinese- English Dictionary of Modern Usage (1972), which contains a massive English index to definitions of Chinese terms. The work was undertaken at the newly founded Chinese University of Hong Kong. His many works represent an attempt to bridge the cultural gap between the East and the West. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1940 and 1950. He continued his work until his death in 1976. Lin was buried at his home in Yangmingshan, Taipei, Taiwan. His home has been turned into a museum, which is operated by Taipei-based Soochow University. The town of Lin's birth, Banzai, has also preserved the original Lin home and turned it into a museum. Lin's reputation and scholarship on Lin Lin Yutang as pictured in The Most Recent Biographies of Important Chinese People Although his major books have remained in print, Lin was a thinker whose place in modern Chinese intellectual history has been overlooked until recently.William Sima, \\"New Scholarship: The Cross-Cultural Legacy of Lin Yutang in China and America,\\" China Heritage Quarterly 29 (2012). Lin themed conventions have been organized in Taiwan and Lin's native Fujian, and in December 2011, the International Conference on the Cross- cultural Legacy of Lin Yutang in China and America was held at City University of Hong Kong, with professional and private scholars from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, the United States, Germany and Slovakia. The organizer of the conference was Dr. Qian Suoqiao, author of the book, Liberal Cosmopolitan: Lin Yutang and Middling Chinese Modernity (Leiden; Boston: Brill, 2010).International Conference on the Cross-cultural Legacy of Lin Yutang in China and America The first full-length academic study of Lin in English is Diran John Sohigian's \\"The Life and Times of Lin Yutang\\" (Columbia University Ph.D. diss., 1991). Jing Tsu's Sound and Script in Chinese Diaspora (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2010) gives a detailed account of Lin Yutang's typewriter and its role in the context of late 19th century script reform, Chinese national language reform in the early twentieth century and the fascinating story of his typewriting keyboard and machine translation research during the Cold War. Family His wife, Liao Tsui-feng (), was an author, who, along with her daughter Lin Hsiang Ju, wrote three cookery books which popularized Chinese cuisine in the English speaking world. Dr. Lin wrote introductions which explained the historical background and relevance for American life. His first daughter Adet Lin Feng-ju (; 1923‚Äì1971) was a Chinese-American author who used the pseudonym Tan Yun. His second daughter Lin Taiyi (; 1926‚Äì2003) was also known as Anor Lin in her earliest writing, and had the Chinese name Yu-ju (). She was an author and the editor-in-chief of Chinese edition of the Reader's Digest from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. She also wrote a biography of her father in Chinese (), which shows some signs of her father's literary flair. His third daughter Lin Hsiang-ju (; born 1931), was referred to as MeiMei in childhood. She was co-author of cookbooks with her mother, and was the head of the Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital Compound, in Hong Kong.

The concept of GSP is very different from the concept of \\"most favored nation\\" (MFN). MFN status provides equal treatment in the case of tariff being imposed by a nation but in case of GSP differential tariff could be imposed by a nation on various countries depending upon factors such as whether it is a developed country or a developing country. Both the rules comes under the purview of WTO. GSP provides tariff reduction for least developed countries but MFN is only for not discriminating among WTO members. History The idea of tariff preferences for developing countries was the subject of considerable discussion within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in the 1960s. Among other concerns, developing countries claimed that MFN was creating a disincentive for richer countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and other trade restrictions with enough speed to benefit developing countries. In 1971, the GATT followed the lead of UNCTAD and enacted two waivers to the MFN that permitted tariff preferences to be granted to developing country goods. Both these waivers were limited in time to ten years. In 1979, the GATT established a permanent exemption to the MFN obligation by way of the enabling clause. This exemption allowed contracting parties to the GATT (the equivalent of today's WTO members) to establish systems of trade preferences for other countries, with the caveat that these systems had to be \\"generalized, non-discriminatory and non-reciprocal' with respect to the countries they benefited (so-called \\"beneficiary\\" countries). Countries were not supposed to set up GSP programs that benefited just a few of their \\"friends.' Effects From the perspective of developing countries as a group, GSP programs have been a mixed success. On one hand, most rich countries have complied with the obligation to generalize their programs by offering benefits to a large swath of beneficiaries, generally including nearly every non-OECD member state. Certainly, every GSP program imposes some restrictions. The United States, for instance, has excluded countries from GSP coverage for reasons such as being communist (Vietnam), being placed on the U.S. State Department's list of countries that support terrorism (Libya), and failing to respect U.S. intellectual property laws. Criticism has been leveled noting that most GSP programs are not completely generalized with respect to products, and this is by design. That is, they don't cover products of greatest export interest to low-income developing countries lacking natural resources. In the United States and many other rich countries, domestic producers of \\"simple\\" manufactured goods, such as textiles, leather goods, ceramics, glass and steel, have long claimed that they could not compete with large quantities of imports. Thus, such products have been categorically excluded from GSP coverage under the U.S. and many other GSP programs. Critics assert that these excluded products are precisely the kinds of manufactures that most developing countries are able to export, the argument being that developing countries may not be able to efficiently produce things like locomotives or telecommunications satellites, but they can make shirts. Supporters note that even in the face of its limitations, it would not be accurate to conclude that GSP has failed to benefit developing countries, though some concede GSP has benefited developing countries unevenly. Some assert that, for most of its history, GSP has benefited \\"richer developing\\" countries - in early years Mexico, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, more recently Brazil and India - while providing virtually no assistance to the world's least developed countries, such as Haiti, Nepal, Pakistan and most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S., however, has closed some of these gaps through supplemental preference programs like the African Growth and Opportunity Act and a newer program for Haiti and Europe has done the same with Everything But Arms.

In the , Surfers Paradise had a population of 23,689 people. Colloquially known as 'Surfers', the suburb has many high-rise apartment buildings and a wide surf beach. The feature of the heart of the suburb is Cavill Mall, which runs through the shopping and entertainment precinct. Cavill Avenue, named after Jim Cavill, an early hotel owner, is one of the busiest shopping strips in Queensland, and the centre of activity for night life. One of the features of the area is the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids designed to build goodwill with tourists. Surfers Paradise is the Gold Coast's entertainment and tourism centre and the suburb's high-rise buildings are the best known feature of the city's skyline. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Surfers Paradise was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"location\\". Geography left Surfers Point is bounded to the east by the Coral Sea of the Pacific Ocean. The entire coastline of Surfers Paradise is called Surfers Paradise Beach () and is a continuous sandy surf beach. The Esplanade is a road that runs along the coast in the north-east of the suburb. It is bounded to the north-west by the Nerang River which then flows through the suburb to exit at the suburb's most northerly boundary almost at the mouth of the river where it flows into the southern end of Moreton Bay. The south-west of the suburb is land on the western bank of the river and is bounded by Bundall Road. The Gold Coast Highway passes through the suburb from north to south. The course of the river has been modified extensively in the latter part of the 20th century to create permanent islands for residential development, some of which were natural features while others were on reclaimed land created by a system of canals. Macintosh Island is an island, substantially redeveloped to create a canal residential estate (). It was named after Hugh Macintosh, a draftsman in the Queensland Lands Department, who was heavily involved in the surveying of Gold Coast area. It is connected to the mainland by the Gold Coast Highway, which passes through the eastern part of the island from north (Main Beach) to south (Surfers Paradise). Chevron Island is a natural island which has been developed for residential use as a neighbourhood (). Thomas Drive is the main road on an east-west axis and which connects the island by two bridges to mainland Surfers Paradise to the east and to the suburb or Southport to the west. It has another bridge to the north to Cronin Island (), a smaller reclaimed island and residential neighbourhood which is only accessible by road via Chevron Island. Cronin Island is named after Jack Cronin, the first engineer employed by the Southport Town Council (now the Gold Coast City Council). Budds Beach is a beach on the Nerang River on the mainland part of the suburb facing Macintosh Island, Chrevron Island and Cronin Island (). It was named after Alan Foster Budd who built a house there in the 1940s. Jarriparilla Cove is the body of water that lies between Budds Beach and Macintosh Island (). It is a traditional Aboriginal name. Girung Island is a small undeveloped island () named using Yugambeh word for the flying foxes (fruit bats) which roost on the island. Despite its name, the Isle of Capri is not an island but a canal residential neighbourhood () in the south-west of the suburb on the western side of the Nerang River. Also on the western side of the river and to the north of the Isle of Capri is Evandale Park () which is a park which contains the Gold Coast Council Chambers (administrative centre) and the council's Home of the Arts cultural precinct. Northcliffe Beach is a section of the Surfers Paradise Beach () in the area of Northcliffe Terrace, a name that refers to a 1920s real estate development between Enderley Avenue and Fern Street. History alt= James Beattie, a farmer, became the first European to settle in the area when he staked out an farm on the northern bank of the Nerang River, close to present-day Cavill Avenue. The farm proved unsuccessful and was sold in 1877 to German immigrant Johan Meyer, who turned the land into a sugar farm and mill. Meyer also had little luck growing in the sandy soil and within a decade had auctioned the farm to focus on providing access to tourists wanting to visit the surf beach. From 1880 to 1928, Meyer's Ferry operated across the Nerang River transporting passengers and vehicles. He operated a horse-and-buggy service from the Southport railway station to the beach. He built the Main Beach Hotel. By 1889, Meyer's hotel had become a post receiving office and subdivisions surrounding it were called Elston, named by the Southport postmaster after his wife's home in Southport, Lancashire, England. The Main Beach Hotel licence lapsed after Meyer's death in 1901 and for 16 years Elston was a tourist town without a hotel or post office.* Gold Coast City Council ‚Äì Early History of Surfers Paradise . Council of the City of Gold Coast. Retrieved 15 October 2015. Real estate map of Northcliffe Estate, now the heart of Surfers Paradise, circa 1920s In 1917, a land auction was held by Brisbane real estate company Arthur Blackwood to sell subdivided blocks in Elston as the \\"Surfers' Paradise Estate\\", but the auction failed because access was difficult. This was the first recorded reference to the name Surfers Paradise. Elston began to get more visitors after the opening of Jubilee Bridge and the extension of the South Coast Road in 1925. Elston was no longer cut off by the river and speculators began buying land around Elston and further south at Burleigh Heads. Estates down the coast were promoted and hotels opened to accommodate tourists and investors. In 1925, Brisbane hotelier Jim Cavill opened the Surfers Paradise Hotel located on what would later become the site of the Surfers Paradise Centre which incorporates the Surfers Paradise Beer Garden and Hard Rock Cafe. In opening the hotel and neighbouring zoo, Cavill created the first attraction in the suburb. Located between the ferry jetty and the white surf beach off the South Coast Road, it became popular and shops and services sprang up around it. In the following years Cavill pushed to have the name Elston changed to Surfers' Paradise. The suburb was officially renamed on 1 December 1933 after the local council felt the Surfers Paradise name was more marketable. In July 1936 Cavill's timber hotel burnt to the ground and was rebuilt the following year. Surfers Paradise State School was first established in Laycock Street, three blocks south of Cavill Avenue, in 1934. It relocated to its current site on the Isle of Capri site in 1976. A development boom followed in the 1950s and 1960s. The first highrise in Surfers Paradise was erected in 1959 and was named the Kinkabool. The Kinkabool stood 10 stories high and remains to this day in Hanlan Street. Many tall apartment buildings were constructed in the decades that followed, including the iconic buildings included the Iluka, St Tropez and The Pink Poodle. The boom later saw strong Japanese investment in the 1980s. Little remains of the early vegetation or natural features of the area and even the historical association of the beachfront development with the river is tenuous. The early subdivision pattern remains, although later reclamation of the islands in the Nerang River as housing estates (e.g. Chevron Island), and the bridges to those islands, have created a contrast reflected in subdivision and building form. Some early remnants survived such as Budds Beach ‚Äî a low- scale open area on the river which even in the early history of the area was a centre for boating, fishing and swimming. Surfers Paradise high-rise, visible from Coolangatta, 2014 Some minor changes have occurred in extending the road along the beachfront since the early subdivision and The Esplanade road is now a focus of activity, with supporting shops and restaurants. The intensity of activity, centred on Cavill, Orchid and Elkhorn Avenues, is reflected in the density of development. Of all places on the Gold Coast the high-rise buildings in this area constitute a dominant and enduring image visible from as far south as Coolangatta and from the mountain resorts of the hinterland. At the , Surfers Paradise had a population of 19,668. In the , Surfers Paradise had a population of 23,689 people.

The park features the Sling Shot and Vomatron rides as well as a mini golf course. = Meter Maids = The Surfers Paradise Meter Maids were introduced in 1965 when entrepreneur Bernie Elsey opposed the installation of parking meters in Surfers Paradise. The maids were hired to top up expired parking meters with coins and dressed in gold bikinis. Meter feeding is against the law but council decided to ignore the offence due to the good publicity it garnered. Gold Coast Mayor Bruce Small promoted the city in 1967 through the use of the bikini-clad meters maids. The meter maids initially dressed in gold lam√© bikinis and a tiara but the outfit would go through several changes during their existence. The attire has now evolved into a gold lycra bikini and an Akubra hat. A sash is often worn emblazoned \\"Surfers Paradise Meter Maids\\". Controversial retired Australian rules football player Warwick Capper underwent a short stint as a Surfers Paradise meter maid in 2007. The evolution of parking meters to no longer take coins has ended the meter maids's traditional role, but they continue to assist visitors and participate in tourism events. = Nightlife Precinct = The \\"Gold Coast Nightlife Precinct\\" offers many after-dark activities for visitors, especially around Cavill Avenue. The precinct is considered Australia's nightlife capital and attracts close to 20,000 visitors daily.

The festival comprises an accessible mix of family events, exhibitions, live music, street markets and short film screenings. = Gold Coast Marathon = In July, Surfers Paradise hosts the annual Gold Coast Marathon in July, attracting runners from around the world. = Gold Coast 600 = In Surfers Paradise there also is the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit, which hosted CART for a long time and now hosts the Gold Coast 600 each October. = Schoolies = Surfing, a popular recreational sport at the Surfers Paradise Beach Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise during Schoolies week. Schoolies week is an Australian tradition of high-school graduates (also known as 'schoolies' or 'leavers') having week-long holidays following the end of their final exams in late November and early December. The tradition began on the Gold Coast in the early to mid 1980s and Surfers Paradise is still the largest single venue for the event. Prior to the 1980s, school leavers enjoyed one \\"muck up day\\" at the end of their Senior year, which often ended by meeting up at one of the old beer gardens in Surfers or Broadbeach. Official Schoolies events on the Gold Coast are drug-free and alcohol-free events held on the beach. The events often include concerts and parties. The event is often seen as a rite of passage for graduating students and a transitional period from youth to adulthood. It is constantly criticised as promoting teen sex and under age drinking/drug taking. The event also attracts over age and under age attendees that are referred to as 'toolies' and 'foolies'. It is estimated that around 40,000 teenagers travel to the Gold Coast for the Schoolies event every year. A dedicated Schoolies event zone, featuring live music and youth-themed activities, is established each year on Surfers Paradise Beach in order to provide a safe, fun environment for school leavers. The area is monitored for exclusive use of current Year 12 school leavers. Schoolies Hub Beach area opens nightly from 7pm.

Texts from the Indian subcontinent describe principles of design, layout, measurements, ground preparation, space arrangement, and spatial geometry. Vastu Shastras incorporate traditional Hindu and (in some cases) Buddhist beliefs. The designs aim to integrate architecture with nature, the relative functions of various parts of the structure, and ancient beliefs utilising geometric patterns (yantra), symmetry, and directional alignments. Vastu Shastra are the textual part of Vastu Vidya - the broader knowledge about architecture and design theories from ancient India. Vastu Vidya knowledge is a collection of ideas and concepts, with or without the support of layout diagrams, that are not rigid. Rather, these ideas and concepts are models for the organisation of space and form within a building or collection of buildings, based on their functions in relation to each other, their usage and the overall fabric of the Vastu. Ancient Vastu Shastra principles include those for the design of Mandir (Hindu temples),George Michell (1988), The Hindu Temple: An Introduction to Its Meaning and Forms, University of Chicago Press, , pp 21-22 and the principles for the design and layout of houses, towns, cities, gardens, roads, water works, shops and other public areas.GD Vasudev (2001), Vastu, Motilal Banarsidas, , pp 74-92 Sherri Silverman (2007), Vastu: Transcendental Home Design in Harmony with Nature, Gibbs Smith, Utah, . Terminology The Sanskrit word vƒÅstu means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land. The vrddhi, vƒÅstu, takes the meaning of \\"the site or foundation of a house, site, ground, building or dwelling-place, habitation, homestead, house\\". The underlying root is vas \\"to dwell, live, stay, reside\\".Monier- Williams (1899). The term shastra may loosely be translated as \\"doctrine, teaching\\". VƒÅstu-≈öastras (literally, science of dwelling) are ancient Sanskrit manuals of architecture. These contain Vastu-Vidya (literally, knowledge of dwelling).BB Dutt (1925), , ; See critical review by LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391 History Theories tracing links of the principles of composition in Vastu Shastra and the Indus Valley Civilization have been made, but scholar Kapila Vatsyayan is reluctant to speculate on such links given the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered. According to Chakrabarti, Vastu Vidya is as old the Vedic period and linked to the ritual architecture. According to Michael W. Meister, the Atharvaveda contains verses with mystic cosmogony which provide a paradigm for cosmic planning, but they did not represent architecture nor a developed practice. Varahamihira's Brihat Samhita dated to the sixth century CE, states Meister, is the first known Indian text that describes \\"something like a vastupurusamandala to plan cities and buildings\\". The emergence of Vastu vidya as a specialised field of science is speculated to have occurred significantly before the 1st-century CE. Description Ancient India produced many Sanskrit manuals of architecture, called Vastu Sastra. Many of these are about Hindu temple layout (above), design and construction, along with chapters on design principles for houses, villages, towns. The architect and artists (Silpins) were given wide latitude to experiment and express their creativity. There exist many VƒÅstu-≈öastras on the art of building houses, temples, towns and cities. One such VƒÅstu ≈öastra is by Thakkura Pheru, describing where and how temples should be built.Stella Kramrisch (1976), The Hindu Temple Volume 1 & 2, Jack Hebner (2010), Architecture of the VƒÅstu ≈öastra - According to Sacred Science, in Science of the Sacred (Editor: David Osborn), , pp. 85-92; N Lahiri (1996), Archaeological landscapes and textual images: a study of the sacred geography of late medieval Ballabgarh, World Archaeology, 28(2), pp 244-264 By 6th century AD, Sanskrit manuals for constructing palatial temples were in circulation in India.Susan Lewandowski (1984), Buildings and Society: Essays on the Social Development of the Built Environment, edited by Anthony D. King, Routledge, , Chapter 4 VƒÅstu-≈öastra manuals included chapters on home construction, town planning, and how efficient villages, towns and kingdoms integrated temples, water bodies and gardens within them to achieve harmony with nature. While it is unclear, states Barnett,LD Barnett, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol 4, Issue 2, June 1926, pp 391 as to whether these temple and town planning texts were theoretical studies and if or when they were properly implemented in practice, the manuals suggest that town planning and Hindu temples were conceived as ideals of art and integral part of Hindu social and spiritual life. The Silpa Prakasa of Odisha, authored by Ramachandra Bhattaraka Kaulachara sometime in ninth or tenth century CE, is another VƒÅstu ≈öastra.Alice Boner and SadƒÅ≈õiva Rath ≈öarmƒÅ (1966), , E.J. Brill (Netherlands) Silpa Prakasa describes the geometric principles in every aspect of the temple and symbolism such as 16 emotions of human beings carved as 16 types of female figures. These styles were perfected in Hindu temples prevalent in eastern states of India. Other ancient texts found expand these architectural principles, suggesting that different parts of India developed, invented and added their own interpretations. For example, in Saurastra tradition of temple building found in western states of India, the feminine form, expressions and emotions are depicted in 32 types of Nataka-stri compared to 16 types described in Silpa Prakasa. Silpa Prakasa provides brief introduction to 12 types of Hindu temples. Other texts, such as Pancaratra Prasada Prasadhana compiled by Daniel SmithH. Daniel Smith (1963), Ed. PƒÅncarƒÅtra prasƒÅda prasƒÅdhapam, A Pancaratra Text on Temple-Building, Syracuse: University of Rochester, and Silpa Ratnakara compiled by Narmada SankaraMahanti and Mahanty (1995 Reprint), ≈öilpa RatnƒÅkara, Orissa Akademi, provide a more extensive list of Hindu temple types. Ancient Sanskrit manuals for temple construction discovered in Rajasthan, in northwestern region of India, include Sutradhara Mandana's Prasadamandana (literally, manual for planning and building a temple) with chapters on town building.Amita Sinha (1998), Design of Settlements in the Vaastu Shastras, Journal of Cultural Geography, 17(2), pp 27-41, Manasara shilpa and Mayamata, texts of South Indian origin, estimated to be in circulation by 5th to 7th century AD, is a guidebook on South Indian Vastu design and construction.Tillotson, G. H. R. (1997). Svastika Mansion: A Silpa-Sastra in the 1930s. South Asian Studies, 13(1), pp 87-97 Isanasivagurudeva paddhati is another Sanskrit text from the 9th century describing the art of building in India in south and central India.Ganapati Sastri (1920), ƒ™≈õƒÅna≈õivagurudeva paddhati, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, In north India, Brihat-samhita by VarƒÅhamihira is the widely cited ancient Sanskrit manual from 6th century describing the design and construction of Nagara style of Hindu temples.Heather Elgood (2000), Hinduism and the religious arts, , Bloomsbury Academic, pp 121-125H Kern (1865), The Brhat Sanhita of Varaha-mihara, The Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta These ancient VƒÅstu ≈öastras, often discuss and describe the principles of Hindu temple design, but do not limit themselves to the design of a Hindu temple.S Bafna, On the Idea of the Mandala as a Governing Device in Indian Architectural Tradition, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Mar. 2000), pp. 26-49 They describe the temple as a holistic part of its community, and lay out various principles and a diversity of alternate designs for home, village and city layout along with the temple, gardens, water bodies and nature.Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, Mandala types and properties The 8x8 (64) grid Manduka Vastu Purusha Mandala layout for Hindu Temples. It is one of 32 Vastu Purusha Mandala grid patterns described in Vastu sastras. In this grid structure of symmetry, each concentric layer has significance. The central area in all mandala is the Brahmasthana. Mandala \\"circle-circumference\\" or \\"completion\\", is a concentric diagram having spiritual and ritual significance in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The space occupied by it varies in different mandala ‚Äì in Pitha (9) and Upapitha (25) it occupies one square module, in Mahaapitha (16), Ugrapitha (36) and Manduka (64), four square modules and in Sthandila (49) and Paramasaayika (81), nine square modules. The Pitha is an amplified Prithvimandala in which, according to some texts, the central space is occupied by earth. The Sthandila mandala is used in a concentric manner. The most important mandala is the Manduka/Chandita Mandala of 64 squares and the Paramasaayika Mandala of 81 squares. The normal position of the Vastu Purusha (head in the northeast, legs in the southwest) is as depicted in the Paramasaayika Mandala. However, in the Manduka Mandala the Vastu Purusha is depicted with the head facing east and the feet facing west. vastu directional chakara It is believed that every piece of a land or a building has a soul of its own and that soul is known as Vastu Purusha. A site of any shape can be divided using the Pada Vinyasa. Sites are known by the number of squares. They range from 1x1 to 32x32 (1024) square sites. Examples of mandalas with the corresponding names of sites include: * Sakala (1 square) corresponds to Eka- pada (single divided site) * Pechaka (4 squares) corresponds to Dwi-pada (two divided site) * Pitha (9 squares) corresponds to Tri-pada (three divided site) * Mahaapitha (16 squares) corresponds to Chatush-pada (four divided site) * Upapitha (25 squares) corresponds to Pancha-pada (five divided site) * Ugrapitha (36 squares) corresponds to Shashtha-pada (six divided site) * Sthandila (49 squares) corresponds to Sapta-pada (seven divided site) * Manduka/ Chandita (64 square) corresponds to Ashta-pada (eight divided site) * Paramasaayika (81 squares) corresponds to Nava-pada (nine divided site) * Aasana (100 squares) corresponds to Dasa-pada (ten divided site) * Bhadrmahasan (196 squares) corresponds to Chodah-pada (14 divided sites) Modern adaptations and usage Vastu Shastra-inspired plan adapted and evolved by modern architect Charles Correa in the design of Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur, Rajasthan. VƒÅstu ≈öastra represents a body of ancient concepts and knowledge to many modern architects, a guideline but not a rigid code. The square-grid mandala is viewed as a model of organisation, not as a ground plan. The ancient VƒÅstu ≈öastra texts describe functional relations and adaptable alternate layouts for various rooms or buildings and utilities, but do not mandate a set compulsory architecture. Sachdev and Tillotson state that the mandala is a guideline, and employing the mandala concept of VƒÅstu ≈öastra does not mean every room or building has to be square. The basic theme is around core elements of central space, peripheral zones, direction with respect to sunlight, and relative functions of the spaces. The pink city Jaipur in Rajasthan was master planned by Rajput king Jai Singh and built by 1727 CE, in part around Vastu Shilpa Sastra principles.Jantar Mantar & Jaipur - Section II National University of Singapore, pp. 17-22 Similarly, modern era projects such as the architect Charles Correa's designed Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya in Ahmedabad, Vidhan Bhavan in Bhopal, and Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, adapt and apply concepts from the Vastu Shastra Vidya. In the design of Chandigarh city, Le Corbusier incorporated modern architecture theories with those of Vastu Shastra. During the colonial rule period of India, town planning officials of the British Raj did not consider Vastu Vidya, but largely grafted Islamic Mughal era motifs and designs such as domes and arches onto Victorian-era style buildings without overall relationship layout. This movement, known as Indo-Saracenic architecture, is found in chaotically laid out, but externally grand structures in the form of currently used major railway stations, harbours, tax collection buildings, and other colonial offices in South Asia. VƒÅstu ≈öastra Vidya was ignored, during colonial era construction, for several reasons. These texts were viewed by 19th and early 20th century architects as archaic, the literature was inaccessible being in an ancient language not spoken or read by the architects, and the ancient texts assumed space to be readily available. In contrast, public projects in the colonial era were forced into crowded spaces and local layout constraints, and the ancient Vastu sastra were viewed with prejudice as superstitious and rigid about a square grid or traditional materials of construction. Sachdev and Tillotson state that these prejudices were flawed, as a scholarly and complete reading of the VƒÅstu ≈öastra literature amply suggests the architect is free to adapt the ideas to new materials of construction, local layout constraints and into a non-square space. The design and completion of a new city of Jaipur in early 1700s based on VƒÅstu ≈öastra texts, well before any colonial era public projects, was one of many proofs. Other examples include modern public projects designed by Charles Correa such as Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur, and Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad. Vastu Shastra remedies have also been applied by Khushdeep Bansal in 1997 to the Parliament complex of India, when he contented that the library being built next to the building is responsible for political instability in the country. German architect Klaus- Peter Gast states that the principles of VƒÅstu ≈öastras is witnessing a major revival and wide usage in the planning and design of individual homes, residential complexes, commercial and industrial campuses, and major public projects in India, along with the use of ancient iconography and mythological art work incorporated into the Vastu vidya architectures. = Vastu and superstition = The use of Vastu shastra and Vastu consultants in modern home and public projects is controversial. Some architects, particularly during India's colonial era, considered it arcane and superstitious. Other architects state that critics have not read the texts and that most of the text is about flexible design guidelines for space, sunlight, flow and function. Vastu Shastra is considered as pseudoscience by rationalists like Narendra Nayak of Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations. Scientist and astronomer Jayant Narlikar considers Vastu Shastra as pseudoscience and writes that Vastu does not have any \\"logical connection\\" to the environment. One of the examples cited by Narlikar arguing the absence of logical connection is the Vastu rule, \\"sites shaped like a triangle ... will lead to government harassment, ... parallelogram can lead to quarrels in the family.\\" Narlikar notes that sometimes the building plans are changed and what has already been built is demolished to accommodate for Vastu rules. Regarding superstitious beliefs in Vastu, Science writer Meera Nanda cites the case of N. T. Rama Rao, the ex- chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, who sought the help of Vastu consultants for his political problems. Rama Rao was advised that his problems would be solved if he entered his office from an east facing gate. Accordingly, a slum on the east facing side of his office was ordered to be demolished, to make way for his car's entrance. The knowledge of Vastu consultants is questioned by Pramod Kumar (citation required), \\"Ask the Vaastu folks if they know civil engineering or architecture or the local government rules on construction or minimum standards of construction to advise people on buildings. They will get into a barrage of \\"ancient\\" texts and \\"science\\" that smack of the pseudo- science of astrology. Ask them where they were before the construction boom and if they will go to slum tenements to advise people or advise on low-cost community-housing‚Äîyou draw a blank.\\" Sanskrit treatises on architecture Of the numerous Sanskrit treatises mentioned in ancient Indian literature, some have been translated in English. Many Agamas, Puranas and Hindu scriptures include chapters on architecture of temples, homes, villages, towns, fortifications, streets, shop layout, public wells, public bathing, public halls, gardens, river fronts among other things. In some cases, the manuscripts are partially lost, some are available only in Tibetan, Nepalese or South Indian languages, while in others original Sanskrit manuscripts are available in different parts of India.

They produced two studio albums and three singles. Their songs were said to have \\"contempt for the cliches of contemporary sexual politics\\" and their music has been compared to the Gang of Four and the Young Marble Giants. The band was led by Lesley Woods, who was once described as \\"one of the most striking women in British rock\\". Career Their first album Playing with a Different Sex is considered a post-punk classic with strong, sarcastic songs like \\"It's Obvious\\" and \\"We're So Cool\\" taking a dry look at gender relations. Other songs, such as \\"Armagh\\" with its refrain, \\"we don't torture\\" criticized the British government's treatment of Irish Republican prisoners in the troubles in Northern Ireland, which caused some controversy at the time. The band performed in 1980 for the concert film Urgh! A Music War. The band's second album, Sense and Sensuality (1982), showed a greater influence of jazz, soul, funk and disco on the band's sound, but was less well received. Following the departure of Jane Munro in 1983, the band recruited Nick O'Connor who also played piano and synthesizers. At this time the group were further augmented by Jayne Morris (percussion and backing vocals), Graeme Hamilton (trumpet) and Cara Tivey on additional keyboards. The band were scheduled to record a third album with producer Steve Lillywhite in 1983 but broke up. Woods has intimated that that the hostility and violence she and other women faced playing music was a factor in the group's demise: 'There comes a point where you can‚Äôt go on any more at that level,' she told Nige Tassell of the Guardian. Woods formed an all-woman band called the Darlings in the late 1980s, but then left the music industry. Now as Lesley Longhurst- Woods she works as a lawyer in London. Guitarist Paul Foad published a guitar technique book, co-written with Stuart Ritchie, titled The Caged Guitarist (2000). Bass player Jane Munro works as an alternative therapist (aromatherapy, reflexology and Indian head massage) in Birmingham. Pete Hammond also remains an active musician and teaches percussion in Birmingham. Reception In a review of the band's debut show at the Whisky a Go Go, critic Richard Cromelin said: \\"When the crowd at the Whisky kept calling Au Pairs back to the stage for encores Wednesday night, it was as if they were trying to tell the group's singer Lesley Woods that her band had done just fine and she could go ahead and loosen up a little.\\" (Los Angeles Times, 1981) Writing about their show at The Ritz, John Rockwell said \\"The Au Pairs blend political lyrics, a tough, funk-dance-rock idiom and an at least initially dispassionate vocal style, rather like the Gang of Four meeting the Young Marble Giants\\" and suggested that Lesley Woods \\"and the band were able to build the insinuating monotones of the songs early in the set through street taunts into a rousing rock-and-roll climax.\\" (The New York Times, 1981) Music historian Gillian G. Gaar noted in her 2002 She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock and Roll (Live Girls) that the band mingled male and female musicians in a revolutionary collaborative way, as part of its outspoken explorations of sexual politics.

Other seasonings may include garlic, onions, and cumin. The dish originated in northern Mexico or southern Texas. Geographic and personal tastes involve different types of meat and other ingredients. Recipes provoke disputes among aficionados, some of whom insist that the word chili applies only to the basic dish, without beans and tomatoes. Chili con carne is a common dish for cook-offs, and may be used as a side, garnish, or ingredient in other dishes, such as soups or salsas. Origins and history In writings from 1529, the Franciscan friar, Bernardino de Sahag√∫n described chili pepper-seasoned stews being consumed in the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, now the location of Mexico City. The use of beef as the primary meat originated with Spanish colonizers. In Spanish, the term \\"chile con carne\\", consisting of the word chile (from the Nahuatl chƒ´lli) and carne, Spanish for 'meat', is first recorded in a book from 1857 about the Mexican-American War. A recipe dating back to the 1850s describes dried beef, suet, dried chili peppers and salt, which were pounded together, formed into bricks and left to dry, which could then be boiled in pots in an army encampment in Monterrey, of what is now Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico. Chili became commonly prepared in northern Mexico and southern Texas. Unlike some other Texas foods, such as barbecued brisket, chili largely originated with working- class Tejana and Mexican women. The chili queens of San Antonio, Texas were particularly famous in previous decades for selling their inexpensive chili- flavored beef stew in their casual \\"chili joints\\". The San Antonio Chili Stand, in operation at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, helped popularize chili by giving many Americans their first taste of it. San Antonio was a tourist destination and helped Texas-style chili con carne spread throughout the South and West. Chili con carne is the official dish of the U.S. state of Texas as designated by the House Concurrent Resolution Number 18 of the 65th Texas Legislature during its regular session in 1977.\\"State Dish - Chili\\". Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Retrieved on March 7, 2010. =Chili parlors= green hot chilis, kidney beans, and tomatoes Before World War II, hundreds of small, family-run chili parlors could be found throughout Texas and other states, particularly those in which √©migr√© Texans had made new homes. Each establishment usually had a claim to some kind of secret recipe. By 1904, chili parlors were opening outside of Texas, in part due to the availability of commercial versions of chili powder, first manufactured in Texas in the late 19th century. After working at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Charles Taylor opened a chili parlor in Carlinville, Illinois, serving Mexican Chili.\\"The First 100 Years\\", Taylorschili.com Varallo's, the oldest restaurant in Tennessee, opened as a chili parlor in 1907, competing with other chili parlors that had opened in Nashville during the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, chains of diner-style chili parlors began opening in the Midwest. Cincinnati chili, a dish developed by Greek immigrants deriving from their own culinary traditions, arguably represents the most vibrant continuation of the chili parlor tradition, with dozens of restaurants offering this style throughout the Cincinnati area. It can be traced back to at least 1922, when the original Empress Chili location opened. In Green Bay, Wisconsin, the chili parlor Chili John's has existed since 1913. As with Cincinnati chili, it is most commonly served over spaghetti with oyster crackers, but the recipe is less sweet with a higher proportion of fat.The Secret to Making Green Bay‚Äôs Own Chili John's Style Chili in Your Kitchen The original proprietor's son opened a second location in Burbank, California in 1946, which is also still in existence.Chili John's Burbank, CA : Food Network Until the late 2000s, a chili parlor dating to 1904, O.T. Hodge, continued to operate in St. Louis. It featured a chili-topped dish called a slinger: two cheeseburger patties, hash browns, and two eggs, and smothered in chili.O.T. Hodges Menu, a \\"chili parlor\\" in Ferguson, MO in business since 1904. As of 2014 no O.T. Hodge-branded locations remain. Dispute over ingredients Ingredients for chili con carne =Beans= Beans, a staple of Tex-Mex cuisine, have been associated with chili as far back as the early 20th century. The question of whether beans belong in chili has long been a matter of contention among chili cooks. While it is generally accepted that the earliest chilis did not include beans, proponents of their inclusion contend that chili with beans has a long enough history to be considered authentic.Albala, Ken. Beans: A History. Oxford:Berg, 2007 p. 178 The Chili Appreciation Society International specified in 1999 that, among other things, cooks are forbidden to include beans in the preparation of chili for official competition‚Äînor are they allowed to marinate any meats.Chili Appreciation Society International, Official CASI Rules & Guidelines October 1, 1999 Small red or pink common beans are commonly used for chili, as are black beans, black-eyed peas, kidney beans, pinto beans, great northern beans, or navy beans. A bowl of Texas-style chili without beans Most commercially-prepared canned chili includes beans. Commercial chili prepared without beans is usually called \\"chili no beans\\" in the United States. Some U.S. manufacturers, notably Bush Brothers and Company and Eden Organic, also sell canned precooked beans (without meat) that are labeled \\"chili beans\\"; these beans are intended for consumers to add to a chili recipe and are often sold with spices added. =Tomatoes= Tomatoes are another ingredient on which opinions differ. Wick Fowler, a north Texas newspaperman and inventor of \\"Two-Alarm Chili\\" (which he later marketed as a kit of spices), insisted on adding tomato sauce to his chili in the ratio of one 15-ounce can per three pounds of meat (425 g per 1.36 kg). He also believed that chili should never be eaten freshly cooked, but refrigerated overnight to seal in the flavor. Matt Weinstock, a Los Angeles newspaper columnist, once remarked that Fowler's chili \\"was reputed to open eighteen sinus cavities unknown to the medical profession\\".Tolbert, A Bowl of Red Variations =Vegetarian chili= A pot of vegetarian chili Vegetarian chili (also known as chili sin carne, chili without meat, chili non carne, and chili sans carne) acquired wide popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and 1970s with the rise of vegetarianism. It is also popular with those on a diet restricting the use of red meat. To make the chili vegetarian, the cook leaves out the meat or replaces it with a meat analogue, such as textured vegetable protein or tofu, quinoa, or a starchy vegetable, such as potatoes. These chilis nearly always include beans. Variants may contain corn, squash, saut√©ed mushrooms, pearl onions, shallots or beets. =Chili verde= Chili verde ('green chili') is a moderately to extremely spicy New Mexican stew or sauce usually made from chunks of pork that have been slow-cooked in chicken broth, garlic, green tomatillos, and roasted green chilis.https://norecipes.com/chile-verde The spiciness of the chili is adjusted by the use of various peppers: poblano, jalape√±o, serrano, and occasionally habanero. Chili verde is a common filling for the Mission burrito. =White chili= White chili is made using chicken or turkey meat and broth, white beans, and green chili peppers. The resulting dish appears white when cooked and is more of a soup rather than a thickened stew. A white cheese, such as Monterey Jack, or sour cream are often added when served. Accompaniments and additions Chili with garnishes and tortilla chips Chili with mashed corn served in Austria The dish may be served with toppings or accompaniments; grated cheese, diced onions, and sour cream are common toppings, as are saltine crackers, tortilla chips or corn chips, cornbread, rolled-up corn or flour tortillas, and pork tamales. Chili can also be served over rice or pasta in dishes such as chili mac. Pre-made chili =Canned chili= Willie Gebhardt, originally of New Braunfels, Texas, and later of San Antonio, produced the first canned chili in 1908. Rancher Lyman Davis near Corsicana, Texas, developed Wolf Brand Chili in 1895. He owned a meat market and was a particular fan of Texas-style chili. In the 1880s, in partnership with an experienced range cook, he began producing heavily spiced chili based on chunks of lean beef and rendered beef suet, which he sold by the pot to local caf√©s. In 1921, Davis began canning his product, naming it for his pet wolf, Kaiser Bill. Wolf Brand canned chili was a favorite of Will Rogers, who always took along a case when traveling and performing in other regions of the world. Ernest Tubb, the country singer, was such a fan that one Texas hotel maintained a supply of Wolf Brand for his visits. Both the Gebhardt and Wolf brands are now owned by ConAgra Foods, Inc. Another major maker of canned chili, Hormel, sells chili available with or without beans, made with turkey or in vegetarian varieties, under their own name and other brands like Stagg. =Brick chili= Another method of marketing commercial chili in the days before widespread home refrigerators was \\"brick chili\\". It was produced by pressing out nearly all of the moisture, leaving a solid substance roughly the size and shape of a half-brick. Wolf Brand was originally sold in this form.Tommy W. Stringer, \\"WOLF BRAND CHILI\\", Handbook of Texas Online (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/diw01), accessed March 6, 2013. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Commonly available in small towns and rural areas of the American Southwest in the first three- quarters of the 20th century, brick chili has largely been surpassed by canned chili, but can still be found in some stores. =Seasoning mix= Home cooks may also purchase seasoning mixes for chili, including packets of dry ingredients such as chili powder, masa flour, salt, and cayenne pepper, to flavor meat and other ingredients. Other dishes made with chili * A chili dog is a hot dog served with a topping of chili (usually without beans). * A chili burger is a burger topped with chili (usually without beans). * A chili size refers to chili served over a ground beef patty (often with cheese) in a bowl or on a plate. * Chili is also added to french fries and cheese to make chili cheese fries, or Coney Island fries. * Chili mac is a dish made with canned chili, or roughly the same ingredients as chili (meat, spices, onion, tomato sauce, beans, and sometimes other vegetables), with the addition of macaroni or some other pasta. Chili mac is a standard dish in the U.S. military and is one of the varieties of Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE). * A Frito pie or walking taco, as it is called at festivals and county fairs in the midwest, typically consists of a small, single-serving bag of Fritos corn chips with a cup of chili poured over them, often topped with grated cheese or onions and jalape√±os and sour cream.

Many garlic presses also have a device with a matching grid of blunt pins to clean out the holes. A garlic press, also known as a garlic crusher, is a kitchen utensil to crush garlic cloves efficiently by forcing them through a grid of small holes, usually with some type of piston. Many garlic presses also have a device with a matching grid of blunt pins to clean out the holes. Garlic presses present a convenient alternative to mincing garlic with a knife, especially because a clove of garlic can be passed through a sturdy press without even removing its peel. The peel remains in the press while the garlic is extruded out. Some sourcesFor example, the Epicurious Food Dictionary also claim that pressing with the peel on makes cleaning the press easier. Garlic crushed by a press is generally believed to have a different flavor from minced garlic, more of garlic's strong flavor compounds are liberated. A few sources prefer the flavor of pressed garlic. Raw-foods chef Ren√©e Underkoffler says \\"a good garlic press makes dealing with garlic a clean pleasure. Pressed garlic has a lighter, more delicate flavor than minced garlic because it excludes the bitter center stem.\\" p. 179.

On the other hand, some chefs say garlic crushed in a press has an inferior flavor compared to other forms of garlic. For instance, chef Anthony Bourdain called garlic presses \\"abominations\\" and advised \\"don't put it through a press.

Definition of Internship (as set forth in the Ohio State University Department of Political Science, accessed January 22, 2013 Once confined to medical graduates, internship is used for a wide range of placements in businesses, non-profit organizations and government agencies. They are typically undertaken by students and graduates looking to gain relevant skills and experience in a particular field. Employers benefit from these placements because they often recruit employees from their best interns, who have known capabilities, thus saving time and money in the long run. Internships are usually arranged by third-party organizations that recruit interns on behalf of industry groups. Rules vary from country to country about when interns should be regarded as employees. The system can be open to exploitation by unscrupulous employers. Internships for professional careers are similar in some ways. Similar to internships, apprenticeships transition students from vocational school into the workforce.\\"The difference between Internships and Apprenticeships\\". internstars.co.uk. The lack of standardization and oversight leaves the term \\"internship\\" open to broad interpretation. Interns may be high school students, college and university students, or post-graduate adults. These positions may be paid or unpaid and are temporary. Many large corporations, particularly investment banks, have \\"insights\\" programs that serve as a pre-internship event numbering a day to a week, either in person or virtually. Typically, an internship consists of an exchange of services for experience between the intern and the organization. Internships are used to determine if the intern still has an interest in that field after the real-life experience. In addition, an internship can be used to create a professional network that can assist with letters of recommendation or lead to future employment opportunities. The benefit of bringing an intern into full-time employment is that they are already familiar with the company, their position, and they typically need little to no training. Internships provide current college students with the ability to participate in a field of their choice to receive hands-on learning about a particular future career, preparing them for full-time work following graduation.  Types  Internships exist in a wide variety of industries and settings. An internship can be paid, unpaid, or partially paid (in the form of a stipend).\\"Unpaid internships face legal, ethical scrutiny\\" , The Bowdoin Orient, Bowdoin College, April 30, 2004 Internships may be part-time or full- time and are usually flexible with students' schedules. A typical internship lasts between one and four months, but can be shorter or longer, depending on the organization involved. The act of job shadowing may also constitute interning. *Insights: Many large corporations, particularly investment banks, have \\"insights\\" programs that serve as a pre-internship event numbering a day to a week, either in person or virtually. *Paid internships are common in professional fields including medicine, architecture, science, engineering, law, business (especially accounting and finance), technology, and advertising. Work experience internships usually occur during the second or third year of schooling. This type of internship is to expand an intern's knowledge both in their school studies and also at the company. The intern is expected to bring ideas and knowledge from school into the company. * Work research, virtual research (graduation) or dissertation: This is mostly done by students who are in their final year of school. With this kind of internship, a student does research for a particular company. The company can have something that they feel they need to improve, or the student can choose a topic in the company themselves. The results of the research study will be put in a report and often will have to be presented. * Unpaid internships are typically through non-profit charities and think tanks which often have unpaid or volunteer positions. State law and state enforcement agencies may impose requirements on unpaid internship programs under Minimum Wage Act. A program must meet criteria to be properly classified as an unpaid internship. * Partially-paid internships is when students are paid in the form of a stipend. Stipends are typically a fixed amount of money that is paid out on a regular basis. Usually, interns that are paid with stipends are paid on a set schedule associated with the organization. Another type of internship growing in popularity is the virtual internship, in which the intern works remotely, and is not physically present at the job location. It provides the capacity to gain job experience without the conventional requirement of being physically present in an office. The internship is conducted via virtual means, such as phone, email, and web communication. Virtual interns generally have the opportunity to work at their own pace.Virtual internship = Internship for a fee = Companies in search of interns often find and place students in mostly unpaid internships, for a fee. These companies charge students to assist with research, promising to refund the fee if no internship is found. The programs vary and aim to provide internship placements at reputable companies. Some companies may also provide controlled housing in a new city, mentorship, support, networking, weekend activities or academic credit. Some companies specifically fund scholarships and grants for low-income applicants. Critics of internships criticize the practice of requiring certain college credits to be obtained only through unpaid internships. Depending on the cost of the school, this is often seen as an unethical practice, as it requires students to exchange paid-for and often limited tuition credits to work an uncompensated job. Paying for academic credits is a way to ensure students complete the duration of the internship, since they can be held accountable by their academic institution. For example, a student may be awarded academic credit only after their university receives a positive review from the intern's supervisor at the sponsoring organization. =Secondary level work experience= Work experience in England was established in the 1970‚Äôs by Jack Pidcock, Principal Careers Officer of Manchester Careers Service. The Service organised two weeks work experience for all Year 10 pupils in Manchester Local Education Authority schools, including those for pupils with special educational needs. Ironically, it was initially resisted by trade unions, and at first he had a job convincing schools, until eventually he persuaded the L.E.A. and councillors to go ahead. It became highly valued by pupils, teachers, inspectors, employers and politicians. Work experience provided a taste of the requirements and disciplines of work and an insight into possible vocational choices. It ran alongside professional, individual, impartial, face to face careers guidance by local careers advisers. A Conservative Government introduced the Education (Work Experience) Act 1973 which enabled all education authorities ‚Äòto arrange for children under school-leaving age to have work experience, as part of their education‚Äô. The Conservative Liberal coalition government abolished compulsory work experience for students in England at key stage 4 (Years 10 to 11 for 14-16 years olds) in 2012. Recently a number of non-governmental and employer led bodies have become critical of pupils and students not understanding the ‚Äòworld of work‚Äô. Work experience is no longer offered on the national curriculum for students in years 10 and 11 in the United Kingdom. but is available for (3rd and 4th year in Scotland), Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland; every student who wishes to do so has a statutory right to take work experience. In 2011, however, the Wolf Review of Vocational Education proposed a significant policy change that‚Äîto reflect the fact that almost all students now stay past the age of 16‚Äîthe requirement for pre-16 work experience in the UK should be removed.A Wolf, Review of Vocational Education, 2011 recommendation 21 p.17 accessed 3 August 2011 Work experience in this context is when students in an adult working environment more or less act as an employee, but with the emphasis on learning about the world of work. Placements are limited by safety and security restrictions, insurance cover and availability, and do not necessarily reflect eventual career choice but instead allow a broad experience of the world of work.Oxfordshire Education Business Partnership - (OEBP) A student who fails to find a placement may sometimes be required to attend school every day‚Äîcontinuing the normal school day, or doing a placement around the school such as aiding the caretaker for example, or helping out elsewhere in the school, such as with language and PE departments, or with ICT technicians. Students are not prohibited from working at a company outside the conurbation of the city or abroad. Routine safety checks on the companies are now more thorough and students who arrange placements at failed companies are forced to find a new placement; companies that fail to comply with statutory requirements for insurance and child protection may be prohibited from officially taking students. (This depends upon the LEA.) Most students do not get paid for work experience. However, some employers pay students, as this is considered part of their education. The duration varies according to the student's course, and other personal circumstances. Most students go out on work experience for one or two weeks in a year. Some students work in a particular workplace, perhaps one or two days a week for extended periods of time throughout the year‚Äîeither for vocation reasons and commitment to alternative curricula or because they have social or behavioural problems. =University level work experience= At university level, work experience is often offered between the second and final years of an undergraduate degree course, especially in the science, engineering and computing fields. Courses of this nature are often called sandwich courses, with the work experience year itself known as the sandwich year. During this time, the students on work placement have the opportunity to use the skills and knowledge gained in their first two years, and see how they are applied to real world problems. This offers them useful insights for their final year and prepares them for the job market once their course has finished. Some companies sponsor students in their final year at university with the promise of a job at the end of the course. This is an incentive for the student to perform well during the placement as it helps with two otherwise unwelcome stresses: the lack of money in the final year, and finding a job when the University course ends.

It is traditionally served as an appetizer by Ashkenazi Jewish households. Historically it consisted of a minced-fish forcemeat stuffed inside the intact fish skin. By the 16th century, cooks had started omitting the labor-intensive stuffing step, and the seasoned fish is most commonly formed into patties similar to quenelles or fish balls. These are popular on Shabbat and Jewish Holidays such as Passover, although they may be consumed throughout the year. In Poland, gefilte fish, referred to as (\\"carp Jewish-style\\"), is a traditional dish in some Polish homes (more commonly in the northern regions near the Baltic Sea), served on Christmas Eve (for Twelve-dish supper) and on Holy Saturday.  Preparation and serving  Gefilte fish: whole stuffed and garnished fish Traditionally, carp, pike, mullet, or whitefish were used to make gefilte fish, but more recently other fish with white flesh such as Nile perch have been used, and there is a pink variation using salmon. There are even vegetarian variations.Gefilte \\"Fish,\\" Vegetarian Accessed November 10, 2010 Fish fillets are ground with eggs and sometimes onion, bread or matza crumbs, and spices or salt, carrot and potato to produce a paste or dough which is then boiled in fish stock. [] Traditionally gefilte fish is cooked in large logs and then sliced for serving but sometimes it is cooked and served as egg- shaped patties, like quenelles. In the United Kingdom, gefilte fish is commonly fried. It is usually served cold or at room temperature. Each piece may be topped with a slice of carrot, and very often with a horseradish mixture called chrain on the side. Carrot is not served with spicy gefilte fish made with ground black pepper instead of carrot and potato. Due to the previous general poverty of the Jewish population in Europe and especially Eastern Europe, where the dish originated, an economical recipe also may have included finely ground and soaked matza meal or bread crumbs. This form of preparation eliminated the need for picking out fish bones at the table, and \\"stretched\\" the (expensive) fish further, so that even poor, large families could enjoy fish on Shabbat. Not only is picking bones religiously prohibited on the Sabbath, but many of the common fish used in the dish, such as carp, are exceptionally bony and difficult to eat in whole form. The fish bones can then be used in making fish stock. In Polish Catholic homes, gefilte fish () is a traditional dish to be eaten on Christmas Eve and Holy Saturday, as these are traditionally meatless feasts.Johnowitz, Eva. Chapter 4, \\"Flavors of Memory\\", in Culinary Tourism, Lucy M. Long (ed.) University Press of Kentucky, 2013. This follows a pattern in which a number of Jewish dishes were also eaten on Catholic religious days in Poland.  Variations  Gefilte fish may be slightly sweet or savory. Preparation of gefilte fish with sugar or black pepper is considered an indicator of whether a Jewish community was Galitzianer (with sugar) or Litvak (with pepper); the boundary separating northern from southern East Yiddish has thus been dubbed \\"the Gefilte Fish Line\\".Bill Gladstone: This is no fish tale: Gefilte tastes tell story of ancestry.

The blowpipe is being held in the glassblower's left hand. The glass is glowing yellow. Glassblowing is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or parison) with the aid of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or gaffer. A lampworker (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass. Technology =Principles= As a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the 1st century BC, glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers; inflation, which is the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network,Frank, S 1982. Glass and Archaeology. Academic Press: London. Freestone, I. (1991). \\"Looking into Glass\\". In S. Bowman (ed.) Science and the Past. pp.37‚Äì56. University of Toronto Press: Toronto & Buffalo. Pollard, A.M. and C. Heron 2008. Archaeological Chemistry. The Royal Society of Chemistry therefore molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat.Cummings, K. 2002. A History of Glassforming. University of Pennsylvania Press To increase the stiffness of the molten glass, which in turn facilitates the process of blowing, there was a subtle change in the composition of glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from Sepphoris of Israel, Fischer and McCray postulated that the concentration of natron, which acts as flux in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing. During blowing, thinner layers of glass cool faster than thicker ones and become more viscous than the thicker layers. That allows production of blown glass with uniform thickness instead of causing blow-through of the thinned layers. A full range of glassblowing techniques was developed within decades of its invention. The two major methods of glassblowing are free-blowing and mold-blowing. Free- blowing Glassworking in a hot shop in New York City This method held a pre-eminent position in glassforming ever since its introduction in the middle of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a \\"gather\\" which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape. (apparently out of print) Researchers at the Toledo Museum of Art attempted to reconstruct the ancient free-blowing technique by using clay blowpipes. The result proved that short clay blowpipes of about facilitate free-blowing because they are simple to handle and to manipulate and can be re-used several times. Skilled workers are capable of shaping almost any vessel forms by rotating the pipe, swinging it and controlling the temperature of the piece while they blow. They can produce a great variety of glass objects, ranging from drinking cups to window glass. An outstanding example of the free-blowing technique is the Portland Vase, which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment was carried out by Gudenrath and Whitehouse with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered on the end of the blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body. Mold-blowing Glassblower Jean-Pierre Canlis sculpting a section of his piece \\"Insignificance\\" Mold- blowing was an alternative glassblowing method that came after the invention of free-blowing, during the first part of the second quarter of the 1st century AD.Price, J. (1991). \\"Decorated Mould-Blown Glass Tablewares in the First century AD\\". In M. Newby & K. Painter (eds.) Roman Glass: Two Centuries of Art and Invention. pp. 56‚Äì75. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London A glob of molten glass is placed on the end of the blowpipe, and is then inflated into a wooden or metal carved mold. In that way, the shape and the texture of the bubble of glass is determined by the design on the interior of the mold rather than the skill of the glassworker. Two types of mold, namely single-piece molds and multi-piece molds, are frequently used to produce mold- blown vessels. The former allows the finished glass object to be removed in one movement by pulling it upwards from the single-piece mold and is largely employed to produce tableware and utilitarian vessels for storage and transportation.Tatton-Brown, V. (1991). \\"The Roman Empire\\". In H. Tait (ed.) Five Thousand Years of Glass. pp. 62‚Äì97. British Museum Press: London Whereas the latter is made in multi-paneled mold segments that join together, thus permitting the development of more sophisticated surface modeling, texture and design. The Roman leaf beaker which is now on display in the J. Paul Getty Museum was blown in a three-part mold decorated with the foliage relief frieze of four vertical plants. Meanwhile, Taylor and HillTaylor, M. & D. Hill 1998. Making Roman Glass Today. In The Colchester Archaeologist 11 tried to reproduce mold-blown vessels by using three-part molds made of different materials. The result suggested that metal molds, in particular bronze, are more effective in producing high-relief design on glass than plaster or wooden molds. The development of the mold-blowing technique has enabled the speedy production of glass objects in large quantity, thus encouraging the mass production and widespread distribution of glass objects.Cuneaz, G.

Skira Editore: Milan =Modern glassblowing= Use of a glory hole to reheat a piece on the end of a blowpipe How a wine glass is made, Kosta Glasbruk, video cane which involves the use of rods of colored glass The transformation of raw materials into glass takes place at around ; the glass emits enough heat to appear almost white hot. The glass is then left to \\"fine out\\" (allowing the bubbles to rise out of the mass), and then the working temperature is reduced in the furnace to around . At this stage, the glass appears to be a bright orange color. Though most glassblowing is done between , \\"soda-lime\\" glass remains somewhat plastic and workable at as low as . Annealing is usually done between . Glassblowing involves three furnaces. The first, which contains a crucible of molten glass, is simply referred to as \\"the furnace\\". The second is called the \\"glory hole\\", and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the \\"lehr\\" or \\"annealer\\", and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, depending on the size of the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to thermal stress. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes. The major tools used by a glassblower are the blowpipe (or blow tube), punty (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and a variety of shears. The tip of the blowpipe is first preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The molten glass is \\"gathered\\" onto the end of the blowpipe in much the same way that viscous honey is picked up on a honey dipper. This glass is then rolled on the marver, which was traditionally a flat slab of marble, but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of steel. This process, called \\"marvering\\",Marvering. glassonline.com forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a stainless steel or iron rod called a \\"punty\\" for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and to finalize the top. The bench is a glassblower's workstation, and has a place for the glassblower to sit, a place for the handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. Blocks are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked fruitwood, and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation. In similar fashion, pads of water-soaked newspaper (roughly square, thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece. Jacks are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later in the creation of a piece. Paddles are flat pieces of wood or graphite used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used for making linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass. There are many ways to apply patterns and color to blown glass, including rolling molten glass in powdered color or larger pieces of colored glass called \\"frit\\". Complex patterns with great detail can be created through the use of cane (rods of colored glass) and murrine (rods cut in cross- sections to reveal patterns). These pieces of color can be arranged in a pattern on a flat surface, and then \\"picked up\\" by rolling a bubble of molten glass over them. One of the most exacting and complicated caneworking techniques is \\"reticello\\", which involves creating two bubbles from cane, each twisted in a different direction and then combining them and blowing out the final form. Lampworkers, usually operating on a much smaller scale, historically used alcohol lamps and breath- or bellows-driven air to create a hot flame at a workbench to manipulate preformed glass rods and tubes. These stock materials took form as laboratory glassware, beads, and durable scientific \\"specimens\\"‚Äîminiature glass sculpture. The craft, which was raised to an art form in the late 1960s by Hans Godo Frabel (later followed by lampwork artists such as Milon Townsend and Robert Mickelson), is still practiced today. The modern lampworker uses a flame of oxygen and propane or natural gas. The modern torch permits working both the soft glass from the furnace worker and the borosilicate glass (low-expansion) of the scientific glassblower. This latter worker may also have multiple headed torches and special lathes to help form the glass or fused quartz used for special projects. History =Origins= The earliest evidence of glassblowing comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, dated from 37 to 4 BC.Avigad, N (1983). Discovering Jerusalem. Nashville. Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe. Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass.Israeli, Y. (1991). \\"The Invention of Blowing\\". In M. Newby & K. Painter (eds.) Roman Glass: Two Centuries of Art and Invention. pp. 46‚Äì55. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London Such inventions swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as casting and core-forming, in working glass. =Roman Empire= Roman blown glass hydria from Baelo Claudia (4th century AD) A glassworks in England in 1858. During the Industrial Revolution, techniques for mass-produced glassware were improved. Glassblowing production methods in England in 1858 The invention of glassblowing coincided with the establishment of the Roman Empire in the 1st century BC, which enhanced the spread and dominance of this new technology.Vose, R.H. (1989). Glass. Collins Archaeology: London. Glassblowing was greatly supported by the Roman government (although Roman citizens could not be \\"in trade\\", in particular under the reign of Augustus), and glass was being blown in many areas of the Roman world.Isings, C. 1957. Roman Glass: from dated finds. Archaeologica Traiectina. J.B. Wolters: Groningen. On the eastern borders of the Empire, the first large glass workshops were set up by the Phoenicians in the birthplace of glassblowing in contemporary Lebanon and Israel as well as in the neighbouring province of Cyprus. Ennion for example, was among the most prominent glassworkers from Lebanon of the time. He was renowned for producing the multi-paneled mold- blown glass vessels that were complex in their shapes, arrangement and decorative motifs. The complexity of designs of these mold-blown glass vessels illustrated the sophistication of the glassworkers in the eastern regions of the Roman Empire. Mold-blown glass vessels manufactured by the workshops of Ennion and other contemporary glassworkers such as Jason, Nikon, Aristeas, and Meges, constitutes some of the earliest evidence of glassblowing found in the eastern territories.H≈ëricht, L.A.S. (1991). \\"Syrian Elements among the Glass from Pompeii\\". In M. Newby & K. Painter (eds.) Roman Glass: two centuries of art and invention. pp. 76‚Äì85. The Society of Antiquaries of London: London Eventually, the glassblowing technique reached Egypt and was described in a fragmentary poem printed on papyrus which was dated to the 3rd century AD.Coles, R.A. 1983. The Oxyrhynchus Papyri 50. Egypt Exploration Society for the British Academy: London. The Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean areas resulted in the substitution of glassblowing for earlier Hellenistic casting, core-forming and mosaic fusion techniques. The earliest evidence of blowing in Hellenistic work consists of small blown bottles for perfume and oil retrieved from the glass workshops on the Greek island of Samothrace and at Corinth in mainland Greece which were dated to the 1st century AD. Later, the Phoenician glassworkers exploited their glassblowing techniques and set up their workshops in the western territories of the Roman Empire, first in Italy by the middle of the 1st century AD. Rome, the heartland of the empire, soon became a major glassblowing center, and more glassblowing workshops were subsequently established in other provinces of Italy, for example Campania, Morgantina and Aquileia. A great variety of blown glass objects, ranging from unguentaria (toiletry containers for perfume) to cameo, from tableware to window glass, were produced. From there, escaping craftsmen (who had been forbidden to travel) otherwise advanced to the rest of Europe by building their glassblowing workshops in the north of the Alps (which is now Switzerland), and then at sites in northern Europe in present-day France and Belgium.Allen, D. (1998). \\"Roman Glass in Britain\\". Shire Archaeology No. 76. CTT Printing Series Ltd.: Pembrokeshire.Price, J. (2000). \\"Roman Glass Production in Western Europe\\". In M-D Nenna (ed.) La Route Du Verre: ateliers primaries et secondaires du second millenaire av. J-C au Moyen Age. pp. 123‚Äì124. Maison de l‚ÄôOrient Mediterranean: Paris One of the most prolific glassblowing centers of the Roman period was established in Cologne on the river Rhine in Germany by late 1st century BC. Stone base molds and terracotta base molds were discovered from these Rhineland workshops, suggesting the adoption and the application of mold-blowing technique by the glassworkers. Besides, blown flagons and blown jars decorated with ribbing, as well as blown perfume bottles with letters CCAA or CCA which stand for Colonia Claudia Agrippiniensis, were produced from the Rhineland workshops. Remains of blown blue-green glass vessels, for example bottles with handles, collared bowls and indented beakers, were found in abundance from the local glass workshops at Poetovio and Celeia in Slovenia.Lazar, I. 2006. Glass finds in Slovenia and neighbouring areas. In Journal of Roman Archaeology 19: 299‚Äì342. Surviving physical evidence, such as blowpipes and molds which are indicative of the presence of blowing, is fragmentary and limited. Pieces of clay blowpipes were retrieved from the late 1st century AD glass workshop at Avenches in Switzerland. Clay blowpipes, also known as mouthblowers, were made by the ancient glassworkers due to the accessibility and availability of the resources before the introduction of the metal blowpipes. Hollow iron rods, together with blown vessel fragments and glass waste dating to approximately 4th century AD, were recovered from the glass workshop in M√©rida of Spain, as well as in Salona in Croatia. =Middle Ages= The glass blowing tradition was carried on in Europe from the medieval period through the Middle Ages to the Renaissance in the demise of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. During the early medieval period, the Franks manipulated the technique of glassblowing by creating the simple corrugated molds and developing the claws decoration techniques.Tatton-Brown, V.

The Byzantine glassworkers made mold-blown glass decorated with Christian and Jewish symbols in Jerusalem between late 6th century and the middle of the 7th century AD. Mold-blown vessels with facets, relief and linear-cut decoration were discovered at Samarra in the Islamic lands. Renaissance Europe witnessed the revitalization of glass industry in Italy. Glassblowing, in particular the mold-blowing technique, was employed by the Venetian glassworkers from Murano to produce the fine glassware which is also known as \\"cristallo\\".Tait, H. (1994). \\"Europe from the Middle Ages to Industrial Revolution\\". In H. Tait (ed.) Five Thousand Years of Glass. pp. 145‚Äì187. British Museum Press: London Wood, P.

(Publishers) Ltd.: The technique of glassblowing, coupled with the cylinder and crown methods, was used to manufacture sheet or flat glass for window panes in the late 17th century. The applicability of glassblowing was so widespread that glass was being blown in many parts of the world, for example, in China, Japan and the Islamic Lands. The N√∏stetangen Museum at Hokksund, Norway, shows how glass was made according to ancient tradition. The N√∏stetangenglassworks had operated there from 1741 to 1777, producing table-glass and chandeliers in the German and English styles.N√∏stetangen Glassworks (N√∏stetangen). nostetangenmuseum.noGamle Sorenskrivergaarden (N√∏stetangen) . nostetangenmuseum.no =Industrial Revolution= =Recent developments= The \\"studio glass movement\\" began in 1962 when Harvey Littleton, a ceramics professor, and Dominick Labino, a chemist and engineer, held two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they started experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art. Littleton promoted the use of small furnaces in individual artists studios.() This approach to glassblowing blossomed into a worldwide movement, producing such flamboyant and prolific artists as Dale Chihuly, Dante Marioni, Fritz Driesbach and Marvin Lipofsky as well as chronicglass and scores of other modern glass artists. Today there are many different institutions around the world that offer glassmaking resources for training and sharing equipment. Working with large or complex pieces requires a team of several glassworkers, in a complex choreography of precisely timed movements. This practical requirement has encouraged collaboration among glass artists, in both semi-permanent and temporary working groups. =In literature= The writer Daphne du Maurier was descended from a family of glass-blowers in 18th century France, and she wrote about her forebears in the 1963 historical novel The Glass-Blowers.

The Town of Scarsdale is coextensive with the Village of Scarsdale, but the community has opted to operate solely with a village government, one of several villages in the state that have a similar governmental situation. As of the 2010 census, Scarsdale's population was 17,166. History =Colonial era= Caleb Heathcote purchased land that would become Scarsdale at the end of the 17th century and, on March 21, 1701, had it elevated to a royal manor. He named the lands after his ancestral home in Derbyshire, England. The first local census of 1712 counted twelve inhabitants, including seven African slaves. When Caleb died in 1721, his daughters inherited the property. The estate was broken up in 1774, and the town was officially founded on March 7, 1788. The town saw fighting during the American Revolution when the Continental and British armies clashed briefly at what is now the junction of Garden Road and Mamaroneck Road. The British commander, Sir William Howe, lodged at a farmhouse on Garden Road that remains standing. Scarsdale's wartime history formed the basis for James Fenimore Cooper's novel, The Spy: A Tale of the Neutral Ground, written while the author lived at the Angevine Farm in the present-day Heathcote section of town. =1790‚Äì1945= According to the first federal census in 1790, the town's population was 281. By 1840, that number had declined to 255‚Äîthe vast majority farmers and farm workers. In 1846, the New York and Harlem Railroad connected Scarsdale to New York City, leading to an influx of commuters. Scarsdale Woman's Club - Historic Oak Tree (September 2012) The Arthur Suburban Home Company purchased a farm in 1891 and converted it into a subdevelopment of one-family dwellings, starting a transformation of the community from rural to suburban. Civil institutions soon appeared: the Heathcote Association (1904), the Town Club (1904), the Scarsdale Woman's Club (1918) and the Scarsdale League of Women Voters (1921). Scarsdale High School and Greenacres Elementary School were built in 1912, and the Edgewood Elementary School opened in 1918. The first store in Scarsdale opened on the corner of Popham Road and Garth Road in 1912. By 1915, the population approached 3000. By 1930, that number approached 10,000.

A necktie, or simply a tie, is a long piece of cloth, worn, usually by men, for decorative purposes around the neck, resting under the shirt collar and knotted at the throat. Variants include the ascot, bow, bolo, zipper, cravat, and knit. The modern necktie, ascot, and bow tie are descended from the cravat. Neckties are generally unsized, but may be available in a longer size. In some cultures men and boys wear neckties as part of regular office attire or formal wear. Some women wear them as well but usually not as often as men. Neckties can also be worn as part of a uniform (e.g. military, school, waitstaff), whereas some choose to wear them as everyday clothing attire. Neckties are traditionally worn with the top shirt button fastened, and the tie knot resting between the collar points.  History  = Origins = The necktie that spread from Europe traces back to Croatian mercenaries serving in France during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). These mercenaries from the Croatian Military Frontier, wearing their traditional small, knotted neckerchiefs, aroused the interest of the Parisians. Because of the difference between the Croatian word for Croats, , and the French word, , the garment gained the name cravat ( in French). The boy-king Louis XIV began wearing a lace cravat around 1646, when he was seven, and set the fashion for French nobility. This new article of clothing started a fashion craze in Europe; both men and women wore pieces of fabric around their necks. From its introduction by the French king, men wore lace cravats, or jabots, that took a large amount of time and effort to arrange. These cravats were often tied in place by cravat strings, arranged neatly and tied in a bow. International Necktie Day is celebrated on October 18 in Croatia and in various cities around the world, including in Dublin, T√ºbingen, Como, Tokyo, Sydney and other towns.18TH OCTOBER ‚Äì THE CRAVAT DAY! .

In this battle, the princes, while hurriedly dressing for battle, wound these cravats around their necks. They twisted the ends of the fabric together and passed the twisted ends through a jacket buttonhole. These cravats were generally referred to as Steinkirks. = 1710‚Äì1800: stocks, solitaires, neckcloths, cravats = In 1715, another kind of neckwear, called \\"stocks\\" made its appearance. The term originally referred to a leather collar, laced at the back, worn by soldiers to promote holding the head high in a military bearing. The leather stock also afforded some protection to the major blood vessels of the neck from saber or bayonet attacks. General Sherman is seen wearing a leather stock in several American Civil War-era photographs. Stock ties were initially just a small piece of muslin folded into a narrow band wound a few times round the shirt collar and secured from behind with a pin. It was fashionable for men to wear their hair long, past shoulder length. The ends were tucked into a black silk bag worn at the nape of the neck. This was known as the bag-wig hairstyle, and the neckwear worn with it was the stock. The solitaire was a variation of the bag wig. This form had matching ribbons stitched around the bag. After the stock was in place, the ribbons would be brought forward and tied in a large bow in front of the wearer. Sometime in the late 18th century, cravats began to make an appearance again. This can be attributed to a group of young men called the macaronis (as mentioned in the song \\"Yankee Doodle\\"). These were young Englishmen who returned from Europe and brought with them new ideas about fashion from Italy. The French contemporaries of the macaronis were the incroyables. = 1800‚Äì1850: cravat, stocks, scarves, bandanas = Pleated silk satin stock, Boston, c. 1830. Los Angeles County Museum of Art, AC1998.78.1. At this time, there was also much interest in the way to tie a proper cravat and this led to a series of publications. This began in 1818 with the publication of Neckclothitania, a style manual that contained illustrated instructions on how to tie 14 different cravats. Soon after, the immense skill required to tie the cravat in certain styles quickly became a mark of a man's elegance and wealth. It was also the first book to use the word tie in association with neckwear. It was about this time that black stocks made their appearance. Their popularity eclipsed the white cravat, except for formal and evening wear. These remained popular through to the 1850s. At this time, another form of neckwear worn was the scarf. This was where a neckerchief or bandana was held in place by slipping the ends through a finger or scarf ring at the neck instead of using a knot. This is the classic sailor neckwear and may have been adopted from them. = 1860‚Äì1920s: bow ties, scarf/neckerchief, the ascot, the long tie = Mathew Brady wearing a tie in 1875 With the industrial revolution, more people wanted neckwear that was easy to put on, was comfortable, and would last an entire workday. Neckties were designed to be long, thin and easy to knot, without accidentally coming undone. This is the necktie design still worn by millions of men. By this time, the sometimes complicated array of knots and styles of neckwear gave way to neckties and bow ties, the latter a much smaller, more convenient version of the cravat. Another type of neckwear, the ascot tie, was considered de rigueur for male guests at formal dinners and male spectators at races. These ascots had wide flaps that were crossed and pinned together on the chest. In 1926, a New York tie maker, Jesse Langsdorf, came up with a method of cutting the fabric on the bias and sewing it in three segments.J.E. Langsdorf, 1923, Necktie, This technique improved elasticity and facilitated the fabric's return to its original shape. Since that time, most men have worn the \\"Langsdorf\\" tie. Yet another development during that time was the method used to secure the lining and interlining (known as the swan) once the tie had been folded into shape. Richard Atkinson and Company of Belfast claim to have introduced the slipstitch for this purpose in the late 1920s. = 1920s‚Äìpresent day = A collection of different colors of ties. Two patterned neckties. After the First World War, hand-painted ties became an accepted form of decoration in the U.S. The widths of some of these ties went up to . These loud, flamboyant ties sold very well all the way through the 1950s. In Britain, regimental stripes have been continuously used in tie designs at least since the 1920s. In Commonwealth countries, necktie stripes run from the left shoulder down to the right side. In Commonwealth countries, only people affiliated with a regiment (or university, school or organisation) should wear a necktie affiliated with that regiment. When Brooks Brothers introduced similar striped ties in the United States around the beginning of the 20th century, they had their stripes run from the right shoulder to the left side, in part to distinguish them from British regimental striped neckties. Before the Second World War ties were worn shorter than they are today; this was due, in part, to men wearing trousers at the natural waist (more or less at the level of the belly button), and also due to the popularity of waistcoats, where tie length is not important as long as the tips are concealed. Around 1944, ties started to become not only wider, but even more wild. This was the beginning of what was later labeled the Bold Look: ties that reflected the returning GIs' desire to break with wartime uniformity. Widths reached , and designs included Art Deco, hunting scenes, scenic \\"photographs\\", tropical themes, and even girlie prints, though more traditional designs were also available. The typical length was . The Bold Look lasted until about 1951, when the \\"Mister T\\" look (so termed by Esquire magazine) was introduced. The new style, characterized by tapered suits, slimmer lapels, and smaller hat brims, included thinner and not so wild ties. Tie widths slimmed to by 1953 and continued getting thinner up until the mid-1960s; length increased to about as men started wearing their trousers lower, closer to the hips. Through the 1950s, neckties remained somewhat colorful, yet more restrained than in the previous decade. Small geometric shapes were often employed against a solid background (i.e., foulards); diagonal stripes were also popular. By the early 1960s, dark, solid ties became very common, with widths slimming down to as little as . The 1960s brought about an influx of pop art influenced designs. The first was designed by Michael Fish when he worked at Turnbull & Asser, and was introduced in Britain in 1965; the term Kipper tie was a pun on his name, as well as a reference to the triangular shape of the front of the tie. The exuberance of the styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s gradually gave way to more restrained designs. Ties became wider, returning to their width, sometimes with garish colors and designs. The traditional designs of the 1930s and 1950s, such as those produced by Tootal, reappeared, particularly Paisley patterns. Ties began to be sold along with shirts, and designers slowly began to experiment with bolder colors. In the 1980s, narrower ties, some as narrow as but more typically wide, became popular again. Into the 1990s, as ties got wider again, increasingly unusual designs became common. Novelty (or joke) ties or deliberately kitschy ties designed to make a statement gained a certain popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. These included ties featuring cartoon characters, commercial products, or pop culture icons, and those made of unusual materials, such as plastic or wood. During this period, with men wearing their trousers at their hips, ties lengthened to . At the start of the 21st century, ties widened to wide, with a broad range of patterns available, from traditional stripes, foulards, and club ties (ties with a crest or design signifying a club, organization, or order) to abstract, themed, and humorous ones. The standard length remains , though other lengths vary from 117 cm to 152 cm. While ties as wide as inches are still available, ties under wide also became popular, particularly with younger men and the fashion-conscious. In 2008 and 2009 the world of fashion saw a return to narrower ties.  Types  A page from Neckclothitania showing different cravat knots. Different knots for neckties, from a 1980s store handout = Cravat = In 1660, in celebration of its hard-fought victory over the Ottoman Empire, a crack regiment from Croatia visited Paris. There, the soldiers were presented as glorious heroes to Louis XIV, a monarch well known for his eye toward personal adornment. It so happened that the officers of this regiment were wearing brightly colored handkerchiefs fashioned of silk around their necks. These neck cloths struck the fancy of the king, and he soon made them an insignia of royalty as he created a regiment of Royal Cravattes. The word \\"cravat\\" is derived from the √† la croate‚Äîin the style of the Croats. = Four-in-hand = The four-in-hand necktie (as distinct from the four-in-hand knot) was fashionable in Great Britain in the 1850s. Early neckties were simple, rectangular cloth strips cut on the square, with square ends. The term \\"four- in-hand\\" originally described a carriage with four horses and a driver; later, it also was the name of a London gentlemen's club, The Four-in-Hand Driving Company founded in 1856. Some etymologic reports are that carriage drivers knotted their reins with a four-in-hand knot (see below), whilst others claim the carriage drivers wore their scarves knotted 'four-in-hand', but, most likely, members of the club began wearing their neckties so knotted, thus making it fashionable. In the latter half of the 19th century, the four-in- hand knot and the four-in-hand necktie were synonymous. As fashion changed from stiff shirt collars to soft, turned-down collars, the four-in-hand necktie knot gained popularity; its sartorial dominance rendered the term \\"four-in-hand\\" redundant usage, shortened \\"long tie\\" and \\"tie\\". In 1926, Jesse Langsdorf from New York City introduced ties cut on the bias (US) or cross- grain (UK), allowing the tie to evenly fall from the knot without twisting; this also caused any woven pattern such as stripes to appear diagonally across the tie. Today, four-in-hand ties are part of men's dress clothing in both Western and non-Western societies, particularly for business. Four-in-hand ties are generally made from silk or polyester and occasionally with cotton. Another material used is wool, usually knitted, common before World War II but not as popular nowadays. More recently, microfiber ties have also appeared; in the 1950s and 1960s, other manmade fabrics, such as Dacron and rayon, were also used, but have fallen into disfavour. Modern ties appear in a wide variety of colours and patterns, notably striped (usually diagonally); club ties (with a small motif repeated regularly all over the tie); foulards (with small geometric shapes on a solid background); paisleys; and solids. Novelty ties featuring icons from popular culture (such as cartoons, actors, or holiday images), sometimes with flashing lights, have enjoyed some popularity since the 1980s. = Six- and seven-fold ties = A seven-fold tie is an unlined construction variant of the four-in-hand necktie which pre-existed the use of interlining. Its creation at the end of the 19th century is attributed to the Parisian shirtmaker Washington Tremlett for an American customer. A seven-fold tie is constructed completely out of silk. A six-fold tie is a modern alteration of the seven-fold tie. This construction method is more symmetrical than the true seven-fold. It has an interlining which gives it a little more weight and is self tipped. = Skinny tie = A skinny tie is a necktie that is narrower than the standard tie and often all-black. Skinny ties have widths of around at their widest, compared to usually for regular ties. Skinny ties were first popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by British bands such as the Beatles and the Kinks, alongside the subculture that embraced such bands, the mods. This is because clothes of the time evolved to become more form-fitting and tailored. They were later repopularized in the late 1970s and early 1980s by new wave and power pop bands such as the Knack, Blondie and Duran Duran. = \\"Pre-tied\\" ties and development of clip-ons = Early illustration of a pre-tied clip-on tie. The \\"pre-tied\\", or more commonly, the clip-on, necktie is a permanently knotted four-in-hand or bow tie affixed by a clip or hook, most often metal and sometimes hinged, to the shirt front without the aid of a band around a shirt collar; these ties are close relatives of banded pre-tied ties that make use of a collar band and a hook and eye to secure them. The clip-on tie sees use with children, and in occupations where a traditional necktie might pose a safety hazard, e.g., law enforcement, mechanical equipment operators etc.Agricultural Safety: Preventing Injuries B 1255. The University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (see below). The perceived utility of this development in the history of style is evidenced by the series of patents issued for various forms of these ties, beginning in the late 19th century,Waehner, Johann (1875) \\"Improvement in neck-tie fasteners\\" (hook-type of clip-on)Jacobowitz, Mayer (1896) \\"Necktie\\" (band-toe attachment) and by the businesses filing these applications and fulfilling a market need for them. For instance, a patent filed by Joseph W. Less of the One-In-Hand Tie Company of Clinton, Iowa for \\"Pre-tied neckties and methods for making the same\\" noted that: a solid black clip-on tie. The Inventor proceeded to claim for the invention‚Äîthe latest version of a 1930s‚Äì1950s product line from former concert violinist Joseph Less, Iowan brothers Walter and Louis, and son-in-law W. Emmett Thiessen evolved to be identifiable as the modern clip-onThe beginning of the effort apparently was a version that used a pre-knotted design and slipped the tie's narrow end through \\"slot\\" in back of the knot. ‚Äî\\"a novel method for making up the tie ... [eliminating] the neckband of the tie, which is useless and uncomfortable in warm weather ... [and providing] means of attachment which is effective and provides no discomfort to the wearer\\", and in doing so achieves \\"accurate simulation of the Windsor knot, and extremely low material and labor costs\\". Notably, the company made use of ordinary ties purchased from the New York garment industry, and was a significant employers of women in the pre-war and World War II years. While the appeal of the pre- tied ties from the perspective of fashion has flowed and ebbed, varieties of clip-on long ties and banded bow ties are still the most common form of child- sized ties in the opening decade of the 21st century.  Types of knot  A demonstration of tying a tie A half Windsor knot with a dimple An Atlantic knot, which is notable for being tied backwards There are four main knots used to knot neckties. In rising order of difficulty, they are: * the four-in-hand knot. The four-in-hand knot may be the most common. * the Pratt knot (the Shelby knot) * the half-Windsor knot * the Windsor knot (also redundantly called the \\"full Windsor\\"). The Windsor knot is the thickest knot of the four, since its tying has the most steps. The Windsor knot is named after the Duke of Windsor, although he did not invent it. The Duke did favour a voluminous knot; however, he achieved this by having neckties specially made of thicker cloths. In the late 1990s, two researchers, Thomas Fink and Yong Mao of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, used mathematical modeling to discover that 85 knots are possible with a conventional tie (limiting the number \\"moves\\" used to tie the knot to nine; longer sequences of moves result in too large a knot or leave the hanging ends of the tie too short). The models were published in academic journals, while the results and the 85 knots were published in layman's terms in a book entitled The 85 Ways to Tie a Tie. Of the 85 knots, Fink and Mao selected 13 knots as \\"aesthetic\\" knots, using the qualities of symmetry and balance. Based on these mathematical principles, the researchers came up with not only the four necktie knots in common use, but nine more, some of which had seen limited use, and some that are believed to have been codified for the first time. Other types of knots include: * the small knot (also \\"oriental knot\\", \\"Kent knot\\"): the smallest possible necktie knot. It forms an equilateral triangle, like the half-Windsor, but much more compact (Fink‚ÄìMao notation: Lo Ri Co T, Knot 1). It is also the smallest knot to begin inside-out. * the Nicky knot: an alternative version of the Pratt knot, but better-balanced and self-releasing (Lo Ci Ro Li Co T, Knot 4). Supposedly named for Nikita Khrushchev, it tends to be equally referred to as the Pratt knot in men's style literature. This is the version of the Pratt knot favored by Fink and Mao. * the Atlantic knot: a reversed Pratt knot, highlighting the structure of the knot normally hidden on the back. In order for the wide blade to remain in front and rightside-out, the knot must begin rightside-out, and the thin end must be wrapped around the wide end. (Ri Co Ri Lo Ci T; not catalogued by Fink and Mao, but would be numbered 5r according to their classification.) * the Prince Albert knot (also \\"double knot\\", \\"cross Victoria knot\\"): A variant of the four-in-hand with an extra pass of the wide blade around the front, before passing the wide blade through both of the resultant loops (Li Ro Li Ro Li Co T T, Knot 62). A version knotted through only the outermost loop is known as the Victoria knot (Li Ro Li Ro Li Co T, Knot 6). * the Christensen knot (also \\"cross knot\\"): An elongated, symmetrical knot, whose main feature is the cruciform structure made by knotting the necktie through the double loop made in the front (Li Ro Ci Lo Ri Lo Ri Co T T, Knot 252). While it can be made with modern neckties, it is most effective with thinner ties of consistent width, which fell out of common use after the 19th century. * the Ediety knot (also \\"Merovingian knot\\"): a doubled Atlantic knot, best known as the tie knot worn by the character \\"the Merovingian\\" in the 2003 film The Matrix Reloaded. This tie can be knotted with the thin end over the wide end, as with the Atlantic knot, or with the wide end over the thin end to mimic the look seen in the film, with the narrow blade in front. (Ri Co Ri Lo Ci Ri Co Ri Lo Ci T ‚Äì not catalogued by Fink and Mao, as its 10 moves exceed their parameters.)  Ties as a sign of membership  The two variants of the school tie for Phillips Academy The use of coloured and patterned neckties indicating the wearer's membership in a club, military regiment, school, professional association (Royal Colleges, Inns of Courts) et cetera, dates only from late-19th century England. The immediate forerunners of today's college neckties were in 1880 the oarsmen of Exeter College, Oxford, who tied the bands of their straw hats around their necks. In the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth countries, neckties are an essential component of the school uniform and are either worn daily, seasonally or on special occasions with the school blazer. In Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, neckties are worn as the everyday uniform, usually as part of the winter uniform. In countries with no winter such as Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia and many African countries, the necktie is usually worn as part of the formal uniform on special occasions or functions. Neckties may also denote membership of a house or a leadership role (i.e. school prefect, house captain, etc.). The most common pattern for such ties in the UK and most of Europe consists of diagonal stripes of alternating colours running down the tie from the wearer's left. Note that neckties are cut on the bias (diagonally), so the stripes on the source cloth are parallel or perpendicular to the selvage, not diagonal. The colours themselves may be particularly significant. The dark blue and red regimental tie of the Household Division is said to represent the blue blood (i.e. nobility) of the Royal Family, and the red blood of the Guards. In the United States, diagonally striped ties are commonly worn with no connotation of group membership. Typically, American striped ties have the stripes running downward from the wearer's right (the opposite of the European style).Dickinson, Rachel J. (June 18, 2004). \\"Ties have a history of hanging around.\\" The Cincinnati Post. However, when Americans wear striped ties as a sign of membership, the European stripe style may be used. An alternative membership tie pattern to diagonal stripes is either a single emblem or a crest centered and placed where a tie pin normally would be, or a repeated pattern of such motifs. Sometimes, both types are used by an organization, either simply to offer a choice or to indicate a distinction among levels of membership. Occasionally, a hybrid design is used, in which alternating stripes of colour are overlaid with repeated motif pattern.  Use by women  Ethnic Mizo schoolgirls in Mizoram wearing neckties as part of the school uniform Biologist Gertrude Van Wagenen wearing a suit and tie. Neckties are sometimes part of uniforms worn by women, which nowadays might be required in professions such as restaurants and police forces. In many countries, girls are nowadays required to wear ties as part of primary and secondary school uniforms. Ties may also be used by women as a fashion statement. During the late 1970s and 1980s, it was not uncommon for young women in the United States to wear ties as part of a casual outfit. This trend was popularized by Diane Keaton who wore a tie as the titular character in Annie Hall in 1977.\\"Calender.\\" Seventeen Nov. 2002: 24. In 1993, neckties reappeared as prominent fashion accessories for women in both Europe and the U.S. Canadian recording artist Avril Lavigne wore neckties with tank tops early in her career.  Occasions for neckties  Traditionally, ties are a staple of office attire, especially for professionals. Proponents of the tie's place in the office assert that ties neatly demarcate work and leisure time. The theory is that the physical presence of something around your neck serves as a reminder to knuckle down and focus on the job at hand. Conversely, loosening of the tie after work signals that one can relax. Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, believes ties are a symbol of oppression and slavery. Outside of these environments, ties are usually worn especially when attending traditionally formal or professional events, including weddings, important religious ceremonies, funerals, job interviews, court appearances, and fine dining.  Opposition to neckties  The debate between proponents and opponents of the necktie center on social conformity, plainness, professional expectation, and personal, sartorial expression. Quoting architect Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright said: \\"Form follows function\\". Applied sartorially, the necktie's decorative function is so criticized. = Christian denominations teaching plain dress = Among many Christian denominations teaching the doctrine of plain dress, long neckties are not worn by men; this includes many Anabaptist communities (such as the Conservative Mennonite Conference), traditional Quakers (who view neckties as contravening their testimony of simplicity), and some Holiness Methodists (such as the Reformed Free Methodists who view neckties as conflicting with the belief in outward holiness). Other Holiness Methodist denominations, such as the Evangelical Wesleyan Church, allow a long necktie that is black in colour. While Reformed Mennonites, among some other Anabaptist communities, reject the long necktie, the wearing of the bow tie is customary. = Anti-necktie sentiment = In the early 20th century, the number of office workers began increasing. Many such men and women were required to wear neckties, because it was perceived as improving work attitudes, morale, and sales. Removing the necktie as a social and sartorial business requirement (and sometimes forbidding it) is a modern trend often attributed to the rise of popular culture. Although it was common as everyday wear as late as 1966, over the years 1967‚Äì69, the necktie fell out of fashion almost everywhere, except where required. There was a resurgence in the 1980s, but in the 1990s, ties again fell out of favor, with many technology-based companies having casual dress requirements, including Apple, Amazon, eBay, Genentech, Microsoft, Monsanto, and Google. In western business culture, a phenomenon known as Casual Friday has arisen, in which employees are not required to wear ties on Fridays, and then‚Äîincreasingly‚Äîon other, announced, special days. Some businesses have extended casual-dress days to Thursday, and even Wednesday; others require neckties only on Monday (to start the work week). At the furniture company IKEA, neckties are not allowed. An example of anti-necktie sentiment is found in Iran, whose theocratic rulers have denounced the accessory as a decadent symbol of European oppression. In the late 1970s (at the time of the Islamic Revolution), members of the US press even metonymized Iran's hardliners as turbans and its moderates as neckties. To date, most Iranian men in Iran have retained the Western-style long-sleeved collared shirt and three-piece suit, while excluding the necktie. The majority of Iranian men abroad wear neckties.Ignatius, David (July 10, 2008). Tehran's Definite 'Maybe'. The Washington Post. Neckties are viewed by various sub- and counter-culture movements as being a symbol of submission and slavery (i.e., having a symbolic chain around one's neck) to the corrupt elite of society, as a \\"wage slave\\".Bragg, Roy (May 24, 2003). \\"Tying one on in the office.\\" San Antonio Express. For 60 years, designers and manufacturers of neckties in the United States were members of the Men's Dress Furnishings Association but the trade group shut down in 2008 as a result of declining membership due to the declining numbers of men wearing neckties. In 2019, presidential candidate Andrew Yang drew attention when he appeared on televised presidential debates without a tie. Yang dismissed media questions about it, saying that voters should be focused on more important issues.  Health and safety hazards  A symbol for not wearing a tie. Necktie wearing presents some risks for entanglement, infection, and vasoconstriction. A 2018 study published in the medical journal Neuroradiology found that a Windsor knot tightened to the point of \\"slight discomfort\\" could interrupt as much as 7.5 percent of cerebral blood flow. A 2013 study published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology found increased intraocular pressure in such cases, which can aggravate the condition of people with weakened retinas. There may be additional risks for people with glaucoma. Entanglement is a risk when working with machinery or in dangerous, possibly violent, jobs such as police officers and prison guards, and certain medical fields. A trainee machinist and his supervisor wear neckties while at work in a machine shop in 1917. In a modern setting, \\"professional\\" dress would likely be superseded by more practical clothing due to the risk of a dangling necktie becoming entangled in moving machinery. Paramedics performing life support remove an injured man's necktie as a first step to ensure it does not block his airway. Neckties might also be a health risk for persons other than the wearer. They are believed to be vectors in disease transmission in hospitals. Notwithstanding such fears, many doctors and dentists wear neckties for a professional image. Hospitals take seriously the cross-infection of patients by doctors wearing infected neckties, because neckties are less frequently cleaned than most other clothes. On September 17, 2007, British hospitals published rules banning neckties. In such a context, some instead prefer to use bow ties due to their short length and relative lack of hindrance.

It involves ideas that may not be obtainable using only traditional step-by-step logic. Considered pseudo-science by some, the term was first used in 1967 by Edward de Bono in his book The Use of Lateral Thinking. De Bono cites the Judgment of Solomon as an example of lateral thinking, where King Solomon resolves a dispute over the parentage of a child by calling for the child to be cut in half, and making his judgment according to the reactions that this order receives. Edward de Bono also links lateral thinking with humour, arguing there's a switch-over from a familiar pattern to a new, unexpected one. It is this moment of surprise, generating laughter and new insight, which facilitates the ability to see a different thought pattern which initially was not obvious. According to de Bono, lateral thinking deliberately distances itself from the standard perception of creativity as \\"vertical\\" logic, the classic method for problem solving.  Methods  Lateral thinking has to be distinguished from critical thinking. Critical thinking is primarily concerned with judging the true value of statements and seeking errors whereas lateral thinking focuses more on the \\"movement value\\" of statements and ideas. A person uses lateral thinking to move from one known idea to new ideas. Edward de Bono defines four types of thinking tools: #idea-generating tools intended to break current thinking patterns‚Äîroutine patterns, the status quo #focus tools intended to broaden where to search for new ideas #harvest tools intended to ensure more value is received from idea generating output #treatment tools that promote consideration of real-world constraints, resources, and supportLateral Thinking: The Power of Provocation manual: Published in 2006 by de Bono Thinking Systems = Random Entry Idea Generating Tool = The thinker chooses an object at random, or a noun from a dictionary and associates it with the area they are thinking about. De Bono exemplifies this through the randomly-chosen word, \\"nose\\", being applied to an office photocopier, leading to the idea that the copier could produce a lavender smell when it was low on paper. = Provocation Idea Generating Tool = A provocation is a statement that we know is wrong or impossible but used to create new ideas. De Bono gives an example of considering river pollution and setting up the provocation, \\"the factory is downstream of itself\\", causing a factory to be forced to take its water input from a point downstream of its output, an idea which later became law in some countries. Provocations can be set up by the use of any of the provocation techniques‚Äîwishful thinking, exaggeration, reversal, escape, distortion, or arising. The thinker creates a list of provocations and then uses the most outlandish ones to move their thinking forward to new ideas. = Movement Techniques = The purpose of movement techniques is to produce as many alternatives as possible in order to encourage new ways of thinking about both problems and solutions. The production of alternatives tends to produce many possible solutions to problems that seemed to only have one possible solution. One can move from a provocation to a new idea through the following methods: extract a principle, focus on the difference, moment to moment, positive aspects or special circumstances. = Challenge = A tool which is designed to ask the question, \\"Why?\\", in a non-threatening way: why something exists or why it is done the way it is. The result is a very clear understanding of \\"Why?\\", which naturally leads to new ideas. The goal is to be able to challenge anything at all, not those that are problematic. For example, one could challenge the handles on coffee cups: The reason for the handle seems to be that the cup is often too hot to hold directly; perhaps coffee cups could be made with insulated finger grips, or there could be separate coffee-cup holders similar to beer holders, or coffee shouldn't be so hot in the first place. = Concept Formation = Ideas carry out concepts. This tool systematically expands the range and number of concepts in order to end up with a very broad range of ideas to consider. = Disproving = Based on the idea that the majority is always wrong (as suggested by Henrik Ibsen In An Enemy of the People, 1882. and by John Kenneth Galbraith), take anything that is obvious and generally accepted as \\"goes without saying\\", question it, take an opposite view, and try to convincingly disprove it. This technique is similar to de Bono's \\"Black Hat\\" of Six Thinking Hats, which looks at identifying reasons to be cautious and conservative. = Fractionation = The purpose of fractionation is to create alternative perceptions of problems and solutions by taking the commonplace view of the situation and break it into multiple alternative situations in order to break away from the fixed view and see the situation from different angles, thus being able to generate multiple possible solutions that can be synthesized into more comprehensive answers. Problem solving ;Problem Solving:When something creates a problem, the performance or the status quo of the situation drops. Problem-solving deals with finding out what caused the problem and then figuring out ways to fix the problem. The objective is to get the situation to where it should be. For example, a production line has an established run rate of 1000 items per hour. Suddenly, the run rate drops to 800 items per hour. Ideas as to why this happened and solutions to repair the production line must be thought of, such as giving the worker a pay raise. A study on engineering students' abilities to answer very open-ended questions suggests that students showing more lateral thinking were able to solve the problems much quicker and more accurately. ;Lateral Problem \\"Solving\\":Lateral thinking will often produce solutions whereby the problem appears as \\"obvious\\" in hindsight. That lateral thinking will often lead to problems that you never knew you had, or it will solve simple problems that have a huge potential. For example, if a production line produced 1000 books per hour, lateral thinking may suggest that a drop in output to 800 would lead to higher quality, and more motivated workers. Students have shown lateral thinking in their application of a variety of individual, unique concepts in order to solve complex problems.

She also founded Sportswoman magazine and was the athletic director at Bryn Mawr College for 24 years. Applebee graduated from the British College of Physical Education in 1899. In 1901, she came to America and took a course in anthropometry at Dudley Allen Sargent's Summer School of Physical Training at Harvard University. After a discussion among her classmates and instructors regarding the British sport of field hockey, she took them to a courtyard behind the Harvard gymnasium and gave a demonstration of the game.Lees, Josephine Townsend.

In the autumn of 1901 she embarked on a tour of women's colleges in the northeastern United States, introducing field hockey and giving coaching and instruction regarding the sport to the students and faculty at each stop. She was invited to Vassar College by Harriet Ballintine, the school's athletic director, and also visited Wellesley College, Bryn Mawr College, Smith College, Mount Holyoke College and Radcliffe College, and Wheaton Female Seminary. She made return visits to each of those schools and the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics to coach field hockey through the spring of 1904.Bryn Mawr College. 1920 Calendar. p. 18.

It is the most widespread of the oystercatchers, with three races breeding in western Europe, central Eurosiberia, Kamchatka, China, and the western coast of Korea. No other oystercatcher occurs within this area. The extinct Canary Islands oystercatcher (Haematopus meadewaldoi), formerly considered a distinct species, may have actually been an isolated subspecies or distinct population of the Eurasian oystercatcher. This oystercatcher is the national bird of the Faroe Islands. Description Eurasian oystercatcher flying on Loch Sligachan on the Isle of Skye, Scotland The oystercatcher is one of the largest waders in the region. It is long, the bill accounting for , and has a wingspan of . They are obvious and noisy plover-like birds, with black and white plumage, red legs and strong broad red bills used for smashing or prising open molluscs such as mussels or for finding earthworms. Despite its name, oysters do not form a large part of its diet. The bird still lives up to its name, as few if any other wading birds are capable of opening oysters at all. This oystercatcher is unmistakable in flight, with white patches on the wings and tail, otherwise black upperparts, and white underparts. Young birds are more brown, have a white neck collar and a duller bill. The call is a distinctive loud piping. The bill shape varies; oystercatchers with broad bill tips open molluscs by prising them apart or hammering through the shell, whereas pointed-bill birds dig up worms. Much of this is due to the wear resulting from feeding on the prey. Individual birds specialise in one technique or the other which they learn from their parents. =Subspecies= There are three subspecies: the nominate ostralegus found in Europe and the coasts of eastern Europe, longipes from Central Asia and Russia, and osculans found from Kamchatka in the Russian Far East and northern parts of China. The extinct Canarian oystercatcher from the Canary Islands may have represented a fourth subspecies, meadewoldi. Bill length shows clinal variation with an increase from west to east. The subspecies longipes has distinctly brownish upperparts and the nasal groove extends more than halfway along the bill. In the subspecies ostralegus the nasal groove stops short of the half-way mark. The osculans subspecies lacks white on the shafts of the outer 2‚Äì3 primaries and has no white on the outer webs of the outer five primaries. Ecology Egg - MHNT The oystercatcher is a migratory species over most of its range. The European population breeds mainly in northern Europe, but in winter the birds can be found in north Africa and southern parts of Europe. Although the species is present all year in Ireland, Great Britain and the adjacent European coasts, there is still migratory movement: the large flocks that are found in the estuaries of south-west England in winter mainly breed in northern England or Scotland. Similar movements are shown by the Asian populations. The birds are highly gregarious outside the breeding season. The nest is a bare scrape on pebbles, on the coast or on inland gravelly islands. 2‚Äì4 eggs are laid. Both eggs and chicks are highly cryptic. Because of its large numbers and readily identified behaviour, the oystercatcher is an important indicator species for the health of the ecosystems where it congregates. Extensive long-term studies have been carried out on its foraging behaviour, in northern Germany, in the Netherlands and particularly on the River Exe estuary in south-west England.Goss-Custard, J. D. (Ed.) (1996). The Oystercatcher: From individuals to populations. Oxford: Oxford University Press. These studies form an important part of the foundation for the modern discipline of behavioural ecology. Etymology The scientific name Haematopus ostralegus comes from the Greek haima Œ±·º≥ŒºŒ± (blood), pous œÄŒøœçœÇ (foot) and the Latin ostrea (oyster) and legere (to collect or pick). The name oystercatcher was coined by Mark Catesby in 1731 as a common name for the North American species H. palliatus, described as eating oysters. Yarrell in 1843 established this as the preferred term, replacing the older name Sea Pie.

James the Less is a figure of early Christianity, one of the Twelve chosen by Jesus. He is also called \\"the Minor\\", \\"the Little\\", \\"the Lesser\\", or \\"the Younger\\", according to translation. He is not to be confused with James, son of Zebedee (\\"James the Great or Elder\\"). He is identified by some as James, the Lord's brother, thought of by St. Jerome and those who followed him as really the cousin of Jesus. James the Less was traditionally commemorated with St. Philip on May 1st in the Western calendars.  Sources  In the New Testament, the name \\"James\\" identifies multiple men. James the Less is named only in connection with his mother \\"Mary\\", who is also the mother of Joseph, who is called Joses by Mark (Joseph and Joses are variants of the same name). There are four mentions: * \\"Mary, the mother of James and Joseph\\" (Matthew 27:56); * \\"Mary, the mother of James the younger and of Joses\\" (Mark 15:40) (\\"James the younger\\" here has also been translated \\"James the less\\"); * \\"Mary, the mother of James\\" (Mark 16:1 and Luke 24:10). This \\"Mary\\" may have been Mary of Clopas, mentioned only in . It is unlikely to be Mary the mother of Jesus since she is not identified as Jesus' mother but only called the mother of James the Less and Joseph/Joses. In Matthew 27:56 she is clearly distinguished from the mother of James, son of Zebedee.  Identification as James the brother of Jesus  Saint James the Less, as depicted in the Menologion of Basil II (c. 1000 AD) James the Less is identified with James the brother of Jesus. Jerome concluded that James \\"the brother of the Lord\\" is the same as James the Less. To explain this, Jerome first tells that James the Less must be identified with James, the son of Alphaeus.The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary Fragment 15 After that, James the Less being the same as James, the son of Alphaeus, Jerome describes in his work called De Viris Illustribus that James \\"the brother of the Lord\\" is the same as James, son of Alphaeus: Thus, Jerome concludes that James the Less, James, son of Alphaeus and James the brother of Jesus are one and the same person. According to the Golden Legend, which is a collection of hagiographies, compiled by Jacobus de Varagine in the thirteenth century: The same work adds \\"Simon Cananean and Judas Thaddeus were brethren of James the Less and sons of Mary Cleophas, which was married to Alpheus.\\"  Identification as James, the son of Alphaeus  Statue of Saint James the Minor, Apostle, at the church of the Mafra Palace, Portugal The title, \\"the Less\\", is used to differentiate James from other people named James. Since it means that he is either the younger or shorter of two, he seems to be compared to one other James. In the lists of the twelve apostles in the synoptic Gospels, there are two apostles called James, who are differentiated there by their fathers: James, son of Zebedee, and James, son of Alphaeus. Long-standing tradition identifies James, the son of Alphaeus, as James the Less. James, son of Zebedee, is then called \\"James the Great\\" (although that designation does not appear in the New Testament). Some propose that Alphaeus was the same man as Cleophas or at least the husband of Mary Clopas. In this regard, Jerome identified James the Less with James, son of Alpheus writing in his work called The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary the following: Papias of Hierapolis, who lived circa 70‚Äì163 AD, in the surviving fragments of his work Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord relates that Mary, wife of Alphaeus is mother of James the Less: Therefore, James, son of Alphaeus would be the same as James the Less. In Catholic tradition, James's mother is none other than Mary of Clopas who was among the women at the foot of the Cross of Jesus, weeping. For that reason, and given the fact that the Semitic word for brother is also used for other close relatives, James son of Alpheus is often held as a cousin to Jesus. He is also thought by some to be the brother of Matthew the Apostle, since the father of both was named Alphaeus (compare Mark 2:14 and 3:18). Modern Biblical scholars are divided on whether this identification is correct. John Paul Meier finds it unlikely.John Paul Meier, A Marginal Jew volume 3, p. 201. \\"There are no grounds for identifying James of Alphaeus - as church tradition has done - with James the Less.\\" Amongst evangelicals, the New Bible Dictionary supports the traditional identification,New Bible Dictionary, 2nd Edition (IVP 1982), \\"James\\" entry (by P.H.Davids) while Don Carson\\"The Expositor's Bible Commentary CDROM, commentary on Matthew (by Don Carson), commentary on Matthew 10:2-4 and Darrell BockLuke, by Darrell Bock (Baker 1994), commentary on Luke 6:15 both regard the identification as possible, but not certain.

The flagship, Richie Rich, ran 254 issues from 1960 to 1991 (with a hiatus from 1982‚Äì1986), followed by a second volume which ran an additional 28 issues from 1991‚Äì1994.

In 1972, Harvey realized that Richie was its most lucrative character, and introduced five new Richie Rich titles: Richie Rich Bank Book, Richie Rich Diamonds, Richie Rich Jackpots, Richie Rich Money World and Richie Rich Riches. By the mid-1970s, says historian Mark Arnold, \\"Richie was starring in 32 different titles every 60 days...

Richie (along with many of the Harvey characters) has been published only sporadically since 1994.

Other illustrators included Ernie Col√≥n, Sid Couchey, Dom Sileo, Ben Brown, Steve Muffatti, and Joe Dennett. Character Despite any negative stereotypes associated with his incredible wealth, Richie Rich is portrayed as kind and charitable (in fact, his moniker is \\"the poor little rich boy\\") he lives in an expensive mansion and owns at least two of everything money can buy. Richie appears to be around seven to ten years old and wears a waistcoat, a white shirt with an Eton collar (which is obscured by a giant red bow tie), and blue shorts.

He typically wears the most threadbare of clothes makes every conceivable effort to avoid spending money to the extent that his house is equipped with an alarm that goes off if he carelessly leaves the house with \\"too much\\" money.

He is often angered with Reggie's non-stop pranks and often punishes him for them (usually by spanking). * Vanessa Van Dough ‚Äì Mrs. Rich's sister-in-law and Reggie's mother.

Pee-Wee plays along with all of Freckles' and Richie's activities without ever saying a word. * Billy Bellhops ‚Äì A redheaded boy who worked as a bellhop at his father's hotel. Premiered in \\"Richie Rich and Billy Bellhops\\" in 1977, but was short-lived.

He appeared only in Richie Rich Meets Timmy Time #1 (September 1977). Timmy Time was created by Ernie Col√≥n as Mark Time. Col√≥n's frustration at Mark Time being renamed Timmy Time and presented as a Richie Rich spin-off, when the original agreement had been that the character would debut in his own series, led him to abandon the project. * Jackie Jokers ‚Äì A stand-up comedian and a friend of Richie Rich. * Jerry Jokers ‚Äì Father of Jackie Jokers who often performs in comedy acts with his son. =Rich family employees= * Cadbury C. Cadbury ‚Äì The Riches' butler who attends to the Rich estate. British born, Cadbury gives the image of propriety and service.

His only desire is to take over Mr. Rich's empire. In other media =Animated TV series= * Beginning in 1980, Richie Rich appeared in his own Saturday morning cartoon show, simply called Richie Rich where Richie Rich was voiced by Sparky Marcus. The show aired on The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show from 1980‚Äì82 and The Pac- Man/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show from 1982‚Äì84. In the animated version, Richie and his pals are somewhat older, around 12 years old. In the cartoon, Richie wears a red sweater with the letter \\"R\\" in front.

He is a main character in season 3, which premiered later that year. =Live action TV series= Netflix debuted a 2015 half-hour comedy series titled Richie Rich with Jake Brennan starring as Richie Rich, along with Joshua Carlon, Jenna Ortega, Lauren Taylor, Kiff VandenHeuvel, and Brooke Wexler. However, the series is very different to the original and the rest of the original main characters were replaced, like Herbert Cadbury their butler and Professor Keenbean head of Rich's research and development, the only exception is Irona. Unlike the comic book version, Richie is not born wealthy and he was self-made trillionaire. Unlike the comics, in this series, Richie has a sister, instead of being an only child, and both of them are raised by a single parent, their father. The show was executive produced by Jeff Hodsden and Tim Pollack from The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and A.N.T. Farm. The show was produced by DreamWorks Animation. =Movies= * Richie Rich, a live action film adaptation, was released in 1994, with Macaulay Culkin as the titular character, Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Jonathan Hyde as Cadbury, Michael McShane as Professor Keanbean, John Larroquette as the evil Laurence Van Dough, and Frank Welker providing special vocal effects. It was produced by Silver Pictures Davis Entertainment and released by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment label. * A live- action sequel, Richie Rich's Christmas Wish, followed in 1998. This film starred David Gallagher as the titular character replacing Macaulay Culkin, Martin Mull as Richard Rich, Lesley Ann Warren as Regina Rich, Keene Curtis as Cadbury, Don McLeod as Irona, Michelle Trachtenberg as Gloria, Eugene Levy as Professor Keanbean, and Jake Richardson as Reggie Van Dough.

In criminal law, it may criminalize actions that were legal when committed; it may aggravate a crime by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; it may change the punishment prescribed for a crime, as by adding new penalties or extending sentences; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed. Conversely, a form of ex post facto law commonly called an amnesty law may decriminalize certain acts. (Alternatively, rather than redefining the relevant acts as non-criminal, it may simply prohibit prosecution; or it may enact that there is to be no punishment, but leave the underlying conviction technically unaltered.) A pardon has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases (though a pardon more often leaves the conviction itself ‚Äì the finding of guilt ‚Äì unaltered, and occasionally pardons are refused for this reason). Other legal changes may alleviate possible punishments (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term in mitius. Some common-law jurisdictions do not permit retroactive criminal legislation, though new precedent generally applies to events that occurred before the judicial decision. Ex post facto laws are expressly forbidden by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3 (with respect to federal laws) and Article 1, Section 10 (with respect to state laws). In some nations that follow the Westminster system of government, such as the United Kingdom, ex post facto laws are technically possible, because the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy allows Parliament to pass any law it wishes. In a nation with an entrenched bill of rights or a written constitution, ex post facto legislation may be prohibited. While American jurisdictions generally prohibit ex post facto laws, European countries apply the principle of lex mitior (\\"the milder law\\"). It provides that, if the law has changed after an offense was committed, the version of the law that applies is the one that is more advantageous for the accused. This means that ex post facto laws apply in European jurisdictions to the extent that they are the milder law. Ex post facto laws by country =Australia= Australia has no strong constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws, although narrowly retroactive laws might violate the constitutional separation of powers principle. Australian courts normally interpret statutes with a strong presumption that they do not apply retroactively. Retroactive laws designed to prosecute what was perceived to have been a blatantly unethical means of tax avoidance were passed in the early 1980s by the Fraser government (see Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance). Similarly, legislation criminalising certain war crimes retroactively has been held to be constitutional (see Polyukhovich v Commonwealth). The government will sometimes make a press release that it intends to change the tax law with effect from the date and time of the press release, before legislation is introduced into parliament. =Brazil= According to the 5th Article, section XXXVI of the Brazilian Constitution, laws cannot have ex post facto effects that affect acquired rights, accomplished juridical acts and res judicata. The same article in section XL prohibits ex post facto criminal laws. Like France, there is an exception when retroactive criminal laws benefit the accused person. =Canada= In Canada, ex post facto criminal laws are constitutionally prohibited by paragraph 11(g) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Also, under paragraph 11(i) of the Charter, if the punishment for a crime has varied between the time the crime was committed and the time of sentencing following a conviction, the convicted person is entitled to the lesser punishment. Due to section 1 and section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms these rights are not absolute, and may be overridden. The Canada sex offender registry, which went into effect on December 15, 2004, is somewhat retroactive. When the registry was created, all offenders who were on the Ontario sex offender registry, which was created in 2001, were required to register on the national registry. In addition, sex offenders in all provinces who were serving a sentence (whether imprisoned or on probation or parole) on December 15, 2004, were required to register, regardless of when their offense and conviction occurred. However, the registry was not retroactive to anybody who had completed their sentence by late 2004 and was not on the Ontario registry. Canadian courts have never ruled on the somewhat retroactive nature of the sex offender registry, since this seems to have never been challenged. Sex offender registration was not mandatory for sex offenders until 2011, and had to be ordered by a judge. Somewhat bizarrely, sex offender registration was seemingly mandatory for people convicted before December 15, 2004, who were serving a sentence on that date, but was only optional for sex offenders convicted between December 15, 2004, and January 1, 2011. Because section 11 of the Charter is among the sections that can be overridden under section 33 (the notwithstanding clause), Parliament could in theory enact ex post facto laws by invoking section 33. However, the federal Parliament (which has the sole power to enact laws punishable for violation by two years or more in penitentiary) has never attempted to enact an ex post facto law (or any other law) using section 33. The Charter prohibition applies only to criminal law. Changes to civil law in Canada can be, and occasionally are, enacted ex post facto. In one example, convicted murderer Colin Thatcher was ordered to forfeit proceeds from a book he had published (after being paroled from prison) under a Saskatchewan law. Although the law was passed long after Thatcher's murder conviction, the courts have ruled that such laws prescribe only civil penalties (as opposed to additional criminal penalties) and are thus not subject to Charter restrictions. =Croatia= Article 90 of the Constitution of Croatia states that \\"only individual provisions of a law may have a retroactive effect for exceptionally justified reasons\\". According to Croatian legal scholar , this means that \\"a law cannot be applied retroactively as a whole, and regulations enacted pursuant to statutory authority can never be applied retroactively\\". =Finland= Generally, the Finnish legal system does not permit ex post facto laws, especially those that would expand criminal responsibility. They are not expressly forbidden; instead, the ban is derived from more general legal principles and basic rights. In civil matters, such as taxation, ex post facto laws may be made in some circumstances. Former Minister of the Interior P√§ivi R√§s√§nen became subject of a criminal investigation about suspected agitation against an ethnic group in late 2019 over her text concerning homosexuality, which was published online in 2004. The statute of limitations for said charge is five years, which has led the case to be interpreted as ex post facto. However, agitation against an ethnic group is a perpetuating crime, and the statute of limitations only begins once the offending material has been removed from public viewing. The investigation has still been characterized as strange, as R√§s√§nen's text is hardly the only material online or otherwise that could be viewed as agitation against an ethnic group, and the demarcation between who should and who should not be prosecuted for publishing and/or making such material available is unclear. Historically there have been three exceptional instances when ex post facto criminal laws have been used in Finland. # Following the Finnish Civil War of 1918, the Parliament of Finland passed a law setting up tribunals to try suspected rebels. These tribunals issued death sentences in many cases, although very few of those accused could have committed a crime that carried the death penalty under Finnish law in force during the war. Several hundred people were executed under what was arguably an ex post facto legal arrangement. During the war, and before the tribunals were set up, thousands of people had been executed without trial by both sides. However, once this phase of the civil war ended, amnesty laws were passed. Thus, the legality of the actions of the government or the participants of either side of the war cannot be legally contested anymore. # After World War II, Finland was under pressure to convict political leaders whom the Allied powers considered responsible for Finnish involvement in the war. An ex post facto law was passed in the autumn of 1945 to permit prosecution for war responsibility, and eventually eight politicians were convicted. In another post-war case, the weapons cache case, an ex post facto law was passed in 1947 so that military personnel could be prosecuted for unofficially preparing for guerrilla resistance in case of Soviet occupation. # During World War II, desertion, draft dodging and conscientious objection were punishable by death or jail. Amnesty laws were passed after World War II to free deserters and draft dodgers from imprisonment and further prosecution and allow them to return home without further legal consequences. =France= In France, so-called \\"lois r√©troactives\\" (retroactive laws) are technically prohibited by Article 2 of the Code Civil, which states that: \\"Legislation provides only for the future; it has no retrospective operation\\". In practice, however, since the Code Civil does not have the status of constitutional legislation and can therefore be overruled by subsequent laws, the Conseil Constitutionnel has determined that retroactive laws can be passed within certain limits ‚Äì such as in the case of financial or tax legislation ‚Äì, particularly where it is considered to be in the \\"general interest\\"; this has been demonstrated by a series of decisions handed down by the Conseil Constitutionnel concerning retroactive tax laws. However, in criminal law, ex post facto sanctions are effectively forbidden as per Article 112-1 of the French Penal Code, except in cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person (called retroactivity in mitius). They are also considered unconstitutional, since the principle of non-retroactivity is laid down in Article 8 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which has constitutional status under French law. The √©puration l√©gale trials held after the 1944 liberation of France introduced the status of indignit√© nationale for Nazi collaborators as a way to avoid ex post facto law. =Germany= Article 103 of the German basic law requires that an act may be punished only if it has already been punishable by law at the time it was committed (specifically: by written law, Germany following civil law). Robert A. Taft, at the time a U.S. Senator from Ohio, asserted that the Nuremberg Trials following World War II were based on ex post facto law because the Allies did not negotiate the London Charter, which defined crimes against humanity and created the International Military Tribunal, until well after the acts charged. Others, including the International Military Tribunal, argued that the London Charter merely restated and provided jurisdiction to prosecute offenses that were already made unlawful by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Covenant of the League of Nations, and the various Hague Conventions. The problem of ex post facto law was also relevant in the 1990s after German reunification as there was a discussion about the trials against East German border troops who killed fugitives on the Inner-German border (Mauersch√ºtzen- Prozesse - Wall-shooters'/ -guards' trials). German courts in these cases recurred to the Radbruch formula.Benjamin Lahusen \\"Aus Juristen Demokraten machen\\" =Hungary= In 2010, the Hungarian National Assembly established a 98% punitive tax on any income over two million forints received either as a retirement package or as severance pay in the previous five years in the government sector. =India= In India, without using the expression \\"ex post facto law\\", the underlying principle has been adopted in the article 20(1) of the Indian Constitution in the following words: Further, what article 20(1) prohibits is conviction and sentence under an ex post facto law for acts done prior thereto, but not the enactment or validity of such a law. There is, thus, a difference between the Indian and the American positions on this point; whereas in the United States, an ex post facto law is in itself invalid, it is not so in India. The courts may also interpret a law in such a manner that any objection against it of retrospective operation may be removed. An example for retrospective law in India is the Karnataka Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978 in the state of Karnataka. =Indonesia= The Indonesian Constitution prohibits trying citizens under retroactive laws in any circumstance. This was tested in 2004 when the conviction of Masykur Abdul Kadir, one of the Bali bombers, under retroactive anti-terrorist legislation was quashed.Indonesian Constitutional Court Decision No 013/PUU-I/2003 (Masykur Abdul Kadir Case) =Iran= Ex post facto laws, in all contexts, are prohibited by Article 169 (Chapter 11) of the Iranian Constitution. =Republic of Ireland= The imposition of retroactive criminal sanctions is prohibited by Article 15.5.1¬∞ of the Irish Constitution. Retroactive changes of the civil law have also been found to violate the constitution when they would have resulted in the loss in a right to damages before the courts, the Irish Supreme Court having found that such a right is a constitutionally protected property right. =Israel= Israel enacted the 1950 \\"Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law\\" for the purpose of punishing acts that occurred during the Second World War and the Holocaust, when Israel did not exist as a state. The law was used to punish Adolf Eichmann and others. =Italy= Article 25, paragraph 2, of the Italian Constitution, establishing that \\"nobody can be punished but according to a law come into force before the deed was committed\\", prohibits indictment pursuant a retroactive law. Article 11 of preliminary provisions to the Italian Civil Code and Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of taxpayer's rights, prohibit retroactive laws on principle: such provisions can be derogated, however, by acts having force of the ordinary law; on the contrary, non-retroactivity in criminal law is thought absolute. =Japan= Article 39 of the constitution of Japan prohibits the retroactive application of laws. Article 6 of Criminal Code of Japan further states that if a new law comes into force after the deed was committed, the lighter punishment must be given. =Lithuania= Lithuania has no constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws. Retroactive criminal sanctions are prohibited by Article 2, Part 1 (Chapter 1) of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania. Retroactive administrative sanctions are prohibited by Article 8 of the Administrative Code of the Republic of Lithuania. Lithuanian lawyer Dainius ≈Ωalimas contends that there has been retroactive application of the law on Genocide (and subsequently adopted articles of the Criminal Code) against participants in Soviet repressions against Lithuanian guerilla fighters and their supporters, and gives examples of such decisions. The Article 99 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania was introduced only in September 26, 2000 and therefore can't be used in events of 1944-1953. =Mexico= According to the first and second paragraphs of the 14th Article of the Mexican Constitution, retroactive application of the law is prohibited if it is detrimental to a person‚Äôs rights, but a new law can be applied if it benefits the person. =Netherlands= Article 4 of the Law on General Provisions (in effect since 1838) states that \\"The law has no retroactive effect\\". Article 1 of Criminal Law states that no act is punishable without a pre-existing law, and that in the case an act was punishable but the law was changed after the criminal act the \\"most favorable\\" (to the suspect) of the two laws will apply. In Civil Law there is no such provision. =New Zealand= Section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1999 stipulates that enactments do not have retrospective effect. The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 also affirms New Zealand's commitment to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with section 26 preventing the application of retroactive penalties. This is further reinforced under section 6(1) of the current Sentencing Act 2002 which provides, \\"[p]enal enactments not to have retrospective effect to disadvantage of offender\\" irrespective of any provision to the contrary. Section 26 of the Bill of Rights and the previous sentencing legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 1985, caused significant digression among judges when the New Zealand Parliament introduced legislation that had the effect of enacting a retrospective penalty for crimes involving an element of home invasion. Ultimately, the discrepancy was restricted with what some labelled artificial logic in the cases of R v Pora and R v Poumako. =Norway= Article 97 of the Norwegian Constitution prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect. The prohibition applies to both criminal and civil laws, but in some civil cases, only particularly unreasonable effects of retroactivity will be found unconstitutional. =Pakistan= Article 12 of the Constitution of Pakistan prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect by stating: * 12.1 - No law shall authorize the punishment of a person:- * 12.1.a - for an act or omission that was not punishable by law at the time of the act or omission; or * 12.1.b - for an offence by a penalty greater than, or of a kind different from, the penalty prescribed by law for that offence at the time the offence was committed. =Philippines= The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines categorically prohibits the passing of any ex post facto law. Article III (Bill of Rights), Section 22 specifically states: \\"No ex post facto law or bill of attainder shall be enacted.\\" However, the Cybercrime Prevention Act, which went into effect on October 3, 2012, is criticized for being ex post facto. =Poland= Retroactive application of law is prohibited by the Article 3 of the Polish civil code, and the legal rule prohibiting such retroactive application is commonly memorised as a Latin sentence Lex retro non agit (\\"A law does not apply retroactively\\"). The said article, however, allows retroactive application of an Act of Parliament if it is expressly understood from its text or purpose. =Portugal= Article 18 of the Portuguese Constitution forbids the retroactive application of any law the restricts right; article 29 of the Portuguese Constitution forbids retroactive application of criminal law; article 103 forbids the application of retroactive taxes. =Romania= Article 15 (2) of the Romanian Constitution provides that the law shall only act for the future, except for the more favourable criminal or administrative law. =Russia= Ex post facto punishment in criminal and administrative law is prohibited by article 54 of the Russian Constitution; ex post facto tax laws by article 57 of the constitution. =Spain= Article 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution guarantees the principle of non-retroactivity of punitive provisions that are not favorable to or restrictive of individual rights. Therefore, \\"ex post facto\\" criminal laws or any other retroactive punitive provisions are constitutionally prohibited. As well as Statute law mentioned above, this now also includes 'court-made law'. The Parot doctrine, in which terrorists were denied the right (enshrined in a 1973 Statute) to earn a reduction in the length of their sentences by a Spanish court ruling in 2006 was judged by the European Court of Human Rights to be contrary to relevant articles on retroactivity & liberty and security in 2013. =South Africa= Section 35(3) of the South African Bill of Rights prohibits ex post facto criminal laws, except that acts which violated international law at the time they were committed may be prosecuted even if they were not illegal under national law at the time. It also prohibits retroactive increases of criminal punishments. =Sweden= In Sweden, retroactive penal sanctions and other retroactive legal effects of criminal acts due the State are prohibited by chapter 2, section 10 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen). Retroactive taxes or charges are not prohibited, but they can have retroactive effect reaching back only to the time when a new tax bill was proposed by the government. The retroactive effect of a tax or charge thus reaches from that time until the bill is passed by the parliament. As the Swedish Act of Succession was changed in 1979, and the throne was inherited regardless of sex, the inheritance right was withdrawn from all the descendants of Charles XIV John (king 1818-44) except the current king Carl XVI Gustaf. Thereby, the heir-apparent title was transferred from the new-born Prince Carl Philip to his older sister Crown Princess Victoria. The Swedish Riksdag voted in 2004 to abolish inheritance tax by January 1, 2005. However, in 2005 they retro- actively decided to move the date to December 17, 2004. The main reason was abolishing inheritance tax for the many Swedish victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which took place on December 26. =Turkey= Ex post facto punishment is prohibited by Article 38 of the Constitution of Turkey. It states: * c1. No one shall be punished for any act which does not constitute a criminal offence under the law in force at the time committed; no one shall be given a heavier penalty for an offence other than the penalty applicable at the time when the offence was committed. * c2. The provisions of the above paragraph shall also apply to the statute of limitations on offences and penalties and on the results of conviction. Thus, the article does not prohibit in mitius laws, i.e. cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, ex post facto laws are permitted by virtue of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. Historically, all acts of Parliament before 1793 were ex post facto legislation, inasmuch as their date of effect was the first day of the session in which they were passed. This situation was rectified by the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793. Some laws are still passed retrospectively: e.g., the Pakistan Act 1990 (by which the United Kingdom amended its legislation consequent to the Commonwealth of Nations having re- admitted Pakistan as a member) was one such law; despite being passed on 29 June 1990, section 2 subsection 3 states that \\"This Act shall be deemed to have come into force on 1st October 1989\\", nine months before it was enacted. Retrospective criminal laws are prohibited by Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, but several noted legal authorities have stated their opinion that parliamentary sovereignty takes priority even over this.Lord Denning in Macarthys Ltd v Smith [1979] ICR 785 at p. 789, quoted in For example, the War Crimes Act 1991 created an ex post facto jurisdiction of British courts over war crimes committed during the Second World War. Another important example of a case which shows the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in action is in relation to Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate, where the decision of the courts was overridden with retrospective effect by the War Damage Act 1965, which changed the law on compensation resulting from scorched earth actions in Burma during the war. More recently, the Police (Detention and Bail) Act 2011 retroactively overrode a controversial court judgment resulting from an error in the drafting of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that would potentially have invalidated thousands of criminal convictions. Another example of an ex post facto criminal law in the UK is the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This law allows people acquitted of murder and certain other serious offences to be retried if there is \\"new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence\\" that the acquitted person really was guilty. This Act applies retroactively and can be used to re-prosecute people who were acquitted before it came into force in 2005, or even before it was passed in 2003. As a result, two of the defendants who were acquitted in the murder of Stephen Lawrence were allowed to be retried, even though this murder occurred in 1993 and the defendants had been acquitted in 1996. Many people have criticized the Criminal Justice Act because of its essential abolition of prohibition against both ex post facto and double jeopardy laws. Taxation law has on multiple occasions been changed to retrospectively disallow tax avoidance schemes. The most significant example known concerns double-taxation treaty arrangements where the Finance Act 2008 with BN66 retrospectively amended 1987 legislation, creating large tax liabilities for 3,000 people where no liability existed before. =United States= Thomas Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, stated in 1813 that: Congress is prohibited from passing ex post facto laws by clause 3 of Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution. The states are prohibited from passing ex post facto laws by clause 1 of Article I, Section 10. This is one of the relatively few restrictions that the United States Constitution made to both the power of the federal and state governments before the Fourteenth Amendment. Thomas Jefferson described them as \\"equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases\\". Over the years, however, when deciding ex post facto cases, the United States Supreme Court has referred repeatedly to its ruling in Calder v. Bull, in which Justice Samuel Chase held that the prohibition applied only to criminal matters, not civil matters, and established four categories of unconstitutional ex post facto laws.Calder v. Bull, . The case dealt with the Article I, Section 10, prohibition on ex post facto laws, because it concerned a Connecticut state law. Not all laws with retroactive effects have been held to be unconstitutional. One current U.S. law that has a retroactive effect is the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. This law imposes new registration requirements on convicted sex offenders and also applies to offenders whose crimes were committed before the law was enacted. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Smith v. Doe (2003) that forcing sex offenders to register their whereabouts at regular intervals, and the posting of personal information about them on the Internet, do not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws, because these laws do not impose any kind of punishment.Smith v. Doe, . In Starkey v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections, the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma found the Oklahoma Sex Offender Registration Act, or SORA, to be punitive in nature, if not in intent. While the law in question had been ruled as not being retroactive in nature, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had been applying the new legislation retroactively. The court found that \\"the Department's retroactive application of the level assignment provisions of 57 O.S. Supp. 2007, 582.1 ‚Äì 582.5, as amended, violates the ex post facto clause.\\"Starkey v. Oklahoma Department Of Corrections, 2013 OK 43 (2013); OSCN Document Controversy has also arisen with regard to sexually violent predator (SVP) laws, which allow the indefinite commitment of a person with a mental abnormality which predisposes them to molest children. This issue arose in the case Kansas v. Hendricks.Kansas v. Hendricks, . In Hendricks, a man with a long history of sexually molesting children was scheduled to be released from prison shortly after the enactment of Kansas's SVP act. Rather than being released, he was committed on the grounds that he had a mental abnormality. Hendricks contested the law on ex post facto and double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court of Kansas invalidated the Act, but the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision and ruled that the law was constitutional on the basis that the law did not impose a criminal punishment. Another example is the Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban, where firearms prohibitions were imposed on those convicted of misdemeanor domestic-violence offenses and on subjects of restraining orders (which do not require criminal conviction). These individuals can now be sentenced to up to ten years in a federal prison for possession of a firearm, regardless of whether the weapon was legally possessed when the law was passed., , and . The law has been legally upheld because it is considered regulatory, not punitive; it is a status offense.United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001). The US military also recognizes ex post facto law. Common law states that Courts- martial will not enforce an ex post facto law, including increasing amount of pay to be forfeited for specific crimes. (See United States v. Gorki 47 M.J. 370). Finally, in Calder v. Bull, the court expressly stated that a law that \\"mollifies\\" a criminal act was merely retrospective, and was not an ex post facto law.Calder, 3 U.S. Scholars have argued that, as a historical matter, the phrase ex post facto referred to civil as well as criminal laws. In administrative law, federal agencies may apply their rules retroactively if Congress has authorized them to; otherwise, retroactive application is generally prohibited. Retroactive application of regulations is disfavored by the courts for several reasons. The courts uphold retroactive regulation where Congress has expressly granted such retroactive power to the agency, as they did in Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital.Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, . The rules as they relate to the effects of ex post facto upon the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines can be found in . See also Bouie v. City of Columbia, Rogers v. Tennessee, Stogner v. California, Republic of Austria v. Altmann, James Bamford and Samuels v. McCurdy. = Vietnam = Ex post facto laws is defined in Article 152, 2015 Law on Promulgation of Legal Documents: # Only in cases of extreme necessity to ensure the common good of society, to exercise the rights and interests of organizations and individuals prescribed in laws and resolutions of the National Assembly, legal documents of central government rules are retroactive. # The retroactive effect is prohibited in the following cases: a) Impose legal liability for acts that at the time of committing such acts the law does not stipulate liability; b) Impose higher legal liability. # Legislative documents of People's Councils, People's Committees at all levels, local governments in special administrative-economic units are not retroactive. There has been no case that new law stated it has a retroactive effect. But the second item of this Article has been widely used in court system (in mitus laws) Treatment by international organizations and treaties =International criminal law= In international criminal law, the Nuremberg trials prosecuted war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in World War II. Although the Nuremberg Charter, the procedural law under which the trials were held, postdated V-E Day, the tribunal rejected the defence that the criminal law was ex post facto, arguing it derived from earlier treaties like the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. The International Criminal Court established in 2002 cannot prosecute crimes committed before 2002. =Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related treaties= Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that no person be held guilty of any criminal law that did not exist at the time of offence nor suffer any penalty heavier than what existed at the time of offence. It does however permit application of either domestic or international law. Very similar provisions are found in Article 15, paragraph 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, replacing the term \\"penal offence\\" with \\"criminal offence\\". It also adds that if a lighter penalty is provided for after the offence occurs, that lighter penalty shall apply retroactively. Paragraph 2 adds a provision that paragraph 1 does not prevent trying and punishing for an act that was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations. Specifically addressing the use of the death penalty, article 6, paragraph 2 provides in relevant part that a death sentence may only be imposed \\"for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime\\". =African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights= Article 2, paragraph 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights provides in part that \\"no one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a legally punishable offence at the time it was committed. No penalty may be inflicted for an offence for which no provision was made at the time it was committed.\\" =American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man= Article 25 of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man provides in part that \\"[n]o person may be deprived of his liberty except in the cases and according to the procedures established by pre-existing law.\\" The right to be tried in accordance to \\"pre-existing law\\" is reiterated in article 26. =Arab Charter on Human Rights= Article 15 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights provides that \\"[n]o crime and no penalty can be established without a prior provision of the law. In all circumstances, the law most favorable to the defendant shall be applied.\\" =European Convention on Human Rights= Effectively all European states (except Belarus), including all European Union and European Economic Area states, are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 7 of the Convention mirrors the language of both paragraphs of Article 15 of the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, with the exception that it does not include that a subsequent lighter penalty must apply. Grammatical form and usage The Digesta Iustiniani (15.3.10.8.3, 20.1.22.pr2) (\\"Digest of Justinian\\") contains the two-word phrase ex postfacto: \\"out of a postfactum\\" (an after-deed), or more naturally, \\"from a law passed afterward\\". This same work, however, also makes use of the three-word phrase ex post facto, (2.14.17.4.2, 4.6.17.1.1, passim), suggesting that post might best be understood as an adverb. Other adverbial usages of post include the Classical Roman author and senator Marcus Tullius Cicero employing phrases such as multis post annis (De Re Publica 2.5.8 and elsewhere). Thus, ex post facto or ex postfacto is natively an adverbial phrase, a usage demonstrated by the sentence \\"He was convicted ex post facto (from a law passed after his crime).\\" The law itself would rightfully be a lex postfacta in Latin, although English generally uses the phrase \\"an ex post facto law\\". In Poland the phrase lex retro non agit (\\"the law does not operate retroactively\\") is used.

The word is the past participle of the French √©migrer, \\"to emigrate\\". French Huguenots French Huguenots were forced to leave France following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The American Revolution Many Loyalists that made up large portions of Colonial America, particularly in the South, fled America during and after the American revolution. Common destinations were other parts of the British Empire such as Upper Canada, Nova Scotia, Great Britain, Jamaica, and the British West Indies. The lands left by the fleeing Tories were often awarded by the new government to Patriot soldiers by way of land grants. The French Revolution Although the French Revolution began in 1789 as a peaceful, bourgeois-led drive for increased political equality for the Third Estate, it soon turned into a violent popular rebellion. To escape political tensions and sometimes in fear for their lives, some emigrated from France, settling in neighboring countries, chiefly Great Britain, Spain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia. A few also went to the United States. The Russian Revolution White Russian √©migr√©s and other opponents of the new regimes fled the Revolutions of 1917 and 1918 and its aftermath. Marx and Engels, drafting their strategy for future revolutions in The Communist Manifesto, suggested confiscating the property of √©migr√©s to finance the revolution‚Äîa recommendation the Bolsheviks followed 70 years later. After the October Revolution, more than 20,000 Russians went to Finland and Yugoslavia, notably Pyotr Wrangel. Many however moved on to France. Paris was the favourite destination for Russian √©migr√©s. Many others traveled east to China, especially to Shanghai. Twentieth century √©migr√©s Aristocrats of some European countries were forced to leave their native lands by political upheavals from the beginning of the 20th century to the end of World War II. United States In 2016, 5,411 US citizens living in other countries relinquished their US citizenship. This is often attributed to extraterritorial laws on US citizens, such as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010. . (In comparison, there were only 235 expatriations in 2008).  South Africa  After the historical electoral victory in South Africa by the ANC (African National Congress) in 1994, many Afrikaners emigrated from South Africa to other countries, citing discrimination in employment and social violence as reasons.Peet van Aardt (24 September 2006). \\"Million whites leave SA - study\\". 24.com.

Biblia Hebraica from Kittel's edition (BHK) 1909. Four letters, fifty letters apart, starting from the first taw on the first verse, form the word ◊™◊ï◊®◊î (Torah). The Bible code (, hatzofen hatanachi), also known as the Torah code, is a purported set of encoded words hidden within the Hebrew text of the Torah, that according to its proponents, have seemingly predicted significant historical events. The statistical likelihood of the Bible code arising by chance has been thoroughly researched, and it is now widely considered to be statistically insignificant, as similar phenomena can be observed in any sufficiently lengthy text. Although Bible codes have been postulated and studied for centuries, the subject has been popularized in modern times by Michael Drosnin's book The Bible Code and the movie The Omega Code. Many examples have been documented in the past. One cited example is that by taking every 50th letter of the Book of Genesis starting with the first taw, the Hebrew word \\"torah\\" is spelled out. The same happens in the Book of Exodus. Modern computers have been used to search for similar patterns and more complex variants, as well as quantifying its statistical likelihood. Some tests purportedly showing statistically significant codes in the Bible were published as a \\"challenging puzzle\\" in a peer-reviewed academic journal in 1994, which was pronounced \\"solved\\" in a subsequent 1999 paper published in the same journal. Overview Contemporary discussion and controversy around one specific steganographic method became widespread in 1994 when Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips and Yoav Rosenberg published a paper, \\"Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis\\", in the scientific journal Statistical Science. The paper, which was presented by the journal as a \\"challenging puzzle\\", presented what appeared to be strong statistical evidence that biographical information about famous rabbis was encoded in the text of the Book of Genesis, centuries before those rabbis lived. Since then the term \\"Bible codes\\" has been popularly used to refer specifically to information encrypted via this ELS method. Equidistant Letter Sequence method The primary method by which purportedly meaningful messages have been extracted is the Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS). To obtain an ELS from a text, choose a starting point (in principle, any letter) and a skip number, also freely and possibly negative. Then, beginning at the starting point, select letters from the text at equal spacing as given by the skip number. For example, the bold letters in this sentence form an ELS. With a skip of ‚àí4 (that is, reading backwards every fourth letter), and ignoring the spaces and punctuation, the word safest is spelled out. Genesis 26:5‚Äì10 in a 21-column grid and you get a word search with \\"Bible\\" and \\"code\\". Myriad other arrangements can yield other words. (Alternate words are bolded for legibility.) Often more than one ELS related to some topic can be displayed simultaneously in an ELS letter array. This is produced by writing out the text in a regular grid, with exactly the same number of letters in each line, then cutting out a rectangle. In the example below, part of the King James Version of Genesis (26:5‚Äì10) is shown with 21 letters per line. ELSs for \\"Bible\\" and \\"code\\" are shown. Normally only a smaller rectangle would be displayed, such as the rectangle drawn in the figure. In that case there would be letters missing between adjacent lines in the picture, but it is essential that the number of missing letters be the same for each line. Although the above examples are in English texts, Bible codes proponents usually use a Hebrew Bible text. For religious reasons, most Jewish proponents use only the Torah (Genesis‚ÄìDeuteronomy). =ELS extensions= Once a specific word has been found as an ELS, it is natural to see whether that word is part of a longer ELS consisting of multiple words.Shak, Moshe Aharon. 2004. Bible Codes Breakthrough. Montreal: Green Shoelace Books. 38 Code proponents Haralick and Rips have published an example of a longer, extended ELS, which reads, \\"Destruction I will call you; cursed is Bin Laden and revenge is to the Messiah\\"Haralick, Rips, and Glazerson. 2005. Torah Codes: A Glimpse into the Infinite. New York: Mazal & Bracha. 125 (though the Hebrew, using appositives in place of to be, lacking helper verbs, and employing definite articles less frequently, would entail far fewer words than the English phrasing). ELS extensions that form phrases or sentences are of interest. Proponents maintain that the longer the extended ELS, the less likely it is to be the result of chance.Sherman, R. Edwin, with Jacobi and Swaney. 2005. Bible Code Bombshell Green Forest, Ar.: New Leaf Press. 95‚Äì109 Critics reply, as in the Skeptical Inquirer deconstruction of 1997, that the longer ELS is in fact effectively nothing more than further increased number of permutations, employing a massive application of the Look-elsewhere effect. History =Early history= Jewish culture has a long tradition of interpretation, annotation, and commentary regarding the Bible, leading to both exegesis and eisegesis (drawing meaning from and imposing meaning on the texts). The Bible code can be viewed as a part of this tradition, albeit one of the more controversial parts. Throughout history, many Jewish, and later Christian, scholars have attempted to find hidden or coded messages within the Bible's text, notably including Isaac Newton. The 13th-century Spanish rabbi Bachya ben Asher may have been the first to describe an ELS in the Bible. His four-letter example related to the traditional zero-point of the Hebrew calendar. Over the following centuries there are some hints that the ELS technique was known, but few definite examples have been found from before the middle of the 20th century. At this point many examples were found by Michael Ber Weissmandl and published by his students after his death in 1957. Nevertheless, the practice remained known to only a few until the early 1980s, when some discoveries of Israeli school teacher Avraham Oren came to the attention of the mathematician Eliyahu Rips at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Rips then took up the study together with his religious studies partners Doron Witztum and Alexander Rotenberg, among several others. =Rips and Witztum= Rips and Witztum designed computer software for the ELS technique and subsequently found many examples. About 1985, they decided to carry out a formal test, and the \\"Great rabbis experiment\\" was born. This experiment tested the hypothesis that ELS's of the names of famous rabbinic personalities and their respective birth and death dates form a more compact arrangement than could be explained by chance. Their definition of \\"compact\\" was complex but, roughly, two ELSs were compactly arranged if they can be displayed together in a small window. When Rips et al. carried out the experiment, the data was measured and found to be statistically significant, supporting their hypothesis. The \\"great rabbis experiment\\" went through several iterations, and was eventually published in 1994, in the peer-reviewed journal Statistical Science. The editorial board was highly skeptical due to the fact that computers can be used to ‚Äúmine‚Äù data for patterns that intuitively seem surprising, but upon careful analysis are found not be statistically significant. While they did find a number of possible sources of error, they were unable to find anyone willing to put in the substantial time and energy required to properly reanalyze all data. However, they did find it intriguing, and therefore decided to offer it as a \\"challenging puzzle‚Äù for anyone interested in doing so. An unintended result of this was that outsiders mistook this as a confirmation of the papers claims. =Other experiments= Another experiment, in which the names of the famous rabbis were matched against the places of their births and deaths (rather than the dates), was conducted in 1997 by Harold Gans, former Senior Cryptologic Mathematician for the United States National Security Agency. Again, the results were interpreted as being meaningful and thus suggestive of a more than chance result. These Bible codes became known to the public primarily due to the American journalist Michael Drosnin, whose book The Bible Code (Simon & Schuster, 1997) was a best-seller in many countries. Rips issued a public statement that he did not support Drosnin's work or conclusions; even Gans has said that although the book says the codes in the Torah can be used to predict future events: \\"This is absolutely unfounded. There is no scientific or mathematical basis for such a statement, and the reasoning used to come to such a conclusion in the book is logically flawed.\\" In 2002, Drosnin published a second book on the same subject, called Bible Code II: the Countdown. The Jewish outreach group Aish-HaTorah employs Bible codes in their Discovery Seminars to persuade secular Jews of the divinity of the Torah, and to encourage them to trust in traditional Orthodox teachings. Use of Bible code techniques also spread into certain Christian circles, especially in the United States. The main early proponents were Yakov Rambsel, who is a Messianic Jew, and Grant Jeffrey. Another Bible code technique was developed in 1997 by Dean Coombs (also Christian). Various pictograms are claimed to be formed by words and sentences using ELS. Since 2000, physicist Nathan Jacobi, an agnostic Jew, and engineer Moshe Aharon Shak, an orthodox Jew, claim to have discovered hundreds of examples of lengthy, extended ELSs. The number of extended ELSs at various lengths is compared with those expected from a non- encoded text, as determined by a formula from Markov chain theory.Sherman, R. Edwin, with Jacobi and Swaney. 2005. Bible Code Bombshell Green Forest, Ar.: New Leaf Press. 281‚Äì286 Criticism The precise order of consonantal letters represented in the Hebrew Masoretic Text is not consistent across manuscripts in any period. It is known from earlier versions, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, that the number of letters was not constant even in the first centuries CE. The Bible code theory thus does not seem to account for these variations.J. Scott Duvall, J. Daniel Hays, 2012, Grasping God's Word: A Hands-On Approach to Reading, Interpreting, and Applying the Bible, p. 337. \\"The scholarly rebuttals to Bible codes have been devastating. These rebuttals have provided strong evidence that there is nothing mystical or divine about ELS. The arguments leveled against this method of finding secret messages fall into two basic categories: that relating to probability, and that relating to textual variations... Textual variations: Another flaw in the ELS approach is that its proponents seem unaware of variations in the text of the Old Testament...\\" The primary objection advanced against Bible codes is that information theory does not prohibit \\"noise\\" from appearing to be sometimes meaningful. Thus, if data chosen for ELS experiments are intentionally or unintentionally \\"cooked\\" before the experiment is defined, similar patterns can be found in texts other than the Torah. Although the probability of an ELS in a random place being a meaningful word is small, there are so many possible starting points and skip patterns that many such words can be expected to appear, depending on the details chosen for the experiment, and it is possible to \\"tune\\" an ELS experiment to achieve a result which appears to exhibit patterns that overcome the level of noise. Others have criticized Drosnin by saying his example of \\"Clinton\\" in his first book violated the basic Bible code concept of \\"minimality\\"; Drosnin's \\"Clinton\\" was a completely invalid \\"code\\". In addition, McKay claimed that Drosnin had used the flexibility of Hebrew orthography to his advantage, freely mixing classic (no vowels, Y and W strictly consonant) and modern (Y and W used to indicate i and u vowels) modes, as well as variances in spelling of K and T, to reach the desired meaning. =Criticism of the original paper= In 1999, Australian mathematician Brendan McKay, Israeli mathematicians Dror Bar-Natan and Gil Kalai, and Israeli psychologist Maya Bar-Hillel (collectively known as \\"MBBK\\") published a paper in Statistical Science, in which they argued that the case of Witztum, Rips and Rosenberg (WRR) was \\"fatally defective, and that their result merely reflects on the choices made in designing their experiment and collecting the data for it.\\" The MBBK paper was reviewed anonymously by four professional statisticians prior to publication. In the introduction to the paper, Robert Kass, the Editor of the Journal who previously had described the WRR paper as a \\"challenging puzzle\\" wrote that \\"considering the work of McKay, Bar-Natan, Kalai and Bar-Hillel as a whole it indeed appears, as they conclude, that the puzzle has been solved\\". From their observations, MBBK created an alternative hypothesis to explain the \\"puzzle\\" of how the codes were discovered. MBBK's argument was not strictly mathematical, rather it asserted that the WRR authors and contributors had intentionally or unintentionally (a) selected the names and/or dates in advance and (b) designed their experiments to match their selection, thereby achieving their \\"desired\\" result. The MBBK paper argued that the ELS experiment is extraordinarily sensitive to very small changes in the spellings of appellations, and the WRR result \\"merely reflects on the choices made in designing their experiment and collecting the data for it.\\" The MBBK paper demonstrated that this \\"tuning\\", when combined with what MBBK asserted was available \\"wiggle\\" room, was capable of generating a result similar to WRR's Genesis result in a Hebrew translation of War and Peace. Bar-Hillel subsequently summarized the MBBK view that the WRR paper was a hoax, an intentionally and carefully designed \\"magic trick\\". The Bible codes (together with similar arguments concerning hidden prophecies in the writings of Shakespeare) have been quoted as examples of the Texas sharpshooter fallacy. =Replies to MBBK's criticisms= Harold Gans Harold Gans, a former Cryptanalyst at the National Security Agency, argued that MBBK's hypothesis implies a conspiracy between WRR and their co-contributors to fraudulently tune the appellations in advance. Gans argues that the conspiracy must include Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips, and S. Z. Havlin, because they all say Havlin compiled the appellations independently. Gans argues further that such a conspiracy must include the multiple rabbis who have written a letter confirming the accuracy of Havlin's list. Finally, argues Gans, such a conspiracy must also include the multiple participants of the cities experiment conducted by Gans (which includes Gans himself). Gans concludes that \\"the number of people necessarily involved in [the conspiracy] will stretch the credulity of any reasonable person.\\" Gans further argued that while \\"the mathematical issues are difficult for non-mathematicians to comprehend, I can summarize as follows: Professor McKay and his colleagues never claimed to have discovered real codes in those non-Torah texts. Their only \\"successful\\" results were obtained by deliberately rigging the experiment in such a way that the layman wouldn't recognize the mathematical flaws.\\" Brendan McKay has replied that he and his colleagues have never accused Havlin or Gans of participating in a conspiracy. Instead, says McKay, Havlin likely did what WRR's early preprints said he did: he provided \\"valuable advices\\". Similarly, McKay accepts Gans's statements that Gans did not prepare the data for his cities experiment himself. McKay concludes that \\"there is only ONE person who needs to have been involved in knowing fakery, and a handful of his disciples who must be involved in the cover-up (perhaps with good intent).\\" WRR authors The WRR authors issued a series of responses regarding the claims of MBBK, including the claim that no such tuning did or even could have taken place. An earlier WRR response to a request by MBBK authors presented results from additional experiments that used the specific \\"alternate\\" name and date formats which MBBK suggested had been intentionally avoided by WRR. Using MBBK's alternates, the results WRR returned showed equivalent or better support for the existence of the codes, and so challenged the \\"wiggle room\\" assertion of MBBK. In the wake of the WRR response, author Bar-Natan issued a formal statement of non-response. After a series of exchanges with McKay and Bar-Hillel, WRR author Witztum responded in a new paper claiming that McKay had used smoke screen tactics in creating several straw man arguments, and thereby avoided the points made by WRR authors refuting MBBK. Witztum also claimed that, upon interviewing a key independent expert contracted by McKay for the MBBK paper, some experiments performed for MBBK had validated rather than refuted the original WRR findings. Witzum questioned why MBBK had expunged these results. McKay replied to these claims. No publication in a peer reviewed scientific journal has appeared refuting MBBK's paper. In 2006, seven new Torah Codes papers were published at the 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'06). Robert Aumann Robert Aumann, a game theorist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2005, has followed the Bible code research and controversy for many years. He wrote: After a long and interesting analysis of the experiment and the dynamics of the controversy, stating for example that \\"almost everybody included [in the controversy] made up their mind early in the game\\" Aumann concluded: Robert Haralick Robert Haralick, a Professor of Computer Science at the City University of New York, has checked the Bible Code for many years and became convinced of its validity. He contributed a new experiment : he checked whether besides the minimal ELS, in which it was known that WRR's list was successful in Genesis, and MBBK's list was successful in War and Peace, there are other, non-minimal ELSs where there is convergence between the rabbis' names and their respective dates. In other words, what convergence will be found at 2nd minimal ELSs, 3rd minimal ELSs and so on. According to him the results were impressive: WRR's list was successful until the 20th minimal ELS, whereas MBBK's list failed after the 2nd minimal ELS. Haralick lectured on the subject in front of the participants of the international conference on pattern recognition in 2006. =Criticism of Michael Drosnin= Journalist Drosnin's books have been criticized by some who believe the Bible code is real but that it cannot predict the future. On Drosnin's claim of Rabin's death, Drosnin wrote in his book \\"The Bible Code\\" (published in 1997) on page 120; \\"Yigal Amir could not be found in advance\\". This is very telling in that dangerous period of Israeli politics from the Oslo Accords of 1993 to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on November 4, 1995. Critics have noted a huge error in the \\"code\\" Drosnin claimed to have found: Drosnin misused the Biblical verse Deuteronomy 4:42. Scholars note; \\"For example, citing again the passage intersecting with Rabin: that passage is from Deuteronomy 4:42, but Drosnin ignores the words immediately following \\"a murderer who will murder.\\" What comes next is the phrase \\"unwittingly\\" (biveli da'at). This is because the verse deals with the cities of refuge where accidental killers can find asylum. In this case, then, the message would refer to an accidental killing of (or by) Rabin and it would therefore be wrong. Another message (p. 71) supposedly contains a \\"complete\\" description of the terrorist bombing of a bus in Jerusalem on February 25, 1996. It includes the phrase \\"fire, great noise,\\" but overlooks the fact that the letters which make up those two words are actually part of a larger phrase from Genesis 35:4 which says: \\"under the terebinth that was near Shechem.\\" If the phrase does tell of a bus bombing, why not take it to indicate that it would be in Nablus, the site of ancient Shechem?\\" Drosnin also made a number of claims and alleged predictions that have since failed. Among the most important, Drosnin clearly states in his book \\"The Bible Code II\\", published on December 2, 2002, that there was to be a World War involving an \\"atomic holocaust\\" that would allegedly be the end of the world. Another claim Drosnin makes in \\"The Bible Code II\\" is that the nation of Libya would develop weapons of mass destruction which would then be given to terrorists who would then use them to attack the West (specifically the United States). In reality Libya improved relations with the West in 2003 and gave up all their existing weapons of mass destruction programs. A final claim Drosnin made in \\"The Bible Code II\\" was that Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat would allegedly be assassinated by being shot to death by gunmen which Drosnin specifically stated would be from the Palestinian Hamas movement. This prediction by Drosnin also failed, as Yasser Arafat died on November 11, 2004 of what was later declared to be natural causes (specifically a stroke brought on by an unknown infection). The only conspiracy theories about Yasser Arafat's allegedly being murdered have been made by a few Palestinian figures, and have involved alleged poisoning that was supposed to have been on the orders of Israeli officials. The only alleged Palestinian collaboration in this conspiracy theory involve two leading Palestinian figures from the Palestinian Fatah movement; those are current Palestinian Authority and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas and Mohammed Dahlan the former head of Fatah in Gaza. Writer Randy Ingermanson criticized Drosnin by stating that; \\"And that's all they are, even for Drosnin‚Äìpossibilities. He believes that the future is not fixed, and that the Bible code predicts all possible outcomes. Which makes it not much of a predictive tool, but again, he seems not to mind this very much. If you are laying bets based on Drosnin, you had better be willing to bet on all possible outcomes.\\" Some accuse him of factual errors, claiming that he has much support in the scientific community, mistranslating Hebrew words to make his point more convincing, and using the Bible without proving that other books do not have similar codes. Criticism using ELS in other texts Equidistant letter sequences \\"wiki\\" and \\"Pedia\\" found in the King James Version of Genesis (10:7-14) Responding to an explicit challenge from Drosnin, who claimed that other texts such as Moby- Dick would not yield ELS results comparable to the Torah, McKay created a new experiment that was tuned to find many ELS letter arrays in Moby-Dick that relate to modern events, including the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. He also found a code relating to the Rabin assassination, containing the assassin's first and last name and the university he attended, as well as the motive (\\"Oslo\\", relating to the Oslo accords). Drosnin and others have responded to these claims, saying the tuning tactics employed by McKay were simply \\"nonsense\\", and providing analyses to support their argument that the tables, data and methodologies McKay used to produce the Moby Dick results \\"simply do not qualify as code tables\\". Skeptic Dave Thomas claimed to find other examples in many texts. While Thomas' methodology was alleged to have been rebutted by Robert Haralick and others, his broader arguments about the law of large numbers stood essentially unchallenged. Also, Thomas's criticisms were aimed at Drosnin, whose methodology is considered even worse. (In fact, Drosnin's example of \\"Clinton\\" in his first book violated the basic Bible code concept of \\"Minimality\\"; Drosnin's \\"Clinton\\" was a completely invalid \\"code\\"). In addition, McKay claimed that Drosnin had used the flexibility of Hebrew orthography to his advantage, freely mixing Masoretic biblical (no vowels, Y and W overwhelmingly consonant) and modern (Y and W used to indicate i and u vowels) modes, as well as variances in spelling of K and T, to reach the desired meaning. In his television series John Safran vs God, Australian television personality John Safran and McKay again demonstrated the \\"tuning\\" technique, demonstrating that these techniques could produce \\"evidence\\" of the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York in the lyrics of Vanilla Ice's repertoire. And the influence and consequences of scribal errors (misspellings, additions, deletions, etc.) are hard to account for in claims for a Bible coded message left secretly in the text. McKay and others claim that in the absence of an objective measure of quality and an objective way to select test subjects (though that remains an objection as equally against Drosnin), it is not possible positively to determine whether any particular observation is significant or not. For that reason, outside of Davis' mathematical arguments, much or most of the serious effort of the skeptics has been focused on the scientific claims of Witztum, Rips, and Gans.

Overnight on 22‚Äì23 October 1944, the Allies successfully evacuated a large group of men trapped in German occupied territory who had been in hiding since the Battle of Arnhem. The fighting north of the Rhine in September had forced the 1st British Airborne division to withdraw, leaving several thousand men behind. Several hundred of these were able to evade capture and go into hiding, usually with the assistance of the Dutch Resistance. Initially the men hoped to be able to wait for the British 2nd Army to resume their advance and thus relieve them, but when it became clear that the Allies would not cross the Rhine that year the men decided to escape back to Allied territory. The first escape operation was a great success and over 100 men were able to return to their own lines, but a second operation was compromised and failed. Despite this, the Resistance continued to help the evaders and many more men were able to escape in small groups over the winter. Background =Battle of Arnhem= In September 1944, the Western Allies launched Operation Market Garden, an attempt by the British 2nd Army to bypass the Siegfried Line and advance into the Ruhr, Germany‚Äôs industrial heartland. The operation required the First Allied Airborne Army to seize several bridges over rivers and canals in the Netherlands, allowing ground forces to advance and cross the Lower Rhine at Arnhem. The 1st British Airborne Division dropped onto Arnhem on 17 September. They encountered far greater resistance than had been expected and only a small force were able to reach Arnhem road bridge. XXX Corps ground advance became delayed and without reinforcement this small force under Lt Colonel John Frost was overwhelmed. The rest of the division became trapped in a small perimeter in Oosterbeek and were withdrawn on the night of 25‚Äì26 September in Operation Berlin. =Evaders= The figures of men involved in the battle are imprecise but it is believed well over 10,400 men fought north of the Lower Rhine. In Operation Berlin, between 2,400-2,500 men safely withdrew to the south bank, leaving some 7,900 men behind.Waddy, p166Middlebrook, p439 Of these almost 1,500 were killed, 6,000 were in German hands and up to 500 were in hiding in the woods and villages near the river. Major Digby Tatham-Warter had escaped a German hospital as early as 21 September and, having lain low for a week, he was contacted by the Dutch Resistance, which requested his assistance in Ede.Digby Tatham-Warter In early October he was joined by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury and soon a ‚ÄòBrigade HQ in hiding‚Äô was set up.Waddy, p181 Tatham-Warter made contact with Lieutenant Gilbert Kirschen of the Belgian SAS who arranged supply drops of weapons, uniforms and supplies for the growing number of British hiding in the area. Piet Kruijff, head of the local Resistance, had been organising the evaders into safe houses in Ede. Soon there were over 80 men in the town and it was becoming so congested that he began housing men in Reemst as well. By the time of the evacuation there were an additional 40 men here. At first it was hoped that the Allied offensive would be quickly resumed thus liberating the men - Tatham-Warter even made plans to carry out operations against the Germans when the 2nd Army began crossing the Rhine. However, in October Kirschen informed the Resistance that there were no plans to attack north of the Lower Rhine in the near future. As the presence of so many Allied evaders would place a great strain on the Resistance and expose the civilians hiding them to great risk, it was decided to evacuate the men as soon as possible.Waddy, p180 The 'HQ in hiding' was in contact with 2nd Army‚Äôs escape organisation based in Nijmegen. Lt Colonel David Dobie (commander of 1st Battalion) successfully swam the Rhine on the night of 16 October and reached Allied lines; he made further arrangements. Dobie contacted the XXX Corps and the 101st Airborne Division, which approved of the evacuation. He was also able to make contact with Tatham-Warter by telephone and together they drew up a plan they hoped would allow all of the men in hiding to escape. Dobie suggested a suitable location on the river near Renkum to make the crossing (codenamed Digby). An RV and route to the river from the north were decided upon, and it was arranged that the men would be met on the north bank by Royal Canadian Engineers and British Royal Engineers of XXX Corps escorted by men of the 506 PIR, 101st Airborne Division. To help guide the evaders the crossing point would be marked by tracer fire from a Bofors Gun. The American forces made patrols north of the river and tracer fire was sent over the bank for several nights to disguise the actual purpose of the operation when it came. The date was set for the night of 23‚Äì24 October.Waddy, p184 Operation On 20 October the Germans ordered residents of nearby villages to leave their homes by the 22nd. Deciding to take advantage of the confusion this would cause, the operation was thus brought forward to the night of 22‚Äì23 October. The men were brought together from their various hides to an RV in the woods north of the river. The German presence in this area was very heavy after the Arnhem fighting and the men assembled in a location only 500 metres from German machine gun nests. By dark 139 men had assembled. They were mainly from the 1st Airborne Division, but there were also a US 82nd Airborne Division trooper, a number of aircrew, some Dutch civilians, and some Russians wishing to join the Allies. The men were organised into platoons and at 9pm began moving south towards the river.Waddy, p186 Tatham-Warter recorded that the Germans were almost certainly aware of their presence, but perhaps unsure of their numbers and wary of American patrols they kept some distance. There was one ‚Äòcontact‚Äô with a patrol and a brief exchange of fire, but no one was hurt. At midnight the group reached the riverbank and moved to the crossing point indicated by the Bofors tracer fire. Once there they flashed a V for Victory signal with their torches,Ambrose, p158 but there was an anxious wait of twenty minutes for the boats. In fact, on the south bank, Dobie, the engineers, and a patrol of E Company, 506 PIR observed the signal and immediately launched their boats, but the British were some 500-800m upriver of the crossing point. Upon reaching the north bank E Company established a small perimeter while men headed east to locate the evaders.Ambrose, p159Waddy, p187 The men quickly moved downstream and in the next 90 minutes all of them were evacuated, with the exception of a Russian who was caught and arrested by the Germans.Van der Zee, p 135 The Germans opened fire sporadically and some mortar rounds fell near the crossing, but the fire was inaccurate. Once on the other side the escapees were led to a farmhouse for refreshments, before being driven to Nijmegen where Dobie had arranged a party and champagne.Waddy,p188 The men were later flown back to the UK, rejoining the men who had escaped in Operation Berlin. Operation Pegasus II The success of the first evacuation prompted the Allies to arrange a second attempt. Unfortunately the security of this operation was compromised early, when a reporter impersonated an intelligence officer and interviewed several escapees from the first operation. The subsequent news story alerted the Germans who strengthened their patrols along the river.Middlebrook, p438 Major Hugh Maguire (of HQ, 1st Airborne Division) was put in charge of the second escape The operation largely replicated the original, but was due to take place 4 km further east on the evening of 18 November. A party of between 130 and 160 men would attempt to cross the river on this occasion, although this number included a much higher proportion of civilians, aircrew, and other non-infantry who were unused to this sort of operation.Van der Zee, p136 Because of the distance from Ede to the crossing point and the need to skirt a German 'no man's zone', the main party's march to the river was approximately 23 km (compared to the 5 km of Pegasus I) and would take two days to make.Van der Zee, p137 The main party became fragmented on the second night Van der Zee, p137 and whilst attempting to make a short cut, one party under Major John Coke of the King's Own Scottish Borderers stumbled into a German patrol. Several men were killed in the resulting firefight ‚Äì perhaps more than twentyPitchfork, p114 ‚Äì and the evaders were forced to scatter. No one was able to cross that night, although seven men crossed during the next two days. The Germans searched the area intensively with patrols and spotter planes, enabling them to capture more of the evaders, and most of the Resistance's Dutch guides were killed or captured.Van der Zee, p138 Later escapes Colonel Graeme Warrack and Captain Alexander Lipmann Kessel had been on the abortive Pegasus II, but were able to escape capture. Like many of the remaining evaders, they continued to hide in German occupied territory for some months. In February 1945, they joined Brigadier John Hackett, who by now had recovered well from his injuries sustained at Arnhem.Van der Zee, p140 Kessel had saved Hackett's life during the battle and even performed minor operations during their time in hiding.Van der Zee, p141 They eventually escaped across the Waal at Groot-Ammers, 25 miles west of Arnhem, on a route later used by another 37 men, including Gilbert Kirschen.Van der Zee, p144 Notable escapees Although many men had failed to return after the Battle of Arnhem, many were able to escape in Operation Pegasus or with the aid of the Resistance over the winter. They included senior ranks: * Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, CO 1st Parachute Brigade (Operation Pegasus). * Brigadier John Hackett, CO 4th Parachute Brigade (February 1945). * Colonel Graeme Warrack, Senior medical officer, 1 Airborne Division (February 1945). * Lieutenant Colonel David Dobie, CO 1 Battalion, Parachute Regiment (in advance of Operation Pegasus). * Lieutenant Colonel Martin Herford, 163 RAMC (October 1944). * Major Allison Digby Tatham-Warter, OC A Company, 2 Battalion, Parachute Regiment (Operation Pegasus). * Major Anthony Deane-Drummond, 2IC Divisional Signals (Operation Pegasus). * Major Tony Hibbert, Brigade Major 1st Parachute Brigade (Operation Pegasus). * Captain Alexander Lipmann Kessel, 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance (February 1945).

Young The Whisperer was an American old-time radio program which broadcast 13 episodes on late Sunday afternoons [5:00 p.m. Eastern] as a summer replacement from July 8 to September 30, 1951 on NBC. It was based on stories by Dr. Stetson Humphrey (in collaboration with his wife, Irene). The tone of the show was often tongue-in-cheek, and satirized the radio crime dramas of the day. Plot Lawyer Philip Gault (Carleton G. Young), due to a college football injury, lost his voice and can only speak in an eerie whisper. Gault infiltrates \\"the syndicate\\" in his native Central City to bring down organized crime from within; to the underworld, he becomes known as the Whisperer. Later, his voice is restored through surgery, but he continues to lead a double life as the Whisperer, relaying instructions by telephone from the syndicate bosses in New York (who don't know he's a mole) to their lackeys in Central City, whom Gault is actually setting up. In the prologue to the final episode from September 30, 1951 titled \\"Strange Bed Fellows\\", Philip Gault explains his history as follows: \\"It all began ten years ago when I was kicked in the throat while playing college football. After the bandages were removed I opened my mouth to speak and all that came out was this rattling hiss. After a bakers dozen of women fainted when I spoke to them and countless babies went into paraclisms of crying, I disappeared from my usual haunts and went to work for a group which I later discovered were known as the crime syndicate. I decided to stay with them and collect sufficient evidence to help destroy them. Then one day I met Dr. Lee and through a miracle of surgery he restored my voice enabling me to resume my real identity as Philip Gault, Lawyer. This dual identity makes life very interesting. For if the syndicate ever finds out that the Whisperer, who passes on their orders, is really Philip Gault, the man who has wrecked so many of their plans, there'll be slow walking and low moaning. But I won't be around to comment on it.\\" Betty Moran portrayed Gault's girlfriend, Ellen Norris, the only person who knows Gault's double identity, other than Dr. Lee. Paul Frees occasionally appeared as Gault's \\"friend on the force\\", Lt. Charles Denvers. William Conrad frequently appeared in different supporting roles under his alias, \\"Julius Krelboyne\\", as he was under exclusive contract to CBS radio at the time. Bill Karn was the producer-director (and occasional writer), and organist Johnny Duffy supplied the background music. The radio actor Carleton G. Young is sometimes confused with the film actor Carleton Scott Young.

They were associated with the late 1970s New York no wave scene, and were featured on the 1978 compilation No New York. History DNA originally consisted of Lindsay, Crutchfield, Gordon Stevenson and Mirielle Cervenka, and took their name from a song by another no wave band, Mars.Masters, p. 38 Stevenson went on to play bass for Teenage Jesus and the Jerks; Cervenka was the younger sister of Exene Cervenka of X. Terry Ork, head of Ork Records, booked the band at Max's Kansas City for its first show. Cervenka and Stevenson left after hearing this. Lindsay and Crutchfield hastily recruited Ikue Mori‚Äîwho at the time had little command of English and no musical experience‚Äîto be DNA's drummer.Moore and Coley, p. 31 This lineup of DNA played occasionally at CBGB and Max's Kansas City and recorded one 7\\" single. Within their first year, they had cemented their reputation as a paradigmatic no wave band when Brian Eno selected them as one of the four groups documented on the No New York LP, the first recording to expose no wave groups to an audience outside of lower Manhattan. The other three bands appearing on this album were The Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, and Mars.Masters, p. 40 Shortly after the recording of No New York, Crutchfield left DNA to form a new band, Dark Day. He was replaced by Tim Wright, previously of the Cleveland band Pere Ubu. As Wright played bass guitar and not keyboards, and was the only member of the band to have any conventional instrumental technique, the change in DNA's sound was dramatic. The music became even more spare and angular, with Wright's bass lines creating a sometimes menacing sound to support Lindsay's scraping, atonal guitar and Mori's irregular rhythms. Their song structures became tighter, briefer, more abstract, and have been compared to haiku. The Lindsay-Mori-Wright lineup of DNA developed something of a cult following between 1979 and 1982, but perhaps more of their fans came from the art world than from rock audiences. Live shows were frequent in this period, but rarely outside of the CBGB/Mudd Club/Tier 3 circuit in lower Manhattan. The group's 10-minute debut album, A Taste of DNA was recorded for Kip Hanrahan's American Clav√© label, and was later released on Rough Trade in 1980. Some live DNA tracks appeared on compilation albums while the band was still in existence. Lindsay, Mori, and Wright decided to dissolve the band in 1982. It's a measure of the cult following the band had developed that its final concerts were three consecutive sold-out nights at CBGB. DNA's final encore was a cover of Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love. This is not included on the CD Last Live at CBGB, released more than a decade later, on John Zorn's Avant label. Lindsay and Mori, and to a lesser extent Crutchfield, have remained active in music. DNA on DNA, a comprehensive CD chronicle of the band, was released by No More Records in 2004.

Born in London, he was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, and in 1722 became a partner in his father's business. In 1729 he was appointed printer of the votes of the British House of Commons, and in 1736 printer to the Society of Antiquaries, of which he was elected a fellow in 1737. He was also appointed printer to the Society for the Encouragement of Learning. On the death of his father in 1737 he became the sole owner of the Bowyer press.

Bowyer was also a close collaborator with the prominent London bookseller Andrew Millar.Millar (1766) In 1761 Bowyer became printer to the Royal Society, and in 1767 printer of the rolls of the House of Lords and the journals of the House of Commons. Also in 1767 he moved from Whitefriars to a larger house in Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street. He died leaving unfinished a number of large works and among them the reprint of Domesday Book. He wrote a great many tracts and pamphlets, edited, arranged and published a host of books, but perhaps his principal work was an edition of the New Testament in Greek, with notes. He also edited the Greek-Latin Lexicon of Schrevelius.

They were one of the early emo bands in the Midwest Emo scene and helped establish the genre. In 1994, the band released their debut album Diary on Sub Pop Records to critical acclaim. However, shortly after recording their second album LP2, the band broke up, with members Nate Mendel and William Goldsmith joining Foo Fighters and Jeremy Enigk embarking on a solo career. In 1997, they regrouped long enough to record two more studio albums and a live album but ultimately disbanded once again in 2001. The band reunited again in 2009. Bassist Nate Mendel, who chose to remain with Foo Fighters during the previous reunion in 1997, took part in this reunion. In a 2013 interview with MusicRadar, Mendel said Sunny Day Real Estate was inactive. According to Mendel, the band attempted to record a full-length album after the end of their reunion tour, but the sessions \\"just fell apart\\". In 2014 the band released one song from those sessions, \\"Lipton Witch,\\" on a split 7\\" vinyl with Circa Survive on Record Store Day. History =Early years= In 1992, guitarist Dan Hoerner and bassist Nate Mendel met when they became housemates at the University of Washington. After jam sessions, they decided to form a band and sought a drummer, eventually deciding to invite William Goldsmith.Grubbs (2008), p. 72 Goldsmith played in many bands but decided to join the duo's project. They released a demo tape under the name \\"Empty Set\\". Post-release, the band changed their name from Empty Set to Chewbacca Kaboom, upon realization that a band with the name Empty Set already existed. However, when another demo tape was released, the new name earned them little attention, and it was yet again subject to change, this time to 'One Day I Stopped Breathing'. The band eventually settled on the name Sunny Day Real Estate. Mendel stated the band's name \\"was just a random thought that popped into my head that came from a Talking Heads song, '(Nothing But) Flowers'\\". He felt that since the band's outlook on the world saw that every possible thing was becoming a commodity to be bought and sold, it was possible that one day, people would even start selling sunny days. The lyrics made him ponder about what could be sold as property, and come up with the commercialization of sunny days.Grubbs (2008), pp.74-76 The newly baptized band started as an instrumental piece, but decided to add a singer. After testing with a female vocalist, Hoerner decided to start singing. The band recorded a self-released two-song 7\\" single called Flatland Spider. Afterwards Mendel took a break to tour with another band, Christ on a Crutch. Goldsmith called his high school friend Jeremy Enigk to play along with them in a new project, Thief, Steal Me a Peach, where Hoerner played bass and Enigk became the guitarist. Despite Mendel having some objections, Enigk became a full-time member, and before long, Enigk ascended to become the permanent frontman of the band. Where Hoerner's vocal style had been in the rougher, hardcore vein, Enigk's vocals were higher-pitched. The musicians also decided to add slower tempos and more groove to their songs. The band's new style went on to shape what music fans and journalists alike consider the \\"indie-emo sound.\\" Emotional hardcore being a style initiated in the late 1980s saw a divergence in sound with bands like Sunny Day Real Estate who strayed away from the hardcore tendencies of original emotional hardcore or emo while keeping some of the intensity and stylistic motifs. =Diary, self-titled and break-up= The band's debut album, Diary, released by indie label Sub Pop in 1994, was greeted with numerous positive reviews. That September, the band performed lead single \\"Seven\\" on an episode of The Jon Stewart Show. A few days later, they taped several songs for MTV's 120 Minutes. Through November and December, the band undertook a US tour with Shudder to Think and Soul Coughing in support of the album. The band projected an enigmatic presence to the public. While supporting Diary, the band allowed only one publicity photo and granted just a single interview (though, strangely, the band posed for an advertisement for department-store chain Nordstrom). In a 1998 interview with Norm Arenas of Texas Is the Reason,Arenas, Norm. \\"The Healing Process\\". Alternative Press. November 1998. Hoerner explained that the band made up a fake band name and brought in a fake lead singer for the ad shoot, only to have the store stick their real band name on the ad. For most of its early days, the band also refused to play a show in California, for reasons that were never fully explained. When the band was asked to perform at the 1994 Almost Acoustic Christmas in Los Angeles for radio station KROQ, Hoerner refused to join them, leaving Enigk, Mendel, and Goldsmith to perform the show as a trio. After finishing their 1994 US tour, the band regrouped to begin recording the follow-up to Diary. While the events surrounding the sessions have not been publicly discussed, the band was clearly enduring internal conflict. Rumors abounded that the root cause was Enigk's sudden conversion to Christianity. In early 1995, the band announced that it was disbanding.Roberts, Michael. \\"Bring Back that Sunny Day.\\" Miami New Times. December 3, 1998. There was much talk but little really known about the reasons for the break-up. While many fans focused on Enigk being a reborn Christian, Enigk and other band members later downplayed that aspect. In a letter addressed \\"To Seth and other readers\\", Enigk responded to rumors regarding his faith. Dismissing the connection between his conversion and their break-up, Enigk wrote, \\"I took a shot on calling upon God. He answered me. My pain was gone. I was full of joy. I had hope again. I must say that the true God is the one who is in the Bible, Jesus Christ,\\" and, \\"I would be a fool to say that He hasn't worked miracles in my life.\\" In November 1995, Sub Pop released the band's second album, bearing only the label Sunny Day Real Estate. The album was released without cover art or liner notes, and was distributed by Sub Pop as LP2. It has also occasionally been referred to as \\"The Pink Album\\", a reference to its solid pink cover. When Sub Pop contacted the band for artwork for the release, the band had nothing to offer, so Goldsmith suggested that they \\"make it pink\\". The album included the songs recorded during the brief sessions, as well as tracks such as \\"Rodeo Jones\\" that were recorded during the sessions for Diary. Enigk confessed in an interview in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; \\"We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren‚Äôt lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted to get it out of the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations\\". After the breakup, Enigk pursued a solo career, releasing his first solo album, Return of the Frog Queen, in 1996. Hoerner moved out to a farm in rural Washington, while Mendel and Goldsmith joined Foo Fighters, the band which Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl had formed following the death of Kurt Cobain. In 1997, following a dispute with Grohl during the sessions for the second Foo Fighters record, Goldsmith departed the band, but Mendel remained. =Reformation, How It Feels to Be Something On, The Rising Tide and second break-up= In 1997, Sub Pop began pressing Enigk and Hoerner about the possibility of releasing a rarities record of Sunny Day Real Estate material, including the band's early 7-inch releases and otherwise unreleased songs, such as the band's unused contribution to The Crow: City of Angels soundtrack. Given that the album with only this material would have been rather short, the band decided to regroup to record a few new songs. While working on the songs, the quartet realized that whatever had driven them apart was behind them, and decided to continue working on new material, eventually signaling to Sub Pop that they wanted to release a full new album. Initially, Mendel intended to quit the Foo Fighters to rejoin Sunny Day full-time, but hedged for several months on actually quitting. Just before starting the recording sessions for the album, Mendel turned down the opportunity, noting that he did not want to leave what he had with the Foo Fighters for a potentially tenuous reunion.Crain, Zac. \\"Brightness Falls \\". Dallas Observer. November 12, 1998. In September 1998, the band released How It Feels to Be Something On. For the album, the remaining trio replaced Mendel with Jeff Palmer, formerly of the Mommyheads. Palmer left the band after a short time, and he was replaced by Joe Skyward. The title track and \\"Every Shining Time You Arrive\\" were intended for Enigk's second solo album, but later became Sunny Day Real Estate songs. On the album, Hoerner took the opportunity to write about his environmental concerns in \\"100 Million\\". While supporting the album, Sub Pop approached them about the possibility of filming the band for a live release. Two shows were documented, one on video and one on audio, in the form of Live. In the weeks after their release, the band noted their displeasure with the video and CD, complaining that Sub Pop did not allow them final approval on the artwork or on the final mixes. Having fulfilled their contractual obligations, the band left the label. The search for a new label was a long and difficult process. Several major labels were eager to sign the band, but the band members felt uncomfortable with signing to a major label. The situation resulted in the departure of long-time manager Greg Williamson. Finally, the band signed with Time Bomb Recordings, an independent label distributed by BMG. With Time Bomb, the band hoped to have the freedom of an indie label backed by the wider distribution of a major label. The band joined with long-time H√ºsker D√º sound engineer Lou Giordano to record The Rising Tide, released in June 2000. The band had high expectations for the release, and subsequently undertook a lengthy US tour. At the end of the tour, the band expressed its desire to finally reach out to its European fans by undertaking its first overseas tour. However, on the eve of the tour, Time Bomb pulled its tour funding, claiming that they simply could not afford to support the band overseas. It turned out that the label had invested a substantial amount of money in supporting Peter Searcy's Could You Please and Thank You, and the album had performed so poorly that the label was almost completely bankrupt. Not only could they not support Sunny Day Real Estate overseas, they could no longer fund the band at all. Some weeks later, the label ceased operations. Disillusioned and disappointed, the band retreated home, and subsequently announced their disbanding. =Post- Sunny Day Real Estate= After their second disbanding, Hoerner again retreated to his farm in Washington, eventually working with Chris Carrabba on tracks for Dashboard Confessional. In 2001, Enigk and Goldsmith reunited with Mendel to form a new band, called The Fire Theft, releasing their first self- titled album in 2003. While they had the option of retaining the Sunny Day Real Estate name, the trio decided that it was time to leave the past behind them and start fresh. Mendel remained with the Foo Fighters, joining The Fire Theft when his schedule allowed it. In 2006, Enigk reignited his solo career by recording and releasing the LP World Waits on his own label, Lewis Hollow Records. Following the October 17 release, Enigk embarked upon a supporting solo tour of the U.S. using material from his 2006 release, as well as his decade-prior solo album, Return of the Frog Queen. After some speculation in 2006 and 2008, in April 2009, several web sites reported that the band had reunited with all original members. The reunion was confirmed in June 2009, by Seattle radio DJ Andrew Harms from 107.7 The End. The band toured the United States and Canada on September and October 2009, and Australia in February 2010 as part of the Soundwave Festival. The band's first show was a surprise secret show on September 16, 2009 at Hell's Kitchen in Tacoma, Washington. To coincide with the new tour, the band's first two albums were remastered and reissued with bonus tracks and newly written liner notes. For their 2009 reunion tour, the band frequently played a newly written song called \\"10\\". On September 29, 2009, the band performed the song \\"Seven\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. The band also performed at the 2010 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and went on to play their first ever European gig on May 29 at Barcelona's Primavera Sound. After that, they played at the HMV Forum in London for their debut UK gig on May 31. They were also scheduled to play at the punk festival Groezrock in Belgium as part of a European tour, but had to cancel their date due to the volcanic ash situation. As of 2009, the band had been making statements from the stage implying that new recorded material might have been on the way. In early 2010, Dan Hoerner confirmed in an interview with Australian music website FasterLouder that the band were writing a new album, but as of 2013, no new material or tour dates have been announced, and Mendel has returned to recording and touring with Foo Fighters. In a 2013 interview with MusicRadar, Mendel stated that Sunny Day Real Estate is currently inactive. According to Mendel, the band attempted to record a new full length after the end of their reunion tour, but the sessions \\"just fell apart.\\" In 2014, the band released a split 7\\" vinyl with Circa Survive on Record Store Day. The band's only song from the 7\\", \\"Lipton Witch,\\" is their first new material released in 14 years. In December 2018, William Goldsmith claimed on his Facebook page that the unfinished fifth Sunny Day Real Estate album remained \\"silenced, abandoned and buried within the murkiest depths of David Grohl's sock drawer.\\" He would later clarify that he was referring to the Grohl-owned Studio 606 where the album sessions took place and were abandoned due to Jeremy Enigk not receiving \\"the moral support as well as engineering that he deserved.\\" Goldsmith also claimed that Grohl disapproved of Nate Mendel's involvement in The Fire Theft, and thus would not be supportive of Mendel completing the new Sunny Day Real Estate LP. Via Foo Fighters' representatives, Mendel denied Goldsmith's initial allegations, to which Goldsmith replied that he had not spoken with Mendel since 2011 after a planned conference call to discuss finishing the album did not happen. Musical style and legacy Sunny Day Real Estate has primarily been considered an emo band, as well as an indie rock, alternative rock, post- hardcore, post-punk or post-grunge band. They have also used musical elements of grunge, along with being influenced by bands such as Nirvana, The Smashing Pumpkins, Fugazi, The Nation of Ulysses, The Psychedelic Furs, Yes, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Dinosaur Jr., Embrace, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Rites of Spring, Screaming Trees, Talking Heads, The Flaming Lips, and U2. As of 2008, Diary is the seventh best-selling album released on Sub Pop, having sold more than 231,000 copies.

He is best known as the guitarist and vocalist in Fugazi and Rites of Spring. Career =Rites of Spring and early projects= Picciotto's musical career began in 1984, with the group Rites of Spring. A part of the D.C. post-hardcore scene, Rites of Spring increased the frenetic violence and visceral passion of hardcore while simultaneously experimenting with its compositional rules. Picciotto, as the band's lyricist, as well as singer and guitarist, shifted hardcore into intensely personal realms and, in doing so, is generally credited with creating emo. Picciotto's early musical resume includes the bands One Last Wish (1986), Happy Go Licky (1987‚Äì1988), Brief Weeds (EPs released circa 1991‚Äì1992), and The Black Light Panthers (ongoing sporadic project since 1982), the last two bands both being projects with Brendan Canty. He created a record label called Peterbilt Records, which released limited-quantity vinyl record albums for the bands Rain, Happy Go Licky, and Deadline, then years later was involved in releasing the album 1986 by One Last Wish, along with Dischord Records. =Fugazi= Though not in the original lineup of Fugazi, Picciotto joined very early in the group's career, singing with them by their second show and appearing on all the band's studio recordings. From the Margin Walker EP on, he took up 2nd guitar duties, playing characteristically trebly Rickenbacker guitars. After seven albums (13 Songs, Repeater, Steady Diet of Nothing, In on the Kill Taker, Red Medicine, End Hits, The Argument), and several tours, Fugazi went on \\"indefinite hiatus\\" in 2003. =Side projects and production work= Picciotto has collaborated and performed with Mats Gustafsson, Vic Chesnutt, and members of the Ex among others. He has produced numerous albums including the Gossip's breakthrough record Standing in the Way of Control as well as Blonde Redhead's Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons (2000), Misery Is a Butterfly (2004), The Blood Brothers final album, Young Machetes, and Downtown Boys' Cost of Living (2017). Picciotto has produced four albums by the duo Xylouris White: Goats (2014), Black Peak (2016), Mother (2018) and The Sisypheans (2019) Picciotto played on the Vic Chesnutt albums North Star Deserter (2007) and At the Cut (2009), and accompanied him on a 2009 Fall/Winter North American Tour. He co- produced the films Chain and Museum Hours with Jem Cohen (who made the Fugazi film Instrument). In 2012 Picciotto was interviewed on stage at the Pop Montreal festival by Howard Bilerman about his experiences in the music industry.\\"Guy Picciotto in Conversation with Howard Bilerman Quartiers Pop, Montreal, QC, September 19\\". Exclaim!, By Ralph Elawani, Sep 20, 2012. On Jan 24th, 2020 Guy appeared on an episode of Live From the Barrage for a wide- ranging discussion that was his first long form interview in quite some time. Equipment Piccioto holding his guitar immediately before performing with Vic Chesnutt in 2009 = Guitars = * Rickenbacker 330 ‚Äì Picciotto's main guitars are a sunburst Rickenbacker 330 and 2 identical black Rickenbacker 330's all equipped with RIC HB1 humbuckers. He has occasionally been seen playing a natural-finish 330. The characteristically trebly Rickenbackers allowed Picciotto to make use of sonic space not taken by MacKaye's chunkier, rhythmic guitar playing in Fugazi. * Rickenbacker 370 ‚Äì Picciotto's main guitar when he fronted Rites of Spring, One Last Wish and in the first few years with Fugazi was a Mapleglo Rickenbacker 370. It eventually ended up in a state too fragile for live use, but he still used it in the studio right up to The Argument. *Gibson Les Paul Jr. ‚Äì During Picciotto's time with Rites of Spring and during the early days of Fugazi (photos show until at least as late as 1993) he could also be seen playing a white, Gibson Les Paul Doublecut Jr with a single P90 pickup. In an NPR interview done in 2011, Picciotto is quoted as having had a Gibson SG Jr. stolen in NYC. The NPR article may be incorrect about it being an SG and it was likely the same Les Paul JR guitar. = Amplification = *Park 100 Watt heads *Marshall JCM 800 2203 heads *Red or Black Marshall JCM 800 4x12 cabinets fitted with 75-watt celestion speakers * Fender Twin reverb (studio) Personal life Picciotto holds a BA degree in English from Georgetown University and is a graduate of the Washington, D.C. private school, the Georgetown Day School.

But Samuel is very inaccurate in such matters; his diary misdates important happenings in his own life; and [his other son] Simeon's statement is too precise to be disregarded.\\" Mozley, 12. an English historian and martyrologist, was the author of Actes and Monuments (otherwise Foxe's Book of Martyrs), telling of Christian martyrs throughout Western history, but particularly the sufferings of English Protestants and proto-Protestants from the 14th century and in the reign of Mary I. Widely owned and read by English Puritans, the book helped to mould British opinion about the Catholic Church for several centuries.William Haller, Foxe's First Book of Martyrs and the Elect Nation (London: Jonathan Cape, 1963) argues that Actes and Monuments is a complex book, portraying the English church as a body of elect whose history of suffering and dedication to the faith echo the history of Israel in the Old Testament. Education Foxe was born in Boston, in Lincolnshire, England, of a middlingly prominent familyIn 1551, one Henry Foxe, a merchant and possible relative, became mayor of that town. and seems to have been an unusually studious and devout child.J. F. Mozley, John Foxe and His Book (New York: Macmillan Company, 1940), p. 13. After work when boys went out to play, \\"John would stay behind; and when search was made, he was found in church (sacro) at his prayers or deep in a book.\\" In about 1534, when he was about 16, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was the pupil of John Hawarden (or Harding), a fellow of the college.Hawarden was perhaps a family friend; he had become rector of Coningsby in 1533, and Foxe's mother, her husband having died when Foxe was young, had married Richard Melton, a yeoman of Coningsby. Three decades later Foxe made a dedication to Hawarden in one of his books, thanking Hawarden for enabling his education. At Brasenose College, Foxe shared rooms with Alexander Nowell, afterwards dean of St Paul's Cathedral. In 1535 Foxe was admitted to Magdalen College School, where he may either have been improving his Latin or acting as a junior instructor. He became a probationer fellow in July 1538 and a full fellow the following July. Foxe took his bachelor's degree on 17 July 1537, his master's degree in July 1543, and was lecturer in logic in 1539‚Äì1540.Foxe wrote several Latin plays on biblical subjects, of which the best, De Christo triumphante or Christus triumphans, an allegorical verse drama on the history of the church, was printed in London in 1551 and by Oporinus in Basel in March 1556. It was performed at Cambridge and probably Oxford in the 1560s. The play was translated into French in 1562 and English in 1579. The latter translation was produced by Richard Day, son of the printer, John Day or Daye, who published Foxe's Actes and Monuments. Foxe's earliest extant literary creation is Titus et Gesippus (written in 1544), a Latin comedy based on Boccaccio. A series of letters in Foxe's handwriting dated to 1544‚Äì45, shows Foxe to be \\"a man of friendly disposition and warm sympathies, deeply religious, an ardent student, zealous in making acquaintance with scholars.\\"Mozley, p. 18. By the time he was twenty-five, he had read the Latin and Greek fathers, the schoolmen, the canon law, and had \\"acquired no mean skill in the Hebrew language.\\"Mozley, p. 20. Resignation from Oxford Foxe resigned from his college in 1545 after becoming a Protestant and thereby subscribing to beliefs condemned by the Church of England under Henry VIII.Foxe may have refused to attend mass. Other Protestants of future renown at Magdalen then were Henry Bull, Laurence Humphrey, Thomas Cooper, and Robert Crowley. After a year of \\"obligatory regency\\" (public lecturing), Foxe would have been obliged to take holy orders by Michaelmas 1545, and the primary reason for his resignation was probably his opposition to clerical celibacy, which he described in letters to friends as self-castration.BL, Lansdowne MS. 388, fols. 80v, 117r. Foxe may have been forced from the college in a general purge of its Protestant members although college records state that he resigned of his own accord and \\"ex honesta causa\\".There exists in Foxe's papers a draft of a letter to Owen Oglethorpe, president of Magdalen, in which Foxe protests against the charges of irreverence and of belonging to a new religion, which were brought against him by some of the college's masters, who are not named by Foxe (BL, Lansdowne MS 388, folios 53r‚Äì58r). Foxe says these masters persecuted other fellows, including Thomas Cooper, later Bishop of Lincoln and Winchester under Elizabeth, and Robert Crowley, a lifelong friend and associate of Foxe, who also left the college at that time. Foxe's letter is printed in Pratt's edition (vol. i. Appendix, pp. 58‚Äì61); see also J. F. Mozley, John Foxe and His Book (New York: Macmillan Company, 1940). Foxe's change of religious opinion may have temporarily broken his relationship with his stepfather and even have put his life in danger. Foxe personally witnessed the burning of William Cowbridge in September 1538.Mozley, p. 21. After being forced to abandon what might have been a promising academic career, Foxe experienced a period of dire need. Hugh Latimer invited Foxe to live with him, but Foxe eventually became a tutor in the household of Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, near Stratford-on-Avon. Before leaving the Lucys, Foxe married Agnes Randall on 3 February 1547.Thomas S. Freeman, \\"Foxe, John,\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). The reasons for Foxe's departure from the Lucys are unknown. According to a short remembrance written by Simeon Foxe in 1611 and appended to the 1641 Actes and Monuments, Foxe stayed with the Randalls in Coventry before returning to his parents in Coningsby. They had six children.John H. King, ed., Foxe's Book of Martyrs: Select Narratives (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. xvii. London under Edward VI Foxe's prospects, and those of the Protestant cause generally, improved after the accession of Edward VI in January 1547 and the formation of a Privy Council dominated by pro-reform Protestants. In the middle of or at the end of 1547, Foxe moved to London and probably lived in Stepney. There he completed three translations of Protestant sermons published by the \\"stout Protestant\\" Hugh Singleton.One sermon was by Martin Luther ESTC 16983 and another by Urbannus Regius: An Instruction of the Christian Faith (ESTC 120847). During this period Foxe also found a patron in Mary Fitzroy, Duchess of Richmond, who hired him as tutor to the orphan children of her brother, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, a Catholic who had been executed for treason in January 1547.Surrey's father, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk was then imprisoned in the Tower of London. (The children were Thomas, who would become the fourth duke of Norfolk and a valuable friend of Foxe; Jane, later Countess of Westmorland; Henry, later earl of Northampton; and their cousin Charles, who would later command the English fleet against the Spanish Armada.) Foxe lived in the Duchess's London household at Mountjoy House and later at Reigate Castle, and her patronage \\"facilitated Foxe's entry into the ranks of England's Protestant elite.\\" During his stay at Reigate, Foxe helped suppress a cult that had arisen around the shrine of the Virgin Mary at Ouldsworth, which had been credited with miraculous healing powers.Freeman, brief on-line biography of Foxe. Foxe was ordained deacon by Nicholas Ridley on 24 June 1550. His circle of friends, associates, and supporters came to include John Hooper, William Turner, John Rogers, William Cecil, and most importantly John Bale, who was to become a close friend and \\"certainly encouraged, very probably guided, Foxe in the composition of his first martyrology.\\" From 1548 to 1551, Foxe brought out one tract opposing the death penalty for adultery and another supporting ecclesiastical excommunication of those who he thought \\"veiled ambition under the cloak of Protestantism.\\" He also worked unsuccessfully to prevent two burnings for religion that occurred during the reign of Edward VI.Mozley, pp. 31‚Äì36. Marian exile On the accession of Mary I in July 1553, Foxe lost his tutorship when the children's grandfather, the Duke of Norfolk was released from prison. Foxe walked warily as befitted one who had published Protestant books in his own name. As the political climate worsened, Foxe believed himself personally threatened by Bishop Stephen Gardiner. Just ahead of officers sent to arrest him, he sailed with his pregnant wife from Ipswich to Nieuwpoort.Mozley, p. 41. He then travelled to Antwerp, Rotterdam, Frankfurt and Strasbourg, which he reached by July 1554. In Strasbourg, Foxe published a Latin history of the Christian persecutions, the draft of which he had brought from England and \\"which became the first shadowy draught of his Acts and Monuments.\\"Mozley, p. 42. He had assistance from two clerics of widely differing opinions ‚Äì from Edmund Grindal, who was later, as Archbishop of Canterbury, to maintain his Puritan convictions in opposition to Elizabeth, and from John Aylmer, afterwards one of the most bitter opponents of the Puritan party. Bale too is also thought to have been a critical assistant in the production of this book, which dealt chiefly with figures deemed precursors to the Protestant Reformation: John Wycliffe, Jan Hus, Savonarola and Reginald Pecock. It was printed in Strasbourg by Wendelin Richelius with the title of Commentarii rerum in ecclesia gestarum. In the autumn of 1554, Foxe moved to Frankfurt, where he served as a preacher for the English church ministering to refugees in the city. There he was unwillingly drawn into a bitter theological controversy. One faction favoured the church polity and liturgy of the Book of Common Prayer, while the other advocated the Reformed models promoted by John Calvin's Genevan church. The latter group, led by John Knox, was supported by Foxe; the former was led by Richard Cox. Eventually Knox, who seems to have acted with more magnanimity, was expelled, and in the autumn of 1555, Foxe and about twenty others also left Frankfurt.Mozley, pp. 44‚Äì46. The prayer book faction reported Knox as having written treason against the Emperor, and they also persuaded the city magistrates to enforce the Prayer Book service on the English church. Although Foxe clearly favoured Knox, he was irenic by temperament and expressed his disgust at \\"the violence of the warring factions\\".Mozley, 46. Moving to Basel, Foxe worked with his fellow countrymen John Bale and Lawrence Humphrey at the drudgery of proofreading. (Educated Englishmen were noted for their learning, industry and honesty and \\"would also be the last persons to quarrel with their bread and butter.\\" No knowledge of German or French was required because the English tended to socialise with one another and could communicate with scholars in Latin.)Mozley, pp. 50‚Äì51 and 57. Foxe laboured over the proofreading of Thomas Cranmer's second book on the Eucharist in the printing house of Johann Herbst (or Oporinus), a book he thought \\"crabbed and obscure\\" (Mozley, p. 46) and which proved too controversial to be printed. (Mozley, p. 56) Foxe also served as an assistant to Hieronymus Froben in the production of a Latin edition of St. John Chrysostom's works. Foxe also completed and had printed a religious drama, Christus Triumphans (1556), in Latin verse. Yet despite receiving occasional financial contributions from English merchants on the continent, Foxe seems to have lived very close to the margin and been \\"wretchedly poor.\\"Mozley, p. 51. When Foxe received reports from England about the ongoing religious persecution there, he wrote a pamphlet urging the English nobility to use their influence with the queen to halt it. Foxe feared that the appeal would be useless, and his fears proved correct.The pamphlet, Ad inclytos ad praepotentes Angliae proceres... supplicatio (1557) was issued from the press of Oporinus. When Knox attacked Mary Stuart in his now famous The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, Foxe apparently criticized Knox's \\"rude vehemency\\" although their friendship seems to have remained unimpaired.Mozley, p. 58. Return to England A page from the first edition of Actes and Monuments, also known as Foxe's Book of Martyrs, published in 1563. After the death of Mary I in 1558, Foxe was in no hurry to return home, and he waited to see if religious changes instituted by her successor, Elizabeth I, would take root. Foxe was also so poor that he was unable to travel with his family until money was sent to him.Mozley, p. 61. Back in England, he seems to have lived for ten years at Aldgate, London, in the house of his former pupil, Thomas Howard, now Fourth Duke of Norfolk.Mozley, p. 62. Howard retained sincere affection for his tutor and left him a small pension in his will years later when Norfolk was executed for treason. Foxe quickly became associated with John Day the printer and published works of religious controversy while working on a new martyrology that would eventually become the Actes and Monuments. Foxe was ordained a priest by his friend Edmund Grindal, now Bishop of London, but he \\"was something of a puritan, and like many of the exiles, had scruples about wearing the clerical vestments laid down in the queen's injunctions of 1559.\\" Many of his friends eventually conformed, but Foxe was \\"more stubborn or single-minded.\\" Some tried to find him preferments in the new regime, but it \\"was not easy to help a man of so singularly unworldly a nature, who scorned to use his powerful friendships to advance himself.\\"Mozley, p. 63. Actes and Monuments =Latin editions= Foxe began his Book of Martyrs in 1552, during the reign of Edward VI, with the Marian Persecutions still in the future. In 1554, while still in exile, Foxe published in Latin at Strasbourg the first shadow of his great book, emphasising the persecution of the English Lollards during the 15th century. As word of the contemporary English persecution made its way to the continent, Foxe began to collect materials to continue his story to the present. He published the first true Latin edition of his famous book at Basel in August 1559.Mozley, 118‚Äì123.Fox J (1559) Rerum in ecclesia gestarum... pars prima, in qua primum de rebus per Angliam et Scotiam gestis atque in primis de horrenda sub Maria nuper regina persecutione narratio continetur, at google books at 08 August 2018. Or for free download from the Bavarian State Library. Of course, it was difficult to write contemporary English history while living (as he later said) \\"in the far parts of Germany, where few friends, no conference, [and] small information could be had.\\"Mozley, 124. But Foxe who had left England poor and unknown, returned only poor. He had gained \\"a substantial reputation\\" through his Latin work. =First edition= On 20 March 1563, Foxe published the first English edition of the Actes and Monuments from the press of John Day.Day's epitaph reads: \\"He set a Foxe to write how martyrs run/By death to life. Foxe ventured pains and health/To give them light: Daye spent in print his wealth,/And God with gain restored his wealth again,/ And gave to him as he gave to the poor.\\" (Mozley, p. 138) It was a \\"gigantic folio volume\\" of about 1800 pages, about three times the length of the 1559 Latin book.Mozley, p. 129. As is typical for the period, the full title was a paragraph long and is abbreviated by scholars as Acts and Monuments,The full title is \\"Actes and Monuments of these latter and perilous days, touching matters of the Church, wherein are comprehended and described the great persecutions and horrible troubles that have been wrought and practised by the Romish prelates, specially in this realm of England and Scotland, from the year of our Lord 1000 unto the time now present; gathered and collected according to the true copies and writings certificatory, as well of the parties themselves that suffered, as also out of the bishops' registers, which were the doers thereof; by John Foxe.\\" although the book was popularly known then, as it is now, as Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Publication of the book made Foxe instantly famous ‚Äì \\"England's first literary celebrity\\" ‚Äì although because there were then no royalties, Foxe remained as poor as ever although the book sold for more than ten shillings, three weeks' pay for a skilled craftsman.Mozley, p. 130; David Loades, \\"The Early Reception\\" . =Second edition= Actes and Monuments was immediately attacked by Catholics such as Thomas Harding, Thomas Stapleton, and Nicholas Harpsfield.Harpsfield, a former archdeacon of Canterbury under Mary I, wrote under the name of Alan Cope, Dialogi sex, contra summi pontificatus, monasticae vitae, sanctorum, sacrarum imaginum oppugnatores, et pseudomartyres (1566), a thousand-page book, with the sixth dialogue aimed at Foxe. Mozley, p. 139. In the next generation, Robert Parsons, an English Jesuit, also struck at Foxe in A Treatise of Three Conversions of England (1603‚Äì04). Harding, in the spirit of the age, called Actes and Monuments ' \\"that huge dunghill of your stinking martyrs,\\" full of a thousand lies'.Mozley, p. 138. Intending to strengthen his book against his critics, and being flooded by new material brought to light by the publication of the first edition,\\"[P]ersonal testimonies poured in on Foxe without solicitation as people sought to exonerate themselves and accuse or eulogize others.\\" Freeman, ODNB. Foxe put together a second edition in 1570 and where the charges of his critics had been reasonably accurate, Foxe removed the offending passages. Where he could rebut the charges, \\"he mounted a vigorous counter-attack, seeking to crush his opponent under piles of documents.\\"Freeman, ODNB: \\"In short, Foxe reacted to Harpsfield's challenge like the commander of a besieged city, abandoning what could not be defended and fortifying what could. Harpsfield drove Foxe to more intensive and extensive research and made his martyrology a more impressive, although not necessarily more accurate, work of scholarship.\\" Even though he deleted material that had been included in the first edition, the second edition was nearly double the size of the first, \\"two gigantic folio volumes, with 2300 very large pages\\" of double-columned text.Mozley, p. 141. The edition was well received by the English church, and the upper house of the convocation of Canterbury meeting in 1571, ordered that a copy of the Bishop's Bible and \\"that full history entitled Monuments of Martyrs\\" be installed in every cathedral church and that church officials place copies in their houses for the use of servants and visitors. The decision was of certain benefit to Foxe's printer Day because he had taken great financial risks printing such a mammoth work.Mozley, p. 147. =Third and fourth editions= Dual martyrdom by burning, 1558; from a 1641 edition of Foxe. Foxe published a third edition in 1576, but it was virtually a reprint of the second, although printed on inferior paper and in smaller type.Mozley, pp. 148‚Äì49. The fourth edition, published in 1583, the last in Foxe's lifetime, had larger type and better paper and consisted of \\"two volumes of about two thousand folio pages in double columns.\\" Nearly four times the length of the Bible, the fourth edition was \\"the most physically imposing, complicated, and technically demanding English book of its era. It seems safe to say that it is the largest and most complicated book to appear during the first two or three centuries of English printing history.\\"John N. King, Foxe's Book of Martyrs: Select Narratives (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. xli. The title page included the poignant request that the author \\"desireth thee, good reader, to help him with thy prayer.\\"Mozley, pp. 149‚Äì50. =Accuracy= Foxe based his accounts of martyrs before the early modern period on previous writers, including Eusebius, Bede, Matthew Paris, and many others. Foxe's own contribution was his compilation of the English martyrs from the period of the Lollards through the persecution of Mary I. Here Foxe had primary sources of all kinds to draw on: episcopal registers, reports of trials, and the testimony of eyewitnesses, a remarkable range of sources for English historical writing of the period.. Foxe's material is more accurate when he deals with his own period, although it is selectively presented, and the book is not an impartial account. Sometimes Foxe copied documents verbatim; sometimes he adapted them to his own use. Although both he and his contemporary readers were more credulous than most moderns, Foxe presented \\"lifelike and vivid pictures of the manners and feelings of the day, full of details that could never have been invented by a forger.\\"Mozley, 168. Foxe's method of using his sources \\"proclaims the honest man, the sincere seeker after truth.\\"Mozley, 168. \\"What the intent and custom is of the papists to do, I cannot tell: for mine own I will say, although many other vices I have, yet from this one I have always of nature abhorred, wittingly to deceive any man or child, so near as I could, much less the church of God, whom I with all my heart do reverence, and with fear obey.\\" A&M;, 3, p. 393. Foxe often treated his material casually, and any reader \\"must be prepared to meet plenty of small errors and inconsistencies.\\"Mozley, p. 155. Furthermore, Foxe did not hold to later notions of neutrality or objectivity. He made unambiguous side glosses on his text, such as \\"Mark the apish pageants of these popelings\\" and \\"This answer smelleth of forging and crafty packing\\",Mozley, p. 157. as Foxe's age was one of strong language as well as of cruel deeds.Mozley, 158. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica went so far as to accuse Foxe of \\"wilful falsification of evidence.\\"\\"John Foxe\\", 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Nevertheless, Foxe is \\"factually detailed and preserves much firsthand material on the English Reformation unobtainable elsewhere.\\"2009 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. According to J.F. Mozley, Foxe presented \\"lifelike and vivid pictures of the manners and feelings of the day, full of details that could never have been invented by a forger.\\"Mozley, p. 168. Life under Elizabeth I =Salisbury and London= Foxe had dedicated Acts and Monuments to the queen,In the dedication, Foxe compares his work to Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, and Elizabeth to Eusebius' patron, the emperor Constantine. The dedication was dropped after 1563. and on 22 May 1563, he was appointed prebend of Shipton in Salisbury Cathedral, in recognition of his championship of the English church.Mozley, 67. Foxe never visited the cathedral or performed any duties associated with the position except to appoint a vicar, William Masters, a highly educated fellow Protestant and former Marian exile. Foxe's inaction as a canon of the cathedral led him to him being declared contumacious, and he was charged with failing to give a tithe for repairs to the cathedral. Perhaps his poverty made him unwilling to spare the time or money to make visits or contributions. In any case, he retained the position until his death.Mozley, p. 69. By 1565, Foxe had been caught up in the vestments controversy led at that time by his associate Crowley. Foxe's name was on a list of \\"godly preachers which have utterly forsaken Antichrist and all his Romish rags\\" that was presented to Lord Robert Dudley some time between 1561 and 1564.Magdalene College, Cambridge, Pepys Library, \\"Papers of state\\", 2.701. He was also one of the twenty clergymen who on 20 March 1565 petitioned to be allowed to choose not to wear vestments; but unlike many of the others, Foxe did not have a London benefice to lose when Archbishop Parker enforced conformity. Rather, when Crowley lost his position at St Giles-without-Cripplegate, Foxe may have preached in his stead.Mozley, p. 75. Mozley says that the registers show that Foxe was never officially vicar of St. Giles. At some point before 1569, Foxe left Norfolk's house and moved to his own on Grub Street. Perhaps his move was motivated by his concerns about Norfolk's exceptionally poor judgment in attempting to marry Mary Stuart, which led to his imprisonment in the Tower in 1569 and his condemnation in 1572 following the Ridolfi Plot. Although Foxe had written Norfolk \\"a remarkably frank letter\\" about the injudiciousness of his course, after Norfolk's condemnation, he and Alexander Nowell ministered to the prisoner until his execution, which Foxe attended, on 2 June 1572.Mozley, p. 84. Norfolk left Foxe twenty pounds a year. In 1570, at the request of Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London, Foxe preached the Good Friday sermon at Paul's Cross. This lofty exposition of the Protestant doctrine of redemption and attack on the doctrinal errors of the Roman Catholic Church was enlarged and published that year as A Sermon of Christ Crucified.STC 11242. Another sermon Foxe preached seven years later at Paul's Cross resulted in his denunciation to the Queen by the French ambassador on grounds that Foxe had advocated the right of the Huguenots to take arms against their king. Foxe replied that he had been misunderstood: he had argued only that if the French king permitted no foreign power (the Pope) to rule over him, the French Protestants would immediately lay down their arms.Mozley, 93‚Äì94. In 1571, Foxe edited an edition of the Anglo-Saxon gospels, in parallel with the Bishops' Bible translation, under the patronage of Archbishop Parker, who was interested in Anglo-Saxon and whose chaplain, John Jocelyn was an Anglo-Saxon scholar. Foxe's introduction argues that the vernacular scripture was an ancient custom in England.Mozley, 80‚Äì81. \\"Anglo-Saxon studies were patronized by Archbishop Parker in the hope that they would demonstrate that the Church in England had always been independent of Rome. It was a preoccupation analogous to aspects of French Gallicanism.\\" John Burrow, A History of Histories. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008, p. 295. =Death and legacy= Foxe died on 18 April 1587 and was buried at St. Giles's, Cripplegate. His widow, Agnes, probably died in 1605. Foxe's son, Samuel Foxe (1560‚Äì1630) prospered after his father's death and \\"accumulated a substantial estate.\\" Fortunately for posterity, he also preserved his father's manuscripts, and they are now in the British Library. Personality Foxe was so bookish that he ruined his health by his persistent study.Mozley, pp. 95‚Äì96. Yet he had \\"a genius for friendship,\\" served as a spiritual counselor and was a man of private charity. He even took part in matchmaking.Mozley, 96, 100‚Äì01. Foxe was so well known as a man of prayer that Francis Drake credited his victory at Cadiz in part to Foxe's praying.Mozley, 101‚Äì02. Furthermore, Foxe's extreme unworldliness caused others to claim that he had prophetic powers and could heal the sick.Mozley, pp. 96 and 105‚Äì07. Foxe had to stop the sick from being carried to him for healing. Certainly, Foxe had a hatred of cruelty in advance of his age. When a number of Flemish Anabaptists were taken by Elizabeth's government in 1572 and sentenced to be burnt, Foxe first wrote letters to the Queen and her council asking for their lives and then wrote to the prisoners themselves (having his Latin draft translated into Flemish) pleading with them to abandon what he considered their theological errors. Foxe even visited the Anabaptists in prison. (The attempted intercession was in vain; two were burnt at Smithfield \\"in great horror with roaring and crying.\\")Mozley, pp. 86‚Äì89. John Day's son Richard, who knew Foxe well, described him in 1607 as an \\"excellent man... exceeding laborious in his pen... his learning inferior to none of his age and time; for his integrity of life a bright light to as many as knew him, beheld him, and lived with him\\" Mozley, 240‚Äì41. Foxe's funeral was accompanied \\"by crowds of mourners\\".Mozley, p. 240 Historical reputation John Foxe, engraving After his death, Foxe's Acts and Monuments continued to be published and appreciatively read. John Burrow refers to it as, after the Bible, \\"the greatest single influence on English Protestant thinking of the late Tudor and early Stuart period.\\"John Burrow, A History of Histories (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008), p. 296. By the end of the 17th century, however, the work tended to be abbreviated to include only \\"the most sensational episodes of torture and death\\", thus giving to Foxe's work \\"a lurid quality which was certainly far from the author's intention.\\" Because Foxe was used to attack Catholicism and a rising tide of high-church Anglicanism, the book's credibility was challenged in the early 19th century by a number of authors, most importantly, Samuel R. Maitland.Freeman, ODNB. Maitland, Six letters on Foxe's Acts and Monuments (1837). In the words of one Catholic Victorian, after Maitland's critique, \\"no one with any literary pretensions... ventured to quote Foxe as an authority.\\"D. Trenow, \\"The Credibility of John Foxe, the 'martyrologist' (1868), quoted in Freeman, ODNB. Further analysis of Maitland's criticism in the 21st century has in the words of David Loades, that Maitland \\"deserves to be treated with genuine, but limited, respect. His demolition of the martyrologist's history of the Waldenses, and of some of his other medieval reconstructions, was accurate up to a point, but he never addressed those parts of the Acts and Monuments where Foxe was at his strongest, and his general conclusion that the work was nothing but a tissue of fabrications and distortions is not supported by modern analysis.\\"David Loades, \\"The Maitland Controversy\\" It was not until J. F. Mozley published John Foxe and His Book, in 1940. that Foxe's rehabilitation as a historian began, initiating a controversy that has continued to the present. Recent renewed interest in Foxe as a seminal figure in early modern studies created a demand for a new critical edition of the Actes and Monuments: Foxe's Book of Martyrs Variorum Edition. In the words of Thomas S. Freeman, one of the most important living Foxe scholars, \\"current scholarship has formed a more complex and nuanced estimate of the accuracy of Acts and Monuments.... Perhaps [Foxe] may be most profitably seen in the same light as a barrister pleading a case for a client he knows to be innocent and whom he is determined to save. Like the hypothetical barrister, Foxe had to deal with the evidence of what actually happened, evidence that he was rarely in a position to forge. But he would not present facts damaging to his client, and he had the skills that enabled him to arrange the evidence so as to make it conform to what he wanted it to say. Like the barrister, Foxe presents crucial evidence and tells one side of a story which must be heard. But he should never be read uncritically, and his partisan objectives should always be kept in mind.\\"Freeman, ODNB.

Utilitarian bioethics deals with whether or not decisions of biology or medicine are good based on the Greatest Happiness principle, and thus any action or decision that leads to happiness for the greatest number of people is good. Many see problems with the morality of utilitarian bioethics, citing moral dilemmas in medical research and triage for example. Still, proponents for utilitarian bioethics look toward models like quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and medical policies like the Texas Advanced Directives Act (TADA) and euthanasia in the Netherlands as advancements in modern health care, while dissenting views argue of its devaluing of individual human life. History Although utilitarian philosophy traces itself back to the nineteenth century British thinkers John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, the application of utilitarianism in contemporary bioethics originated in the work of Peter Singer in the 1970s and 1980s. A second generation of utilitarian bioethicists, including Julian Savulescu, Jacob M. Appel and Thaddeus Mason Pope, advanced utilitarian ethics further in the 1990s and 2000s. A few applications of the utilitarian bioethics in policy are the Groningen Protocol in the Netherlands and the Advance Directives Act in Texas. In the 1990s, backlash against utilitarian bioethics emerged, led by such figures as Wesley J. Smith and novelist Dean Koontz.Harris, Kathy. One Door Away From Heaven', Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Feb 14, 2002Colon, Alicia. \\"When Killing An Ill Infant 'Is Not Wrong, The New York Sun, December 3, 2004 Philosopher Bernard Williams was also critical of the utilitarian perspective.  Related areas  = Morality = Those against utilitarian principles in research, health care, or bio-medical fields suggest that the means to achieve an overall benefit for society is not justified and becomes immoral, and anyone who is part of the act or who is involved in it being allowed is complicit in its immorality. They argue that utilitarianism fails to join itself with common morality, and thus the cannot be accepted as a moral, and any application of utilitarian principles are unethical. Those in favor of utilitarian principles in research, health-care, or bio-medical fields seek advancements in these areas for the benefit of all people and the collective happiness as a species. They view, what those who are against utilitarian ethics would suggest as immoral acts, as good and necessary practices as a means to maximize total well being,and the arguably controversial research and medical practices are good and beneficial to all people. Many who argue for the morality of utilitarian principles in research and medical areas point to our already accepted model of disaster triage, inherently utilitarian, which seeks to do the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people by foregoing treatment of those in critical conditions for those who have a higher chance to recover and those that can be quickly cared for to then help in the care effort. = Resource distribution = alt= Utilitarian bioethics is based on the premise that the distribution of resources is a zero-sum game, and therefore medical decisions should logically be made on the basis of each person's total future productive value and happiness, their chance of survival from the present, and the resources required for treatment. One way to grasp an effective way to distribute resources is by cost-effective analysis. Utilitarian bioethicists argue that cost-effective analysis is the most effective tool in distributing and utilizing resources so to maximize the best possible outcome with the idea that the outcome would lead to a benefit or increased happiness for society. One example of cost-effective analysis in regard to health care is the concept of quality-adjusted life years or QALY. QALY is a measure of benefit from treating or allocating resources to individuals based on the comparison of each individuals alternative outcome. Although there is controversy in regard to the equality of persons in this concept, equality should be regarded as a separate issue, because if one uses a standard of measurement that produces the same amount of qalys for each individual, as proposed by G.W. Torrance one of the economist credited to the creation of the concept, then there is unfairness when we consider different age groups, with the elderly getting a lower amount of qalys. Some this method of resource allocation as mechanical and devoid of human emotion, and argue for an augmented form of cost-effective analysis which seeks to correct this, called the Kevany Riposte. The Kevany Riposte is similar to the traditional cost-effective analysis method in that it compares alternative choices and their cost-effective ratio, but adds and additional element to the equation which is called the diplomatic value. This added element to resource allocation takes into account the future diplomatic and political effects of a decision, which shows how choices can have a future improvement and be more advantageous in the long run, though less cost-effective in the outset. For many resource allocation decisions, those involving the most rare and severe cases, medical culture and society are at odds and the choice of where to distribute resources will inevitably cause some ethical offense. = Policy = Though not the principle moral framework for guiding laws, utilitarian ethics can be seen in a number of different areas of state and federal laws, especially those involving resource distribution and health policies.  TADA and Futile Care  In 1999, with the passing of the TADA, Texas became the first state to have a law on the books that deals directly with futile medical care. Section 166.046, Subsection (e) of the law states physicians have the right to refuse any intervention they deem as inappropriate. Utilitarian ethics would allow for such a decision given that if there is no benefit from the intervention, than resources as being used ineffectively and therefore effecting others in society, decreasing overall happiness. Some argue that the law is inherently flawed, in that what some physicians find futile-care, others might not agree. And even more, some argue that the very law itself demeans the value and dignity of human life. There have also been cases where the physicians who determined that treatment being done was futile-care were actually not so, which lead to possibly avoidable death. Given its criticisms, many applaud TADA for its groundbreaking development into medical policy and see it as a step forward to better health care.  The Groningen Protocol and Neonatal Euthanasia  Euthanasia in the Netherlands has been legal for sometime, albeit not for infants. However, neonatal euthanasia still occurs in the Netherlands with a general tolerance by society and no physicians or associated parties going to trial. The Groningen Protocol sought to provide an ethical framework to allow for euthanasia of infants with severe medical diagnosis and prognosis. Many believe that the protocol cannot be followed because the criteria of the protocol cannot be met by neonates, namely the quality-of-life and pain and suffering criteria. Those against the protocol believe in the value of principilism, that of beneficence and non-maleficence, and that the physician should care for the infant with the best of their ability. Proponents of the protocol argue that if there is unanimous agreement for the euthanizing of the neonate among those who are in the best position to make that decision, the parents and physicians, then euthanizing is in severe cases is a good and not immoral.

Biography Postman was born in New York City, where he would spend most of his life. In 1953, he graduated from the State University of New York at Fredonia and enlisted in the military but was released less than five months later. At Teachers College, Columbia University he was awarded a Master's degree in 1955 and an Ed.D (Doctor of Education) degree in 1958. Postman took a position with San Francisco State University's English Department in 1958. Soon after, in 1959, he began teaching at New York University (NYU). In 1971, at NYU's Steinhardt School of Education, he founded a graduate program in media ecology. He became the School of Education's only University Professor in 1993, and was chairman of the Department of Culture and Communication until 2002. At age 72, Postman died of lung cancer at a hospital in Flushing, Queens, on October 5, 2003.Wolfgang Saxon: New York Times Obituary: Neil Postman, October 9, 2003 At the time, he had been married to his wife, Shelley Ross Postman, for 48 years. They had three children. He is buried in Cedar Park Cemetery, Paramus, New Jersey, where his headstone reads \\"Beloved Husband, Father Grandfather, Brother and Teacher.\\" Works Postman wrote 20 books and more than 200 magazine and newspaper articles in, for example, The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's Magazine, Time, Saturday Review, Harvard Educational Review, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Stern, and Le Monde. He was the editor of the quarterly journal ETC: A Review of General Semantics from 1976 to 1986. In 1976, Postman taught a course for NYU credit on CBS-TV's Sunrise Semester called \\"Communication: the Invisible Environment\\". He was also a contributing editor at The Nation. Several of Postman's articles were reprinted after his death in the quarterly journal, ETC.: A Review of General Semantics as part of a 75th Anniversary Edition in October 2013. Postman never owned a computer or typewriter, and wrote exclusively in longhand. Despite his oft-quoted concerns about television, computers, and the role of technology in society, Postman used the medium of television to advance his ideas and sat for many television interviews. Later in life, Postman even had cable television in his home. On education In 1969 and 1970 Postman collaborated with New Rochelle educator Alan Shapiro on the development of a model school based on the principles expressed in Teaching as a Subversive Activity. In Teaching as a Subversive Activity, Postman and co-author Charles Weingartner suggests that many schools have curricula that are trivial and irrelevant to students' lives. The result of Postman and Weingartner's critiques in Teaching as a Subversive Activity was the \\"Program for Inquiry, Involvement, and Independent Study\\" within New Rochelle High School. This \\"open school\\" experiment survived for 15 years, and in subsequent years many programs following these principles were developed in American high schools, current survivors include Walter Koral's Language class at the Village School in Great Neck, New York. In a 1973 address, \\"The Ecology of Learning,\\" at the Conference on English Education, Postman proposes seven changes for schools that build on his critiques expressed in Teaching as a Subversive Activity. First, Postman proposes that schools should be \\"convivial communities\\" for learning rather than places that try to control students through judgement and punishment. Secondly, Postman suggests that schools should either discard or dramatically change grading practices that lead to competition in school rather than an attitude of learning. Postman also proposes getting rid of homogeneous groupings of students that reinforce social and economic inequalities, standardized tests that promote competition, and permanently kept student records that are used to punish and control students. Proactively, Postman suggests that industries and professional schools, rather than K-12 schools, should develop criteria for selecting students and that schools should focus on civic education that teaches students their rights as citizens. In a television interview conducted in 1995 on PBS's MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, Postman spoke about his opposition to the use of personal computers in schools. He felt that school was a place to learn together as a cohesive group and that it should not be used for individualized learning. Postman also worried that the personal computer was going to take away from individuals socializing as citizens and human beings.From interview from PBS on MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour (1995).  Amusing Ourselves to Death  One of Postman's most influential works is Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. In Amusing, Postman argued that by expressing ideas through visual imagery, television reduces politics, news, history, and other serious topics to entertainment. He worried that culture would decline if the people became an audience and their public business a \\"vaudeville act.\\" Postman also argued that television is destroying the \\"serious and rational public conversation\\" that was sustained for centuries by the printing press. Technopoly In his 1992 book Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology, Postman defines \\"Technopoly\\" as a society which believes \\"the primary, if not the only, goal of human labor and thought is efficiency, that technical calculation is in all respects superior to human judgment ... and that the affairs of citizens are best guided and conducted by experts.\\" In an interview, Postman described Technopoly as being about the tendency of technology to be given cultural control of sovereign American social institutions. Postman argues that the United States is the only country to have developed into a technopoly. He claims that the U.S. has been inundated with technophiles who do not see the downside of technology. This is dangerous because technophiles want more technology and thus more information. However, according to Postman, it is impossible for a technological innovation to have only a one-sided effect. With the ever-increasing amount of information available, Postman argues that: \\"Information has become a form of garbage, not only incapable of answering the most fundamental human questions but barely useful in providing coherent direction to the solution of even mundane problems.\\" Postman was not opposed to all forms of technology. In page 7 of Technopoly, he agrees that technological advancements, specifically \\"the telephone, ocean liners, and the reign of hygiene,\\" have lengthened and improved modern life. In his words, this agreement proves that he is not a \\"one-eyed technophobe\\". In Technopoly, Postman discusses Luddism, explaining that being a Luddite often is associated with a naive opposition to technology. But, according to Postman, historical Luddites were trying to preserve their way of life and rights given to them prior to the advancement of new technologies.

Life He was born at Cawston, Norfolk, and educated at Ely. He became a sizar of Caius College, Cambridge, in 1592, but was expelled in the next year for stealing a book. He became one of Philip Henslowe's playwrights, collaborating with Henry Chettle, William Haughton, Thomas Dekker, Richard Hathwaye and Wentworth Smith. There are 22 plays to which he is linked. However his almost incessant activity does not seem to have paid, to judge by the small loans, of five shillings and even two shillings, that he obtained from Henslowe. Little is known of his life beyond these small details, and disparaging references by Ben Jonson in 1618/19, describing him, (with Dekker and Edward Sharpham) as a \\"rogue\\" and (with Thomas Middleton and Gervase Markham) as a \\"base fellow\\". It may be indicative of his abilities that of all the writers who did a substantial amount of work for Henslowe's companies Day is one of only two not mentioned and praised by Francis Meres in his lists of \\"the best\\" writers in 1598. In Peregrinatio Scholastica, or Learning's Pilgrimage, a collection of 22 morall Tractes written towards the end of his life, but not published until 1881, he laments that \\"notwithstanding . . . Industry . . . he was forct to take a napp at Beggars Bushe\\", and elsewhere he refers to \\"being becalmde in a fogg of necessity\\" having been passed over by \\"Credit\\" and \\"Opinion\\". It seems likely that he was the \\"John Daye, yeoman\\" who killed fellow dramatist Henry Porter in Southwark 1599. If so it does not seem have to interrupted his career; he continued to collaborate with writers such as Henry Chettle, who had written with Porter. Works The first play in which Day appears as part-author is The Conquest of Brute, with the finding of the Bath (1598), which, with most of his early work, is lost. Day's earliest extant work, written in collaboration with Chettle, is The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (acted 1600, printed 1659), a drama dealing with the early years of the reign of Henry VI. It bore the sub-title of The Merry Humor of Tom Strowd, the Norfolk Yeoman, and was so popular that second and third parts, by Day and Haughton, were produced in the next year. The Isle of Gulls (printed 1606), a prose comedy founded upon Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, contains in its light dialogue much satire to which the key is now lost, but Algernon Charles Swinburne notes in Manasses's burlesque of a Puritan sermon is a curious anticipation of the eloquence of Mr. Chadband in Bleak House. In 1607 Day produced, in conjunction with William Rowley and George Wilkins, The Travels of the Three English Brothers, which detailed the adventures of Sir Thomas, Sir Anthony and Robert Shirley. This play is a dramatic romance of a type that hearkened back to the early decades of the public stage in London. In 1608 Day published two comedies, Law Tricks, or Who Would have Thought it? and Humour out of Breath. The Parliament of Bees is the work on which Day's reputation chiefly rests. The piece contains much for which parallel passages are found in Thomas Dekker's Wonder of a Kingdom (1636) and The Noble Spanish Soldier (printed 1634). The passages which echo The Noble Spanish Soldier include references to speaking Spanish which are only meaningful in the context of Dekker's play; this suggests that the Dekker play is the original, a possibility reinforced by the consideration that there is no known edition of The Parliament of Bees earlier than 1641. The six dramas by Day which we possess show a delicate fancy and dainty inventiveness all his own. He preserved, in a great measure, the dramatic tradition of John Lyly, and affected a kind of subdued euphuism. Without ever wholly abandoning these characteristics, Day's comedy also reveals some influence of early Jacobean satirists such as John Marston, who like Day wrote for the children's companies. The Maid's Metamorphosis (1600), once supposed to be a posthumous work of Lyly's, may be an early work of Day's. It possesses, at all events, many of his marked characteristics. His prose Peregrinatio Scholastica or Learninges Pilgrimage, dating from his later years, was printed by A. H. Bullen from a manuscript of Day's. Considerations partly based on this work have suggested that he had a share in the anonymous The Pilgrimage to Parnassus and the Return from Parnassus. The beauty and ingenuity of The Parliament of Bees were noted and warmly extolled by Charles Lamb; and Day's work has since found many admirers. The date of his death is unknown, but an elegy on him by John Tatham, the city poet, was published in 1640. Publication His works, edited by Bullen, were printed at the Chiswick Press in 1881. The same editor included The Maid's Metamorphosis in Vol. 1 of his Collection of Old Plays. The Parliament of Bees and Humour out of Breath were printed in Nero and other Plays (Mermaid Series, 1888), with an introduction by Arthur Symons. An appreciation by Algernon Charles Swinburne appeared in The Nineteenth Century (October 1897).

Rowley first appears in the historical record as an associate of Philip Henslowe in the late 1590s. Initially he appears to have been an actor, perhaps a sharer, in the Admiral's Men, who performed at the Rose Theatre. After 1598, he assumed some non-acting responsibilities, helping Henslowe and Edward Alleyn manage the business affairs of the company. Yet he remained an actor as late as 1617, as he appears in the \\"plots\\" for plays including Frederick and Basilea (as Heraclius), The Battle of Alcazar (as an ambassador), and 1 Tamar Cam. He remained with the company through its successive patronage by Prince Henry and the Palsgrave. As a writer, Rowley belonged to the crowd of collaborating playwrights who kept Henslowe and Alleyn supplied with new drama. Henslowe paid him for additions to Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus; tradition, deferential to Marlowe, has assigned him the clown's bits in the 1616 edition. He wrote the now-lost Judas with William Borne (or Bird, or Boyle) and Edward Juby. He also wrote alone. His only extant solo work is When You See Me You Know Me (1603-5), a history of Henry VIII from the death of Jane Seymour to the visit of Charles V. He also wrote a play on Richard III and two apparent comedies, Hard Shift for Husbands and A Match or no Match‚Äîall three licensed shortly before his death, and none of which has survived. On stylistic grounds, H. D. Sykes assigned him a share in The Famous Victories of Henry V, The Taming of a Shrew, and parts of Robert Greene's Orlando Furioso. These attributions are possible but not widely accepted, as the plays are associated with Queen Elizabeth's Men, a troupe with which Rowley is not otherwise associated. MacD. P. Jackson also credits him with writing Richard II, Part One which others attribute to Shakespeare. The long-uncertain question of his connection to the more-famous William Rowley was perhaps clarified by the discovery of his will in the 1960s: in this document, a brother named William is bequeathed all of Samuel's books. Samuel Rowley died in the parish of St Mary's in Whitechapel, where he had resided for decades. References *Cesarano, S. P. \\"Samuel Rowley.\\" Dictionary of National Biography.

Early life The son of Robert Chettle, a London dyer, he was apprenticed in 1577 and became a member of the Stationer's Company in 1584, traveling to Cambridge on their behalf in 1588. His career as a printer and author is shadowy. He may have set up some of the tracts printed in response to Martin Marprelate. In 1591, he entered into partnership with William Hoskins and John Danter, two stationers. They published a good many ballads, and some plays, including a surreptitious and botched first quarto of Romeo and Juliet, to which it is suggested Chettle added lines and stage directions. The Groat's-Worth of Wit Title page of Kind Hearts Dream by Henry ChettleIn 1592 Greene's Groats- Worth of Wit, supposedly the work of the recently deceased, and very popular, Robert Greene, was published, having been entered in the register of the Stationer's Company \\"at the peril of Henry Chettle\\". This contained a passage criticising various playwrights, which offended at least two contemporary writers, one probably the alleged \\"atheist\\" Christopher Marlowe and the other possibly William Shakespeare. Chettle was accused of writing the work under Greene's name. He denied the charge in the preface to his Kind Heart's Dream, published later that year: > About three months since died M. Robert Greene, leaving many papers in > sundry booksellers' hands, among other his Groatsworth of Wit, in which a > letter written to divers play-makers is offensively by one or two of them > taken, and because on the dead they cannot be avenged, they willfully forge > in their conceits a living author [...] With neither of them that take > offence was I acquainted, and with one of them I care not if I never be. The > other, whom at that time I did not so much spare as since I wish I had, for > that, as I have moderated the heat of living writers and might have used my > own discretion (especially in such a case, the author being dead), that I > did not I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault, because > myself have seen his demeanor no less civil than he excellent in the quality > he professes. Besides, divers of worship have reported his uprightness of > dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writing that > approves his art. The theory that Greene's Groatsworth is a forgery by Chettle has been both supported and challenged by scholars. In 1935 Harold Jenkins attributed the work to Greene, not Chettle.Harold Jenkins, \\"On the Authenticiy of Greene's Groatsworth of Wit and The Repentance of Robert Greene,\\" The Review of English Studies 11 (1935): 33. However, a pioneering 1969 computer-aided stylometric analysis by Warren B. Austin firmly attributed it to Chettle. Austin's views were challenged in 2006 by Richard Westley.Richard Westley, \\"Computing Error: Reassessing Austin's Study of Groats-worth of Wit,\\" Literary and Linguistic Computing 21 (2006): 363-78. Links to Henslowe He seems to have been generally in debt, judging from numerous entries in Philip Henslowe's diary of advances for various purposes, on one occasion (17 January 1599) to pay his expenses in the Marshalsea prison, on another (7 March 1603) to get his play out of pawn. He made a greater number of small borrowings from Henslowe than any other person. These and Henslowe‚Äôs casual records of them suggest some friendship between them, though in 1602 Chettle seems to have been writing for both Worcester's Company and the Admiral's, despite signing a bond to write exclusively for the latter. Works As early as 1598 Francis Meres includes Chettle in his Palladis Tamia as one of the \\"best for comedy\\", and Henslowe lists payments to him for thirty-six plays between 1598 and 1603, and he may have been involved in as many as fifty plays, although only a dozen seem to be his alone. Chettle had regular association with Henry Porter, Thomas Dekker, and after 1600 with John Day. Of the thirteen plays usually attributed to Chettle's sole authorship only one was printed. This was The Tragedy of Hoffmann: or a Revenge for a Father (played 1602; printed 1631). It has been suggested that this piece was put forward as a rival to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Chettle's non-dramatic writings include (besides Kind Heart's Dream) Piers Plainnes Seaven Yeres Prentiship (1595), the story of a fictitious apprenticeship in Crete and Thrace, and England's Mourning Garment (1603), in which are included some verses alluding to the chief poets of the time. Death He died before 1607, when Dekker in his Knight's Conjurer described him joining the poets in Elysium: \\"in comes Chettle sweating and blowing by reason of his fatness\\".

He entered Gray's Inn on 22 May 1590.Dictionary of National Biography He was elected Member of Parliament for Dunwich in 1601. In 1602 he was acting as secretary to the Lord High Treasurer, Sir Robert Cecil, and in December 1604 he became receiver of fines on alienations, in succession to Sir Arthur Aty. In 1614 he was elected MP for Reigate. He was knighted by James I at Theobalds on 22 January 1616.Knights of England In February 1619 he became a Master of Requests, and in 1622 he was appointed comptroller of the royal household, \\"paying well for the post.\\" Suckling had become wealthy and accumulated manors, fee-farms, and advowsons in various parts of the country. In September 1621 he was mentioned as Sir Richard Weston's most serious competitor for the chancellorship of the exchequer and in March 1622 he was promoted to be secretary of state. Charles I, upon his accession three years later, created him a privy councillor. Alabaster monument (circa 1611) to Sir John Suckling (politician) In 1624 he was elected MP for Middlesex, Lichfield and Kingston upon Hull and chose to sit for Middlesex. In 1625 he represented Yarmouth (IoW) after Edward Clarke opted to sit for Hythe. In 1626 he was elected MP for Norwich and for Sandwich; he chose to sit for Norwich. Suckling married Martha Cranfield, daughter of Thomas Cranfield of London, and sister of Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex. She died on 28 October 1613, aged 35. By her, he was the father of the poet Sir John Suckling. A monument of Sir John Suckling, his first wife, Martha, and family, can be seen in St Andrew's Church, Norwich. He then married Jane Hawkins, widow of Charles Hawkins and originally of the Suffolk family of Reve or Reeve. His widow took as her third husband Sir Edwin Rich, of Mulbarton, Norfolk and on the default of her stepson carried into that family the estate of Roos Hall near Beccles Suffolk which Suckling had acquired in 1600 as his residence. On Suckling's death, Roos Hall had been inherited by Sir Alexander Temple (Suckling's brother-in- law) in lieu of repayment of a debt , but was later repurchased by the family.

His main contributions were to late Elizabethan and early Jacobean theatre. He is best known for his masterpiece A Woman Killed with Kindness, a domestic tragedy, which was first performed in 1603 at the Rose Theatre by the Worcester's Men company.Gurr (1992, 243), Massai (2002, xi), McLuskie (1994, 91), and Thomson (1998, 486). The play was first printed in 1607. He was a prolific writer, claiming to have had \\"an entire hand or at least a maine finger in two hundred and twenty plays\\", although only a fraction of his work has survived. Early years Few details of Heywood's life have been documented with certainty. Most references indicate that the county of his birth was most likely Lincolnshire, while the year has been variously given as 1570, 1573, 1574 and 1575. It has been speculated that his father was a country parson and that he was related to the half-century-earlier dramatist John Heywood, whose death year is, again, uncertain, but indicated as having occurred not earlier than 1575 and not later than 1589. Heywood is said to have been educated at the University of Cambridge, though his college is a matter of dispute. The persistent tradition that he was a Fellow of Peterhouse was discussed and dismissed by a Master of that college.. Alternatively, there is evidence that Heywood was a member of Emmanuel. Subsequently, however, he moved to London, where the first mention of his dramatic career is a note in the diary of theatre entrepreneur Philip Henslowe recording that he was paid for a play that was performed by the Admiral's Men, an acting company, in October 1596. By 1598, he was regularly engaged as a player in the company; since no wages are mentioned, he was presumably a sharer in the company, as was normal for important company members. He was later a member of other companies, including Lord Southampton's, Lord Strange's Men and Worcester's Men (who subsequently became known as Queen Anne's Men). During this time, Heywood was extremely prolific; in his preface to The English Traveller (1633) he describes himself as having had \\"an entire hand or at least a maine finger in two hundred and twenty plays\\". However, only twenty three plays and eight masques have survived that are accepted by historians as wholly or partially authored by him. Creative activity Heywood's first play may have been The Four Prentises of London (printed 1615, but acted some fifteen years earlier). This tale of four apprentices who become knights and travel to Jerusalem may have been intended as a burlesque of the old romances, but it is more likely that it was meant seriously to attract the apprentice spectators to whom it was dedicated. Its popularity was satirized in Beaumont and Fletcher's travesty of the middle-class taste in drama, The Knight of the Burning Pestle. Heywood's two-part history plays Edward IV (printed 1600), and If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody, or, The Troubles of Queene Elizabeth (1605 and 1606) concern, respectively, The Wars of the Roses and the life of the Queen contrasted with that of the preeminent merchant and financier Thomas Gresham. He wrote for the stage, and (perhaps disingenuously) protested against the printing of his works, saying he had no time to revise them. Johann Ludwig Tieck called him the \\"model of a light and rare talent\\", and Charles Lamb wrote that he was a \\"prose Shakespeare\\"; Professor Ward, one of Heywood's most sympathetic editors, pointed out that Heywood had a keen eye for dramatic situations and great constructive skill, but his powers of characterization were not on a par with his stagecraft.Who? Citation? He delighted in what he called \\"merry accidents\\", that is, in coarse, broad farce; his fancy and invention were inexhaustible. Heywood's best known plays are his domestic tragedies and comedies (plays set among the English middle classes); his masterpiece is generally considered to be A Woman Killed with Kindness (acted 1603; printed 1607), a domestic tragedy about an adulterous wife, and a widely admired Plautine farce The English Traveller (acted approximately 1627; printed 15 July 1633), which is also known for its informative \\"Preface\\", giving Heywood an opportunity to inform the reader about his prolific creative output. His citizen comedies are noteworthy because of their physicality and energy. They provide a psycho-geography of the sights, smells, and sounds of London's wharfs, markets, shops, and streets which contrasts with the more conventional generalisations about the sites of commerce, which are satirised in city comedies. Heywood wrote numerous prose works, mostly pamphlets about contemporary subjects, of interest now primarily to historians studying the period. His best known long essay is An Apology for Actors, a moderately-toned and reasonable reply to Puritan attacks on the stage, which contains a wealth of detailed information on the actors and acting conditions of Heywood's day. It is in the \\"Epistle to the Printer\\" in this 1612 work that Heywood writes about William Jaggard's appropriation of two of Heywood's poems for the same year's edition of The Passionate Pilgrim. In 1641 Heywood had printed The Life of Merlin Surnamed Ambrosius. The book chronicled all the kings of England dating back to the legendary king Brutus, who had come from Troy to start an exploration and a new colony, up to Charles I who was the King when Heywood died. The book goes on to chronicle certain prophesies told by Merlin and the interpretations of each and explanation of each within the context of the modern world. Final two decades Between 1619 and 1624, Heywood seems to have inexplicably ceased all activity as an actor, but from 1624, until his death seventeen years later, his name frequently appears in contemporary accounts. In this period, Heywood was associated with Christopher Beeston's company at The Phoenix theatre, Queen Henrietta's Men or Lady Elizabeth's Men. At The Phoenix, Heywood produced new plays such as The Captives, The English Traveller, and A Maidenhead Well Lost as well as revivals of old plays. Numerous volumes of his prose and poetry were published, including two lengthy poetic works, Gynaikeion (1624), described as \\"nine books of various history concerning women\\" and, eleven years later, The Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels. As a measure of Heywood's popular standing in the final years of his life, Love's Mistress or the Queen's Masque, a play published in 1636, but performed since 1634, was reported to have been seen by King Charles I and his queen three times in eight days. According to writings of the period, Thomas Heywood had been living in Clerkenwell since 1623 and it was there, at St. James's Church that he was buried eighteen years later. Because of the uncertainty regarding the year of his birth, his age can only be estimated, but he was likely in his late sixties, possibly having reached seventy. The date of the burial, 16 August 1641, the only documented date, also appears in a number of reference books as Heywood's death date, although he may actually have died days earlier. It may be presumed, however, that due to a possible August heatwave, the burial occurred on an expedited basis.

In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press, 1911; Vol. 13, p. 66. Life Most of what little biographical information there is about him is derived from the papers of Philip Henslowe, proprietor of the Rose Theatre. Henslowe's earliest reference to him refers to him as \\"young\\" Haughton. He wrote all his known dramatic work for Henslowe, for production by the Admiral's Men and Worcester's Men. (Henslowe's papers refer to Haughton as Hawton, Hauton, Haughtoun, Haulton, Howghton, Horton, Harton, and HarvghtonChambers, E. K. The Elizabethan Stage. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 334.--a fine example of the famously flexible Elizabethan orthography. His name is spelled Houghton in his 1605 will.) On 10 March 1600 Henslowe lent Haughton ten shillings \\"to release him out of The Clink\\". A William Haughton received an M.A. from Oxford in 1604, but Baugh doubts that this was the playwright. Haughton made his will on 6 June 1605, with his sometime dramatic collaborator Wentworth Smith and one Elizabeth Lewes as witnesses. It was proved on 20 July 1605. He was of Allhallows, Stainings, at that time. He left a widow Alice and children. Career as a playwright During the years 1597 to 1602 he collaborated in many plays with Henry Chettle, Thomas Dekker, John Day, Richard Hathwaye and Wentworth Smith. Haughton's hand has also been sought in several anonymous plays of the period, including Wiley Beguiled, The Wit of a Woman, The Merry Devil of Edmonton, Captain Thomas Stukeley and A Warning For Fair Women. A merry comedy entitled Englishmen for My Money, or A Woman will have her Will (1598) is ascribed to his sole authorship, and Fleay credits him with a considerable share in Patient Grissel (1599). The latter attribution has been confirmed and refined by W. L. Halstead and by Cyrus Hoy (1980), giving the subplot concerning Sir Owen the Welsh Knight and his wife Gwenthyan, as well as that concerning the Duke's sister Julia and her three foolish suitors to Haughton, leaving the main plot to Dekker and Chettle. The Devil and his Dame, mentioned as a forthcoming play by Henslowe in March 1600, is identified by Fleay as Grim the Collier of Croydon, which was printed in 1662. In this play an emissary is sent from the infernal regions to report on the conditions of married life on earth. This attribution has recently been confirmed by William M Baillie (see below). Grim is reprinted in vol. viii, and Englishmen for My Money iii, vol. 5, of WC Hazlitt's edition of Dodsley's Old Plays. Englishmen for My Money was edited in old-spelling by A. C. Baugh in 1917, and appeared as a Tudor Facsimile Text in 1911. Grim has been edited by William L. Baillie as part of A Choice Ternary of English Plays: Gratiae Theatrales (1984), and appeared as a Tudor Facsimile Text in 1912. Patient Grissell appears in Fredson Bowers' edition of Dekker's Dramatic Works. In May 1600 he brokered a play, now lost, to Henslowe called The English Fugitives, possibly based on Lewes Lewknor's The Estate of English Fugitives published in 1595. Known works Known plays by Haughton, either singly or in conjunction with others, include: # Englishmen for My Money, or A Woman Will Have Her Will. Stationers' Register entry 3 August 1601.

He was baptized on 13 October 1560 in St Gregory by St Paul's, London, and was the son of Christopher Munday, a stationer, and Jane Munday.David M. Bergeron, 'Munday, Anthony (bap. 1560, d. 1633)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 accessed 14 Aug 2013 He was one of the chief predecessors of Shakespeare in English dramatic composition, and wrote plays about Robin Hood. He is believed to be the primary author of Sir Thomas More, on which he is believed to have collaborated with Henry Chettle, Thomas Heywood, William Shakespeare, and Thomas Dekker. Biography He was once thought to have been born in 1553, because the monument to him in the church of St Stephen Coleman Street, since destroyed, stated that at the time of his death he was eighty years old. From the inscription we likewise learn that he was \\"a citizen and draper\\". In 1589 he was living in the city, and dates his translation of The History of Palmendos \\"from my house in Cripplegate\\". That he carried on the business of a draper, or had some connection with the trade as late as 1613, may be gathered from the following passage at the close of The Triumphs of Truth, the city pageant for that year, by Thomas Middleton: \\"The fire-work being made by Maister Humphrey Nichols, a man excellent in his art; and the whole work and body of the Triumph, with all the proper beauties of the workmanship, most artfully and faithfully performed by John Grinkin; and those furnished with apparel and porters by Anthony Munday, Gentleman.\\" The style of \\"gentleman\\" was probably given to him with reference to the productions of his pen. =Early years= He probably already had appeared on the stage as an actor when he was bound apprenticed in 1576 for eight years to the stationer John Allde, an apprenticeship from which he was soon released. By 1578 he was in Rome. In the opening lines of his English Romayne Lyfe (1582) he states that he went abroad solely in order to see strange countries and to learn foreign languages; but he may have been a spy sent to report on the Jesuit English College in Rome or a journalist intent on making literary capital out of the designs of the English Catholics then living in France and Italy. He writes that he and his companion, Thomas Nowell, were robbed of all their possessions on the road from Boulogne to Amiens, where they were helped by an English priest who entrusted them with letters to be delivered in Reims. These they handed over to the English ambassador in Paris. Under a false name, as the son of a well-known English Catholic, Munday gained recommendations which secured his reception at the English College in Rome. He was treated with special kindness by the rector, Dr Morris, for the sake of his supposed father. He gives a detailed account of the routine of the place, of the dispute between the English and Welsh students, of the carnival at Rome, and finally of the martyrdom of Richard Atkins. =The playwriting years= His political services against the Catholics were rewarded in 1584 by the post of messenger to her Majesty's chamber, and from this time he seems to have given up acting. In 1598‚Äì1599, when he travelled with the Earl of Pembroke's men in the Low Countries, it was in the capacity of playwright to rewrite old plays. He devoted 'himself to writing for the booksellers and the theatres, compiling religious works, translating Amadis de Gaule and other French romances, and putting words to popular airs. He was the chief pageant-writer for the City from 1605 to 1616. These works included London's Love to Prince Henry (1610), his publication describing the city's pageant on the Thames for the investiture of Prince Henry as Prince of Wales in May 1610. One of the more gorgeous Lord Mayor's shows was that of 1616, which was devised by Munday. It is also possible that he supplied most of the pageants between 1592 and 1605, of which no authentic record has been kept. His works At what date he acquired the title of \\"poet to the city\\" is not known; he had certainly been previously employed in a similar capacity, as Ben Jonson introduces him in that capacity in The Case is Altered, which was written in 1598 or 1599. He pours ridicule upon Don Antonio Balladino (as he calls Munday),\\"Antony Munday's Career\\", The Cambridge History of English and American Literature, vol. 5, (1907-1921) and Middleton mentions him in his The Triumphs of Truth. Munday was a prolific author in verse and prose, original and translated, and may be counted among the predecessors of Shakespeare in dramatic composition. One of his earliest works was The Mirror of Mutability, from 1579: he dedicated it to his long-time patron Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford,Anthony Munday and the Catholics, 1560‚Äì1633. Donna B. Hamilton, 2005 and perhaps then belonged to the Earl's company of players, to which he had again attached himself on his return from Italy. Munday's Banquet of Dainty Conceits was printed in 1588. Nearly all the existing information respecting Anthony Munday's dramatic works is derived from Philip Henslowe's papers. At what period he began to write for the stage cannot be ascertained: the earliest date in these manuscripts connected with his name is December 1597; but he may have been a member of the Earl of Oxford's theatrical company before he went to Rome prior to 1578. In the old catalogues, and in Gerard Langbaine's Momus Triumphans, 1688, a piece called Fidele and Fortunatus is mentioned, and such a play was entered at Stationers' Hall on 12 November 1584. There is little doubt that this is the same production, two copies of which have been discovered, with the running title of Two Italian Gentlemen, that being the second title to Fidele and Fortunatus in the Register. Both copies are without title-pages; but to one of them is prefixed a dedication signed A.M., and we may with tolerable certainty conclude that Anthony Munday was the author or translator of it, and that it was printed about the date of its entry on the Stationers' Books. Munday wrote two plays on the life of Robin Hood, The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington, first mentioned in the Rose theatre records in 1597‚Äì8 and published in 1601. =Catalogue of plays= The subsequent catalogue of plays which Munday wrote, either alone or in conjunction with others, is derived from the materials supplied by Edmond Malone. * Fidele and Fortunio or Fedele and Fortuna, by Anthony Munday. c. 1584. * Sir Thomas More, by Anthony Munday, Henry Chettle, Thomas Heywood, William Shakespeare, Thomas Dekker, ca. 1591‚Äì3. *Mother Redcap, by Anthony Munday and Michael Drayton.

Or it may be on the roof, as in many 16th- century prodigy houses. It may be raised for additional air or a vista, with a simple kitchen below, as at Hampton Court Palace and Wrest Park, and it may be richly decorated, but it normally contains no bedrooms, and typically a single grand room apart from any service spaces.Girouard, 105-118 The design is often ornamental, if not downright fanciful, and some are also follies, as in Paxton's Tower. There are usually plenty of windows, as appreciating the view was a large part of their purpose. Often they are built on a slope, so that from the front, only the door to the main room can be seen; the door to the servants' spaces underneath was hidden at the back (Wrest Park). The Banqueting House, Gibside is an example. In the English of the period, \\"banquet\\" had two distinct meanings: firstly a grand formal celebratory meal (the usual modern sense), but also a course or light meal taken in a special place away from the main dining place, the relevant sense here (Whitehall apart).Girouard, 105-106 In large meals a banqueting house was most likely to be used for eating dessert, if reasonably close to the main house. Otherwise it might be used on fine days for taking tea, or any kind of drink, snack or meal.Girouard, 105-118 The best known example, though far larger than most, is the Banqueting House on Whitehall, once part of Whitehall Palace. This is a grand dining hall for full formal meals, and what may be called in distinction a banqueting hall. Such buildings were created in various settings, for example at Cholmley House next to Whitby Abbey, which had been converted into a country house.Jenkins, 903-904 Most banqueting houses fitted at most twenty people, and many fewer.

While conducting an underground ministry in officially Anglican England, Campion was arrested by priest hunters. Convicted of high treason, he was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn. Campion was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1886 and canonised in 1970 by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. His feast day is celebrated every 1st of December. Early years and education (1540‚Äì1569) Born in London on 24 January 1540, Campion was the son of a bookseller in Paternoster Row, near St Paul's Cathedral. He received his early education at Christ's Hospital school and, at the age of 13, was chosen to make the complimentary speech when Queen Mary visited the city in August 1553.Simpson, Richard. Edmund Campion: a Biography, (1867), p.2Chapman, John H. \\"The Persecution under Elizabeth\\" Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Old Series Vol. 9 (1881), pp. 30‚Äì34. Retrieved 31 January 2013. William Chester, a governor of Christ's Hospital, took a special interest in him, and sponsored him as a scholar to St John's College, Oxford,G. Kilroy, Edmund Campion: A Scholarly Life (Routledge, 2016), pp. 18-27, passim. where he became junior fellow in 1557Simpson (1867), p.3 and took the required Oath of Supremacy, probably on the occasion of his B.A. degree in 1560.Waugh (1935), p.26 He took a master's degree at Oxford in 1564. Two years later, Campion welcomed Queen Elizabeth to the university, and won her lasting regard. He was selected to lead a public debate in front of the Queen. By the time the Queen had left Oxford, Campion had earned the patronage of the powerful William Cecil and also the Earl of Leicester, tipped by some to be future husband of the young Queen. When Sir Thomas White, the founder of the college, was buried in 1567, it fell to Campion to give the Latin oration. Rejecting Anglicanism Religious difficulties then arose; but at the persuasion of Richard Cheyney, Bishop of Gloucester, although holding Catholic doctrines, he received Holy Orders in 1564 as a deacon in the Anglican Church. Inwardly \\"he took a remorse of conscience and detestation of mind.\\" Rumours of his opinions began to spread and he left Oxford in 1569 and went to Ireland for private study and research, but not, as Simpson said (now corrected by Fr. P. Joseph's revision of Simpson, 2010) to take part in a proposed establishment of the University of Dublin. =Ireland (1569‚Äì1570)= Campion was appointed tutor to Richard Stanihurst, son of James Stanyhurst, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and attended the first session of the House of Commons, which included the prorogation. He was transferred through Stanihurst's arrangement to the house of Christopher Barnewall at Turvey in the Pale, which he acknowledged saved him from arrest and torture by the Protestant party in Dublin. For some three months he eluded his pursuers, going by the name \\"Mr Patrick\\" and occupying himself by writing A Historie of Ireland. =Douai (1571‚Äì1573)= In the year of 1571, Campion left Ireland in secret and escaped to Douai in the Low Countries (now France) where he was reconciled to the Catholic Church and received the Eucharist that he had denied himself for the past twelve years. He entered the English College founded by William Allen. The enrollment of the college grew, and a papal subsidy was granted a little time after Campion's arrival. Campion found himself reunited with Oxford friends. He was to teach rhetoric while there and finish studying for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity, which was granted him by the University of Douai on 21 January 1573. He received minor orders after this and was ordained sub-deacon.Guiney, Louise Imogen. Blessed Edmund Campion, New York: Benziger Brothers (1908). p.55 =Rome, Brunn and Prague (1573‚Äì1580)= Campion then travelled to Rome on foot, alone and in the guise of a pilgrim, to join the Jesuits. In April 1573, in Rome, he became the first novice accepted into the Society of Jesus by Mercurianus, the order's fourth Superior General. He was assigned to the Austrian Province as there was not yet an English province of the Jesuits and began his two-year novitiate at Brunn (now Brno) in Moravia. He was ordained deacon and priest by Anthony Brus, O.M.C.R.S., Archbishop of PragueSimpson (1867), p.90 and said his first Mass on 8 September 1578.Guiney (1908), p.69 For six years, Campion taught at the Jesuit college in Prague as professor of both rhetoric and philosophy.Waugh, Evelyn. Edmund Campion, London: Hollis and Carter (1935).p.75 =Mission to England (1580‚Äì1581)= In 1580, the Jesuit mission to England began. The mission was strictly forbidden, according to Campion's Challenge to the Privy Council, \\"to deal in any respects with matters of state or policy of this [English] realm...\\"Simpson (1867), pp.159‚Äì160 Campion accompanied Fr. Robert Persons who, as superior, was intended to counterbalance his own fervour and impetuousness. He had been surprised to learn that he was chosen to take part in the mission, and expressed the fear that he lacked constitutional courage.Simpson (1867), pp.95‚Äì96 The members of the mission were instructed to avoid the company of boys and women and to avoid giving the impression of being legacy hunters. Before embarking, the members of the mission were embarrassed to receive news of a landing by papal- sponsored forces in the Irish province of Munster in support of the Irish rebel James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald. They also learned that a letter detailing their party and mission had been intercepted and that they were expected in England.Waugh (1935), p.98 part of Campion's Challenge to the Privy Council Campion finally entered England in the guise of a jewel merchant, arriving in London on 24 June 1580, and at once began to preach. His presence soon became known to the authorities and to his fellow Catholics lying in London's prisons. Among the latter was Thomas Pounde in the Marshalsea, where a meeting was held to discuss means of counteracting rumours circulated by the Privy Council to the effect that Campion's mission was political and treasonous. Pounde rode in haste after Campion and explained the need for Campion to write a brief declaration of the true causes of his coming.Foley, Henry S.J., Records of the English Province of the Society of Jesus. Vol. III. London (1878). p.628 The diffusion of this declaration, known as the Challenge to the Privy Council, or, Campion's Brag, made his position more difficult. He led a hunted life, administering the sacraments and preaching to Catholics in Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, and Lancashire. During this time he wrote his Decem Rationes (\\"Ten Reasons\\"), arguments against the validity of the Anglican Church. This pamphlet, in Latin, was printed in a clandestine press at Stonor Park, Henley, and 400 copies were found on the benches of St Mary's, Oxford, at the Commencement, on 27 June 1581. It caused great sensation, and the hunt for Campion was stepped up. On his way to Norfolk, he stopped at Lyford Grange, the house of a certain Francis Yate, then in Berkshire, where he preached on 14 July and the following day, by popular request. Here, he was captured by a spy named George Eliot and taken to London with his arms pinioned and bearing on his hat a paper with the inscription \\"Campion, the Seditious Jesuit\\". Imprisonment, torture and disputations Imprisoned for four days in the Tower of London in a tiny cell called \\"Little Ease\\",Simpson (1867), p.239. \\"Little-ease is a cell where the prisoner cannot stand or lie at length.\\" Campion was then taken out and questioned by three Privy Councillors‚ÄîLord Chancellor Sir Thomas Bromley, Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household Sir Christopher Hatton and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester‚Äîon matters including whether he acknowledged Queen Elizabeth to be the true Queen of England. He replied that he did, and was offered his freedom, wealth and honours, including a possibility of the Archbishopric of Canterbury,Guiney (1908), p.139 which he could not accept in good conscience. Campion was imprisoned in the Tower more than four months and tortured on the rack two or three times.Simpson (1867), p.277 False reports of a retraction and of a confession by Campion were circulated.Simpson (1867), p.240‚Äì250 He had four public disputations with his Anglican adversaries, on 1, 18, 23 and 27 September 1581, at which they attempted to address the challenges of Campion's Challenge to the Privy Council and Decem Rationes. Although still suffering from the effects of his torture, and allowed neither time nor books for preparation, he reportedly conducted himself so easily and readily that \\"even the spectators in the court looked for an acquittal\\". He was arraigned and indicted on 14 November 1581Simpson (1867), p.281 with several others at Westminster on a charge of having conspired, in Rome and Reims, to raise a sedition in the realm and dethrone the Queen. Edmund Campion, in a 1631 print. Trial, sentence and execution The trial was held on 20 November 1581. After hearing the pleadings for three hours, the jury deliberated an hour before delivering its verdict:Simpson (1867), p. 307. Campion and his fellow defendants were found guilty of treason. He answered the verdict: Lord Chief Justice Wray read the sentence: \\"You must go to the place from whence you came, there to remain until ye shall be drawn through the open city of London upon hurdles to the place of execution, and there be hanged and let down alive, and your privy parts cut off, and your entrails taken out and burnt in your sight; then your heads to be cut off and your bodies divided into four parts, to be disposed of at Her Majesty‚Äôs pleasure. And God have mercy on your souls.\\"Simpson (1867), p.308‚Äì309 On hearing the death sentence, Campion and the other condemned men broke into the words of the Te Deum. After spending his last days in prayer he was dragged with two fellow priests, Fathers Ralph Sherwin and Alexander Briant, to Tyburn where the three were hanged, drawn and quartered on 1 December 1581.

Lyly's mannered literary style, originating in his first books, is known as euphuism. Biography John Lyly was born in Kent, England, in 1553/1554, to Peter Lyly (d. 1569) and his wife, Jane Burgh (or Brough), of Burgh Hall in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The first of eight children, he was probably born in Canterbury, where his father was the Registrar for the Archbishop Matthew Parker and where the births of his siblings are recorded between 1562 and 1568. His grandfather was William Lily, the grammarian.Hunter, G. K. (2004). \\"Lyly, John (1554‚Äì1606)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 23 January 2012. According to Anthony Wood, at the age of 16 Lyly became a student at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1573 and his master's two years later. In 1574 he applied to Lord Burghley for the Queen's letters to admit him as fellow at Magdalen College, but the fellowship was not granted, and Lyly subsequently left the university. He complains about a sentence of rustication apparently passed on him at some time, in his address to the gentlemen scholars of Oxford affixed to the second edition of the first part of Euphues, but nothing more is known about either its date or its cause. Wood said that Lyly never took kindly to the proper studies of the university. \\"For so it was that his genius being naturally bent to the pleasant paths of poetry (as if Apollo had given to him a wreath of his own bays without snatching or struggling) did in a manner neglect academical studies, yet not so much but that he took the degrees in arts, that of master being compleated 1575.\\"Wood, Anthony. Athenae Oxonienses:An exact history of all the writers and bishops who have had their education in the University of Oxford. To which are added the Fasti, or Annals of the said University. London (1813) 1:676. After he left Oxford, where he had the reputation of \\"a noted wit\\", Lyly seems to have attached himself to Lord Burghley. \\"This noble man\\", he writes in the Glasse for Europe, in the second part of Euphues (1580), \\"I found so ready being but a straunger to do me good, that neyther I ought to forget him, neyther cease to pray for him, that as he hath the wisdom of Nestor, so he may have the age, that having the policies of Ulysses he may have his honor, worthy to lyve long, by whom so many lyve in quiet, and not unworthy to be advaunced by whose care so many have been preferred.\\" Lyly became the private secretary of Burghley's son-in-law Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, himself a playwright to whom the second part of Euphues is dedicated, and who seems to have acted as patron to most of Lyly's literary associates when they left Oxford for London.Dover Wilson, John. John Lyly, Macmillan and Bowes, Cambridge, 1905. Starting in 1580, Lyly received control over the Blackfriars Theatre having his plays performed by the Children of Paul‚Äôs in the presence of the Queen. Two years later a letter from Lyly to the treasurer, dated July 1582, protests against an accusation of dishonesty which had brought him into trouble with his friend and patron, Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, and demands a personal interview in order to clear his name. However, neither from Burghley nor from Queen Elizabeth I did Lyly ever receive any substantial patronage. He began his literary career by the composition of Euphues, or the Anatomy of Wit, which was licensed to Gabriel Cawood in December 1578 and published in the spring of 1579. In the same year he was incorporated M.A. at the University of Cambridge, and possibly saw his hopes of court advancement dashed by the appointment in July of Edmund Tylney to the office of Master of the Revels, a post at which he had been aiming. Euphues and his England appeared in 1580, and, like the first part of the book, won immediate popularity. For a time Lyly was the most successful and fashionable of English writers, hailed as the author of \\"a new English\\", as a \\"raffineur de l'Anglois\\"; and, as Edward Blount, the editor of his plays, wrote in 1632, \\"that beautie in court which could not parley Euphuism was as little regarded as she which nowe there speakes not French\\". After the publication of Euphues Lyly seems to have entirely deserted the novel form, which was much imitated (e.g., by Barnabe Rich in his Second Tome of the Travels and Adventures of Don Simonides, 1584), and to have thrown himself almost exclusively into play-writing, probably still with a view to the mastership of revels. His Campaspe and Sapho were produced at Court in 1582,The Complete Works of John Lyly. R. W. Bond, 3 Vols. Clarendon Press. ii. p. 230. perhaps through the earl of Oxford's station as Lord High Chamberlain. In total, probably eight Lyly plays were acted before the queen by the Children of the Chapel and especially by the Children of Paul's between the years 1584 and 1591, one or two of them being repeated before a popular audience at the Blackfriars Theatre. Their brisk lively dialogue, classical colour and frequent allusions to persons and events of the day maintained that popularity with the court which Euphues had won. Lyly sat in parliament as a member for Hindon in Wiltshire in 1580, for Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire in 1593, for Appleby in Westmorland in 1597 and for Aylesbury a second time in 1601. In 1589 Lyly published a tract in the Martin Marprelate controversy, called Pappe with an hatchet, alias a figge for my Godsonne; Or Crack me this nut; Or a Countrie Cuffe, etc. Though published anonymously, the evidence for his authorship of the tract may be found in Gabriel Harvey's Pierce's Supererogation (written November 1589, published 1593), in Nashe's Have with You to Saffron-Walden (1596), and in various allusions in Lyly's own plays.See Frederick William Fairholt's Dramatic Works of John Lilly, i. 20. About the same time he probably made his first petition to Queen Elizabeth. The two petitions, transcripts of which are extant among the Harleian manuscripts, are undated, but in the first of them he speaks of having been ten years hanging about the court in hope of preferment, and in the second he extends the period to thirteen years. It may be conjectured with great probability that the ten years date from 1579, when Tylney was appointed Master of the Revels with a tacit understanding that Lyly was to have the next reversion of the post. \\"I was entertained your Majestie's servaunt by your own gratious favor\\", he says, \\"strengthened with condicions that I should ayme all my courses at the Revells (I dare not say with a promise, but with a hopeful Item to the Revercion) for which these ten yeres I have attended with an unwearyed patience\\". But in 1589 or 1590 the mastership of the revels was as far off as ever‚ÄîTylney in fact held the post for thirty-one years. In the second petition of 1593, Lyly wrote \\"Thirteen yeres your highnes servant but yet nothing. Twenty friends that though they saye they will be sure, I finde them sure to be slowe. A thousand hopes, but all nothing; a hundred promises but yet nothing. Thus casting up the inventory of my friends, hopes, promises and tymes, the summa totalis amounteth to just nothing\\". What may have been Lyly's subsequent fortunes at court are unknown. Blount says vaguely that Elizabeth \\"graced and rewarded\\" him, but of this there is no other evidence. After 1590 his works steadily declined in influence and reputation; he died poor and neglected in the early part of the reign of James I. At the end of his life, he became a Parliament member for Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs court, serving on a committee about the wine abuse reformation in 1598. Shakespeare‚Äôs A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream and As You Like It are seen to have drawn influence from Lyly‚Äôs work. In November 1606, Lyly died from disease. He was buried in London at St Bartholomew-the-Less on 20 November 1606. He was married, and he had two sons and a daughter. Although Euphues was Lyly's most popular and influential work in the Elizabethan period, his plays are now admired for their flexible use of dramatic prose and the elegant patterning of their construction.The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 p. 618 The proverb \\"All is fair in love and war\\" has been attributed to Lyly's Euphues.Manser, M, and George Latimer Apperson.

Comedies In 1632 Blount published Six Court Comedies, the first printed collection of Lyly's plays. They appear in the text in the following order; the parenthetical date indicates the year they appeared separately in quarto form: * Endymion (1591) * Campaspe (1584) * Sapho and Phao (1584) * Gallathea (1592) * Midas (1592) * Mother Bombie (1594) Title page of The Woman in the Moon, 1597 Lyly's other plays include Love's Metamorphosis (though printed in 1601, possibly Lyly's earliest play‚Äîthe surviving version is likely a revision of the original), and The Woman in the Moon, first printed in 1597. Of these, all but the last are in prose. A Warning for Faire Women (1599) and The Maid's Metamorphosis (1600) have been attributed to Lyly, but on altogether insufficient grounds. The first editions of all these plays were issued between 1584 and 1601, and the majority of them between 1584 and 1592, in what were Lyly's most successful and popular years. His importance as a dramatist has been very differently estimated. Lyly's dialogue is still a long way removed from the dialogue of Shakespeare. But at the same time it is a great advance in rapidity and resource upon anything which had gone before it; it represents an important step in English dramatic art. His nimbleness, and the wit which struggles with his pedantry, found their full development in the dialogue of Twelfth Night and Much Ado about Nothing, just as \\"Marlowe's mighty line\\" led up to and was eclipsed by the majesty and music of Shakespearean passion. One or two of the songs introduced into his plays are justly famous and show a real lyrical gift. Nor in estimating his dramatic position and his effect upon his time must it be forgotten that his classical and mythological plots, flavourless and dull as they would be to a modern audience, were charged with interest to those courtly hearers who saw in Midas Philip II, Elizabeth in Cynthia and perhaps Leicester's unwelcome marriage with Lady Sheffield in the love affair between Endymion and Tellus which brings the former under Cynthia's displeasure. As a matter of fact his reputation and popularity as a playwright were considerable. Harvey dreaded lest Lyly should make a play upon their quarrel; Francis Meres, as is well known, places him among \\"the best for comedy\\"; and Ben Jonson names him among those foremost rivals who were \\"outshone\\" and outsung by Shakespeare. Lyly must also be considered and remembered as a primary influence on the plays of William Shakespeare, and in particular the romantic comedies. Love's Metamorphosis is a large influence on Love's Labour's Lost, and Gallathea is a major source for A Midsummer Night's Dream. In 2007, Primavera Productions in London staged a reading of Gallathea, directed by Tom Littler, consciously linking it to Shakespeare's plays. They also claim an influence on Twelfth Night and As You Like It. In addition to the plays, Lyly also composed at least one \\"entertainment\\" (a show that combined elements of masque and drama) for Queen Elizabeth; The Entertainment at Chiswick was staged on 28 and 29 July 1602. Lyly has been suggested as the author of several other royal entertainments of the 1590s, most notably The Entertainment at Mitcham performed on 13 September 1598.Logan, Terence P., and Denzell S.

The name is the jocular complement of the MIT Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS). ITS, and the software developed on it, were technically influential far beyond their core user community. Remote \\"guest\\" or \\"tourist\\" access was easily available via the early ARPAnet, allowing many interested parties to informally try out features of the operating system and application programs. The software environment of ITS was a major influence on the hacker culture, as described in Steven Levy's book Hackers. History ITS development was initiated in the late 1960s by those (the majority of the MIT AI Lab staff at that time) who disagreed with the direction taken by Project MAC's Multics project (which had started in the mid-1960s), particularly such decisions as the inclusion of powerful system security. The name was chosen by Tom Knight as a joke on the name of the earliest MIT time- sharing operating system, the Compatible Time-Sharing System, which dated from the early 1960s. By simplifying their system compared to Multics, ITS's authors were able to quickly produce a functional operating system for their lab. ITS was written in assembly language, originally for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-6 computer, but the majority of ITS development and use was on the later, largely compatible, PDP-10. Although not used as intensively after about 1986, ITS continued to operate at MIT until 1990, and then until 1995 at Stacken Computer Club in Sweden. Significant technical features ITS introduced many then-new features: * The first device- independent graphics terminal output; programs generated generic commands to control screen content, which the system automatically translated into the appropriate character sequences for the particular type of terminal operated by the user. * A general mechanism for implementing virtual devices in software running in user processes (which were called \\"jobs\\" in ITS). * Using the virtual-device mechanism, ITS provided transparent inter-machine filesystem access. The ITS machines were all connected to the ARPAnet, and a user on one machine could perform the same operations with files on other ITS machines as if they were local files. * Sophisticated process management; user processes were organized in a tree, and a superior process could control a large number of inferior processes. Any inferior process could be frozen at any point in its operation, and its state (including contents of the registers) examined; the process could then be resumed transparently. * An advanced software interrupt facility that allowed user processes to operate asynchronously, using complex interrupt handling mechanisms. * PCLSRing, a mechanism providing what appeared (to user processes) to be quasi-atomic, safely-interruptible system calls. No process could ever observe any process (including itself) in the middle of executing any system call. * In support of the AI Lab's robotics work, ITS also supported simultaneous real-time and time-sharing operation. User environment The environment seen by ITS users was philosophically significantly different from that provided by most operating systems at the time. * Initially there were no passwords, and a user could work on ITS without logging on. Logging on was considered polite, though, so people knew when one was connected. * To deal with a rash of incidents where users sought out flaws in the system in order to crash it, a novel approach was taken. A command that caused the system to crash was implemented and could be run by anyone, which took away all the fun and challenge of doing so. It did, however, broadcast a message to say who was doing it. * All files were editable by all users, including online documentation and source code. * All users could talk with instant messaging on another's terminal, or they could use a command (SHOUT) to ask all active users for help. * Users could see what was happening on another's terminal (using a command called OS for \\"output spy\\"). A target of OS could detect and kill it using another command called JEDGAR, named after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. This facility was later disabled in an interesting way: it looked like the remote session was killed, but it was not. * Tourists (guest users either at MIT AI Lab terminals, or over the ARPAnet) were tolerated and occasionally encouraged to actively join the ITS community. Informal policy on tourist access was later formalized in a written policy. Ease of access, with or without a guest account, allowed interested parties to informally explore and experiment with the operating system, application programs, and \\"hacker\\" culture. Working copies of documentation and source code could be freely consulted or updated by anybody on the system. The wide-open ITS philosophy and collaborative community were the direct forerunner of the free and open- source software, open-design, and Wiki movements. Important applications developed on ITS The EMACS (\\"Editor MACroS\\") editor was originally written on ITS. In its ITS instantiation it was a collection of TECO programs (called \\"macros\\"). For later operating systems it was written in the common language of those systems ‚Äì for example, the C language under Unix, and Zetalisp under the Lisp Machine system. GNU‚Äòs info help system was originally an EMACS subsystem, and then was later written as a complete standalone system for Unix-like machines. Several important programming languages and systems were developed on ITS, including MacLisp (the precursor of Zetalisp and Common Lisp), Microplanner (implemented in MacLisp), MDL (which became the basis of Infocom's programming environment), and Scheme. Among other significant and influential software subsystems developed on ITS, the Macsyma symbolic algebra system is probably the most important. Terry Winograd's SHRDLU program was developed in ITS. The computer game Zork was also originally written on ITS. Richard Greenblatt's Mac Hack VI was the top-rated chess program for years and was the first to display a graphical board representation. Miscellaneous The default ITS top-level command interpreter was the PDP-10 machine language debugger (DDT). The usual text editor on ITS was TECO and later Emacs, which was written in TECO. Both DDT and TECO were implemented through simple dispatch tables on single-letter commands, and thus had no true syntax. The ITS task manager was called PEEK. The local spelling \\"TURIST\\" is an artifact of six-character filename (and other identifier) limitations, which is traceable to six SIXBIT encoded characters fitting into a single 36-bit PDP-10 word. \\"TURIST\\" may also have been a pun on Alan Turing, a pioneer of theoretical computer science. The less-complimentary term \\"LUSER\\" was also applied to guest users, especially those who repeatedly engaged in clueless or vandalous behavior. The Jargon File started as a combined effort between people on the ITS machines at MIT and at Stanford University SAIL. The document described much of the terminology, puns, and culture of the two AI Labs and related research groups, and is the direct predecessor of the Hacker's Dictionary.

Biography Born in Trece√±o in the province of Cantabria, he spent some of his youth at the court of Isabella I of Castile. In 1528 he entered the Franciscan order, and afterwards accompanied Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, during his journeys to Italy and other parts of Europe. He successively held the offices of Charles V's court preacher, court historiographer, Bishop of Guadix, Bishop of Mondo√±edo and Charles V's counselor. His earliest work, entitled The Dial of Princes (Reloj de pr√≠ncipes in its original Spanish), published at Valladolid in 1529, and, according to its author, the fruit of eleven years' labour, is a mirror for princes in the form of a didactic novel, designed after the manner of Xenophon's Cyropaedia, to delineate in a somewhat ideal way, for the benefit of modern sovereigns, the life and character of an ancient prince, Marcus Aurelius, distinguished for wisdom and virtue. It was often reprinted in Spanish; and it so speedily attained fame that before the close of the century there were published several translations in Latin, Italian, French, German, Dutch and English. The two earliest English translations are by J Bourchier (London, 1546) and by Thomas North. There is another version of this text, either earlier or later, Libro Aureo which Jos√© Luis Alberg claims Guevara did not want published, and which came out around the same time. That version in its definitive form was published by the great French Hispanist in 1929. It is difficult now to account for the extraordinary popularity of the work. It gave rise to a great literary controversy, the author having tried to claim it as historically accurate, appealing to an imaginary \\"manuscript in Florence.\\" Other works of Guevara are the D√©cada de los C√©sares (Valladolid, 1539), or \\"Lives of the Ten Roman Emperors,\\" in imitation of the manner of Plutarch and Suetonius; and the Ep√≠stolas familiares (Valladolid, 1539‚Äì1545), sometimes called \\"The Golden Letters,\\" often printed in Spain, and translated into all the principal languages of Europe. They are in reality a collection of stiff and formal essays which have long ago fallen into merited oblivion. Guevara, whose influence upon the Spanish prose of the 16th century was considerable, also wrote Libro de los inventores del arte de marear (Valladolid, 1539, and Madrid, 1895). In the same year, Guevara wrote a work of crucial importance called ‚ÄúAviso de privados y doctrina de cortesanos‚Äù. In this work, Guevara laid the foundations for the concept of the courtier, and thus, also for the 'court society' described by the seminal and namesake work by Nobert Elias. Guevara, who most certainly had read \\"Il Cortegiano\\" (1518) by Baldassare Castiglione‚Äîwhom Charles V called the greatest courtier of his age‚Äîbrought a different aspect to the figure of the courtier: while the latter's work was a 'behavioral' guide, Guevara described the practical aspects of men surrounding a monarch and differentiated their duties from those who were part of religious orders, in a famous passage in Chapter 1: \\"En la Religi√≥n si se levanta a media noche, es por loar al Se√±or en el culto Divino; mas en la Corte infinitas veces trasnochan, no por m√°s de cumplir con el mundo.\\" (As far as religion is concerned, if one wakes up in the middle of night, it is to laud the Lord in the Divine worship. But at the court, they stay awake all night infinite times, for no other reason than to keep up with the world [el mundo: people/the world, i.e. the world that counts]). Besides the above- mentioned controversy, there was another regarding the two chapters on the Danubian Farmer, which appeared in different versions both in the Libro √°ureo and the Reloj de pr√≠ncipes in which, it has been argued, the Farmer is a metaphor for the New World indigenous peoples and the Roman Empire is nothing less than the Spanish Empire. Antonio died in Mondo√±edo. He was the cousin of Diego de Guevara. Works *Libro √°ureo de Marco Aurelio (Sevilla, 1528). *The Diall of Princes, translated by Sir Thomas North, abridged by K. N.

Early life He was born in London. His father, who was of a German family (the name was originally Fahrholz), was a tobacco manufacturer, and Frederick was at first employed in the business. He then worked as a drawing-master, and later as a scene-painter. Ink copies made by him of figures from William Hogarth's plates led to his being employed by Charles Knight on several of his illustrated publications. Career His first published literary work was a contribution to Hone's Year-Book in 1831. His life was one of almost uninterrupted quiet labour, carried on until within a few days of death. Several works on civic pageantry and some collections of ancient unpublished songs and dialogues were edited by him for the Percy Society in 1842. In 1844 he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He published an edition of the dramatic works of John Lyly in 1858. His principal works are Tobacco, its History and Association (1859); Gog and Magog (1860); Up the Nile and Home Again (1862); many articles and serials contributed to the Art Journal, some of which were afterwards separately published, as Costume in England (1846); Dictionary of Terms in Art (1854). These works are illustrated by numerous cuts, drawn on the wood by his own hand. He also illustrated Evans's Coins of the Ancient Britons, Frederic William Madden's Jewish Coinage, Halliwell's folio Shakespeare and his Sir John Maundeville, Charles Roach Smith's Richborough, the Miscellanea Graphica of Lord Londesborough, and many other works. Later life Fairholt died in 1866 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Legacy His books relating to Shakespeare were bequeathed to the library at Stratford-on-Avon; those on civic pageantry (between 200 and 300 volumes) to the Society of Antiquaries; his old prints and works on costume to the British Museum; his general library he desired to be sold and the proceeds devoted to the Royal Literary Fund.

Within six weeks, approximately 13,000 French men and women were slain by the rebels, and the government of Charles lost control of the island. This began the War of the Sicilian Vespers.  Background  = The papacy versus the House of Hohenstaufen = The rising had its origin in the struggle of investiture between the pope and the Hohenstaufen Holy Roman Emperors for control of Italy, especially the Church's private demesne known as the Papal States. These lay between Hohenstaufen lands in northern Italy and the Hohenstaufen Kingdom of Sicily in the south; the Hohenstaufen also at the time ruled Germany. In 1245 Pope Innocent IV excommunicated Frederick II and declared him deposed, and roused opposition against him in Germany and Italy. When Frederick died in 1250, his dominion was inherited by his son, Conrad IV of Germany. A period of turmoil followed Conrad's death in 1254, and the Kingdom of Sicily was seized by Manfred, King of Sicily, Frederick's illegitimate son, who reigned from 1258 to 1266. Manfred had no involvement in German politics, where the interregnum lasted longer and there was no emperor until 1274. He first styled himself as vicar of his nephew Conradin, Conrad's son.Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, pp. 16ff. However, following a false rumor that Conradin was dead, Manfred had himself crowned king. He wished for a reconciliation with the papacy, which may have explained his support for the landless Baldwin II, Latin Emperor. However, Pope Urban IV and later Pope Clement IV were not prepared to recognize Manfred as lawful ruler of Sicily and first excommunicated him, then sought to depose him by force of arms. After abortive attempts to enlist England as the champion of the Papacy against Manfred,Pope Alexander IV literally shopped around for a buyer for the crown of Sicily. In 1256 King Henry III of England agreed to buy the crown for his son Edmund for 135,541 German marks. He raised secular and church taxes in England and paid the Pope 60,000 marks, but could raise no more. The people and clergy of England refused to be taxed any further to enable an English prince to sit on the Sicilian throne. On December 18, 1258, Pope Alexander issued a bull releasing Henry from his obligation to buy the throne, but he kept the 60,000 marks already paid (cf. Runciman, Chapter 4) Urban IV settled on the later Charles I of Naples as his candidate for the Sicilian throne. Charles invaded Italy and defeated and killed Manfred in 1266 at the Battle of Benevento, becoming King of Sicily. In 1268 Conradin, who had meanwhile come of age, invaded Italy to press his claim to the throne, but he was defeated at the Battle of Tagliacozzo and executed afterwards. Charles was now undisputed master of the Kingdom of Sicily. = Charles of Anjou and Sicilian unrest = Charles regarded his Sicilian territories as a springboard for his Mediterranean ambitions, which included the overthrow of Michael VIII Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire and the capture of Constantinople. Once the richest city in the western world, Constantinople was attacked and plundered during the Fourth Crusade and further subjugated, reduced in population and stripped of its art and treasures for the next 57 years under the rule of the Latin Empire. With the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, Michael VIII Palaiologos continued to rebuild what was left of the economically strategic city as an important trade route to Europe. Unrest simmered in Sicily because of its very subordinate role in Charles' empire-- its nobles had no share in the government of their own island and were not compensated by lucrative posts abroad, as were Charles' French, Proven√ßal and Neapolitan subjects; also, Charles spent the heavy taxes he imposed on wars outside Sicily, making Sicily somewhat of a donor economy to Charles' nascent empire. As Steven Runciman put it, \\"[The Sicilians] saw themselves now being ruled to enable an alien tyrant make conquests from which they would have no benefit\\" Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 212. The unrest was also fomented by Byzantine agents to thwart Charles' projected invasion and by King Peter III of Aragon, Manfred's son-in-law, who saw his wife Constance as rightful heir to the Sicilian throne.  The uprising  The church of the Holy Spirit in Palermo. The event takes its name from an insurrection which began at the start of Vespers, the sunset prayer marking the beginning of the night vigil on Easter Monday, 30 March 1282, at the Church of the Holy Spirit just outside Palermo.Because the city's borders have expanded over the centuries, the church is now within the city limits. Beginning on that night, thousands of Sicily's French inhabitants were massacred within six weeks. The events that started the uprising are not known for certain, but the various retellings have common elements. According to Steven Runciman, the Sicilians at the church were engaged in holiday festivities and a group of French officials came by to join in and began to drink. A sergeant named Drouet dragged a young married woman from the crowd, pestering her with his advances. Her husband then attacked Drouet with a knife, killing him. When the other Frenchmen tried to avenge their comrade, the Sicilian crowd fell upon them, killing them all. At that moment all the church bells in Palermo began to ring for Vespers. Runciman describes the mood of the night: According to Leonardo Bruni (1416), the Palermitans were holding a festival outside the city when the French came up to check for weapons, and on that pretext began to fondle the breasts of their women. This then began a riot. The French were attacked, first with rocks, then weapons, and all were killed. The news spread to other cities leading to revolt throughout Sicily. \\"By the time the furious anger at their insolence had drunk its fill of blood, the French had given up to the Sicilians not only their ill-gotten riches but their lives as well.\\" There is also a third version of the events that is quite close to Runciman's, varying only in the minor details. This story is part of the oral tradition on the island up to the present time. This oral tradition cannot be verified, but is of interest to sociologists.Tournatore, Matteo G. C., Arba Sicula (Sicilian Dawn), Journal of Sicilian Folklore and Literature, Vol XXV, Numira 1 & 2, pp. 47ff. According to the legend, John of Procida was the mastermind behind the conspiracy. It seems that he was in contact with both Michael VIII Palaiologos and Peter III of Aragon. All three were later excommunicated by Pope Martin IV in 1282. Immediate aftermath After leaders were elected in Palermo, messengers spread word across the island for the rebels to strike before the French had time to organise resistance. In a fortnight the rebels gained control over most of the island, and within six weeks it was all under rebel control, except for Messina which was well fortified, and whose leading family, the Riso, remained faithful to Charles. But on 28 April it too broke into open revolt under the command of Captain of the People and, most significantly, the islanders' first act was to set fire to Charles's fleet in the harbor.Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 218. It is reported that upon hearing of the fleet's destruction, King Charles exclaimed \\"Lord God, since it has pleased You to ruin my fortune, let me only go down in small steps.\\"Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 220. Charles' Vicar Herbert and his family were safely within castle Mategriffon, but after negotiations the rebels granted Herbert and his family safe conduct to leave the island upon a promise that they never return. After the restoration of order in the city, the townsmen announced themselves a free commune answerable only to the pope. They elected leaders, one of whom was Bartholomaeus of Neocastro who was prominent in the unfolding events and would later chronicle much of the revolt in Historia Sicula, an important if sometimes contradictory source of information for historians. Again significantly, the leaders' next act was to send word, via a Genoese merchant named Alafranco Cassano, to the Emperor Michael advising him that his nemesis Charles had been crippled.Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 219. Only thereafter were ambassadors sent to Pope Martin IV pleading for each city on the island to be recognised as a free commune under the sole suzerainty of the Holy Church. The islanders were hoping for status such as enjoyed by Venice, Genoa, Pisa and other cities, free to form their own government, but morally answerable only to the pope who would hold a vague and unstable suzerainty.Runciman, Sicilian Vespers p. 216, citing Nicholas Specialis, Historia Sicula, pp. 924ff. However, the French pope was firmly in Charles' camp and he directed the Sicilians to recognize Charles as their rightful king.Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 214. Aragonese intervention Peter III Aragon, in Sicily during Vespri siciliani (1282). We can see him accompanied by his wife and her royal maids, to claim her legal rights to the throne. \\"Arrivo Aragonesi\\" (Biblioteca Vaticana) After the pope refused the rebels' pleas to allow the status of free communes, the Sicilians sent for Peter III of Aragon, whose wife Constance was Manfred, King of Sicily's daughter, Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor's great-granddaughter and the sole surviving heir of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was not in captivity and was in a position to assert her rights. Peter III championed his wife's claim to the entirety of the Kingdom of Sicily.Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 201. Before the Vespers, Peter III constructed and outfitted a fleet for war. When the pope asked why he needed such a great war fleet, Peter stated that it would be used against the followers of Islam along the northern coast of Africa, because he had legitimate trade interests there and needed to protect them. So when Peter received a request for help from the Sicilians he was conveniently on the north coast of Africa in Tunis, just 200 miles across the sea from the island. At first, Peter feigned indifference to the request of the Sicilians and their plight, but after several days to allow a proper showing of deference made for the pope's consumption, he took advantage of the revolt. Peter ordered his fleet to sail for Sicily, landed at Trapani on 30 August 1282. While he marched towards Palermo, his fleet followed close by the coastal road. Peter III of Aragon's involvement changed the character of the uprising from a local revolt into a European War.See Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 227, citing Bartholomew of Neocastro, Historia Sicula, p. 24. Peter arrived at Palermo on September 2 and initially he was received by the populace with indifference, as merely one foreign king replacing another. However, after Pope Martin made plain his orders for the populace to accept Charles, Peter promised the islanders that they would enjoy the ancient privileges they had had under the Norman king, William II of Sicily. Thereafter, he was accepted as a satisfactory second choice and was crowned by acclamation of the people at the cathedral in Palermo on September 4, thus becoming also Peter I of Sicily.Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 228. With the pope's blessing, the counterattack from Charles was not long in coming; his fleet from the Kingdom of Naples arrived and blockaded the port of Messina and made several attempts to land troops on the island, but all were repulsed.  Michael Palaeologus' Commentary Years later, in his autobiography, Michael VIII wrote: \\"Should I dare to claim that I was God's instrument to bring freedom to the Sicilians, then I should only be stating the truth.\\"M. Palaeologus, De Vita sua Opusculum, 9, IX, pp. 537‚Äì38. But as Runciman observes, with or without Byzantine gold, it was the proud people of Sicily alone who fought against their armed oppressor; and \\"However it may have been plotted and prepared, it was that one March evening of the Vespers at Palermo that brought down King Charles' empire.\\"Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 256.

Whether it is a contemporary narrative or not hinges on the interpretation of one word in the text. Runciman (p. 329) describes these words as \\"putirini\\", the first person plural, vs \\"putirisi\\" the impersonal tense. *The earliest narrative source for the Vespers is the Sicilian language Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia, written perhaps as early as 1287. It credits John of Procida with organising the overthrow of the French and portrays him in a positive light. Two later Tuscan Guelph histories, the Liber Jani de Procida et Palialoco and the Leggenda di Messer Gianni di Procida, possibly relying on the Rebellamentu or the Rebellamentus lost source, follow it in stressing John's involvement, but they portray him in a more critical light. The Liber, as its title suggests, emphasises John's negotiations with Michael VIII (\\"Palioloco\\"). *Besides these there are two Florentine chronicles of importance. The Leggenda was once thought to be a source for the Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani, itself a source for the Vespers. Brunetto Latini, in his Tesoro, similarly adopts the Sicilian version of events, which includes the earliest version of the rape. The Tuscan Liber turns the rape story around, suggesting the Sicilian woman had pulled a knife on her French suitor when his friends came to aid him. Sicilian Vespers (1846), by Francesco Hayez. * .

However, this is very unlikely as Sicilians did not consider themselves to be Italians in the 13th century. The first reference to the term Mafia dates from 1862. The claim that the Mafia originated as a secret society that had allegedly organised and led the uprising of 1282 was propagated by Mafiosi in the 19th and 20th centuries to promote the Mafia's self-image as the romantic and chivalrous defenders of ordinary Sicilians against foreign oppressors.Cawthorne Nigel Mafia: The History of the Mob, London: Arcturus, 2012 p.13-14 This origins story came to be believed by Mafiosi themselves with for example the American Mafiosi Joseph Bonanno telling his friends and family when asked about the origin of the Mafia that it began with the Sicilian Vespers.Cawthorne Nigel Mafia: The History of the Mob, London: Arcturus, 2012 p.13-14 The fact that many Sicilians considered the Piedmont-dominated Italian state that emerged after Italian unification in 1861 to be a sort of foreign occupation gave the Mafia a strong reason to promote this image to capitalise on the widespread resentment felt by people in the Mezzogiorno about the way that the Piedmontese monopolised power in the new state.Cawthorne Nigel Mafia: The History of the Mob, London: Arcturus, 2012 p.14-15 Hence the story about Mafia as the leaders of the Sicilian Vespers was invented, with the implication that the Italian state was the latest in a series of foreign oppressors and it would be ignoble for Sicilians to co-operate with the Italian state against the Mafia.Cawthorne Nigel Mafia: The History of the Mob, London: Arcturus, 2012 p.14-15 Other uses of the term *In 1594, when the French King Henry IV was taking some tedious peace negotiations with the Spanish ambassador in France, bored with the unwillingness of the Spaniards to accept his terms, he stated that the King of Spain should behave with more humility, for if not, he could easily invade Spanish territories in Italy, stating that \\"My armies could move so fast that I would have breakfast in Milan and dine in Rome.\\" Whereupon the Spanish ambassador replied \\"Now then, if that is so, Your Majesty would surely make it to Sicily in time for Vespers\\".Runciman, Sicilian Vespers, p. 287. *Having previously arranged the murder of mafia boss Joe Masseria on 15 April 1931 in order to consolidate organized crime in New York City under Salvatore Maranzano, mafia boss Lucky Luciano then ordered the murders of Maranzano and those capos of Maranzano and Masseria whom Luciano saw as threats. These murders allegedly occurred on September 10, 1931 which marked the end of the Castellammarese War in New York City and in mafia parlance is known as the Night of the Sicilian Vespers. This was later proved to be mostly a myth in mafia culture as no hard evidence exists that all these murders ‚Äì outside of Maranzano and a few others ‚Äì actually occurred. *Sicilian-born brothers David and Francis Rifugiato named their short-lived band \\"The Sicilian Vespers\\" after this event.

He was a Tunisian agricultural worker and convicted murderer. He moved to Marseille, France, in 1968 and six years later he kidnapped, tortured and murdered 22-year-old √âlisabeth Bousquet, his former girlfriend. He was sentenced to death in February 1977 and executed by guillotine in September that year. He was the last person to be executed in Western Europe, and he was the last person to be executed by beheading anywhere in the Western world. He was not however, the last person sentenced to death penalty in France. Marcel Chevalier served as chief executioner. (French) Early life Born in Tunisia on 22 September 1949, Djandoubi started living in Marseille in 1968, working in a grocery store. He later worked as a landscaper but had a workplace accident in 1971: his leg got caught in the tracks of a tractor and resulted in the loss of two-thirds of his right leg.C√©dric Condom, Le Dernier Guillotin√©, Plan√®te+ Justice, 2011 (French) In 1973, a 21-year-old woman named √âlisabeth Bousquet, whom Djandoubi had met in the hospital while recovering from his amputation, filed a complaint against him, stating that he had tried to force her into prostitution. Murder of √âlisabeth Bousquet After his arrest and eventual release from custody during the spring of 1973, Djandoubi drew two other young girls into his confidence and then forced them into prostitution for him. On 3 July 1974, he kidnapped Bousquet and took her into his home where, in full view of the terrified girls, he beat the woman before stubbing a lit cigarette all over her breasts and genital area. Bousquet survived the ordeal so he took her by car to the outskirts of Marseille and strangled her there. On his return, Djandoubi warned the two girls to say nothing of what they had seen. Bousquet's body was discovered in a shed by a boy on 7 July 1974. One month later, Djandoubi kidnapped another girl who managed to escape and report him to police. Trial and execution After a lengthy pre-trial process, Djandoubi eventually appeared in court in Aix-en- Provence on charges of torture-murder, rape, and premeditated violence on 24 February 1977. His main defence revolved around the supposed effects of the amputation of his leg six years earlier which his lawyer claimed had driven him to a paroxysm of alcohol abuse and violence, turning him into a different man. On 25 February he was sentenced to death. An appeal against his sentence was rejected on 9 June. In the early morning of 10 September 1977, twelve days before his 28th birthday, Djandoubi was informed that he, like the child murderers Christian Ranucci (executed on 28 July 1976) and J√©r√¥me Carrein (executed on 23 June 1977), had not received a reprieve from President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing. Shortly afterwards, at 4:40 a.m., he was executed by guillotine at Baumettes Prison in Marseille. While Djandoubi was the last person executed in France, he was not the last condemned. (French) No more executions occurred after capital punishment was abolished in France in 1981 following the election of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, and those sentenced to die had their sentences commuted. (French) Djandoubi's death would be the final time any Western nation would ever carry out an execution by beheading, as well as the most recent government-sanctioned guillotine execution in the world.

The Lotus S≈´tra () is one of the most popular and influential Mahayana sutras, and the basis on which the Tiantai, Tendai, Cheontae, and Nichiren schools of Buddhism were established. According to British professor Paul Williams, \\"For many East Asian Buddhists since early times, the Lotus Sutra contains the final teaching of the Buddha, complete and sufficient for salvation.\\"  Title  Lotus Sutra title inscription (daimoku) The earliest known Sanskrit title for the s≈´tra is the , meaning 'Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Fine Dharma'. In English, the shortened form Lotus S≈´tra is common. The Lotus S≈´tra has also been highly regarded in a number of Asian countries where MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism has been traditionally practiced. Translations of this title into the languages of some of these countries include: * (shortened to ). * , My≈çh≈ç Renge Ky≈ç (short: ). * (short: Beophwa gyeong). (short: ). Nichiren (1222-1282) regarded the title as the summary of the Lotus Sutra¬¥s teachings. The chanting of the title as a mantra is the basic religious practice of his school.  Textual history  = Formation = In 1934, based on his text- critical analysis of Chinese and Sanskrit versions, Kogaku Fuse concluded that the Lotus S≈´tra was composed in four main stages. According to Fuse, the verse sections of chapters 1-9 and 17 were probably composed in the 1st century BCE, with the prose sections of these chapters added in the 1st century CE. He estimates the date of the 3rd stage (ch. 10, 11, 13-16, 18-20 and 27) to be around 100 CE, and the last stage (ch. 21-26), around 150 CE. According to Stephen F. Teiser and Jacqueline Stone, there is consensus about the stages of composition but not about the dating of these strata. Tamura argues that the first stage of composition (ch. 2-9) was completed around 50 CE and expanded by chapters 10-21 around 100 CE. He dates the third stage (ch. 22-27) around 150 CE. Karashima proposes another modified version of Fuse's hypothesis with the following sequence of composition: *Chapters 2‚Äì9 form the earliest stratum. **The first layer of this stratum includes the tristubh verses of these chapters which may have been transmitted orally in a Prakrit dialect. **The second layer consists of the sloka verses and the prose of chapters 2-9. *Chapters 1, 10‚Äì20, 27, and a part of chapter 5 that is missing in Kumarajiva's translation. *Chapters 21‚Äì26 and the section on Devadatta in chapter 11 of the Sanskrit version. = Translations into Chinese = Three translations of the Lotus S≈´tra into Chinese are extant. The Lotus S≈´tra was originally translated from Sanskrit into Chinese by ¬¥s team in 286 CE in Chang'an during the Western Jin Period (265-317 CE). However, the view that there is a high degree of probability that the base text for that translation was actually written in a Prakrit language has gained widespread acceptance. It may have originally been composed in a Prakrit dialect and then later translated into Sanskrit to lend it greater respectability. This early translation by Dharmarak·π£a was superseded by a translation in seven fascicles by KumƒÅrajƒ´va¬¥s team in 406 CE.Taisho vol. 9, no. 262, CBETA According to Jean-No√´l Robert, KumƒÅrajƒ´va relied heavily on the earlier version. The Sanskrit editions are not widely used outside of academia. The Supplemented Lotus S≈´tra of the Wonderful Dharma (TiƒÅn P«ên Mi√†of«é Li√°nhu√° Jƒ´ng), in 7 volumes and 27 chapters, is a revised version of Kumarajiva's text, translated by Jnanagupta and Dharmagupta in 601 CE. In some East Asian traditions, the Lotus S≈´tra has been compiled together with two other sutras which serve as a prologue and epilogue: # the Innumerable Meanings Sutra (; Japanese: ); and # the Samantabhadra Meditation Sutra (; Japanese: ). This composite sutra is often called the Threefold Lotus S≈´tra or Three-Part Dharma Flower Sutra (; Japanese: ). =Translations into Western languages= Eugene Burnouf's Introduction √† l'histoire du Buddhisme indien (1844) marks the start of modern academic scholarship of Buddhism in the West. His translation of a Nepalese Sanskrit manuscript of the Lotus Sutra, \\"Le Lotus de la bonne loi\\", was published posthumously in 1852. Prior to publication, a chapter from the translation was included in the 1844 journal The Dial, a publication of the New England transcendentalists, translated from French to English by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.Lopez (2016b) A translation of the Lotus Sutra from an ancient Sanskrit manuscript was completed by Hendrik Kern in 1884. Western interest in the Lotus Sutra waned in the latter 19th century as Indo-centric scholars focused on older Pali and Sanskrit texts. However, Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, based predominantly in China, became interested in KumƒÅrajƒ´va's translation of the Lotus Sutra into Chinese. These scholars attempted to draw parallels between the Old and New Testaments to earlier Nikaya sutras and the Lotus Sutra. Abbreviated and \\"christo-centric\\" translations were published by Richard and Soothill. In the post World War II years, scholarly attention to the Lotus Sutra was inspired by renewed interest in Japanese Buddhism as well as archeological research in Dunhuang. This led to the 1976 Leon Hurvitz publication of the Lotus Sutra based on Kumarajiva's translation. Whereas the Hurvitz work was independent scholarship, other modern translations were sponsored by Buddhist groups: Kato Bunno (1975, Nichiren-shu/Rissho-kosei-kai), Murano Senchu (1974, Nichiren-shu), Burton Watson (1993, Soka Gakkai), and the Buddhist Text Translation Society (Xuanhua). The translations into French, Spanish and German are based on Kumarajiva's Chinese text. Each of these translations incorporate different approaches and styles that range from complex to simplified.  Outline  The sutra is presented in the form of a drama consisting of several scenes. According to Sangharakshita, it uses the entire cosmos for its stage, employs a multitude of mythological beings as actors and \\"speaks almost exclusively in the language of images.\\" The Lotus Sutra can be divided into two parts: # Chapters 1‚Äì14 are called the Theoretical Teachings (Japanese: Shakumon). # Chapters 15‚Äì28 are referred to as the Essential Teachings (Japanese: Honmon). The difference between the two lies with the standpoint of who is preaching them. The Theoretical Teachings (ch. 1‚Äì14) are preached from the standpoint of Shakyamuni Buddha, who attained Buddhahood for the first time at the City of Gaya in India. On the other hand, Shakyamuni declares in the Essential Teachings (ch. 15‚Äì28) that his enlightenment in India was provisional, and that he in fact attained Buddhahood in the inconceivably remote past. As result of this (based on the interpretations of the Tiantai/Tendai school and Nichiren Daishonin), all the provisional Buddhas, such as Amida Nyorai, Dainichi Nyorai, and Yakushi Nyorai, were integrated into one single original Buddha. = Chapter 1 = Eagle Peak near Rajagaha was the Buddha‚Äôs favorite retreat and the scene for many of his discourses Chapter 1: Introduction ‚Äì During a gathering at Vulture Peak, Shakyamuni Buddha goes into a state of deep meditative absorption (samadhi), the earth shakes in six ways, and he brings forth a ray of light which illuminates thousands of buddha-fields in the east. Bodhisattva Manjusri then states that the Buddha is about to expound his ultimate teaching. = Chapters 2-9 = Scholars suggest that chapters 2-9 contain the original form of the text. Chapter 2 explains the goals of early Buddhism, the Arhat and the Pratyekabuddha, as expedient means of teaching. The Buddha declares that there exists only one path, leading the bodhisattva to the full awakening of a Buddha. This concept is set forth in detail in chapters 3-9, using parables, narratives of previous existences and prophecies of enlightenment. Chapter 2: Expedient Means ‚Äì Shakyamuni explains his use of skillful means to adapt his teachings according to the capacities of his audience. He reveals that the ultimate purpose of the Buddhas is to cause sentient beings \\"to obtain the insight of the Buddha\\" and \\"to enter the way into the insight of the Buddha.\\" Chapter 3: Simile and Parable ‚Äì The Buddha teaches a parable in which a father uses the promise of various toy carts to get his children out of a burning house. Once they are outside, he gives them all one large cart to travel in instead. This symbolizes how the Buddha uses the Three Vehicles: Arhatship, Pratyekabuddhahood and Samyaksambuddhahood, as skillful means to liberate all beings ‚Äì even though there is only one vehicle. The Buddha also promises Sariputra that he will attain Buddhahood. Chapter 4: Belief and Understanding ‚Äì Four senior disciples address the Buddha. They tell the parable of the poor son and his rich father, who guides him with pedagogically skillful devices to regain self-confidence and \\"recognize his own Buddha-wisdom\\". Chapter 5: The Parable of Medicinal Herbs ‚Äì This parable says that the Dharma is like a great monsoon rain that nourishes many different kinds of plants who represent ≈örƒÅvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas, and all beings receiving the teachings according to their respective capacities. Chapter 6: Bestowal of Prophecy ‚Äì The Buddha prophesies the enlightenment of Mahakasyapa, Subhuti, Mahakatyayana and Mahamaudgalyayana. Chapter 7: The Parable of Phantom City ‚Äì The Buddha teaches a parable about a group of people seeking a great treasure who are tired of their journey and wish to quit. Their guide creates a magical phantom city for them to rest in and then makes it disappear. The Buddha explains that the magic city represents the \\"Hinayana nirvana\\" and the treasure is buddhahood. Chapter 8: Prophecy of Enlightenment for Five Hundred Disciples ‚Äì 500 Arhats are assured of their future Buddhahood. They tell the parable of a man who has fallen asleep after drinking and whose friend sews a jewel into his garment. When he wakes up he continues a life of poverty without realizing he is really rich, he only discovers the jewel after meeting his old friend again. The hidden jewel has been interpreted as a symbol of Buddha-nature. Zimmermann noted the similarity with the nine parables in the TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tra that illustrate how the indwelling Buddha in sentient beings is hidden by negative mental states. Chapter 9: Prophecies Conferred on Learners and Adepts ‚Äì Ananda, Rahula and two thousand ≈örƒÅvakas are assured of their future Buddhahood. = Chapters 10-22 = Chapters 10-22 expound the role of the bodhisattva and the concept of the eternal lifespan and omnipresence of the Buddha. The theme of propagating the Lotus S≈´tra which starts in chapter 10, continues in the remaining chapters. Chapter 10: The Teacher of the Law ‚Äì Presents the practices of teaching the sutra which includes accepting, embracing, reading, reciting, copying, explaining, propagating it, and living in accordance with its teachings. The teacher of the Dharma is praised as the messenger of the Buddha. The floating jeweled stupa; illustrated Lotus Sutra, Japan 1257. Chapter 11: The Emergence of the Treasure Tower ‚Äì A great jeweled stupa rises from the earth and floats in the air; a voice is heard from within praising the Lotus S≈´tra. Another Buddha resides in the tower, the Buddha Prabh≈´taratna who is said to have made a vow to make an appearance to verify the truth of the Lotus Sutra whenever it is preached. Countless manifestations of Shakyamuni Buddha in the ten directions are now summoned by the Buddha. Thereafter Prabh≈´taratna invites Shakyamuni to sit beside him in the jeweled stupa. This chapter reveals the existence of multiple Buddhas at the same time and the doctrine of the eternal nature of Buddhahood. Chapter 12: Devadatta ‚Äì Through the stories of the dragon king's daughter and Devadatta, the Buddha teaches that everyone can become enlightened ‚Äì women, animals, and even the most sinful murderers. Chapter 13: Encouraging Devotion ‚Äì The Buddha encourages all beings to embrace the teachings of the sutra in all times, even in the most difficult ages to come. The Buddha prophecies that 6000 nuns who are also present will become Buddhas. Chapter 14: Peaceful Practices ‚Äì Manjusri asks how a bodhisattva should spread the teaching. In his reply Shakyamuni Buddha describes the proper conduct and the appropriate sphere of relations of a bodhisattva. A bodhisattva should not talk about the faults of other preachers or their teachings. He is encouraged to explain the Mahayana teachings when he answers questions. Virtues such as patience, gentleness, a calm mind, wisdom and compassion are to be cultivated. Chapter 15: Emerging from the Earth ‚Äì In this chapter countless bodhisattvas spring up from the earth, ready to teach, and the Buddha declares that he has trained these bodhisattvas in the remote past. This confuses some disciples including Maitreya, but the Buddha affirms that he has taught all of these bodhisattvas himself. Chapter 16: The Life Span of Thus Come One ‚Äì The Buddha explains that he is truly eternal and omniscient. He then teaches the Parable of the Excellent Physician who entices his sons into taking his medicine by feigning his death. Chapter 17: Distinction in Benefits ‚Äì The Buddha explains that since he has been teaching as many beings as the sands of the Ganges have been saved. Chapter 18: The Benefits of Responding with Joy ‚Äì Faith in the teachings of the sutra brings much merit and lead to good rebirths. Chapter 19: Benefits of the Teacher of the Law - the Buddha praises the merits of those who teach the sutra. They will be able to purify the six senses. Chapter 20: The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging ‚Äì The Buddha tells a story about a previous life when he was a Bodhisattva called sadƒÅparibh≈´ta ('never disparaging') and how he treated every person he met, good or bad, with respect, always remembering that they will become Buddhas. Chapter 21: Supernatural Powers of the Thus Come One ‚Äì Reveals that the sutra contains all of the Eternal Buddha‚Äôs secret spiritual powers. The bodhisattvas who have sprung from the earth (ch. 15) are entrusted with the task of propagating it. Chapter 22: Entrustment ‚Äì The Buddha transmits the Lotus Sutra to all bodhisattvas in his congregation and entrusts them with its safekeeping. The Buddha Prabh≈´taratna in his jeweled stupa and the countless manifestations of Shakyamuni Buddha return to their respective buddha-field. = Chapters 23-28 = Chapter 22: \\"Entrustment\\" ‚Äì the final chapter in the Sanskrit versions and the alternative Chinese translation. Shioiri suggests that an earlier version of the sutra ended with this chapter. He assumes that the chapters 23-28 were inserted later into the Sanskrit version. These chapters are devoted to the worship of bodhisattvas.Lopez (2016), chapter 1 Chapter 23: \\"Former Affairs of Bodhisattva Medicine King\\" ‚Äì the Buddha tells the story of the 'Medicine King' Bodhisattva, who, in a previous life, burnt his body as a supreme offering to a Buddha. The hearing and chanting of the Lotus S≈´tra' is also said to cure diseases. The Buddha uses nine similes to declare that the Lotus S≈´tra is the king of all sutras. Avalokite≈õvara, Ajanta cave no 1, 5th century Chapter 24: The Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound ‚Äì Gadgadasvara ('Wonderful Voice'), a Bodhisattva from a distant world, visits Vulture Peak to worship the Buddha. Bodhisattva 'Wonderful Voice' once made offerings of various kinds of music to the Buddha \\"Cloud-Thunder-King\\". His accumulated merits enable him to take 34 different forms to propagate the Lotus Sutra. Chapter 25, The Universal Gateway of the Bodhisattva Perciever of the World's Sounds ‚Äì The Bodhisattva is devoted to Avalokite≈õvara, describing him as a compassionate bodhisattva who hears the cries of sentient beings, and rescues those who call upon his name. Chapter 26 ‚Äì DhƒÅra·πáƒ´- Hariti and several Bodhisattvas offer sacred dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ ('formulae') in order to protect those who keep and recite the Lotus S≈´tra. Chapter 27 ‚Äì Former Affairs of King Wonderful Adornment - tells the story of the conversion of King 'Wonderful-Adornment' by his two sons. Chapter 28 ‚Äì Encouragement of the Bodhisattva Universal Worthy- a bodhisattva called \\"Universal Virtue\\" asks the Buddha how to preserve the sutra in the future. Samantabhadra promises to protect and guard all those who keep this sutra in the future Age of Dharma Decline.  Teachings  Portable shrine depicting Buddha Sakyamuni preaching the Lotus S≈´tra. The Walters Art Museum. = One vehicle, many skillful means = This Lotus S≈´tra is known for its extensive instruction on the concept and usage of skillful means ‚Äì (Sanskrit: upƒÅya, Japanese: h≈çben), the seventh paramita or perfection of a Bodhisattva ‚Äì mostly in the form of parables. The many 'skillful' or 'expedient' means and the \\"three vehicles\\" are revealed to all be part of the One Vehicle (EkayƒÅna), which is also the Bodhisattva path. This is also one of the first sutras to use the term MahƒÅyƒÅna, or \\"Great Vehicle\\". In the Lotus S≈´tra, the One Vehicle encompasses so many different teachings because the Buddha's compassion and wish to save all beings led him to adapt the teaching to suit many different kinds of people. As Paul Williams explains: > Although the corpus of teachings attributed to the Buddha, if taken as a > whole, embodies many contradictions, these contradictions are only apparent. > Teachings are appropriate to the context in which they are given and thus > their contradictions evaporate. The Buddha‚Äôs teachings are to be used like > ladders, or, to apply an age-old Buddhist image, like a raft employed to > cross a river. There is no point in carrying the raft once the journey has > been completed and its function fulfilled. When used, such a teaching > transcends itself. The sutra emphasizes that all these seemingly different teachings are actually just skillful applications of the one Dharma and thus all constitute the \\"One Buddha Vehicle and knowledge of all modes\\". The Lotus S≈´tra sees all other teachings are subservient to, propagated by and in the service of the ultimate truth of the One Vehicle leading to Buddhahood. The Lotus S≈´tra also claims to be superior to other s≈´tras and states that full Buddhahood is only arrived at by exposure to its teachings and skillful means. = All beings have the potential to become Buddhas = dragon king¬¥s daughter offers her priceless pearl to the Buddha. The narrative of her instantaneous attainment of Buddhahood was understood as a promise of the enlightenment of women. Frontispiece of a 12th century Lotus Sutra handscroll. The One Vehicle doctrine defines the enlightenment of a Buddha (anuttara samyak sambhodi) as the ultimative goal and the sutra predicts that all those who hear the Dharma will eventually achieve this goal. Many of the Buddha¬¥s disciples receive prophecies that they will become future Buddhas. Devadatta, who, according to the Pali texts, had attempted to kill the Buddha, receives a prediction of enlightenment. Even those, who practice only simple forms of devotion, such as paying respect to the Buddha, or drawing a picture of the Buddha, are assured of their future Buddhahood. Although the term buddha-nature (buddhadhatu) is not mentioned once in the Lotus Sutra, Japanese scholars Hajime Nakamura and Akira Hirakawa suggest that the concept is implicitly present in the text. Vasubandhu (fl. 4th to 5th century CE), an influential scholar monk from Ghandara, interpreted the Lotus Sutra as a teaching of buddha-nature and later commentaries tended to adopt this view. Based on his analysis of chapter 5, Zhanran (711-778), a scholar monk of the Chinese Tiantai school, argued that insentient things also possess buddha-nature and in medieval Japan, the Tendai Lotus school developed its concept of original enlightenment which claimed the whole world to be originally enlighted. = The nature of the Buddhas = Another key concept introduced by the Lotus S≈´tra is the idea of the eternal Buddha, who achieved enlightenment innumerable eons ago, but remains in the world to help teach beings the Dharma time and again. The life span of this primordial Buddha is beyond imagination, his biography and his apparent death are portrayed as skillful means to teach sentient beings. The Buddha of the Lotus S≈´tra states: > In this way, since my attainment of Buddhahood it has been a very great > interval of time. My life-span is incalculable asatkhyeyakalpas [rather a > lot of aeons], ever enduring, never perishing. O good men! The life-span I > achieved in my former treading of the bodhisattva path even now is not > exhausted, for it is twice the above number. Yet even now, though in reality > I am not to pass into extinction [enter final nirvana], yet I proclaim that > I am about to accept extinction. By resort to these expedient devices [this > skill-in-means] the Thus Come One [the Tathagata] teaches and converts the > beings. The Buddhas Prabh≈´taratna and Shakyamuni seated side-by-side in the jeweled stupa. Stele, bronze and gold, dated 518 CE The idea that the physical death of a Buddha is the termination of that Buddha is graphically refuted by the appearance of another Buddha, Prabh√ªtaratna, who passed long before. In the vision of the Lotus S≈´tra, Buddhas are ultimately immortal. Crucially, not only are there multiple Buddhas in this view, but an infinite stream of Buddhas extending infinitely in space in the ten directions and through unquantifiable eons of time. The Lotus S≈´tra illustrates a sense of timelessness and the inconceivable, often using large numbers and measurements of time and space. According to Gene Reeves, the Lotus S≈´tra also teaches that the Buddha has many embodiments and these are the countless bodhisattva disciples. These bodhisattvas choose to remain in the world to save all beings and to keep the teaching alive. Reeves writes, \\"because the Buddha and his Dharma are alive in such bodhisattvas, he himself continues to be alive. The fantastically long life of the Buddha, in other words, is at least partly a function of and dependent on his being embodied in others.\\" The Lotus S≈´tra also teaches various dhƒÅra·πáƒ´s or the prayers of different celestial bodhisattvas who out of compassion protect and teach all beings. The lotus flower imagery points to this quality of the bodhisattvas. The lotus symbolizes the bodhisattva who is rooted in the earthly mud and yet flowers above the water in the open air of enlightenment.  Impact  According to Donald Lopez, the Lotus Sutra is \\"arguably the most famous of all Buddhist texts,\\" presenting \\"a radical re-vision of both the Buddhist path and of the person of the Buddha.\\"Jessica Ganga (2016), Donald Lopez on the Lotus Sutra, Princeton University Press Blog The Lotus Sutra was frequently cited in Indian works by Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, Candrakirti, Shantideva and several authors of the Madhyamaka and the Yogacara school. The only extant Indian commentary on the Lotus Sutra is attributed to Vasubandhu. According to Jonathan Silk, the influence of the Lotus S≈´tra in India may have been limited, but \\"it is a prominent scripture in East Asian Buddhism.\\" The sutra has most prominence in Tiantai (sometimes called \\"The Lotus School\\") and Nichiren Buddhism. It is also influential in Zen Buddhism. = China = Tao Sheng, a fifth-century Chinese Buddhist monk wrote the earliest extant commentary on the Lotus S≈´tra. Tao Sheng was known for promoting the concept of Buddha nature and the idea that even deluded people will attain enlightenment. Daoxuan (596-667) of the Tang Dynasty wrote that the Lotus Sutra was \\"the most important sutra in China\\". Zhiyi (538‚Äì597 CE), the generally credited founder of the Tiantai school of Buddhism, was the student of Nanyue Huisi who was the leading authority of his time on the Lotus S≈´tra. Zhiyi's philosophical synthesis saw the Lotus S≈´tra as the final teaching of the Buddha and the highest teaching of Buddhism. He wrote two commentaries on the sutra: Profound meanings of the Lotus S≈´tra and Words and phrases of the Lotus S≈´tra. Zhiyi also linked the teachings of the Lotus S≈´tra with the Buddha nature teachings of the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra and made a distinction between the \\"Eternal Buddha\\" Vairocana and the manifestations. In Tiantai, Vairocana (the primeval Buddha) is seen as the 'Bliss body' ‚Äì SambhogakƒÅya ‚Äì of the historical Gautama Buddha. = Japan = The Lotus S≈´tra is a very important sutra in Tiantai and correspondingly, in Japanese Tendai (founded by Saicho, 767‚Äì822). Tendai Buddhism was the dominant form of mainstream Buddhism in Japan for many years and the influential founders of popular Japanese Buddhist sects including Nichiren, Honen, Shinran and Dogen were trained as Tendai monks. Calligraphic mandala (Gohonzon) inscribed by Nichiren in 1280. The central characters are the title of the Lotus S≈´tra. Nichiren, a 13th-century Japanese Buddhist monk, founded an entire school of Buddhism based on his belief that the Lotus S≈´tra is \\"the Buddha¬¥s ultimate teaching\\", and that the title is the essence of the sutra, \\"the seed of Buddhahood\\". Nichiren held that chanting the title of the Lotus S≈´tra ‚Äì Namu My≈çh≈ç Renge Ky≈ç ‚Äì was the only way to practice Buddhism in the degenerate age of Dharma decline and was the highest practice of Buddhism. Nichiren described chapters 10-22 as the \\"third realm\\" of the Lotus Sutra (Daisan h≈çmon) which emphasizes the need to endure the trials of life and bodhisattva practice of the true law in the real sahƒÅ world. Dogen, the 13th- century Japanese founder of S≈çt≈ç Zen Buddhism, used the Lotus S≈´tra often in his writings. According to Taigen Dan Leighton, \\"While Dogen's writings employ many sources, probably along with his own intuitive meditative awareness, his direct citations of the Lotus S≈´tra indicate his conscious appropriation of its teachings as a significant source\\" and that his writing \\"demonstrates that Dogen himself saw the Lotus Sutra, 'expounded by all buddhas in the three times,' as an important source for this self-proclamatory rhetorical style of expounding.\\" In his Shobogenzo, Dogen directly discusses the Lotus S≈´tra in the essay Hokke-Ten-Hokke, \\"The Dharma Flower Turns the Dharma Flower\\". The essay uses a dialogue from the Platform Sutra between Huineng and a monk who has memorized the Lotus S≈´tra to illustrate the non-dual nature of Dharma practice and sutra study. During his final days, Dogen spent his time reciting and writing the Lotus Sutra in his room which he named \\"The Lotus Sutra Hermitage\\". The Soto Zen monk Ry≈çkan also studied the Lotus S≈´tra extensively and this sutra was the biggest inspiration for his poetry and calligraphy. The Rinzai Zen master Hakuin Ekaku achieved enlightenment while reading the third chapter of the Lotus S≈´tra. According to Shields, \\"modern(ist)\\" interpretations of the Lotus Sutra begin with the early 20th century nationalist applications of the Lotus Sutra by Chigaku Tanaka, Nissho Honda, Seno'o, and Nissh≈ç Inoue. Japanese new religions began forming in the 19th century and the trend accelerated after World War II. Some of these groups have pushed the study of the Lotus Sutra to a global scale. While noting the importance of several Japanese New Religious Movements to Lotus Sutra scholarship, Lopez focuses on the contributions made by the Reiyukai and Soka Gakkai and Stone discusses the contributions of the Soka Gakkai and Rissh≈ç K≈çsei Kai. Etai Yamada (1900‚Äì1999), the 253rd head priest of the Tendai denomination conducted ecumenical dialogues with religious leaders around the world based on his interpretation of the Lotus Sutra which culminated in a 1987 summit. He also used the Lotus Sutra to move his sect from a \\"temple Buddhism\\" perspective to one based on social engagement. Nichiren-inspired Buddhist organizations have shared their interpretations of the Lotus Sutra through publications, academic symposia, and exhibitions. = Influence on East Asian culture = The Buddhas Prabh≈´taratna and Shakyamuni sitting side by side in the jeweled stupa; wall painting, Yulin Caves The Lotus S≈´tra has had a great impact on East Asian literature, art, and folklore for over 1400 years.  Art  Various events from it are depicted in religious art. Wang argues that the explosion of art inspired by the Lotus Sutra, starting from the 7th and 8th centuries in China, was a confluence of text and the topography of the Chinese medieval mind in which the latter dominated. Motifs from the Lotus Sutra figure prominently in the Dunhuang caves built in the Sui era. In the fifth century, the scene of Shakyamuni and Prabhutaratna Buddhas seated together as depicted in the 11th chapter of the Lotus Sutra became arguably the most popular theme in Chinese Buddhist art. Examples can be seen in a bronze plaque (year 686) at Hase-dera Temple in Japan and, in Korea, at Dabotap and Seokgatap Pagodas, built in 751, at Bulguksa Temple.  Literature  Tamura refers to the \\"Lotus Sutra literary genre.\\" Its ideas and images are writ large in great works of Chinese and Japanese literature such as The Dream of the Red Chamber and The Tale of Genji. The Lotus Sutra has had an outsized influence on Japanese Buddhist poetry. Far more poems have been Lotus Sutra-inspired than other sutras. In the work Kanwa taisho myoho renge-kyo, a compendium of more than 120 collections of poetry from the Heian period, there are more than 1360 poems with references to the Lotus Sutra in just their titles.  Folklore  The Lotus Sutra has inspired a branch of folklore based on figures in the sutra or subsequent people who have embraced it. The story of the Dragon King's daughter, who attained enlightenment in the 12th (Devadatta) chapter of the Lotus Sutra, appears in the Complete Tale of Avalokite≈õvara and the Southern Seas and the Precious Scroll of Sudhana and Longn√º folkstories.

The popular character has gone on to influence pop culture, language, and even science. TOC Description A shmoo is shaped like a plump bowling pin with stubby legs. It has smooth skin, eyebrows, and sparse whiskers‚Äîbut no arms, nose, or ears. Its feet are short and round, but dexterous, as the shmoo's comic book adventures make clear. It has a rich gamut of facial expressions and often expresses love by exuding hearts over its head. Cartoonist Al Capp ascribed to the shmoo the following curious characteristics: * They reproduce asexually and are incredibly prolific, multiplying faster than rabbits. They require no sustenance other than air. * Shmoos are delicious to eat, and are eager to be eaten. If a human looks at one hungrily, it will happily immolate itself‚Äîeither by jumping into a frying pan, after which they taste like chicken, or into a broiling pan, after which they taste like steak. When roasted they taste like pork, and when baked they taste like catfish. Raw, they taste like oysters on the half-shell. * They also produce eggs (neatly packaged), milk (bottled, grade-A), and butter‚Äîno churning required. Their pelts make perfect bootleather or house timbers, depending on how thick one slices them. * They have no bones, so there's absolutely no waste. Their eyes make the best suspender buttons, and their whiskers make perfect toothpicks. In short, they are simply the perfect ideal of a subsistence agricultural herd animal. * Naturally gentle, they require minimal care and are ideal playmates for young children. The frolicking of shmoos is so entertaining (such as their staged \\"shmoosical comedies\\") that people no longer feel the need to watch television or go to the movies. * Some of the more tasty varieties of shmoo are more difficult to catch, however. Usually shmoo hunters, now a sport in some parts of the country, use a paper bag, flashlight, and stick to capture their shmoos. At night the light stuns them, then they may be whacked in the head with the stick and put in the bag for frying up later on. The original story In a sequence beginning in late August 1948, Li'l Abner discovers the shmoos when he ventures into the forbidden \\"Valley of the Shmoon\\" following the mysterious and musical sound they make (from which their name derives). Abner is thrown off a cliff and into the valley below by a primitive \\"large gal\\" (as he addresses her), whose job is to guard the valley. (This character is never seen again.) There, against the frantic protestations of a naked, heavily- bearded old man who shepherds the shmoos, Abner befriends the strange and charming creatures. \\"Shmoos\\", the old man warns, \\"is the greatest menace to hoomanity th' world has evah known!\\" \\"Thass becuz they is so bad, huh?\\" asks Li'l Abner. \\"No, stupid\\", answers the man‚Äîand then encapsulates one of life's profound paradoxes: \\"It's because they's so good!!\\". Having discovered their value (\\"Wif these around, nobody won't nevah havta work no more!!\\"), Abner leads the shmoos out of the valley‚Äîwhere they become a sensation in Dogpatch and, quickly, the rest of the world. Captains of industry such as J. Roaringham Fatback, the \\"Pork King\\", become alarmed as sales of nearly all products decline, and in a series of images reminiscent of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the \\"Shmoo Crisis\\" unfolds. On Fatback's orders, a corrupt exterminator orders out \\"Shmooicide Squads\\" to wipe out the shmoos with a variety of firearms, which is depicted in a macabre and comically graphic sequence, with a tearful Li'l Abner misguidedly saluting the supposed \\"authority\\" of the extermination squads. After the shmoos have been eliminated, Dogpatch's extortionate grocer Soft-Hearted John is seen cackling as he displays his wares‚Äîrotting meat and produce: \\"Now them mizzuble starvin' rats has t'come crawlin t'me fo' the necessities o' life!! They complained 'bout mah prices befo'!! Wait'll they see th' new ones!!\\". The exterminator congratulates him. However, it is soon discovered that Abner has secretly saved two shmoos, a \\"boy\\" and a \\"girl\\". The boy shmoo, as a Dogpatch native, is required to run from the girl shmoo in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. (Shmoos usually are portrayed as gender-neutral, although Capp sidesteps this issue for this sequence to allow the comic plot twist.) When \\"he\\" is caught by \\"her\\", in accordance with the rules of the race, they are joined in marriage by Marryin' Sam (whom they \\"pay\\" with a dozen eggs, two pounds of butter, and six cupcakes with chocolate frosting‚Äîall of which Sam reckons to be worth about 98 cents in 1948). The already expanding shmoo family is last seen returning toward the Valley of the Shmoon. The sequence, which ended just before Christmas of 1948, was massively popular, both as a commentary on the state of society and a classic allegory of greed and corruption tarnishing all that is good and innocent in the world. The Shmoo caused an unexpected national sensation, and set the stage for a major licensing phenomenon. In their very few subsequent appearances in Li'l Abner, shmoos also are identified by the U.S. military as a major threat to national security. Origins Al Capp offered his version of the origin of the Shmoo in a wryly satirical article, \\"I Don't Like Shmoos\\", in Cosmopolitan (June 1949): Capp introduced many other allegorical creatures in Li'l Abner over the years‚Äîincluding Bald Iggles, Kigmies, Nogoodniks, Mimikniks, the Money Ha-Ha, Shminks, Abominable Snow-Hams, Gobbleglops, Shtunks and Bashful Bulganiks, among others. Each one highlighted another disquieting facet of human nature‚Äîbut none have ever had quite the same cultural impact as the Shmoo. According to publisher Denis Kitchen: \\"For the rest of his career Capp got countless letters [from] people begging him to bring the Shmoo back. Periodically he would do it but each time it ended the same way‚Äîwith the Shmoo being too good for humanity, and he had to essentially exterminate them again. But there was always one or two who would survive for future plot twists...\\" =Etymology= The origin of Capp's word \\"shmoo\\" has been the subject of debate by linguists for decades. It has been speculated by that shmoo was a thinly veiled phallic symbol, and that the name derives from Yiddish schmuck (schmo) meaning \\"male genitalia\\" or a \\"fool, contemptuous person\\" (Arthur Asa Berger and Allan H. Orrick of Johns Hopkins). Earlier than these academics, Thomas Pyles (U. Florida) had favored the shmuck over the derivation from another Yiddish schmu meaning \\"profit\\", suggested by Leo Spitzer. Spitzer noted the shmoo's providential characteristics (providing eggs and milk) in arguing his hypothesis, further explaining that in Yiddish schmu specifically connoted \\"illicit profit\\", and that the word also giving rise to term schmus \\"tale, gossip\\", whose verb form schmusen or \\"shmoosing\\" (schmooze) has become familiar even to non-Jews. Lilian Mermin Feinsilver assessed this association with shmu \\"illicit profit\\" as \\"pertinent\\", together with the observation that shmue was a taboo Yiddish term for the uterus. It is one of many Yiddish slang variations that would find their way into Li'l Abner. Revealing an important key to the story, Al Capp wrote that the Shmoo metaphorically represented the limitless bounty of the Earth in all its richness‚Äîin essence, Mother Nature herself. In Li'l Abner's words, \\"Shmoos hain't make believe. The hull [whole] earth is one!!\\" Analysis \\"Capp is at his allegorical best in the epics of the Shmoos, and later, the Kigmies\\", wrote comic strip historian Jerry Robinson (in The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art, 1974). \\"Shmoos are the world's most amiable creatures, supplying all man's needs. Like a fertility myth gone berserk, they reproduced so prodigiously they threatened to wreck the economy\\"‚Äîif not western civilization as we know it, and ultimately society itself. Superficially, the Shmoo story concerns a cuddly creature that desires nothing more than to be a boon to humans. Although initially Capp denied or avoided discussion of any satirical intentions (\\"If the Shmoo fits\\", he proclaimed, \\"wear it!\\"), he was widely seen to be stalking bigger game subtextually. The story has social, ethical, and philosophical implications that continue to invite analysis to this day. During the remainder of his life, Capp was seldom interviewed without reference to the nature of the Shmoo story. The mythic tale ends on a deliberately ironic note. Shmoos are officially declared a menace, and systematically hunted down and slaughtered‚Äîbecause they were deemed \\"bad for business\\". The much-copied story line was a parable that was interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the Cold War. Al Capp was even invited to go on a radio show to debate socialist Norman Thomas on the effect of the Shmoo on modern capitalism. \\"After it came out both the left and the right attacked the Shmoo\\", according to publisher Denis Kitchen. \\"Communists thought he was making fun of socialism and Marxism. The right wing thought he was making fun of capitalism and the American way. Capp caught flak from both sides. For him it was an apolitical morality tale about human nature... I think [the Shmoo] was one of those bursts of genius. He was a genius, there's no question about that.\\" Reception The Shmoo inspired hundreds of \\"Shmoo clubs\\" all over North America. College students‚Äîwho had made Capp's invented idea of the Sadie Hawkins dance a universally adopted tradition‚Äîflocked to the Shmoo as well. One school, the University of Bridgeport, even launched the \\"American Society for the Advancement of the Shmoo\\" in early 1949. Licensing history An unexpected‚Äîand virtually unprecedented‚Äîpostwar merchandising phenomenon followed Capp's introduction of the Shmoo in Li'l Abner. As in the strip, shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950‚Äîincluding a Time cover story. They also garnered nearly a full page of coverage (under \\"Economics\\") in the Time International section. Major articles also ran in Newsweek, Life, The New Republic, and countless other publications and newspapers. Virtually overnight, as a Life headline put it, \\"The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck!\\" =Toys and consumer products= A child in West Berlin holding a Shmoo-shaped balloon and sitting on a CARE Package (October 1948) Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in Baltimore turned out a whole line of shmoo apparel, including \\"Shmooveralls\\". In 1948, people danced to the Shmoo Rhumba and the Shmoo Polka. The Shmoo briefly entered everyday language through such phrases as \\"What's Shmoo?\\" and \\"Happy Shmoo Year!\\" Close to a hundred licensed shmoo products from 75 different manufacturers were produced in less than a year, some of which sold five million units each.Newsweek, 5 September 1949; and Editor & Publisher, 16 July 1949 In a single year, shmoo merchandise generated more than $25 million in sales in 1948 dollars (equivalent to $ million in ). The Shmoo was so popular it even replaced Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse as the face of the Children's Savings Bond, issued by the U.S. Treasury Department in 1949. The valid document was colorfully illustrated with Capp's character, and promoted by the Federal Government of the United States with a $16 million advertising campaign budget. According to one article at the time, the Shmoo showed \\"Thrift, loyalty, trust, duty, truth, and common cents [that] add up to aid to his nation\\". Al Capp accompanied President Harry S. Truman at the bond's unveiling ceremony. =Comic books and reprints= The Life and Times of the Shmoo (1948), a paperback collection of the original sequence, was a bestseller for Simon & Schuster and became the first cartoon book to achieve serious literary attention. Distributed to small town magazine racks, it sold 700,000 copies in its first year of publication alone. It was reviewed coast to coast alongside Dwight Eisenhower's Crusade in Europe (the other big publication at the time). The original book and its sequel, The Return of the Shmoo (1959), have been collected in print many times since‚Äîmost recently in 2002‚Äîalways to high sales figures. There was also a separate line of comic books, Al Capp's Shmoo Comics (featuring Washable Jones), published by the Capp family-owned Toby Press. Comics historian and Li'l Abner expert Denis Kitchen recently edited a complete collection of all five original Shmoo Comics, from 1949 and 1950. The book was published by Dark Horse Comics in 2008. Kitchen edited a second Shmoo-related volume for Dark Horse in 2011, on the history of the character in newspaper strips, collectibles, and memorabilia. =Recordings and sheet music= Recordings and published sheet music related to the Shmoos include: Shmoo 78rpm disc * The Shmoo Sings with Earl Rogers (1948) 78 rpm / Allegro * The Shmoo Club b/w The Shmoo Is Clean, the Shmoo Is Neat with Gerald Marks and Justin Stone (1949) 78 rpm / Music You Enjoy, Inc. * The Snuggable, Huggable Shmoo b/w The Shmoo Doesn't Cost a Cent with Gerald Marks and Justin Stone (1949) 78 rpm / Music You Enjoy, Inc. * Shmoo Lesson b/w A Shmoo Can Do Most Anything with Gerald Marks and Justin Stone (1949) 78 rpm / Music You Enjoy, Inc. * The Shmoo Song (1948) Composed by Jule Styne & John Jacob Loeb / Harvey Music Corp. * Shmoo Songs (1949) Composed by Gerald Marks / Bristol Music Corp. * The Kigmy Song (1949) Composed by Joe Rosenield & Fay Tishman / Town and Country Music Co. =Animation and puppetry= Originally, shmoos were meant to be included in the 1956 Broadway Li'l Abner musical, employing stage puppetry. Reportedly, the idea was abandoned in the development stage by the producers, however, for reasons of practicality. A variation of the character had appeared earlier as a marionette puppet on television. \\"Shmoozer\\", a talking shmoo with an anthropomorphic human body, was a recurring sidekick character on Fearless Fosdick, a short-lived puppet series that aired on NBC-TV in 1952. After Capp's death in 1979, the Shmoo gained its own animated series as part of Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo (which consisted of reruns of The New Fred and Barney Show mixed with the Shmoo's own cartoons; the two separate types of characters didn't \\"meet\\", however). The characters did meet, however, in the early 1980s Flintstones spin-off The Flintstone Comedy Show. The Shmoo appeared, incongruously, in the segment Bedrock Cops as a police officer alongside part-time officers Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. Needless to add, this Shmoo had little relationship to the L'il Abner character, other than a superficial appearance. A later Hanna-Barbera venture, The New Shmoo, featured the character as an (inexplicably) shape-shifting mascot of Mighty Mysteries Comics, a group of teens who solve Scooby-Doo-like mysteries. In this series the Shmoo could metamorphose magically into any shape at will‚Äîlike Tom Terrific. None of these revisionist revivals of the venerable character was particularly successful. In popular culture * Frank Sinatra, who was frequently spoofed by Al Capp in Li'l Abner, has a line in the MGM musical On the Town (1949) about cops \\"multiplyin' like shmoos!\\" * Florence King refers to owning a ceramic shmoo, which she threw out of her window after reading the books of Ayn Rand. * In the 1990 movie Book of Love, the character Crutch wins a stuffed shmoo at a carnival. * In the M*A*S*H television episode \\"Who Knew?\\", Colonel Potter (played by Harry Morgan) displays an inflatable shmoo toy in his office that he purchased for his grandson. * In Larry Niven's Known Space stories, an alien species known as the Bandersnatch, also edible and intelligent, is described as being \\"smooth as a shmoo\\". * In the novel The Forge of God by Greg Bear, \\"Shmoo\\" is the name humans give to the race of robots that visits Earth, due to their similar shape. * Some overlapping similarities exist between shmoos and tribbles‚Äîthe multitudinous alien creatures featured in a 1967 television episode from the original Star Trek. Like shmoos, tribbles also reproduced at such an alarming rate, they threatened ecological disaster. However, David Gerrold‚Äîwho wrote \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\"‚Äîdrew his inspiration from an historical event: Australia's environmentally destructive rabbit overpopulation. * The characters Gleep and Gloop‚Äîtwo protoplastic creatures from the Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning animated cartoon series The Herculoids‚Äîwere clearly inspired by (and are sometimes mistaken for) shmoos. * French artists Etienne Chambaud and David Jourdan have written \\"Economie de l'abondance ou La courte vie et les jours heureux\\", a new adventure of Jacques le fataliste et son ma√Ætre from Diderot, based on the discovery by Jacques of the Shmoo. * In the 2006 film Lucky Number Slevin, the character known only as \\"The Boss\\" (played by Morgan Freeman) refers to the Shmoo, recounting its original features as a source of plenty (in a monologue taken from an old Li'l Abner comic). * The Marxist political philosopher Gerald Cohen used the story of the Shmoo to illustrate his objections to capitalism in an episode of Opinions. * The Simpsons uses a statue of the Shmoo to replace the giant phallic statue from the film A Clockwork Orange in the episode \\"Treehouse of Horror XXV\\". * The Shmoo is featured in ‚ÄúBedrock Cops‚Äù as a friend and partner of Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble. * In the North American version of the video game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, there is an enemy monster called \\"Schmoo\\" (in the original Japanese version it is an Obake called \\"Kyuu\\" an homage to the character in manga, Obake no Q-tar≈ç), which is apparently an homage to The Shmoo. Schmoos appear in the Forbidden Library and killing one may result in obtaining the rare sword \\"Crissaegrim\\" (its rare item drop), one of the most powerful swords in the game. * During the Soviet Union's blockade of West Berlin, Germany in 1948, candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners from transport planes by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron. The commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting the inflatable shmoos as part of Operation: Little Vittles. \\"When the candy- chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted....\\"Newsweek, 11 October 1948 * Shmoos invaded the 1948 presidential election, as challenger Thomas Dewey accused incumbent Harry S. Truman of \\"promising everything, including the Shmoo!\\"Newsweek, 5 September 1948 * Capp periodically reintroduced the Shmoos in Li'l Abner, sometimes with significant variations. \\"Bad\\" Shmoos (called \\"Nogoodniks\\") debuted in a series of Sunday strips in 1949. The nasty cousin of the good-natured Shmoo, Nogoodniks were a sickly shade of green, and had \\"li'l red eyes, sharp yaller teeth, an' a dirty look\\". Frequently sporting 5 o'clock shadows, eye patches, scars, bandages, and other ruffian attributes‚Äîthey devoured \\"good\\" Shmoos, were the sworn enemies of \\"hoomanity\\", and wreaked havoc on Dogpatch. * In the ABC sitcom The Goldbergs, Beverley Goldberg endearingly refers to her children as Shmoos. * The product of artist Mark Gonzale, Adidas sells a version of its Trefoil logo (termed the Shmoofoil), that is patterned after the Shmoo. Eponyms Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast mating type a with shmoo responding to Œ±-factor The term \\"shmoo\\" has entered the English language, defining highly technical concepts in at least four separate fields of science: * \\"Shmoo plot\\" is a technical term relating to the graphical display of test results in electrical engineering, dating back at least to 1966. The name most likely arose because the shape of the two-dimensional plots often resembled a shmoo. The term is also a verb: to \\"shmoo\\" means to run the test. * In microbiology, the shmoo's uncanny resemblance to budding yeast‚Äîcombined with its near-limitless usefulness‚Äîhas led to the character's adoption as a mascot of sorts for scientists studying yeast as a model organism for genetics and cell biology. In fact, the cellular bulge that is produced by a haploid yeast cell as a response to a pheromone from the opposite mating type (either or Œ±-factor) is referred to as a \\"shmoo\\", because cells that are undergoing mating and present this particular structure resemble the cartoon character. The whole process is known to biologists as \\"shmooing\\". Shmoos are essential; without them, we would have neither bread nor beer. The word \\"shmoo\\" has appeared in nearly 700 science publications since 1974; it is used in labs studying the bread- and beer-making species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. * Echinoderm biologists use \\"shmoo\\" (often misspelled \\"schmoo\\") to refer to a very simple, highly derived, blob-shaped larva found in some sea urchins (e.g. Wray 1996). * It has been used in discussions of socioeconomics, for instance. In economics, a \\"widget\\" is any material good that is produced through labor (extracted, refined, manufactured, or assembled) from a finite resource‚Äîin contrast to a \\"shmoo\\", which is a material good that reproduces itself and is captured or bred as an economic activity (the original shmoo lives and reproduces without requiring any material sustenance). \\"If shmoos really existed, they would be a 'free good'.\\" Erik Olin Wright uses the \\"parable of the shmoo\\" to introduce discussion of class structure and economics. * In the field of particle physics, \\"shmoo\\" refers to a high energy cosmic ray survey instrument used at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for the Cygnus X-3 Sky Survey performed at the LAMPF (Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility) grounds. At one time, more than one hundred white \\"shmoo\\" detectors were sprinkled around the accelerator beamstop area and adjacent mesa to capture subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the Cygnus constellation. The detectors housed scintillators and photomultipliers in an array that gave the detector its distinctive shmoo shape. The particle accelerator Tevatron at Fermilab houses superconducting magnets that produce ice formations that also resembled shmoos. * In medicine, the \\"Shmoo sign\\" refers to the appearance of a prominent, rounded left ventricle and dilated aorta on a plain AP chest radiograph, giving the appearance of a Shmoo. Applied conversely, the shmoo has been cited as a hypothetical example of the potential falsifiability of natural selection as a key driving mechanism of biological evolution. That is, such a poorly adapted species could not possibly evolve via natural selection, so if it were to exist, it would falsify the theory.

A spiritual teacher, writer, and public speaker, de Mello wrote several books on spirituality and hosted numerous spiritual retreats and conferences. He continues to be known for his storytelling which drew from the various mystical traditions of both East and West and for introducing many people in the West to mindfulness-based practices he sometimes called \\"awareness prayer.\\"  Beginnings  De Mello was the oldest of five children born to Frank and Louisa n√©e Castellino de Mello. He was born in Bombay, British India, on 4 September 1931. He was raised in a Catholic family and dreamed of one day joining the Jesuit order. At the age of 16, de Mello entered the Society of Jesus at the seminary of Vinalaya on the outskirts of Bombay. In 1952, he was sent to Spain to study philosophy in Barcelona before undertaking ministry. He then returned to India to study theology at De Nobili College in Pune and was ordained to the priesthood in March 1961. After his return to India, he spent several years working in seminaries, and in 1968 he was made rector of the seminary of Vinalaya. De Mello was first attracted to the Jesuits for their strict discipline. Those who knew him during his earlier years in the order described him as somewhat conservative in his theology and reluctant to explore other religions. Some of his peers noted that his experience in Spain led him to broaden his perspective and to lose much of his rigidity.  Work  In 1972, he founded the Institute of Pastoral Counselling, later renamed the Sadhana Institute of Pastoral Counselling, in Poona, India. De Mello's first published book, Sadhana ‚Äì A Way to God, was released in 1978. It outlined a number of spiritual principles and \\"Christian exercises in Eastern form\\" inspired by the teachings of Saint Ignatius. It popularized the notion of \\"awareness prayer\\" in the United States for his readers and for those who attended his lectures.  Death  De Mello died of a heart attack in 1987, aged 55, in New York City.Biography, by Bill deMello Bill De Mello, a brother of Tony's recounts in his book \\"Anthony deMello: The Happy Wanderer\\" that Tony's body was found by Fr. Frank Stroud, S.J. According to Fr. Stroud, de Mello's body was curled up in a fetal position. His official death certificate lists the immediate cause of his death as \\"Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with recent thrombosis of left circumflex branch.\\"  Posthumous controversy  In 1998, 11 years after de Mello's death, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under the leadership of its Cardinal-Prefect, Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) conducted a review of de Mello's work and released a lengthy comment expressing theological concern that de Mello's books \\"are incompatible with the Catholic faith and can cause grave harm\\". The Indian magazine Outlook saw this as an attempt by Rome to undermine the clergy in Asia amid widening fissures between Rome and the Asian Church. De Mello's books are available in many Catholic bookshops in the West, but include the advisory that they were written in a multi-religious context and are not intended to be manuals on Christian doctrine.

Chinese painting from the Dunhuang Caves, Tang Dynasty The Vimalakƒ´rti Nirde≈õa (), (sometimes referred to as the Vimalakƒ´rti S≈´tra or Vimalakƒ´rti Nirde≈õa S≈´tra) is a Buddhist text which centers around a lay buddhist meditator who attained a very high degree of enlightenment considered by some second only to the Buddha's. It was extremely influential in East Asia, but most likely of considerably less importance in the Indian and Tibetan sub-traditions of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. The word nirde≈õa in the title means \\"instruction, advice\\", and Vimalakƒ´rti is the name of the main protagonist of the text, and means \\"Taintless Fame\\". The sutra teaches, among other subjects, the meaning of nondualism, the doctrine of the true body of the Buddha, the characteristically MahƒÅyƒÅna claim that the appearances of the world are mere illusions, and the superiority of the MahƒÅyƒÅna over other paths. It places in the mouth of the upƒÅsaka (lay practitioner) Vimalakƒ´rti a teaching addressed to both arhats and bodhisattvas, regarding the doctrine of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ. In most versions, the discourse of the text culminates with a wordless teaching of silence. Translator Burton Watson argues that the Vimalakƒ´rti Nirde≈õa was likely composed in approximately 100 CE. Although it had been thought lost for centuries, a version in Sanskrit was recovered in 1999 among the manuscripts of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. The Sanskrit was published in parallel with the Tibetan and three Chinese versions by the Study Group on Buddhist Sanskrit Literature at the Institute for Comprehensive Studies of Buddhism at Taisho University in 2004, and in 2006, the same group published a critical edition that has become the standard version of the Sanskrit for scholarly purposes. In 2007 the Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods published a romanized Sanskrit version under the title ƒÄryavimalakƒ´rtinirde≈õo NƒÅma MahƒÅyƒÅnas≈´tram. For a recent and thorough summary of the present scholarly understanding of the text, readers should consult Felbur.  Translations  Fragments of Vimalakirti Sutra in Chinese on the reverse side of Old Tibetan Chronicle discovered in Dunhuang Mogao Cave #17 Various translations circulate, and an even greater number are known or claimed to have existed in the past. Tradition holds that the text was translated into pre-modern Chinese seven times. A supposed first translation (probably legendary) is said in some classical bibliographic sources, beginning with the notoriously unreliable Lidai sanbao ji Ê≠∑‰ª£‰∏âÂØ∂Á¥Ä T2034 in 598 C.E., to have been produced by Yan Fotiao Âö¥‰ΩõË™ø. Three canonical Chinese versions are extant: an earlier version ascribed to Zhi Qian ÊîØË¨ô, entitled Weimojie jing Á∂≠Êë©Ë©∞Á∂ì T474; one produced by KumƒÅrajƒ´va È≥©Êë©ÁæÖ‰ªÄ in 406 C.E. under the title Weimojie suoshuo jing Á∂≠Êë©Ë©∞ÊâÄË™™Á∂ì T475; and one translated by Xuanzang in 650 ÁéÑÂ•ò and is entitled Shuo Wogoucheng jing Ë™™ÁÑ°Âû¢Á®±Á∂ì T476. Of these, the KumƒÅrajƒ´va version is the most famous. The principal Tibetan version is that found in the Kanjur, by Chos nyid tshul khrims (DharmatƒÅ≈õila), Dri ma med par grags pas bstan pa D176/Q843.' An additional version was found at Dunhuang in the early 20th century. In modern English, five main translations exist, two KumƒÅrajƒ´va's Chinese, two from the Tibetan, and one from the recently rediscovered Sanskrit text. A typically erudite French translation by √âtienne Lamotte was made from the Tibetan. Lamotte's French was re-translated into English by Sara Boin-Webb, bringing the total number of English versions to five. The English translations are: * (From KumƒÅrajƒ´va's Chinese) * (An exhaustive scholarly treatment) - Translation from French *Ziporyn, Brook (1998). Review : The Vimalakirti Sutra by Burton Watson, The Journal of Asian Studies 57 (1), 205-206 (From KumƒÅrajƒ´va's Chinese and featuring a short introduction) * (From Tibetan and featuring short introduction, extensive notes and glossary entries) * (From KumƒÅrajƒ´va's Chinese and featuring short introduction, glossary, and minor notes) * (The first English edition from the original Sanskrit, with brief introduction. Seems available only as electronic book.) Jan Nattier has discussed and compared most of these translations in considerable detail, as an interesting case in the agendas and resulting shortcomings of various approaches to modern Buddhist Studies. There also exist or existed various translations (some of them at second remove) into the Japanese, Korean, Khotanese, Mongolian, Sogdian and Manchurian languages. Most Japanese versions are based on KumƒÅrajƒ´va, but two translations directly from the rediscovered Sanskrit text into vernacular Japanese have also now been published, one by Takahashi Hisao È´òÊ©ãÂ∞öÂ§´ and Nishino Midori Ë•øÈáéÁø†, and one by Ueki Masatoshi Ê§çÊú®ÈõÖ‰øä.  Synopsis  The Vimalakirti Sutra can be summarised as follows. (From KumƒÅrajƒ´va's Chinese and featuring short introduction, glossary, and minor notes)Study Group 2004Study Group 2006Lamotte 1962 Chapter 1 The scene is ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´'s garden outside Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´. Even in this setting, we may see evidence of the literary sophistication of the authors, and the foreshadowing of key themes (antinomianism, female characters as literary tropes): ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´ was a famously accomplished courtesan, ascribed in narrative with various roles in relation to promulgation of the Dharma. Five hundred Licchavi youths offer parasols to the Buddha, who miraculously transforms them into a single gigantic parasol that covers the entire cosmos. The youths ask how the \\"Buddha field\\" (buddhak·π£etra) can be purified. The Buddha responds that the Buddha field is pure when the mind is pure (this line was one source of a whole line of interpretation in Pure Land thinking in the later East Asian tradition). The buddhak·π£etra is also equated with various other exalted categories in the MahƒÅyƒÅna, such as the six perfections, or the four \\"illimitables\\" or \\"noble dwelling-places\\" (brahmavihƒÅra). Because ≈öƒÅriputra is unable to see this purity, the Buddha performs a miracle that displays it to him briefly. One implication of this scene is that our SahƒÅ world‚Äîthe buddhak·π£etra of ≈öƒÅkyamuni‚Äîis in fact as glorious as other Buddha worlds, but our defilements prevent us from correctly seeing it as such. Chapter 2 The scene is now Vimalakƒ´rti's house in Vai≈õƒÅlƒ´. He is a wealthy merchant householder. He is a husband and a father. However, he is also a powerful bodhisattva with Buddha-like qualities. He enters dens of iniquity, such as gambling parlours, brothels, and the haunts of philosophers of other schools, but even in so doing, he is merely appearing to conform with the ways of this world in order to bring sentient beings to realisation of the truth. Note the echo of the famous courtesan ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´ in the theme, emphasised here, of Vimalakƒ´rti's ambivalent, even paradoxical, relationship to sexuality and chastity; the same theme is revisited in an amusing anecdote in Chapter 3, in which Vimalakƒ´rti bests MƒÅra (the \\"Buddhist devil\\") by accepting 12,000 goddesses from him for his \\"serving-women\\". These goddesses have just been rejected by another advanced practitioner as improper, but Vimalakƒ´rti immediately takes the occasion to convert them towards ultimate awakening. Here, it now transpires that Vimalakƒ´rti is feigning illness, in order that he can exploit the sympathy visits of his fellow citizens to teach them. He teaches one such group of visitors about the distinction between the apparently impermanent material body, which is prone to such sickness, and the true body of the Buddha. This is one of the earliest developed instances of dharmakƒÅya (\\"Dharma-body\\") doctrine known in MahƒÅyƒÅna literature. Chapter 3 The Buddha successively appeals to a string of his most advanced non-MahƒÅyƒÅna disciples (mahƒÅ≈õrƒÅvakas), and also to three bodhisattvas and a householder, to visit Vimalakƒ´rti and ask after his health. They all refuse, saying that on prior occasions when they met with him, he showed them up in his understanding of various doctrines. Vimalakƒ´rti is typically portrayed in these recounted exchanges as having triumphed by a kind of paradoxical and contrary rhetoric, which on the surface makes no sense. For example, he bested ≈öƒÅriputra on the topic of sitting in meditation by asserting that true meditation is in fact a string of things bearing no obvious resemblance to meditation, such as having no body in the visible world, or abiding in a state of complete meditative cessation (normally held to resemble physical death to the untrained eye) while at the same time engaging actively and perfectly in all the niceties of monastic deportment. Chapter 4 The bodhisattva Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ (conventionally understood as the embodiment of supreme wisdom) is persuaded by the Buddha to visit Vimalakƒ´rti, albeit with some difficulty. Vimalakƒ´rti miraculously transforms his apparently narrow and humble abode into a vast cosmic palace, thus creating enough space for the throng Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ has brought with him. Vimalakƒ´rti explains his illness in spiritual terms, equating it with the fundamental existential malaise of all sentient beings. According to this discourse, the true cure for all ills is also spiritual, and involves the achievement of states of non-self and non-dualism. Chapter 5 Vimalakƒ´rti performs a further miracle, summoning from another distant Buddha-field 32,000 vast \\"lion thrones\\" (si·πÉhƒÅsana) for Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ and his company, without expanding his narrow room. Each of these seats is so immense that advanced bodhisattvas must transform their bodies to a size of 42,000 yojanas (leagues) tall to sit on them. ≈öariputra and other mahƒÅ≈õrƒÅvakas, incapable of this feat, cannot mount their seats. This space- and mind-bending miracle is taken as the chance to teach that a vast array of \\"unthinkable\\" things are possible for advanced adherents of the MahƒÅyƒÅna (e.g. inhaling all the winds of all the worlds at once, or showing all the offerings ever given to all Buddhas in a single pore of the skin of their bodies). Chapter 6 Vimalakƒ´rti expounds a series of analogies designed to explain the point that the bodhisattva regards sentient beings as, in various senses, illusory or even logically impossible. A goddess then appears, who has been living in Vimalakƒ´rti's room for twelve years. She creates a shower of heavenly petals. These petals stick to the bodies of the non-MahƒÅyƒÅna adepts (mahƒÅ≈õrƒÅvakas), but slide off the bodies of the bodhisattvas and drop to the ground. ≈öƒÅriputra, perturbed (among other things, by a probable infringement of the monastic code, which prohibits personal adornment), even attempts to use his supernatural powers to shed this unwelcome decoration, but in vain. A battle of wits and wisdom ensues, in which ≈öƒÅriputra is sorely bested and humiliated by the goddess. She explains that he cannot shake off the flowers because he is \\"attached\\" (for instance, to a formalistic and superficial understanding of the Dharma and the Vinaya). ≈öƒÅriputra asks the goddess, perhaps somewhat peevishly, why she still has the (inferior) body of a woman, if she has attained to such high levels of insight. In response, she uses her own supernatural powers to switch bodies with ≈öƒÅriputra, who is even more perturbed to find himself in the guise of a woman, but finds that nothing he does allows him to return to his own \\"true\\" form. Eventually, the goddess takes mercy and releases her hold, but the overall effect of the exchange is to show the vast superiority of MahƒÅyƒÅna doctrine and practice over the other, more traditional forms of Buddhism of which ≈öƒÅriputra is a paragon. The drama presented in this chapter has been an important reference point for traditional and especially modern attempts to find MahƒÅyƒÅna perspectives on the nature of gender, and Buddhist feminist attempts to find canonical sources for a stance that ascribes equal spiritual status or potential to women. Chapter 7 A dialogue ensues between Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ and Vimalakƒ´rti. Echoing the dramatic besting of ≈öƒÅriputra‚Äîa famed expert in doctrine‚Äîby a mere non-Buddhist deity and female, this dialogue ultimately sees Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, the paragon of MahƒÅyƒÅna wisdom, upstaged by someone who is apparently a \\"mere\\" householder, and (as we saw in Chapter 2), apparently no model of virtue at that‚Äîa companion of gamblers and prostitutes. Chapter 8 Vimalakƒ´rti conducts a dialogue with a series of bodhisattvas from Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´'s entourage on the topic of non-duality (advaya). Again, Vimalakƒ´rti ultimately emerges supreme from this contest. His \\"statement\\" on the topic is his famous silence, which crowns the whole series of exchanges and is implicitly framed as the \\"last word\\". This portion of the text was important for later tradition, including various Chan/Zen texts and schools, as a source of the notion that truth is beyond language, and specially framed acts of silence are its most adequate expression. Chapter 9'' Vimalakƒ´rti uses his powers to conjure up a magically emanated bodhisattva, whom he sends to a remote Buddha- world to fetch a wonderfully fragrant type of food that is eaten there. The emanated bodhisattva brings this food back to Vimalakƒ´rti's home, and he uses a single bowlful to miraculously feed the vast congregation in attendance. Vimalakƒ´rti takes the occasion to deliver a discourse on the necessity of suffering as a means of teaching for the beings in ≈öƒÅkyamuni's SahƒÅ world. Chapter 10 Vimalakƒ´rti picks up the entire assembly in his room in one hand, and miraculously transports it to ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´'s garden (the scene we left in the opening chapter), where they visit the Buddha and ƒÄnanda. When ƒÄnanda smells the fragrance of the wonderful food described in the previous chapter, it is used as the occasion for a teaching that describes how the Buddhas accomplish their teaching and liberation of sentient beings by all means conceivable (and inconceivable!). ƒÄnanda concedes that ≈õrƒÅvakas are inferior to bodhisattvas, and Vimalakƒ´rti delivers another teaching. Chapter 11 Vimalakƒ´rti explains how he views the Buddha. This teaching is conveyed by a series of negations. The Buddha reveals to ≈öƒÅriputra that Vimalakƒ´rti is in fact a bodhisattva from the Buddha-world Abhirati, which is created and overseen by the Buddha Ak·π£obhya. In order to show the assembly in ƒÄmrapƒÅlƒ´'s garden this world, Vimalakƒ´rti uses his prodigious powers to bring the entire world into the garden. ≈öƒÅkyamuni Buddha predicts to all present that they will be reborn in Abhirati, and Vimalakƒ´rti puts the Buddha-world back where it came from. Chapter 12 The text closes with formulaic statements that the teaching it delivers should be preserved and transmitted. A new sermon expounds a series of characteristics of inferior bodhisattvas, which prevent them attaining the highest attainments. The Buddha entrusts the s≈´tra to Maitreya, in order that sentient beings of future ages may also be able to hear it.  Use of silence  The Vimalakƒ´rti-nirde≈õa \\"offers us two dramatic and contrasting moments of silence. The first of these [is] the silence of ≈öƒÅriputra\\", who is rendered silent during an exchange with a goddess: Vimalakƒ´rti remains silent while discussing the subject of emptiness with an assembly of bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas give a variety of answers on the question what non-duality is. Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ is the last bodhisattva to answer, and says that \\"by giving an explanation they have already fallen into dualism\\". Vimalakƒ´rti, in his turn, answers with silence. With this emphasis on silence the Vimalakƒ´rti-nirde≈õa served as a forerunner of the approach of the Ch'an/Zen tradition, with its avoidance of positive statements on 'ultimate reality': But it does not mean that language is to be discredited completely:  East Asian Commentaries  The Vimalakƒ´rti was the object of energetic commentarial activity in East Asia. (By contrast, no commentaries are known in India or Tibet.) A fragment of a very early commentary, conceivably dating before the end of the fourth century, has been preserved in manuscript form, and taken as the object of a monographic study. Another important text, the Zhu Weimojie jing Ê≥®Á∂≠Êë©Ë©∞Á∂ì (which modern scholarship has shown to be the product of a complex history), transmits what is actually a set of interrelated commentaries ascribed to scholars among the very translation team that produced the second Chinese translation at the beginning of the fifth century, including KumƒÅrajƒ´va himself. Other relatively early commentaries were produced by Jingying Huiyuan Ê∑®ÂΩ±ÊÖßÈÅ† (523-592): Wuimo yiji Á∂≠Êë©Áæ©Ë®ò T1776; Zhiyi Êô∫È°ó (538‚Äì597): Weimo jing xuanshu Á∂≠Êë©Á∂ìÁéÑÁñè; Jizang ÂêâËóè (549‚Äì623): Jingming xuanlun Ê∑®ÂêçÁéÑË´ñ T1780 and Weimo jing yishu Á∂≠Êë©Á∂ìÁæ©Áñè T1781; [Kiu]Ji [Á™∫]Âü∫ (632‚Äì682): Shuo Wugoucheng jing shu Ë™™ÁÑ°Âû¢Á®±Á∂ìÁñè T1782; and Zhanran ÊπõÁÑ∂ (711‚Äì782): Weimo jing l√ºeshu Á∂≠Êë©Á∂ìÁï•Áñè T1778. Yet another significant commentary is the Yuimagy≈ç gisho Á∂≠Êë©ÁµåÁæ©Áñè, or Commentary on the Vimalakƒ´rti S≈´tra, ascribed to Prince Sh≈çtoku ËÅñÂæ≥Â§™Â≠ê (574-622),Hubbard, Jamie, trans. (2012). Expository Commentary on the Vimalakƒ´rti Sutra. Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research, Berkeley, . p.XIII an early work of Japanese Buddhism, which is said to be based on the commentary of the Liang Dynasty Chinese monk Zhizang Êô∫Ëóè (458-522 CE).  Other Signs of Influence in East Asia  The impact of the Vimalakƒ´rti-nirde≈õa can also be traced in many other dimensions of East Asian culture. Large numbers of manuscript copies of the text survive in collections from Dunhuang Êï¶ÁÖå and elsewhere. The text had a major impact on the arts, including visual art, but also poetry. The self- chosen soubriquet of the Tang poet Wang Wei ÁéãÁ∂≠ (699‚Äì759), for instance, means nothing less than \\"Vimalakƒ´rti\\". In the modern world, the famous Peking opera \\"The Heavenly Maiden Scatters Flowers\\" Â§©Â•≥Êï£Ëä±, created by Mei Lanfang Ê¢ÖËò≠Ëä≥ (1894-1961), also took as its basis the dramatic encounter between the goddess and ≈öƒÅriputra in Chapter 6. The sutra is also thought to have been influential in East Asian Buddhism for its perceived humor (though the supposed humour of the text is a difficult topic, somewhat controversial in modern scholarship), and the perception that it provides scriptural warrant for various compromises between (typically monastic) austerity and engagement with secular life. The text has also been influential in MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism for its perceived inclusiveness and respect for non-monastic practitioners, and is often interpreted as advocating an equal role for women in Buddhism. One context in which the text was especially popular was the Chan/Zen Á¶™ school. However, McRae also notes that the s≈´tra was not used as an object of devotion, and that no school was ever formed around it, so that it does not seem to have enjoyed the degree of popularity of some other s≈´tras. Richard B. Mather traces multiple causes of the popularity of the text in China, including its \\"brash\\" humor, its criticism of ≈õrƒÅvakas and Abhidharma, and the universality and \\"flexibility\\" of its outlook.Mather, Richard B. (1968), \\"Vimalakƒ´rti and Gentry Buddhism,\\" History of Religions, 8 (1), 60-73 Mather states that despite its disparagement of ≈õrƒÅvakas, the s≈´tra strong supports the Sa·πÉgha, and the text intends to sanction the pursuit of the bodhisattva path by both monastics and laity without opposition to one another. Hu Shih, an important figure in Chinese language reform in the early 20th century, wrote that the Vimalakƒ´rti-nirde≈õa was among KumƒÅrajƒ´va's three most influential translations (the other two being the Diamond S≈´tra and Lotus S≈´tra).Sheng Yen. Orthodox Chinese Buddhism. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 57 As a literary work, he praised this version of the s≈´tra as \\"half novel and half drama, with the greatest impact on literature and fine arts.\\" Nan Huaijin also regards this translation of the Vimalakƒ´rti-nirde≈õa as unique in Chinese literature, and forming \\"virtually its own literary realm.\\"Nan Huai-Chin. Diamond Sutra Explained. 2004. p. 6 According to Nan Huaijin's description of the Chan/Zen monastic system, the abbot of the monastery customarily lived in a small room patterned after that of Vimalakƒ´rti's room.Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. pp. 173-174, 211 This room, as well as the abbot himself, were colloquially referred to as the fƒÅngzh√†ng (Ch. Êñπ‰∏à, Jpn. h≈çj≈ç), or \\"ten-foot square,\\" \\"square fathom.\\" This refers to a description of Vimalakƒ´rti's apparently small and humble room, which the text portrays as miraculously transforming into a vast cosmic arena in which transcendent truths are taught for an audience of advanced bodhisattvas.

He worked as a concert pianist, as a musical director at the Leipzig University Church, as a professor at the Royal Conservatory in Leipzig, and as a music director at the court of Duke Georg II of Saxe- Meiningen. Reger first composed mainly Lieder, chamber music, choral music and works for piano and organ. He later turned to orchestral compositions, such as the popular Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart (1914), and to works for choir and orchestra such as Gesang der Verkl√§rten (1903), ' (1909), Der Einsiedler and the Hebbel Requiem (both 1915).  Career  Born in Brand, Bavaria, Reger studied music theory in Sondershausen, then piano and theory in Wiesbaden. The first compositions to which he assigned opus numbers were chamber music and Lieder. A concert pianist himself, he composed works for both piano and organ. His first work for choir and piano to which he assigned an opus number was Drei Ch√∂re (1892). Reger returned to his parental home in 1898, where he composed his first work for choir and orchestra, ' (Hymn to singing), Op. 21. From 1899, he courted Elsa vonBercken who at first rejected him. He composed many songs such as Sechs Lieder, Op. 35, on love poems by five authors. Reger moved to Munich in September 1901, where he obtained concert offers and where his rapid rise to fame began. During his first Munich season, Reger appeared in ten concerts as an organist, chamber pianist and accompanist. Income from publishers, concerts and private teaching enabled him to marry in 1902. Because his wife Elsa was a divorced Protestant, he was excommunicated from the Catholic Church. He continued to compose without interruption, for example Gesang der Verkl√§rten, Op. 71. In 1907, Reger was appointed musical director at the Leipzig University Church, a position he held until 1908, and professor at the Royal Conservatory in Leipzig. In 1908 he began to compose ' (The 100th Psalm), Op. 106, a setting of Psalm 100 for mixed choir and orchestra, for the 350th anniversary of Jena University. Part I was premiered on 31 July that year. Reger completed the composition in 1909, premiered in 1910 simultaneously in both Chemnitz and Breslau. In 1911 Reger was appointed Hofkapellmeister (music director) at the court of Duke Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen, responsible also for music at the Meiningen Court Theatre. He retained his master class at the Leipzig conservatory. In 1913 he composed four tone poems on paintings by Arnold B√∂cklin (Vier Tongedichte nach Arnold B√∂cklin), including Die Toteninsel (Isle of the Dead), as his Op. 128. The composer at work, painting by Franz N√∂lken, 1913He gave up the court position in 1914 for health reasons. In response to World War I, he thought in 1914 already to compose a choral work to commemorate the fallen of the war. He began to set the Latin Requiem but abandoned the work as a fragment. He composed eight motets forming Acht geistliche Ges√§nge f√ºr gemischten Chor (Eight Sacred Songs), Op. 138, as a master of \\"new simplicity\\". In 1915 he moved to Jena, commuting once a week to teach in Leipzig. He composed in Jena the Hebbel Requiem for soloist, choir and orchestra. Reger died of a heart attack while staying at a hotel in Leipzig on 11 May 1916. The proofs of Acht geistliche Ges√§nge, including \\"Der Mensch lebt und bestehet nur eine kleine Zeit\\", were found next to his bed. Reger had also been active internationally as a conductor and pianist. Among his students were Joseph Haas, S√°ndor Jemnitz, Jaroslav Kvapil, Ruben Liljefors, Rudolf Serkin, George Szell and Crist√≤for Taltabull. Reger was the cousin of Hans von Koessler.  Works  Reger produced an enormous output in just over 25 years, nearly always in abstract forms. His work was well known in Germany during his lifetime. Many of his works are fugues or in variation form, including the Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart based on the opening theme of Mozart's Piano Sonata in A major, K. 331. Welte-Philharmonic-Organ, 1913 Reger wrote a large amount of music for organ, the most popular being the Benedictus from the collection Op. 59Anderson, Christopher S. 2013. Twentieth-Century Organ Music. Routledge. p. 123. and his Fantasy and Fugue on BACH, Op. 46. While a student under Hugo Riemann in Wiesbaden, Reger met the German organist, Karl Straube; they became friends and Straube premiered many of Reger's organ works, such as the Three chorale fantasias, Op. 52. Reger recorded some of his works on the Welte Philharmonic organ, including excerpt from 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67. He composed organ works for secular use, such as Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue, Op. 127, dedicated to Karl Straube who played the premiere during the 1913 opening of the Breslau Centennial Hall, when was inaugurated. Reger was particularly attracted to the fugal form and created music in almost every genre, save for opera and the symphony (he did, however, compose a Sinfonietta, his op. 90). A similarly firm supporter of absolute music, he saw himself as being part of the tradition of Beethoven and Brahms. His work often combined the classical structures of these composers with the extended harmonies of Liszt and Wagner, to which he added the complex counterpoint of Bach. Reger's organ music, though also influenced by Liszt, was provoked by that tradition. Some of the works for solo string instruments turn up often on recordings, though less regularly in recitals. His solo piano and two-piano music places him as a successor to Brahms in the central German tradition. He pursued intensively Brahms's continuous development and free modulation, whilst being rooted in Bach-influenced polyphony. Reger was a prolific writer of vocal works, Lieder, works for mixed chorus, men's chorus and female chorus, and extended choral works with orchestra such as Der 100. Psalm and Requiem, a setting of a poem by Friedrich Hebbel, which Reger dedicated to the soldiers of World War I. He composed music to texts by poets such as Gabriele D'Annunzio, Otto Julius Bierbaum, Adelbert von Chamisso, Joseph von Eichendorff, Emanuel Geibel, Friedrich Hebbel, Nikolaus Lenau, Detlev von Liliencron, Friedrich R√ºckert and Ludwig Uhland. Reger assigned opus numbers to major works himself. His works could be considered retrospective as they followed classical and baroque compositional techniques such as fugue and continuo. The influence of the latter can be heard in his chamber works which are deeply reflective and unconventional.  Reception  In 1898 Caesar Hochstetter, an arranger, composer and critic, published an article entitled \\"Noch einmal Max Reger\\" in a music magazine (Die redenden K√ºnste 5 no. 49, pp. 943 f). Caesar recommended Reger as \\"a highly talented young composer\\" to the publishers. Reger thanked Hochstetter with the dedications of his piano pieces Aquarellen, Op. 25, and Cinq Pi√®ces pittoresques, Op. 34. Reger had an acrimonious relationship with Rudolf Louis, the music critic of the M√ºnchener Neueste Nachrichten, who usually had negative opinions of his compositions. After the first performance of the Sinfonietta in A major, Op. 90, on 2 February 1906, Louis wrote a typically negative review on 7 February. Reger wrote back to him: \\"Ich sitze in dem kleinsten Zimmer in meinem Hause. Ich habe Ihre Kritik vor mir. Im n√§chsten Augenblick wird sie hinter mir sein!\\" (\\"I am sitting in the smallest room of my house. I have your review before me. In a moment it will be behind me!\\"). Another source has the German composer Sigfrid Karg-Elert as the targeted critic of this letter. Arnold Schoenberg was an admirer of Reger's: A letter he sent to Alexander von Zemlinsky in 1922 states: ‚ÄúReger...must in my view be done often; 1, because he has written a lot; 2, because he is already dead and people are still not clear about him. (I consider him a genius.)‚Äù  Films  The documentary Max Reger ‚Äì Music as a perpetual state, by Andreas Pichler and Ewald Kontschieder, Miramonte Film, was released in 2002. It was the first factually based film documentation about Max Reger. It was produced in cooperation with the Max-Reger-Institute. Max Reger: The Last Giant, a documentary film about the life and works of Max Reger, was released on 6 DVDs around December 2016 to mark the 100th anniversary of Reger's death. It is produced by Fugue State Films and includes excerpts from Reger's most important works for orchestra, piano, chamber ensemble and organ, with performances by Frauke May, Bernhard Haas, Bernhard Buttmann and the Brandenburgisches Staatsorchester Frankfurt.

He has been a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Cork South-Central constituency since 1989. He previously served as Leader of the Opposition in Ireland from 2011 to 2020, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2008 to 2011, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from 2004 to 2008, Minister for Health and Children from 2000 to 2004, Minister for Education and Science and Lord Mayor of Cork from 1992 to 1993. Whilst Martin was Minister for Health and Children in 2004, he introduced a ban on tobacco smoking in all Irish workplaces and established the Health Service Executive (HSE). Ireland was the first country to introduce a full workplace smoking ban. As Foreign Minister, in 2009, Martin travelled to Latin America for the first time, and made the first official visit to Cuba by an Irish Minister. That same year, he travelled to Khartoum following the kidnapping of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki. In 2010, he became the first Western foreign minister to visit Gaza since Hamas took control there in 2007. In January 2011, Martin resigned as Minister for Foreign Affairs and was subsequently elected as the eighth leader of Fianna F√°il following Cowen's resignation as party leader. In the 2011 general election, Martin led the party to its worst showing in its 85-year history, with a loss of 57 seats and a drop in its share of the popular vote to 17.4%. In the 2016 general election, Fianna F√°il's performance improved significantly, more than doubling their D√°il representation from 20 to 44 seats. In the 2020 general election, Fianna F√°il became the largest party, attaining the most seats at 38, one seat ahead of Sinn F√©in with 37 seats. He was appointed Taoiseach on 27 June 2020, leading a coalition government with Fine Gael and the Green Party as part of a historic deal. Early life Martin was born in 1960 in Cork, and was raised in the Turners Cross area. Martin was the son of Paddy Martin (1923‚Äì2012), a former soldier in the Defence Forces, CI√â employee and Irish international boxer, and Eileen \\"Lana\\" Corbett (1929‚Äì2010). He was the third child in a family of five. Martin's eldest brother Se√°n and his twin brother P√°draig subsequently became involved in local politics in Cork. His two younger sisters, Eileen and M√°ir√©ad, have remained apolitical. Martin attended Col√°iste Chr√≠ost R√≠ before studying arts at University College Cork. It was during his time at university that Martin became involved in politics. He was a prominent member of the cumann of √ìgra Fianna F√°il, the youth wing of the party before later serving as national chairman of √ìgra. After graduating with a BA degree, Martin later completed an MA in political history. Subsequently, he completed a higher diploma in education, and began a career as a history teacher in Presentation Brothers College. In 2009, he published his MA thesis as a book: Freedom to Choose: Cork and Party Politics in Ireland 1918‚Äì1932. Early political career Martin's time as a teacher was short-lived; he left after just one year to become a full-time politician when he secured election to Cork Corporation as a Fianna F√°il candidate in 1985. It was from this local base that he decided to embark on a career in national politics a little under two years later. Martin was one of four candidates who secured the Fianna F√°il nomination to run in the Cork South-Central constituency at the 1987 general election, however, of the four he polled the fewest first-preference votes and failed to be elected. He became a member of the Fianna F√°il national executive in 1988. In 1989, Taoiseach Charles Haughey called a snap election, and Martin was once again added to the Fianna F√°il ticket in Cork South-Central, and on that occasion he secured election to D√°il √âireann. He has been re-elected at each subsequent election since. In his first few years as a TD, Martin served on a number of Oireachtas committees, including those dealing with crime, finance and the Irish language. He served as Lord Mayor of Cork in 1992. Two years later, in December 1994, Bertie Ahern was elected as the new leader of Fianna F√°il, as the party lost power and went into opposition in the D√°il. Martin, however, joined Ahern's new front bench at the start of 1995 as Spokesperson on Education and the Gaeltacht. Cabinet career (1997‚Äì2011) =Minister for Education and Science (1997‚Äì2000)= When Fianna F√°il returned to power following the 1997 general election, Martin was appointed to the newly expanded position of Minister for Education and Science. Aged 36, he was the youngest member of Bertie Ahern's first cabinet. As Minister for Education and Science, his tenure was characterised by an increase in spending at all levels of education, while a number of educational initiatives, such as a review of the primary school curriculum and the introduction of special needs assistants, were also initiated. =Minister for Health and Children (2000‚Äì2004)= In a cabinet reshuffle in January 2000, Martin was appointed Minister for Health and Children. Martin's predecessor, Brian Cowen, described the position as \\"like being in Angola\\", because 'landmines' can go off at any time. In spite of tough opposition, Martin introduced a ban on tobacco smoking in all Irish workplaces, including pubs and restaurants. He announced on 30 January 2003, his intention to have the ban in place on 1 January 2004. He visited New York in September 2003 to look at how a similar ban worked there, and signed the UN's framework convention on tobacco control at their headquarters. The smoking ban was introduced on 29 March 2004, making Ireland the first country in the world to introduce a blanket ban on smoking in the workplace. Martin was presented with an award by the European Respiratory Society in Glasgow on 4 September 2004, for his work on the smoking ban. He introduced the an overhaul of the health system, which included the abolition of the health boards and establishment of the Health Service Executive (HSE). He deregulated the country's pharmacies from 31 January 2002. In October 2003, Martin promised to examine cases of symphysiotomy in Irish hospitals which occurred during the 1940s and 1950s, and offered free health care to those affected. =Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (2004‚Äì2008)= In September 2004, he exchanged government positions with Mary Harney, to become Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The following September, the government's economic record on the cost of living came under scrutiny from the RT√â television programme Rip-Off Republic. This led to Martin abolishing the controversial Groceries Order 1987, a piece of legislation which prohibited the sale of groceries below cost price. Letters containing death threats and shotgun cartridges, from a group calling itself the Irish Citizens Defence Force, were posted to Martin on 29 February 2008, at a prominent Dublin fertility clinic. =Minister for Foreign Affairs (2008‚Äì2011)= On the resignation of Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach in May 2008, Martin supported Brian Cowen's bid for the Fianna F√°il leadership. In a cabinet reshuffle on 13 May 2008, following the election of Brian Cowen as Taoiseach, Martin became Minister for Foreign Affairs. One of the first issues that he had to deal with was the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. Martin led the government campaign. Despite the overwhelming majority of government and opposition parties supporting a Yes vote, the electorate rejected the government's recommendation. Martin and Cowen failed to convince the Irish public to support the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, and this protest expressed in the referendum on 12 June 2008 plunged the government into a major political crisis. Martin with US Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez in 2005 In February 2009, Martin travelled to Latin America for the first time, making stopovers in Mexico and Havana; it was the first time an Irish government Minister had made an official visit to Cuba. In September 2009, he travelled to Khartoum to discuss the kidnapping of Sharon Commins and Hilda Kawuki with the Sudanese government. On 7 February 2010, he defended the ‚Ç¨4.4 million redevelopment of the Irish embassy in Ottawa, Canada. While in Brussels on 22 February 2010, he questioned Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel Avigdor Lieberman over the use of fraudulent Irish passports in the assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. On 17 March 2010, he met President of the United States Barack Obama in the White House, alongside Taoiseach Brian Cowen. On 26 May 2010, he met with senior Chinese leaders in Beijing, to discuss relations between China and Ireland, before travelling onward to Shanghai. While there, he visited the Irish pavilion at Expo 2010 in the city. On 28 June 2010, he began a five-day trip to Uganda and Ethiopia, where he visited buildings and met ministers and businesspeople. Criticism of Gaza blockade As Minister for Foreign Affairs, Martin was critical of the blockade of Gaza, particularly after being denied access to the area in 2009. He wrote to Spain (as President of the EU), to suggest that the body send a team of foreign ministers to the area in 2010. He made his first visit there himself on 25 February 2010, on a one-day humanitarian mission through the Egyptian border. In doing so, Martin became the first Western foreign minister to visit Gaza, since Hamas took control in 2007. While in Gaza, the Minister toured hospitals and schools. He was accompanied by United Nations vehicles. Martin wrote about his experience in the International Herald Tribune the following week. Martin was Minister for Foreign Affairs during the Gaza flotilla raid and the aftermath of this incident. He told D√°il √âireann that he had requested that the Israeli government allow the MV Rachel Corrie to deliver its cargo of aid to Gaza instead of involving itself in \\"further bloodshed\\". Leadership of Fianna F√°il (2011‚Äì2020)  =2011= In September 2010, doubts about Brian Cowen's abilities and political judgment as Taoiseach and party leader emerged following a disastrous early-morning radio interview on Morning Ireland. Cowen survived, however, that same month Martin admitted that he and other cabinet members, namely Brian Lenihan and Dermot Ahern, harboured ambitions to lead the party should a vacancy arise. While some backbench rebel Fianna F√°il TD's and senators called for Cowen to go, no cabinet minister publicly came forward to challenge the incumbent. In spite of this, Martin once again expressed an interest in running for the leadership of Fianna F√°il once the vacancy arises in December 2010 on RT√â's Saturday View radio programme. On 16 January 2011, Martin announced that he would vote against Brian Cowen in the upcoming confidence motion in his leadership of the party. He offered to resign as Minister for Foreign Affairs, but his resignation was initially refused by Cowen. Following the result of the motion, which Cowen won, the resignation was accepted. On 22 January 2011, just days after winning a vote of confidence, Brian Cowen announced that he was stepping down as leader of Fianna F√°il, but would remain as Taoiseach. On a special RT√â News programme that day, a number of Fianna F√°il TDs and senators came on the air and publicly backed Martin for the leadership. Later that evening, Martin formally announced his intention to seek support for the leadership of Fianna F√°il. He was immediately seen as the front-runner; however, a number of other candidates, including Brian Lenihan √âamon √ì Cu√≠v and Mary Hanafin, entered the field to ensure a contest. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan was seen as Martin's biggest rival for the position, however, his position was weakened due to his public declaration of support for Cowen the previous week. On 26 January 2011, the Fianna F√°il parliamentary party met to elect a new leader. Martin was proposed by Dara Calleary and seconded by √Åine Brady and received 33 first preference votes. After Hanafin and Lenihan had been eliminated from the contest and their surplus votes distributed, Martin emerged with 50 votes and was duly elected the eighth leader of Fianna F√°il. After election, he pledged to reinvigorate Fianna F√°il from its traditional centre ground roots, believing that Fianna F√°il has never delivered to the Irish people through the labels of left and right. Martin led the party into the 2011 general election, which saw Fianna F√°il swept from power in the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state. The party saw its first-preference vote more than halved. Without significant transfers, the count quickly turned into a rout. Ultimately, Fianna F√°il lost 57 seats, representing a decline of 75%‚Äìthe worst electoral performance in its 85-year history. The party was knocked down to only 20 seats for third place‚Äìthe first time in 79 years that it was not the largest party in the D√°il. While Martin and other Fianna F√°il leaders concluded early on that they would not be re-elected to another term in government, they were surprised by the severity of the defeat; they had hoped to hold onto at least 30 seats. In the wake of what has been described as \\"defeat on a historic scale\\", Martin pledged to renew the party \\"at every level\\". During the Seanad elections, Martin recommended support for 10 candidates, in an attempt to bring new blood into the parliamentary party. This caused resentment from Fianna F√°il Councillors and incumbent Fianna F√°il Senators. Only five of the recommended ten were elected, although the party performed better than expected winning fourteen seats. In August 2011, Martin approached Gay Byrne as a possible nominee for the presidential election, but this approach caused controversy within his party, who favoured an internal candidate, Brian Crowley, which was exacerbated on the declining of the nomination by Byrne and the withdrawal from the process by Crowley. In an opinion poll in September 2011, Fianna F√°il's popularity fell to 10%, several points lower than its performance in the February 2011 election. =2016‚Äì2018= In 2016, he criticized Fine Gael for plans to cut personal taxation in Ireland to levels seen in the United States.\\"Fianna F√°il ‚Äòa bit to the left‚Äô, says Miche√°l Martin\\": The Irish Times, Fiach Kelly, published 1/6/2016 At the 2016 general election, Martin led Fianna F√°il to a modest recovery, with a representation of 44 seats in the 158-member parliament.\\"Irish election: Rivals Fine Gael and Fianna F√°il to discuss forming new government\\": BBC, published 3/2/20 In 2016, he was nominated for Taoiseach, but no nominees received enough votes to be nominated as Taoiseach.\\"Irish election: D√°il fails to elect new taoiseach\\": BBC, published 3/10/2016 Martin was also the party Spokesperson on Northern Ireland. In January 2018, Martin stated that he would support a relaxation of Ireland's abortion stance, citing ‚Äúcruel inflexibility and unintended consequences‚Äù. Specifically, he said \\"he would vote in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment and to allow abortion on request until near the end of the first trimester,\\" leading to some political conflict within Fianna F√°il.\\"‚ÄòBrave‚Äô or ‚Äòa betrayal‚Äô?

A majority of 93 members of the D√°il voted in favour of him taking the role, while 63 members voted against him. On 29 June 2020, there was a controversy surrounding Martin and the other party leaders for not selecting any ministers from the West of Ireland with Dara Calleary becoming Chief Whip and not a senior Minister. On 14 July 2020, following drink-driving revelations, he sacked Barry Cowen as Minister for Agriculture and the Marine. On 21 August 2020, following the Golfgate scandal, Cowen's successor Dara Calleary resigned after attending a social hosted by the Oireachtas Golf Society which was contrary to national health guidelines surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Personal life Martin is married to Mary O'Shea, whom he met at university, and together the couple have had five children. In October 2010, Martin's youngest daughter, L√©ana, died in Great Ormond Street Hospital after suffering from a heart condition. Eleven years earlier his son, Ruair√≠, died in infancy.

The Protocol was intended to finally resolve the long-running territorial dispute between the two countries, and brought about the official end of the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War of 1941-1942. Nevertheless, the Protocol was incomplete, and war broke out between Peru and Ecuador twice more, in 1981 and in 1995, before the signing of the Itamaraty Peace Declaration which brought final resolution to the dispute. History In May 1941, as tensions at the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border mounted and war was imminent, the governments of the United States, Brazil, and Argentina offered their services in aiding in the mediation of the dispute. Their efforts failed to prevent the outbreak of hostilities on July 23, 1941, but the diplomatic intervention led to a definitive cease-fire being put into place on July 31. Despite this, limited skirmishes continued to occur through the months of August and September in the Ecuadorian provinces of El Oro and Loja, as well as in the Amazonian lands. Ecuador accused Peru of continuing its advances into the highland province of Azuay. On October 2, with military observers from the three mediating countries serving as witnesses, Ecuador and Peru signed the Talara Accord, which created a demilitarized zone inside the provinces of El Oro and Loja, pending the signing of a definitive peace treaty. Diplomatic efforts continued, with the mediating countries being joined by Chile. With its recent entry into World War II, the United States was eager to present a united American continent. At the third Pan-American Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the United States encouraged a settlement between the two countries. On January 29, 1942, on the final day of the third Pan-American Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, the foreign ministers of Ecuador and Peru, Julio Tobar Donoso and Alfredo Solf y Muro, signed a \\"Protocol of Peace, Friendship, and Boundaries\\", known as the Rio de Janeiro Protocol. The observers from the United States, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile co-signed the document, becoming \\"Guarantors of the Protocol\\". The Rio Protocol was subsequently ratified by each country's congress on February 26, 1942. By the terms of the Protocol, Ecuador agreed to withdraw its long- standing claim for rights to direct land access to the Mara√±on and Amazon rivers; Peru agreed to withdraw Peruvian military forces from Ecuadorian territory. An area of of hitherto disputed territory in the Maynas region of the Amazonian basin was awarded to Peru, which had been established to be the de facto possessor of the land since the end of the 19th century. The status quo line defined in the 1936 Lima Accord was used as the basis for the definitive border line; the previous border recognized current possessions, but not sovereignty. Relative to the 1936 line, Ecuador ceded 18,552 km¬≤ of previously possessed territory to Peru, while Peru ceded 5,072 km¬≤ of previously possessed territory to Ecuador.Julio Tobar Donoso, La Invasi√≥n Peruana y el Protocolo de Rio. Antecedentes y Explicaci√≥n Hist√≥rica. Quito, Banco Central del Ecuador, 1982 (1st Ed. 1945). P. 462. During the 1960s, the Ecuadorian government alleged that the Protocol was invalid, because it had been signed under coercion while foreign troops were stationed on Ecuadorian soil. This stance was modified by subsequent governments, but was never officially reverted until the resolution of the dispute in 1995. The intended goal of the Rio Protocol was not fulfilled until the signing of the Itamaraty Peace Declaration in 1995. Between the signing of the two treaties, the Paquisha Incident and the Cenepa War rekindled the dispute.

Biography  = Early life and education = Rabin was born in 1931 in Breslau, Germany (today Wroc≈Çaw, in Poland), the son of a rabbi. In 1935, he emigrated with his family to Mandate Palestine. As a young boy, he was very interested in mathematics and his father sent him to the best high school in Haifa, where he studied under mathematician Elisha Netanyahu, who was then a high school teacher. After high school, he was drafted into the army during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. The mathematician Abraham Fraenkel, who was a professor of mathematics in Jerusalem, intervened with the army command, and Rabin was discharged to study at the university in 1949. He received an M.Sc. from Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1953 and a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1956. = Career = Rabin became Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley (1961‚Äì62) and MIT (1962-63). Before moving to Harvard University as Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science in 1981, he was a professor at the Hebrew University. In the late 1950s, he was invited for a summer to do research for IBM at the Lamb Estate in Westchester County, New York with other promising mathematicians and scientists. It was there that he and Dana Scott wrote the paper \\"Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems\\". Soon, using nondeterministic automata, they were able to re-prove Kleene's result that finite state machines exactly accept regular languages. As to the origins of what was to become computational complexity theory, the next summer Rabin returned to the Lamb Estate. John McCarthy posed a puzzle to him about spies, guards, and passwords, which Rabin studied and soon after he wrote an article, \\"Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and Hierarchy of Recursive Sets.\\"Rabin, M.O., \\"Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and Hierarchy of Recursive Sets\\", Technical Report No. 2, O.N.R., Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1960 Nondeterministic machines have become a key concept in computational complexity theory, particularly with the description of the complexity classes P and NP. Rabin then returned to Jerusalem, researching logic, and working on the foundations of what would later be known as computer science. He was an associate professor and the head of the Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University at 29 years old, and a full professor by 33. Rabin recalls, \\"There was absolutely no appreciation of the work on the issues of computing. Mathematicians did not recognize the emerging new field\\". In 1960, he was invited by Edward F. Moore to work at Bell Labs, where Rabin introduced probabilistic automata that employ coin tosses in order to decide which state transitions to take. He showed examples of regular languages that required a very large number of states, but for which you get an exponential reduction of the number of states if you go over to probabilistic automata. In 1969, Rabin proved that the second-order theory of n successors is decidable. A key component of the proof implicitly showed determinacy of parity games, which lie in the third level of the Borel hierarchy. In 1975, Rabin finished his tenure as Rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA as a visiting professor. Gary Miller was also there and had his polynomial time test for primality based on the extended Riemann hypothesis. While there, Rabin invented the Miller‚ÄìRabin primality test, a randomized algorithm that can determine very quickly (but with a tiny probability of error) whether a number is prime. Rabin's method was based on previous work of Gary Miller that solved the problem deterministically with the assumption that the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, but Rabin's version of the test made no such assumption. Fast primality testing is key in the successful implementation of most public-key cryptography, and in 2003 Miller, Rabin, Robert M. Solovay, and Volker Strassen were given the Paris Kanellakis Award for their work on primality testing. In 1976 he was invited by Joseph Traub to meet at Carnegie Mellon University and presented the primality test. After he gave that lecture, Traub had said, \\"No, no, this is revolutionary, and it's going to become very important.\\" In 1979, Rabin invented the Rabin cryptosystem, the first asymmetric cryptosystem whose security was proved equivalent to the intractability of integer factorization. In 1981, Rabin reinvented a weak variant of the technique of oblivious transfer invented by Wiesner under the name of multiplexing, allowing a sender to transmit a message to a receiver where the receiver has some probability between 0 and 1 of learning the message, with the sender being unaware whether the receiver was able to do so. In 1987, Rabin, together with Richard Karp, created one of the most well-known efficient string search algorithms, the Rabin‚ÄìKarp string search algorithm, known for its rolling hash. Rabin's more recent research has concentrated on computer security. He is currently the Thomas J. Watson Sr. Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University and Professor of Computer Science at Hebrew University. During the spring semester of 2007, he was a visiting professor at Columbia University teaching Introduction to Cryptography.  Awards and honours Rabin is a foreign member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, a member of the French Academy of Sciences and a foreign member of the Royal Society. In 1976, the Turing Award was awarded jointly to Rabin and Dana Scott for a paper written in 1959, the citation for which states that the award was granted: > For their joint paper \\"Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems,\\" which > introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines, which has proved to be an > enormously valuable concept. Their (Scott & Rabin) classic paper has been a > continuous source of inspiration for subsequent work in this field.ACM > Turing Award Citation In 1995, Rabin was awarded the Israel Prize, in computer sciences. In 2010, Rabin was awarded the Tel Aviv University Dan David Prize (\\"Future\\" category), jointly with Leonard Kleinrock and Gordon E. Moore, for Computers and Telecommunications. Rabin was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science from Harvard University in 2017.

El Periquillo was written in 1816, though due to government censorship the last of four volumes was not published until 1831. The novel has been continuously in print in more than twenty editions since then. El Periquillo Sarniento can be read as a nation-building novel, written at a critical moment in the transition of Mexico (and Latin America) from Colony to Independence. Jean Franco has characterized the novel as \\"a ferocious indictment of Spanish administration in Mexico: ignorance, superstition and corruption are seen to be its most notable characteristics\\".[Jean Franco, An Introduction to Spanish-American Literature (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 34; cited in Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, revised edition (London: Verso, 1991), p. 29] Given Lizardi's career as a pioneering Mexican journalist, his novel can also be read as a journal of opinion in the guise of a picaresque novel. It follows the adventures of Pedro Sarmiento (nicknamed \\"Periquillo Sarniento\\" or \\"Mangy Parrot\\" by his disreputable friends), who, like Lizardi himself, is the son of a Criollo family from Mexico City with more pretensions to \\"good birth\\" than means of support. The story begins with Periquillo's birth and miseducation and continues through his endless attempts to make an unearned living, as a student, a friar, a gambler, a notary, a barber, a pharmacist, a doctor, a beggar, a soldier, a count, and a thief, until late in life he sees the light and begins to lead an honest life. At every point along the way, Lizardi uses the deathbed voice of the elderly and repentant Periquillo to lambast the social conditions that led to his wasted life. In this, the novelist mimics the role of the early nineteenth-century journalist more interested in arguing opinions than relating mundane incidents. The marriage of slapstick humor with moralizing social commentary, established in El Periquillo, remained a constant in the Mexican novels that followed on its heels throughout the nineteenth century.(Antonio Benitez-Rojo, \\"Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Fern√°ndez de Lizardi and the Emergence of the Spanish American Novel as National Project,\\" Modern Language Quarterly 57 (2): pp. 334‚Äì35) Agust√≠n Y√°√±ez justifies this often criticized \\"moralizing\\" tendency in Lizardi as \\"a constant in the artistic production of Mexico... and moreover, it is a constant in Mexican life\\".(\\"El Pensador Mexicano,\\" in Cedomil Goic, ed., Historia y cr√≠tica de la literatura hispanoamericana, t. I, √âpoca colonial, Barcelona: Grijalbo, 1988, pp. 428‚Äì29) At the same time, as critics have noted, Lizardi's interest in depicting the realities and reproducing the speech of Mexicans from all social classes make his novel a bridge between the inherited picaresque mold that forms its overt structure and the costumbrista novels of the nineteenth century. Place in Lizardi's Work Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Fern√°ndez de Lizardi is emblematic of the generation of intellectuals, artists, and writers who led Mexico into the modern era. His own life history resonates with the ambivalences and outright contradictions of a world between colonial rule and independence. His writings ‚Äî four novels, several fables, two plays, dozens of poems, over 250 articles and pamphlets ‚Äî are important in three ways: as artistic expressions in themselves; as texts that contributed in vital ways to the intellectual life of Mexico early in its independence; and as windows into the daily life of that period. Of Lizardi's many published works, El Periquillo Sarniento remains the most important. It typifies the dual impulse of his writing: to entertain and to edify. It is also a lively, comic novel that captures much of the reality of Mexico in 1816. In his subsequent novels Noches tristes (1818) and La Quijotita y su prima (1818‚Äì19), Lizardi's didactic side won out over his will to entertain. La Quijotita in particular is an exercise in moralizing, populated with flat characters whose function is to model particular foibles or virtues. Lizardi's last novel, Don Catr√≠n de la Fachenda (1820), has on the contrary been held up by some critics as superior to El Periquillo. In Don Catr√≠n, Lizardi took pains to respond to critics of the overt moralizing in his first novel. The result is a slimmed- down, artistically unified, more ironic, and darker picaresque.(Nancy Vogeley, \\"A Latin American Enlightenment Version of the Picaresque: Lizardi's Don Catr√≠n de la Fachenda,\\" in Carmen Benito-Vessels and Michael Zappala, eds., The Picaresque, Newark: University of Delaware Press, 1994, pp. 123‚Äì46) Yet El Periquillo retains its importance. As Antonio Ben√≠tez-Rojo writes, citing Benedict Anderson's use of El Periquillo as an exemplar of the anti-colonial novel, \\"the illusion of accompanying Periquillo along the roads and through the villages and towns of the viceroyalty helped awaken in the novel's readers the desire for nationness.\\" Don Catr√≠n \\"is artistically superior to El Periquillo Sarniento,\\" Ben√≠tez-Rojo continues, \\"yet for all its defects the latter, because of its great vitality, is a major work of Mexican literature.\\"(\\"Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Fern√°ndez de Lizardi and the Emergence of the Spanish American Novel as National Project,\\" p. 335; p. 336.) Finally, El Periquillo has the virtue of being the first, as Lizardi himself noted: \\"I am far from believing that I have written a masterpiece that is free from defects: it has many that I recognize, and must have others still that I have not noticed; but it also has one undeniable distinction, which is that of being the first novel that has been written in this country by an American in three hundred years.\\"(Cited in Jefferson Rea Spell, Bridging the Gap, Mexico City: Editorial Libros de M√©xico, 1971, p. 267.) Because of its status as the first novel written by a Latin American and one emulated by generations of Mexican novelists, El Periquillo Sarniento appears on many \\"must-read\\" lists for graduate programs in Latin American literature, and it is of equal interest to students of Latin American history.

At the 1977 general election he stood for the D√°il in the Dublin Clontarf constituency as a Fianna F√°il candidate and was elected alongside Fianna F√°il stalwart George Colley. From 1981 to 2011, he was elected for the Dublin North-East constituency. In 1979, Jack Lynch appointed him as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Government Chief Whip). That same year Woods supported Colley in his leadership bid, but the other candidate, Charles Haughey, was successful. Despite Woods having supported Colley, Haughey appointed him Minister for Health and Social Welfare. He held that post until 1981, and again in the short-lived 1982 government. In 1987, Fianna F√°il returned to power and he returned as Minister for Social Welfare. In 1991, he became Minister for Agriculture and Food. In 1992, Woods entered the contest to succeed Haughey as leader. He received little support and withdrew from the contest. The eventual victor, Albert Reynolds, retained Woods as Minister for the Marine in his new cabinet. Following the formation of the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìLabour Party coalition in 1993, Woods remained in the cabinet, this time with the Social Welfare portfolio, and‚Äîafter the mass resignation of the Labour ministers‚Äîwas additionally appointed Minister for Health. After three years in opposition, Fianna F√°il returned to power in 1997. Woods was appointed Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. He introduced a ¬£70 million overhaul of Ireland's fishing fleet and also launched a new maritime college. In the cabinet reshuffle in 2000, he replaced Miche√°l Martin as Minister for Education. Woods was not retained in the cabinet following the 2002 general election. He was Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs from 2002 to 2007. He retired from politics at the 2011 general election. Controversies While serving as Minister for Education, Woods signed a controversial agreement with 18 Irish religious orders involved in child sex- abuse scandals which limited their compensation liability to the victims of abuse to only ‚Ç¨128 million. This compensation scheme is projected to eventually cost the Irish government ‚Ç¨1.35 billion. The agreement was signed just before the 2002 general election, and consequently was not laid before the cabinet for its approval. It then remained unpublished for several months. In 2003, after brokering the deal, Woods claimed his strong Catholic faith made him the most suitable person to negotiate the deal. He also denied allegations that he was a member of Opus Dei or the Knights of Saint Columbanus after the group Survivors of Child Abuse alleged he was a member of the former. After the publication of the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA), Woods defended the deal; he claimed the Department of Education and Science had the management role in the schools in question and that the state knew all the details when making the deal. Mary Raftery criticised his remarks, pointing out that some of them contradicted remarks made by Woods himself.

The antoninianus, or pre-reform radiate, was a coin used during the Roman Empire thought to have been valued at 2 denarii. It was initially silver, but was slowly debased to bronze with a minimal silver content. The coin was introduced by Caracalla in early 215 AD. It was silver, similar to the denarius except that it was slightly larger and featured the emperor wearing a radiate crown, indicating it was a double denomination. Antoniniani depicting women (usually the emperor's wife) featured the bust resting upon a crescent moon. Even at its introduction, the silver content of the antoninianus was only equal to 1.5 denarii. This created inflation: People rapidly hoarded the denarii (Gresham's law), while both buyers and sellers recognized the new coin had a lower intrinsic value and elevated their prices to compensate. Silver bullion supplies began running short because the Roman Empire was no longer conquering new territory, the Iberian silver mines had been exhausted, and a series of soldier emperors and usurpers needed coin to pay their troops and buy their loyalty. Each new issue of the antoninianus thus had less silver in it than the last, and thus contributed to ever-increasing inflation. In 271 AD Aurelian increased the average weight of the antoninianus, this change lasting for only a short time. Around this time, the enigmatic 'XXI' was first marked on the reverse of the antoninianus. The true meaning of this series of numbers is still a topic of debate, but is thought to represent a 20:1 silver ratio (4.76% silver, which may originally have been 5%, if worn-away silver enrichment on the surface is allowed for). By the late 3rd century AD, antoniniani were almost entirely made of bronze reclaimed from melted-down older issues like the sestertius. Vast quantities were minted, with a large percentage of the circulating stock being contemporary forgeries, often with blundered legends and designs. Individual coins were by then practically worthless, and were lost or discarded by the millions. The resultant situation was not unlike the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in 1920s Germany, when paper money was printed in reckless abundance. The coin ceased to be used by the end of the 3rd century, when a series of monetary reforms attempted to arrest the decline by issuing new coinage. The rapid decline in silver purity of the antoninianus. Today most of these coins are extremely common finds, with a few scarcer examples including Aemilianus, Marcus Aurelius Marius, Quietus, and Regalianus. Modern numismatists use \\"antoninianus\\" because it is not known what it was called in antiquity. An ancient Roman document called the Historia Augusta (of generally low reliability) refers to silver coins named after an Antoninus on several occasions (several Roman emperors in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries bore this name). Because Caracalla's silver coin was a new issue, and he had taken Antoninus as part of his imperial name, an association (though likely false) was made with it, and the name stuck.

Otis's composition \\"Strawberry Letter 23\\" (as recorded by The Brothers Johnson) topped the Billboard R&B; chart and reached #5 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977. He also achieved commercial success with his 1974 single \\"Inspiration Information\\" (from the album of the same title), reaching #56 on the R&B; chart. Biography Born in Los Angeles, California, Otis is the son of rhythm and blues pioneer, musician, bandleader, and impresario Johnny Otis, who was of Greek descent, and his wife Phyllis Walker, who was of African American and Filipino descent. The name \\"Shuggie\\" (short for \\"sugar,\\" according to his mother) was coined by Phyllis when he was a newborn. Otis began playing guitar when he was two years old and performing professionally with his father's band at the age of eleven, often disguising himself with dark glasses and a false mustache so that he could play with his father's band in after-hours nightclubs. Otis, primarily known as a guitarist, also sings and plays a multitude of other instruments. While growing up with and being heavily influenced by many blues, jazz and R&B; musicians in his father Johnny's immediate circle, Otis began to gravitate towards the popular music of his generation such as Jimi Hendrix, Arthur Lee (of the band Love), and Sly Stone. In 1969, Al Kooper asked Otis to be the featured guest on the second installment (Kooper Session) of the Super Session album series that had previously included Stephen Stills and Mike Bloomfield. Kooper and the then- fifteen-year-old Otis recorded the whole album over one weekend in New York. Immediately returning to Los Angeles, Otis, along with his father and singer Delmar \\"Mighty Mouth\\" Evans, performed on the album Cold Shot (by the elder Otis), released in 1969 on the Los Angeles-based Kent label. Another obscure album this three-man team recorded was the extremely rare and risque Snatch & The Poontangs, on which Otis recorded tracks under the pseudonym \\"Prince Wunnerful\\". Otis then released his first solo album later that year entitled Here Comes Shuggie Otis on Epic Records. Countless musicians were his guests on that debut attempt, including Johnny, Leon Haywood, Al McKibbon, Wilton Felder. This further established his reputation and catapulted him to the attention of B. B. King, who was quoted in a 1970 issue of Guitar Player magazine saying Otis was his \\"favorite new guitarist\\". Some of the artists Otis performed and recorded with during that time include Frank Zappa (having played electric bass on the legendary jazz instrumental, \\"Peaches en Regalia\\" from the 1969 album Hot Rats), Etta James, Eddie Vinson, Richard Berry, Louis Jordan, and Bobby 'Blue' Bland, among many others. The album Otis received the most recognition for was his second Epic Records release in 1971, Freedom Flight, which featured his hit \\"Strawberry Letter 23\\". Both the album and single reached the Billboard Top 200 and the Billboard Hot 100, respectively and caught the attention of Brothers Johnson guitarist George Johnson, who then played it for producer Quincy Jones. They covered the song and it instantly became a smash hit. Even though Otis played most of his own parts in the studio, the lineup on this album was quite extensive, including keyboardist George Duke and Aynsley Dunbar of Frank Zappa, Journey and Whitesnake fame. In 1974, Otis released Inspiration Information, his third and final album for Epic Records. The album had taken almost three years to finish. All the songs were written and arranged by Otis himself, who played every musical instrument on the album, except for horns and some strings. However, despite its long-awaited impact, Inspiration Information had but one single (the title track) reach the Billboard Hot 100. After the album's release, Otis was approached by Billy Preston on behalf of The Rolling Stones, asking him to join the band for their upcoming world tour. He declined the offer, along with the chance to work with Quincy Jones in helping produce Otis's next album. After a series of similar refusals, Otis gained the reputation of \\"taking his time\\", and his recording contract with Epic Records was nullified. Otis's only credited works throughout the mid-1970s were done as a session musician for his father's recording projects. Inspiration Information gained a huge cult following during the 1990s with the emergence of rare groove and acid jazz. It was lauded by such musicians as Prince and Lenny Kravitz. Due in part to this regained interest, the album was re- released on April 3, 2001, by David Byrne's independent label Luaka Bop Records. This CD re-issue includes all nine original album tracks plus four songs taken from Otis' 1971 album Freedom Flight, and features new cover art, liner notes, and exclusive never-seen-before photos. Otis is featured in every one of his father Johnny's books, as well as Alligator Records Presents West Coast Blues, issued in August 1998. Otis and Sony Music Entertainment made a deal for a double CD which was released on April 20, 2013. It is a re-release of Inspiration/Information. Added to the album are several bonus tracks, including an accompanying album entitled Wings of Love. Wings of Love is an album of previously unreleased material, all of which was written from 1975 to the present, including live material from some of his performances. It will be available on Shugiterius records (Otis's company) and Sony records, through Sony Music Entertainment. Otis and a band entitled Shuggie Otis Rite toured internationally in 2013 in support of the release, including Australia, Japan, the U.S., Ireland and the U.K. Their performances earned rave reviews from critics. A new, mostly instrumental, album was released in April 2018 titled Inter-Fusion. Personal life Otis had a son named Johnny III, known as Lucky Otis, with his first wife Miss Mercy of The GTOs, an all-girl group produced by Frank Zappa. Soon after his first marriage ended, he married Lillian Wilson (known as Teri), daughter of trumpeter/bandleader/Latin-jazz pioneer Gerald Wilson; they had a son, Eric, naming him after Eric Dolphy, who was one of Gerald's bandmates and close friends. Both of Shuggie's sons, Lucky and Eric, are musicians. Eric has played and toured in his father's band. Lucky, a bassist, began by playing with his grandfather, Johnny Otis, and then launched a solo career, heading his own group Otis Ledbetter with partner Louis Ledbetter, great-grandson of blues musician Lead Belly. He has also fronted a 13-piece rhythm-and-blues orchestra, The New Johnny Otis All-Stars, continuing his grandfather's Big Band legacy.

She has been a McGraw Distinguished Lecturer at Princeton University and was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences following a term in residence at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ. Tannen is the author of twelve books, including That's Not What I Meant! and You Just Don't Understand, the latter of which spent four years on the New York Times Best Sellers List, including eight consecutive months at number one. She is also a frequent contributor to The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, and TIME magazine, among other publications. Education Tannen graduated from Hunter College High School and completed her undergraduate studies at Harpur College (now part of Binghamton University) with a B.A. in English Literature. Tannen went on to earn a Masters in English Literature at Wayne State University. Later, she continued her academic studies at UC Berkeley, earning an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Linguistics. Writing career Tannen has lectured worldwide in her field, and written and edited numerous academic publications on linguistics, discourse analysis, and interpersonal communication. She has published many books including Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends; Talking Voices: Repetition, Dialogue and Imagery in Conversational Discourse; Gender and Discourse; and The Handbook of Discourse Analysis. Her major theoretical contribution, presented in Talking Voices, is a poetics of conversation. She demonstrates that everyday conversation is made up of linguistic features that are traditionally regarded as literary, such as repetition, dialogue, and imagery. Tannen has also written several general-audience books on interpersonal communication and public discourse. She became well known in the United States after her book You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in Conversation was published in 1990. It remained on the New York Times Best Seller list for nearly four years, and was subsequently translated into 30 other languages. She has written several other general-audience books and mainstream articles between 1983 and 2017. Two of her recent books, You Were Always Mom's Favorite!: Sisters in Conversation Throughout Their Lives and You're Wearing THAT?: Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation were also New York Times best-sellers. Among her other books, The Argument Culture received the Common Ground Book Award, and I Only Say This Because I Love You received a Books for a Better Life Award. Research =Overview= Deborah Tannen's main research has focused on the expression of interpersonal relationships in conversational interaction. Tannen has explored conversational interaction and style differences at a number of different levels and as related to different situations, including differences in conversational style as connected to the gender and cultural background, as well as speech that is tailored for specific listeners based on the speaker's social role. In particular, Tannen has done extensive gender-linked research and writing that focused on miscommunications between men and women; however, some linguists have argued against Tannen's claims from a feminist standpoint. Tannen's research began when she analyzed her friends while working on her Ph.D. Since then, she has collected several naturally occurring conversations on tape and conducted interviews as forms of data for later analysis. She has also compiled and analyzed information from other researchers in order to draw out notable trends in various types of conversations, sometimes borrowing and expanding on their terminology to emphasize new points of interest. =Gender differences in US family interaction= Tannen highlighted the \\"Telling Your Day\\" ritual that takes place in many U.S. families, in which, typically, the mother in a two-parent family encourages a child to share details (about their day which the mother has typically already heard about) with the father. She also emphasizes the common occurrence of the \\"troubles talk\\" ritual in women. This ritual involves a woman sharing details about \\"a frustrating experience\\" or other previously encountered problem with a confidant. She cites this ritual of an example of how, for many women, closeness is established through sharing personal details. As one example of gender-linked misinterpretations, Tannen points out that a man who is on the receiving end of \\"troubles talk\\" from his wife will often take the mention of a problem and how it was handled as an invitation to pass judgment, despite the fact that \\"troubles talk\\" is simply an expository experience meant to enhance emotional connections. =Interplay of connection maneuvers and power maneuvers in family conversations= Tannen once described family discourse as \\"a prime example‚Ä¶of the nexus of needs for both power and connection in human relationships. She coined the term \\"connection maneuvers\\" to describe interactions that take place in the closeness dimension of the traditional model of power and connection; this term is meant to contrast with the \\"control maneuvers,\\" which, according to psychologists Millar, Rogers, and Bavelas, take place in the power dimension of the same model. Tannen challenged the conventional view of power (hierarchy) and connection (solidarity) as \\"unidimensional and mutually exclusive\\" and offered her own kind of model for mapping the interplay of these two aspects of communication, which takes the form of a two-dimensional grid (Figure 1). Figure 1: Tannen's Power vs. Connection grid. In this model, the vertical axis represents the level of power in the interaction, and the horizontal axis represents connection. Having presented this model, Tannen proposed that in the American paradigm, a sibling relationship would be mapped in the bottom left quadrant, as there is a high level of closeness and a relative equality that is not comparable to the power dynamic in an American parent/child relationship. Using this new model, Tannen argues that connection maneuvers do not only occur independently of control maneuvers. Among other examples, she mentions a wife who refuses to let her husband take over making popcorn by saying \\"You always burn it\\". According to Tannen, the wife's resistance to her husband's request is a control maneuver, but by citing a potential undesirable effect for her family (i.e. burnt popcorn), she ties a connection maneuver into her attempt to enforce a decision. Tannen also highlights ventriloquizing ‚Äì which she explains as a \\"phenomenon by which a person speaks not only for another but also as another\\" ‚Äì as a strategy for integrating connection maneuvers into other types of interactions. As an example of this, she cites an exchange recorded by her research team in which a mother attempts to convince her son to pick up his toys by ventriloquizing the family's dogs: \\"[extra high pitch] We're naughty, but we're not as naughty as Jared\\". =Conversational style= Deborah Tannen describes the notion of conversational style as \\"a semantic process\\" and \\"the way meaning is encoded in and derived from speech\\". She cites the work of R. Lakoff and J. Gumperz as the inspiration behind her thinking. According to Tannen, some features of conversational style are topic (which includes type of topics and how transitions occur), genre (storytelling style), pace (which includes rate of speech, occurrence or lack of pauses, and overlap), and expressive paralinguistics (pitch/amplitude shifts and other changes in voice quality). =\\"High-involvement\\" vs. \\"high-considerateness\\"= Based on a two-and-a-half hour recording of Thanksgiving dinner conversations with friends, Tannen analyzed the two prevailing conversational styles among the six participants, which she divided evenly between the categories of New Yorker and non-New Yorker. Upon analyzing the recording, Tannen came to the conclusion that the speech of the New Yorkers was characterized by exaggerated intonations (paralinguistics), overlapping speech between two or more speakers, short silences, and machine-gun questions, which she defines as questions that are \\"uttered quickly, timed to overlap or latch onto another's talk, and characterized by reduced syntactic form\\". The style of the non-New Yorkers was opposite that of the New Yorkers in all regards mentioned above; furthermore, the non-New Yorkers were caught off-guard by the New Yorkers' exaggerated intonation and interrupting questions, two factors that discouraged them from finishing their conversations at some points. Tannen refers to the New Yorkers' style as \\"high-involvement\\" and the unimposing style of the non-New Yorkers as \\"high-considerateness\\". =Indirectness in work situations= Tannen has expressed her stance against taking indirect speech as a sign of weakness or as a lack of confidence; she also set out to debunk the idea that American women are generally more indirect than men. She reached this conclusion by looking through transcripts of conversations and interviews, as well as through correspondence with her readers. One example she uses against the second idea comes from a letter from a reader, who mentioned how his Navy superior trained his unit to respond to the indirect request \\"It's hot in this room\\" as a direct request to open the window. A different letter mentions the tendency of men to be more indirect when it comes to expressing feelings than women. Tannen also mentions exchanges where both participants are male, but the two participants are not of equal social status. As a specific example, she mentions a \\"black box\\" recording between a plane captain and a co-pilot in which the captain's failure to understand the co-pilot's indirect conversational style (which was likely a result of his relatively inferior rank) caused a crash. =Indirectness as a sociocultural norm= During a trip to Greece, Tannen observed that comments she had made to her hosts about foods she had not seen yet in Greece (specifically, scrambled eggs and grapes) had been interpreted as indirect requests for the foods. This was surprising to her, since she had just made the comments in the spirit of small talk. Tannen observed this same tendency of Greeks and Greek-Americans to interpret statements indirectly in a study that involved interpreting the following conversation between a husband and a wife: : The participants ‚Äì some Greeks, some Greek-Americans, and some non-Greek Americans ‚Äì had to choose between the following two paraphrases of the second line in the exchange: : Tannen's findings showed that 48% of Greeks chose the first (more indirect) paraphrase, while only 32% of non-Greek Americans chose the same one, with the Greek- Americans scoring closer to the Greeks than the other Americans at 43%. These percentages, combined with other elements of the study, suggest that the degree of indirectness a listener generally expects may be affected through sociocultural norms. =Agonism in written academic discourse= Tannen analyzed the agonistic framing of academic texts, which are characterized by their \\"ritualized adversativeness\\". She argued that expectations for academic papers in the US place the highest importance on presenting the weaknesses of an existing, opposing, argument as a basis for bolstering the author's replacement argument. According to her, agonism limits the depth of arguments and learning, since authors who follow the convention pass up opportunities to acknowledge strengths in the texts they are arguing against; in addition, this places the newest, attention-grabbing works in prime positions to be torn apart.

Pierre de Fermat was one of the first mathematicians to propose a general technique, adequality, for finding the maxima and minima of functions. As defined in set theory, the maximum and minimum of a set are the greatest and least elements in the set, respectively. Unbounded infinite sets, such as the set of real numbers, have no minimum or maximum. Definition A real-valued function f defined on a domain X has a global (or absolute) maximum point at x‚àó, if f(x‚àó) ‚â• f(x) for all x in X. Similarly, the function has a global (or absolute) minimum point at x‚àó, if f(x‚àó) ‚â§ f(x) for all x in X. The value of the function at a maximum point is called the maximum value of the function, denoted \\\\max(f(x)), and the value of the function at a minimum point is called the minimum value of the function. Symbolically, this can be written as follows: :x_0 \\\\in \\\\mathrm{X} is a global maximum point of function f:\\\\mathrm{X} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, if (\\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\mathrm{X})\\\\, f(x_0) \\\\geq f(x). The definition of global minimum point also proceeds similarly. If the domain X is a metric space, then f is said to have a local (or relative) maximum point at the point x‚àó, if there exists some Œµ > 0 such that f(x‚àó) ‚â• f(x) for all x in X within distance Œµ of x‚àó. Similarly, the function has a local minimum point at x‚àó, if f(x‚àó) ‚â§ f(x) for all x in X within distance Œµ of x‚àó. A similar definition can be used when X is a topological space, since the definition just given can be rephrased in terms of neighbourhoods. Mathematically, the given definition is written as follows: :Let (\\\\mathrm{X}, d_\\\\mathrm{X}) be a metric space and function f:\\\\mathrm{X} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}. Then x_0 \\\\in \\\\mathrm{X} is a local maximum point of function f if (\\\\exists \\\\varepsilon > 0) such that (\\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\mathrm{X})\\\\, d_\\\\mathrm{X}(x, x_0)<\\\\varepsilon \\\\implies f(x_0)\\\\geq f(x). The definition of local minimum point can also proceed similarly. In both the global and local cases, the concept of a strict extremum can be defined. For example, x‚àó is a strict global maximum point if for all x in X with x ‚â† x‚àó, we have f(x‚àó) > f(x), and x‚àó is a strict local maximum point if there exists some Œµ > 0 such that, for all x in X within distance Œµ of x‚àó with x ‚â† x‚àó, we have f(x‚àó) > f(x). Note that a point is a strict global maximum point if and only if it is the unique global maximum point, and similarly for minimum points. A continuous real-valued function with a compact domain always has a maximum point and a minimum point. An important example is a function whose domain is a closed and bounded interval of real numbers (see the graph above). Search Finding global maxima and minima is the goal of mathematical optimization. If a function is continuous on a closed interval, then by the extreme value theorem, global maxima and minima exist. Furthermore, a global maximum (or minimum) either must be a local maximum (or minimum) in the interior of the domain, or must lie on the boundary of the domain. So a method of finding a global maximum (or minimum) is to look at all the local maxima (or minima) in the interior, and also look at the maxima (or minima) of the points on the boundary, and take the largest (or smallest) one. Likely the most important, yet quite obvious, feature of continuous real-valued functions of a real variable is that they decrease before local minima and increase afterwards, likewise for maxima. (Formally, if f is continuous real-valued function of a real variable x, then x0 is a local minimum if and only if there exist a0 **0 ) and increases on (x0,b)) A direct consequence of this is the Fermat's theorem, which states that local extrema must occur at critical points (or points where the function is non-differentiable). One can distinguish whether a critical point is a local maximum or local minimum by using the first derivative test, second derivative test, or higher-order derivative test, given sufficient differentiability. For any function that is defined piecewise, one finds a maximum (or minimum) by finding the maximum (or minimum) of each piece separately, and then seeing which one is largest (or smallest). Examples e. * The function x2 has a unique global minimum at x = 0. * The function x3 has no global minima or maxima. Although the first derivative (3x2) is 0 at x = 0, this is an inflection point. * The function \\\\sqrt[x]{x} has a unique global maximum at x = e. (See figure at right) * The function x‚àíx has a unique global maximum over the positive real numbers at x = 1/e. * The function x3/3 ‚àí x has first derivative x2 ‚àí 1 and second derivative 2x. Setting the first derivative to 0 and solving for x gives stationary points at ‚àí1 and +1. From the sign of the second derivative, we can see that ‚àí1 is a local maximum and +1 is a local minimum. Note that this function has no global maximum or minimum. * The function x has a global minimum at x = 0 that cannot be found by taking derivatives, because the derivative does not exist at x = 0. * The function cos(x) has infinitely many global maxima at 0, ¬±2, ¬±4, ..., and infinitely many global minima at ¬±œÄ, ¬±3œÄ, ¬±5œÄ, .... * The function 2 cos(x) ‚àí x has infinitely many local maxima and minima, but no global maximum or minimum. * The function cos(3x)/x with 0.1 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1.1 has a global maximum at x = 0.1 (a boundary), a global minimum near x = 0.3, a local maximum near x = 0.6, and a local minimum near x = 1.0. (See figure at top of page.) * The function x3 \\\\+ 3x2 ‚àí 2x + 1 defined over the closed interval (segment) [‚àí4,2] has a local maximum at x = ‚àí1‚àí/3, a local minimum at x = ‚àí1+/3, a global maximum at x = 2 and a global minimum at x = ‚àí4. Functions of more than one variable Peano surface, a counterexample to some criteria of local maxima of the 19th centuryThe global maximum is the point at the top Counterexample: The red dot shows a local minimum that is not a global minimum For functions of more than one variable, similar conditions apply. For example, in the (enlargeable) figure on the right, the necessary conditions for a local maximum are similar to those of a function with only one variable. The first partial derivatives as to z (the variable to be maximized) are zero at the maximum (the glowing dot on top in the figure). The second partial derivatives are negative. These are only necessary, not sufficient, conditions for a local maximum, because of the possibility of a saddle point. For use of these conditions to solve for a maximum, the function z must also be differentiable throughout. The second partial derivative test can help classify the point as a relative maximum or relative minimum. In contrast, there are substantial differences between functions of one variable and functions of more than one variable in the identification of global extrema. For example, if a bounded differentiable function f defined on a closed interval in the real line has a single critical point, which is a local minimum, then it is also a global minimum (use the intermediate value theorem and Rolle's theorem to prove this by reductio ad absurdum). In two and more dimensions, this argument fails. This is illustrated by the function :f(x,y)= x^2+y^2(1-x)^3,\\\\qquad x,y\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}, whose only critical point is at (0,0), which is a local minimum with ∆í(0,0) = 0\\\\. However, it cannot be a global one, because ∆í(2,3) = ‚àí5. Maxima or minima of a functional If the domain of a function for which an extremum is to be found consists itself of functions (i.e. if an extremum is to be found of a functional), then the extremum is found using the calculus of variations. In relation to sets Maxima and minima can also be defined for sets. In general, if an ordered set S has a greatest element m, then m is a maximal element of the set, also denoted as \\\\max(S). Furthermore, if S is a subset of an ordered set T and m is the greatest element of S with (respect to order induced by T), then m is a least upper bound of S in T. Similar results hold for least element, minimal element and greatest lower bound. The maximum and minimum function for sets are used in databases, and can be computed rapidly, since the maximum (or minimum) of a set can be computed from the maxima of a partition; formally, they are self- decomposable aggregation functions. In the case of a general partial order, the least element (i.e., one that is smaller than all others) should not be confused with a minimal element (nothing is smaller). Likewise, a greatest element of a partially ordered set (poset) is an upper bound of the set which is contained within the set, whereas a maximal element m of a poset A is an element of A such that if m ‚â§ b (for any b in A), then m = b. Any least element or greatest element of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements. If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable. In a totally ordered set, or chain, all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one minimal element and at most one maximal element. Then, due to mutual comparability, the minimal element will also be the least element, and the maximal element will also be the greatest element. Thus in a totally ordered set, we can simply use the terms minimum and maximum. If a chain is finite, then it will always have a maximum and a minimum. If a chain is infinite, then it need not have a maximum or a minimum. For example, the set of natural numbers has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain S is bounded, then the closure Cl(S) of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in which case they are called the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of the set S, respectively.

Poli assumed the nom de plume \\"Saba\\" in 1910, and his name was officially changed to Umberto Saba in 1928. From 1919 he was the proprietor of an antiquarian bookshop in Trieste. He suffered from depression for all of his adult life. Life and career Saba's Christian father, 29-year-old Ugo Edoardo Poli, converted to Judaism in order to marry 37-year-old Felicita Rachele Cohen in July 1882. Felicita was one month pregnant with Umberto at the time of the wedding. Ugo abandoned his new wife and faith before Umberto was born and the child was raised first by a Slovene Catholic wet-nurse, Gioseffa Gabrovich Schobar (\\"Peppa\\"), and her husband, who had just lost a child, and from 1887 onwards by his mother, in her sister Regina's home, though Umberto maintained a close lifelong attachment to Peppa.Moleta, Vincent (2004) Umberto Saba ‚Äì Poetry and Prose. Bridgetown, Western Australia: √Üolian Press (p. 528) Saba as a child Saba was a keen reader who kept pet birds and studied the violin. (pp. xix, 528) In 1897 he transferred from the Gymnasium to a commercial college, the Imperial Academy of Commerce and Navigation, and then went to work in the office of a customs agent. In 1900 he began composing poetry, signing his work \\"Umberto Chopin Poli.\\" In January 1903 Saba travelled to Pisa to study archaeology, German and Latin, but began to complain of a nervous disorder and, in June, returned to Trieste. After a holiday in Slovenia, he spent some time later that year in Switzerland, writing a play. In July 1904, the socialist newspaper, Il Lavoratore, edited by his friend Amadeo Tedeschi, published Saba's account of a visit to Montenegro earlier in the year, and in May 1905, Il Lavoratore printed his first published poem. In 1905 he travelled to Florence with friends and ‚Äì upon meeting his father for the first time ‚Äì changed his nom de plume to \\"Umberto da Montereale,\\" after the town of his father's birth. That summer he met Carolina (Lina) W√∂lfler, and began corresponding with her the following December. Between 1907 and 1908 he completed an obligatory year of Italian military service in an infantry unit based in Salerno. He married Lina in a Jewish ceremony in 1909, and they had a daughter, Linuccia, the following year. (p. xix) In November 1910 his first collection of poems, Poesie, was published under the name Saba, and the name was legally recognised as his surname in 1928. (p. xix). This choice of name (which may be based on one of two Hebrew words ‚Äì \\"sova\\" (◊©◊ï◊ë◊¢) meaning \\"being well-fed\\" or \\"saba\\" (◊°◊ë◊ê) meaning \\"grandfather\\") is thought by some scholars to be an homage to his Jewish mother,Joseph Cary, Three Modern Italian Poets: Saba, Ungaretti, Montale (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992) p. 35. while others point to the similarity with his wet-nurse's surname, Schobar.Sartarelli, Stephen (1998) Songbook: Selected Poems from the Canzionere of Umberto Saba. Riverdale-on-Hudson: Sheep Meadow Press. p, xv In the spring of 1911, while Saba was away in Florence meeting people associated with the influential magazine La Voce, and initiating a collaboration with Mario Novaro, Lina had an affair with a painter. The couple separated, but were together again by May 1912 when the family moved to Bologna, where public readings of his poetry were poorly received and Saba was beset by depressed lows and creative highs. Destitute, in 1914 the family moved to Milan, where Saba found work first as a secretary, then as a nightclub manager. In early 1915 he began writing for Benito Mussolini's Il Popolo d'Italia newspaper, but in June was drafted into the army, where he saw no active service and was hospitalised due to depression. (pp. 544‚Äì5) In 1919, he returned to Trieste and purchased the Mail√§nder second-hand bookshop, which he renamed La Libreria Antica e Moderna. The business produced enough income to support the family, and Saba soon became enthusiastic about buying and selling rare old books and enjoyed the extensive travel involved. He self-published the first edition of his Songbook in 1921 (successive, enlarged editions followed, and eventually it grew to contain over four hundred poems, spanning fifty years). (p. 544‚Äì5) In 1929 he began psychoanalysis under the influential Trieste psychoanalyst Edoardo Weiss, a student of Freud. (p. xxi) Saba (left) receiving his honorary doctorate from the University of Rome in 1953 In 1939 Saba sought exemption from the newly proclaimed anti-Jewish laws, but was unwilling to be baptised into the Catholic faith, so the following year he sold the bookshop to his long-time assistant and friend, Carlo Cerne. Upon the announcement of the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in 1943, Saba fled Trieste with his family to Florence, where they moved to eleven different hiding places over the following 12 months, to avoid deportation; after which Lina returned to Trieste and Saba moved to Rome, where he oversaw the publication of Scorciatoie e raccontini. In 1946 Saba was awarded the Viareggio Prize and returned to Trieste where, in the following year, he sparked a vitriolic debate over the future of the city with his article If I were named governor of Trieste. After being prescribed injectable opium for his depression, from 1950 onwards Saba was frequently admitted to a Rome nursing home for treatment of addiction. At the age of 70, in 1953, the University of Rome bestowed upon him an honorary doctorate, and he received an award from the Lincean Academy. He died at the age of 74 in Gorizia, nine months after a heart attack, and a year after the death of his wife.

He won three USSR Chess Championships in the 1960s (1963, 1965, and 1966), and was among the world's top ten players during that era.  Early life  Leonid Stein was born in Kamenets-Podolsky. He was a Jewish Ukrainian who served in the Soviet Army. In both 1955 and 1956, he tied for first place in the individual Army Championship. He achieved the national Master title for chess at the relatively late age of 24, but, as his Army titles against strong competition attest, he was likely at that strength somewhat earlier. At 24, he competed for the first time in the USSR Chess Championship at Tbilisi, 1959. In the following year he won the Ukrainian Championship at Kiev, winning it again in 1962. He played board one for the Soviet team at the Helsinki 1961 Student Olympiad, scoring a strong +8, =3, ‚àí1, and helping his team to the overall gold medals.  Grandmaster and Soviet Champion  Stein tied for third place in the 1961 Soviet Championship, at Moscow, defeating Tigran Petrosian on the way. He won his first Soviet title at Leningrad 1963; he tied with Boris Spassky and Ratmir Kholmov in the tournament itself, then won the playoff. He won again at Tallinn, 1965, and repeated the next year, 1966, at Tbilisi. Two outstanding international tournament victories were attained at Moscow 1967 (commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1917 October Revolution), and Moscow 1971 (Alekhine Memorial, equal with Anatoly Karpov). Further international tournament victories were scored at Sarajevo (Bosna) 1967, equal with Borislav Ivkov, Hastings 1967‚Äì68, shared, Kecskem√©t 1968, Tallinn 1969, P√§rnu 1971, and Las Palmas 1973, equal with Tigran Petrosian. From 1963 to his premature death in 1973, Stein was in the top ten players in the world, or just outside that range.  World title challenge frustrations  Amsterdam Interzonal 1964 (from left to right) Leonid Stein, Mark Taimanov, Borislav Ivkov, Andor Lilienthal and Vasili Smyslov With his strong result at the 1961 Soviet Championship, he earned the right to play in the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal tournament. His play there was excellent, finishing in a tie for 6th‚Äì7th places, but he was denied the right to advance to the Candidates' Tournament, because of a FIDE rule then in force which limited the qualifiers from any one country to three (in this case USSR). He had finished behind fellow Soviets Efim Geller, Petrosian, and Viktor Korchnoi. A very similar occurrence was the story of the next Interzonal tournament, in Amsterdam 1964. Stein took fifth place, sufficient for qualification for any non-Soviet player, with an outstanding total of 16¬Ω / 23, but was blocked from advancement. He had finished behind fellow Soviets Mikhail Tal, Vasily Smyslov, and Boris Spassky, who, along with Danish GM Bent Larsen, had all scored 17 points. He did represent the USSR at the Tel Aviv Olympiad that year, scoring a fine 10/13, and winning an individual gold medal on the first reserve board. Again, he was in the Soviet side at the Havana Olympiad 1966, scoring 9/12, winning an individual silver medal on board four. Both times, the Soviet Union won the team gold medals. Again, in 1967, Stein qualified for the Sousse Interzonal, scored well, in a tie for 6th‚Äì8th places, but had to undergo a further playoff with Samuel Reshevsky and Vlastimil Hort, in Los Angeles, which was won by Reshevsky. He was in the Soviet side for the European team championships at Hamburg 1965 and Kapfenberg 1970, both of which were victorious. He served as an alternate on the Soviet team for the Match of the Century against the Rest of the World team, at Belgrade 1970. He played one game, losing to Larsen. Stein had already qualified for the 1973 Petropolis Interzonal, and was considered a potential favorite to win the entire Candidates' cycle. But, as he was preparing to leave with the Soviet side for the European team championship, set for Bath 1973, he collapsed of an apparent heart attack, and died in the Rossiya Hotel in Moscow. He was only 38 and still near the peak of his career.  Style and legacy  Stein's creative style was greatly influenced by Chigorin and Alekhine. He was a highly intuitive, natural player. He was considered to be a brilliant attacking genius, but nevertheless played very sound chess, being less willing than Tal to complicate with unforeseeable results. He excelled with Black in sharp openings such as the King's Indian Defence, the Gr√ºnfeld Defence, and the Sicilian Defence. He was one of few players who had an even score against Vasily Smyslov, Tigran Petrosian, and Mikhail Botvinnik. He had plus records against Mikhail Tal, Boris Spassky, and Paul Keres. Stein defeated many of the top players of his era.  Notable chess games  * Nikolay Krogius vs Leonid Stein, Ukrainian Championship, Kiev 1960, King's Indian Defence, Petrosian Variation (E92), 0-1 Stein was a terror in the King's Indian, and shows it here. * Leonid Stein vs Tigran Petrosian, USSR Championship, Moscow 1961, French Defence, Winawer Variation (C18), 1-0 Stein takes off the world champion-to-be in devastating fashion. * Leonid Stein vs Mikhail Tal, USSR Club Championship Team finals, Moscow 1961, Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation (B94), 1-0 Former world champion Tal has to concede defeat in an ultra-sharp game. * Leonid Stein vs Lajos Portisch, Stockholm Interzonal 1962, Sicilian Defence, Kan Variation (B42), 1-0 Stein unleashes a nasty knight sacrifice to tear open Black's king position. * Boris Spassky vs Leonid Stein, USSR Championship, Leningrad 1964, Grunfeld Defence (D86), 0-1 Another world champion-to-be meets his match in Leonid Stein. * Mikhail Botvinnik vs Leonid Stein, Moscow 1965, Ruy Lopez, Delayed Exchange Variation (C85), 0-1 Yet another former world champion may have wished he had stayed home. * Leonid Stein vs Pal Benko, Caracas 1970, Sicilian Defence, Lasker Variation (B33), 1-0 Black's opening play was daring and was refuted in precise fashion. * Leonid Stein vs Vasily Smyslov, Moscow 1972, English Opening (A17), 1‚Äì0 Smyslov, a master of quiet positional play, has few answers for Stein's tactics. * Ljubomir Ljubojevic vs Leonid Stein, Las Palmas 1973, Nimzo-Larsen Opening (A01), 0‚Äì1 Two skilled tacticians go toe-to-toe, and Stein comes out on top, after slipping in a surprise knight sacrifice in the opening.

He served as British Ambassador to Italy during the First World War. Early life Rodd was born in London on 9 November 1858. He was the only son of Cornishman Major James Rennell Rodd (1812‚Äì1892) of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, and his wife Elizabeth Anne Thomson, the third daughter of Dr. Anthony Todd Thomson. His paternal grandparents were Admiral Sir John Tremayne Rodd and the former Jane Rennell, a daughter of the geographer James Rennell. Rodd was educated at Haileybury and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was associated with the circle of Oscar Wilde. Wilde later assisted Rodd in securing publication for his first book of verse, Rose Leaf and Apple Leaf, for which Wilde provided an introduction. As Wilde began to court scandal in his public career, their friendship subsequently cooled.  Career  He entered the British Diplomatic Service in 1883, and served in minor positions at embassies in Berlin, Rome, Athens and Paris. From 1894 to 1902, Rodd worked under the Consul-General of Egypt, Lord Cromer. He played an important part in negotiating the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897 with Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. In late 1901, he was appointed first secretary at the embassy in Rome, where he arrived in 1902, and remained for the next two years. In 1904, Rodd was made minister plenipotentiary to Sweden‚Äîand until November 1905, Norway‚Äîbut did not arrive until 17 January 1905. He played an active and neutral part in the Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden, for which he was rewarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Polar Star by King Oscar II. After the secession, he continued as a minister in Sweden until 1908. In 1908 he was appointed ambassador to Italy. He remained in this post until 1919, and played a key role in securing Italy's adhesion to the Triple Entente. Rodd left the Diplomatic Service in 1919, but nonetheless served on the mission to Egypt in 1920, with The Viscount Milner. Rodd was the British delegate to the League of Nations from 1921 to 1923. He also sat as Unionist Member of Parliament for the constituency of St Marylebone between 1928 and 1932. =Writing career and scholar= Apart from his diplomatic services Rodd was also a published poet and scholar of ancient Greece and Rome. He published his memoirs, entitled Social and Diplomatic Memories, in three volumes between 1922 and 1925. His diaries were published in 1981 by Torsten Burgman, and edited by Victor Lal in 2005.Legg, L. G. Wickham, Williams, E. T (editors). The Dictionary of National Biography, 1941-1950.

He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1908 and in 1933 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Rennell, of Rodd in the County of Hereford. Personal life On 27 October 1894, Rennell Rodd was married to Lilias Georgina Guthrie (1864‚Äì1951) at St George's Hanover Square Church. She was the fourth daughter of James Alexander Guthrie, 4th Baron of Craigie and the former Elinor Stirling (a daughter of Adm. Sir James Stirling, Governor of Western Australia from 1834 to 1838). Lilias' sister, Rose Ellinor Guthrie, was the wife of Maj.-Gen. The Hon. Sir Cecil Edward Bingham (a younger son of Charles Bingham, 4th Earl of Lucan). They had four sons and two daughters, including: * Francis James Rennell Rodd, 2nd Baron Rennell (1895‚Äì1978), who married the Hon. Mary Constance Vivian Smith, daughter of Vivian Smith, 1st Baron Bicester. * Hon. Evelyn Violet Elizabeth Rodd (1899‚Äì1980), who was a Conservative politician and was created a life peer as Baroness Emmet of Amberley in 1965. * Hon. Gloria Rodd (1901‚Äì1975), who married the painter Simon Elwes * Hon. Peter Murray Rennell Rodd (1904‚Äì1968), who married the author Nancy Mitford, daughter of David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale and one of the famous Mitford sisters. * Hon. Gustaf Guthrie Rennell Rodd (b. 1905), who married Yvonne Mary Marling, the youngest daughter of diplomat Sir Charles Murray Marling. Lord Rennell died in July 1941, aged 82. He was succeeded in the barony by his second, but eldest surviving, son Francis, who later served as President of the Royal Geographical Society. His widow died on 20 September 1951. =Descendants= Though his daughter Gloria, he was a grandfather of four boys, including the portrait painter Dominick Elwes, who had three sons with Tessa Kennedy, including actor Cary Elwes.

On 19 September 1851, the local bishop formally approved the public devotion and prayers to Our Lady of La Salette. On 21 August 1879, Pope Leo XIII granted a canonical coronation to the image now located within the Basilica of Our Lady of La Salette. A Russian style tiara was granted to the image, instead of the solar-type tiara used in its traditional depictions of Our Lady during her apparitions. Places dedicated to Our Lady of La Salette outside of France include a sanctuary in Oliveira de Azem√©is, in Portugal; shrines in Enfield, New Hampshire, and Attleboro, Massachusetts in the United States, both known for their Christmas lights; and a chapel in San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, in M√©xico. History Basilica of Our Lady of La Salette. The Marian Shrine of Our Lady in the great mountain of La Salette. In 1846 the village of La Salette consisted of eight or nine scattered hamlets. The population was about 800, principally small farmers with their families and dependents. On the evening of Saturday, 19 September 1846, Maximin Giraud and M√©lanie Calvat (called Mathieu) returned from the mountain where they had been minding cows and reported seeing \\"a beautiful lady\\" on Mount Sous-Les Baisses, weeping bitterly. They described her as sitting with her elbows resting on her knees and her face buried in her hands. She was clothed in a white robe studded with pearls; and a gold colored apron; white shoes and roses about her feet and high headdress. Around her neck she wore a crucifix suspended from a small chain.Wyse, John.

After giving a secret to each child, the apparition walked up a hill and vanished. After five years of investigation, the Bishop of Grenoble, Philibert de Bruillard announced in 1851 that the apparition was likely to be a true revelation and authorised the commencement of the following of Our Lady of La Salette.\\"Notre-Dame de La Salette\\", Eymardian Places This determination was later confirmed by his successor, Bishop Ginoulhiac.Bunson, Matthew. \\"LaSalette\\", Catholic Almanac's Guide to the Church Our Sunday Visitor, 2001, Message According to the children's account, the Virgin invited people to respect the repose of the seventh day, and to respect the name of God. She sorrowfully threatened punishment, in particular a scarcity of potatoes, which would rot. The context of these punishments places the warning just prior to the winter of 1846‚Äì1847, which was in Europe, and especially in France and in Ireland, a period of famine in the months which followed the apparition. This was one of the factors of the apparition's popular appeal. The message of the visionaries of La Salette focuses on the conversion of all humanity to Christ. John Vianney, John Bosco, and writer Joris-Karl Huysmans were all influenced by La Salette. The spirit of La Salette is said to be one of prayer, conversion, and commitment. Fr. Ren√© J. Butler, M.S. of the La Salette Missionaries of North America says \\"The whole purpose of the Apparition of Our Lady of La Salette was reconciliation.\\" Pope John Paul II stated: \\"As I wrote on the occasion of the 150th anniversary, 'La Salette is a message of hope, for our hope is nourished by the intercession of her who is the Mother of mankind.\\" Inquiry Statue depicting Our Lady of La Salette crying in Corps, Is√®re, France. Sensation about Our Lady of La Salette arose when M√©lanie and Maximin made their message public, which caused the bishop of Grenoble to investigate the apparition. During the investigation, a number of accusations were made against the visionaries, including the assertion that the apparition was actually just a middle-aged woman named La Merli√®re. Secrets No mention of secrets is made in the children's first accounts, presumably out of fear they would be compelled to disclose them. The children later reported that the Blessed Virgin had confided a special secret to each of them. These two secrets, which neither M√©lanie nor Maximin ever made known to each other, were sent by them in 1851 to Pope Pius IX on the advice of Mgr. de Bruillard. It is assumed that these secrets were of a personal nature.

Cosmochemistry (from Greek Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÇ k√≥smos, \\"universe\\" and œáŒ∑ŒºŒµŒØŒ± kheme√≠a) or chemical cosmology is the study of the chemical composition of matter in the universe and the processes that led to those compositions. This is done primarily through the study of the chemical composition of meteorites and other physical samples. Given that the asteroid parent bodies of meteorites were some of the first solid material to condense from the early solar nebula, cosmochemists are generally, but not exclusively, concerned with the objects contained within the Solar System. History In 1938, Swiss mineralogist Victor Goldschmidt and his colleagues compiled a list of what they called \\"cosmic abundances\\" based on their analysis of several terrestrial and meteorite samples. Goldschmidt justified the inclusion of meteorite composition data into his table by claiming that terrestrial rocks were subjected to a significant amount of chemical change due to the inherent processes of the Earth and the atmosphere. This meant that studying terrestrial rocks exclusively would not yield an accurate overall picture of the chemical composition of the cosmos. Therefore, Goldschmidt concluded that extraterrestrial material must also be included to produce more accurate and robust data. This research is considered to be the foundation of modern cosmochemistry. During the 1950s and 1960s, cosmochemistry became more accepted as a science. Harold Urey, widely considered to be one of the fathers of cosmochemistry, engaged in research that eventually led to an understanding of the origin of the elements and the chemical abundance of stars. In 1956, Urey and his colleague, German scientist Hans Suess, published the first table of cosmic abundances to include isotopes based on meteorite analysis. The continued refinement of analytical instrumentation throughout the 1960s, especially that of mass spectrometry, allowed cosmochemists to perform detailed analyses of the isotopic abundances of elements within meteorites. in 1960, John Reynolds determined, through the analysis of short-lived nuclides within meteorites, that the elements of the Solar System were formed before the Solar System itself which began to establish a timeline of the processes of the early Solar System. Meteorites Meteorites are one of the most important tools that cosmochemists have for studying the chemical nature of the Solar System. Many meteorites come from material that is as old as the Solar System itself, and thus provide scientists with a record from the early solar nebula. Carbonaceous chondrites are especially primitive; that is they have retained many of their chemical properties since their formation 4.56 billion years ago, and are therefore a major focus of cosmochemical investigations. The most primitive meteorites also contain a small amount of material (< 0.1%) which is now recognized to be presolar grains that are older than the Solar System itself, and which are derived directly from the remnants of the individual supernovae that supplied the dust from which the Solar System formed. These grains are recognizable from their exotic chemistry which is alien to the Solar System (such as matrixes of graphite, diamond, or silicon carbide). They also often have isotope ratios which are not those of the rest of the Solar System (in particular, the Sun), and which differ from each other, indicating sources in a number of different explosive supernova events. Meteorites also may contain interstellar dust grains, which have collected from non-gaseous elements in the interstellar medium, as one type of composite cosmic dust (\\"stardust\\") Recent findings by NASA, based on studies of meteorites found on Earth, suggests DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Comets On 30 July 2015, scientists reported that upon the first touchdown of the Philae lander on comet 67/P surface, measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde. Research In 2004, scientists reported detecting the spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules had ever been found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond to each other in various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)‚Äîwhich may have been vital in the formation of early life on Earth‚Äîin a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae. In August 2009, NASA scientists identified one of the fundamental chemical building-blocks of life (the amino acid glycine) in a comet for the first time. In 2010, fullerenes (or \\"buckyballs\\") were detected in nebulae. Fullerenes have been implicated in the origin of life; according to astronomer Letizia Stanghellini, \\"It's possible that buckyballs from outer space provided seeds for life on Earth.\\" In August 2011, findings by NASA, based on studies of meteorites found on Earth, suggests DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules), building blocks for life as we know it, may be formed extraterrestrially in outer space. In October 2011, scientists reported that cosmic dust contains complex organic matter (\\"amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure\\") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. On August 29, 2012, astronomers at Copenhagen University reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, glycolaldehyde, in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, which is located 400 light years from Earth. Glycolaldehyde is needed to form ribonucleic acid, or RNA, which is similar in function to DNA. This finding suggests that complex organic molecules may form in stellar systems prior to the formation of planets, eventually arriving on young planets early in their formation. In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics‚Äî\\"a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively\\". Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons \\"for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.\\" In 2013, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA Project) confirmed that researchers have discovered an important pair of prebiotic molecules in the icy particles in interstellar space (ISM). The chemicals, found in a giant cloud of gas about 25,000 light-years from Earth in ISM, may be a precursor to a key component of DNA and the other may have a role in the formation of an important amino acid. Researchers found a molecule called cyanomethanimine, which produces adenine, one of the four nucleobases that form the \\"rungs\\" in the ladder-like structure of DNA. The other molecule, called ethanamine, is thought to play a role in forming alanine, one of the twenty amino acids in the genetic code. Previously, scientists thought such processes took place in the very tenuous gas between the stars. The new discoveries, however, suggest that the chemical formation sequences for these molecules occurred not in gas, but on the surfaces of ice grains in interstellar space. NASA ALMA scientist Anthony Remijan stated that finding these molecules in an interstellar gas cloud means that important building blocks for DNA and amino acids can 'seed' newly formed planets with the chemical precursors for life. In January 2014, NASA reported that current studies on the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective. In February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.

Paasikivi with Kliment Voroshilov. Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU Nikita Khrushchev, and President of Finland Urho Kekkonen meeting in Moscow in November 1960. The Paasikivi- Kekkonen doctrine was a foreign policy doctrine established by Finnish President Juho Kusti Paasikivi and continued by his successor Urho Kekkonen, aimed at Finland's survival as an independent sovereign, democratic, and capitalist country in the immediate proximity of the Soviet Union. The principal architect of Finland's postwar foreign policy of neutrality was Juho Kusti Paasikivi, who was president from 1946 to 1956. Urho Kekkonen, president from 1956 until 1982, further developed this policy, stressing that Finland should be an active rather than a passive neutral.  Background  Finland and the Soviet Union signed the Paris Peace Treaty in February 1947, which in addition to the concessions of the Moscow Peace Treaty provided for: * Limiting the size of Finland's defense forces, * Cession to the Soviet Union of the Petsamo area on the Arctic coast, * Lease of the Porkkala peninsula off Helsinki to the Soviets for use as a naval base for 50 years (it was returned ahead of schedule in 1956), * Free transit access to this area across Finnish territory, and * War reparations to the Soviet Union decided to 300 million gold dollars (amounting to an estimated 570 million U.S. dollars in 1952, the year the payments ended).  Realization  In April 1948, Finland signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union. Under this mutual assistance pact, Finland was obligated, with the aid of the Soviet Union, if necessary, to resist armed attacks by \\"Germany or its allies\\" (i.e., NATO) against Finland or against the Soviet Union through Finland. At the same time, the agreement recognized Finland's desire to remain outside great-power conflicts. This agreement was renewed for 20 years in 1955, in 1970, and again in 1983. This allowed Finland to retain independence in internal affairs, e.g. a multiparty parliamentary system, and not to join the Eastern Bloc. However, joining NATO or other overt alliance with the West was out of question and foreign policy was often limited.  Criticism  Contemporary Finns often criticized the Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctrine as tending towards a \\"liturgy\\" of good relations. Both countries were militarily prepared. However, international trade was active, in the framework of bilateral trade. Furthermore, the policy was heavily tied to the person of President Kekkonen, who consequently exploited his position as a \\"guarantor of Soviet relations\\" against political opponents. Outright censorship, official as well as unofficial, was employed for films and other works considered explicitly anti-Soviet, such as The Manchurian Candidate or The Gulag Archipelago, although political freedoms were not otherwise coercively limited. Later criticism has included the following points: * The Soviet Union did not consider Finland a neutral country, but \\"striving to be neutral\\". Although Kekkonen was largely successful in retaining sovereign power over affairs in Finland, Finland's position on international affairs, such as the invasion of Czechoslovakia, was often ambiguous or Soviet-friendly. The 1977 hijacking of a Soviet airliner further exemplifies this; the undue influence of the Soviet ambassador, who would storm a government meeting to make demands, shows that the Finnish government had trouble fending off Soviet interference.Tiilikainen, Heikki. Kylm√§n sodan kujanjuoksu. The Soviet Union had an unusually large diplomatic mission in Finland, and Kekkonen communicated with the Soviet Union through the KGB station chief rather than by regular diplomatic channels. The Soviets intervened in Finnish politics in various ways, e.g. through the Communist Party of Finland and Soviet-friendly contacts in other parties (e.g. Kekkonen's K-linja in the Centre Party). * The Soviet military kept a separate unit in readiness to invade Helsinki from Tallinn in the case of war.https://www.is.fi/ulkomaat/art-2000000831378.html The plans, which were fully up-to-date, were left behind in the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Estonia after Estonia regained independence in 1991. * The policy had little respect in the West. Western foreign policy actors and military personnel either did not know about the policy or assumed it was a failure from the outset. Regarding the former, British military officers were known to have queried how many Soviet troops were in Finland. Regarding the latter, nuclear weapons were trained on targets in Finland, with the assumption that any possible Finnish resistance to a Soviet invasion would be a certain failure. * There was covert cooperation between the Finnish government and Western intelligence agencies. The CIA could fund the anti- Communist Social Democratic Party, a major, often government-leading party, though it gradually became unusually pro-Soviet beginning in the late 1960s, with many radical leftists holding influential posts among other such parties. There was also military intelligence cooperation, for instance allowing SIGINT flights to probe the Soviet radar network (according to Pekka Visuri) and providing seismic data to detect Soviet nuclear tests.  Liquidation  The Finns responded cautiously in 1990‚Äì91 to the decline of Soviet power and the USSR's subsequent dissolution. They unilaterally abrogated restrictions imposed by the 1947 and 1948 treaties with the exception of a ban on acquiring nuclear weapons, joined in voicing Nordic concerns over the coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and gave increasing unofficial encouragement to Baltic independence. At the same time, by replacing the Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance pact with treaties on general cooperation and trade, Finns put themselves on an equal footing while retaining a friendly bilateral relationship. Finland now is boosting cross-border commercial ties and touting its potential as a commercial gateway to Russia. It has reassured Russia that it will not raise claims about the formerly Finnish territory ceded after the Continuation War (though a small but vocal minority of the people disagrees), and continues to reaffirm the importance of good bilateral relations.

The deeply indented shape of the ria reflects the dendritic pattern of drainage that existed before the rise in sea level that flooded the valley. A ria () is a coastal inlet formed by the partial submergence of an unglaciated river valley. It is a drowned river valley that remains open to the sea. Typically, rias have a dendritic, treelike outline although they can be straight and without significant branches. This pattern is inherited from the dendritic drainage pattern of the flooded river valley. The drowning of river valleys along a stretch of coast and formation of rias results in an extremely irregular and indented coastline. Often, there are naturally-occurring islands, which are summits of partly submerged, preexisting hill peaks. (Islands may also be artificial, such as those constructed for the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel.) A ria coast is a coastline having several parallel rias separated by prominent ridges, extending a distance inland.Goudie, A. (2004) Encyclopedia of Geomorphology. Routledge. London, England.Bird, E.C.F. (2008) Coastal Geomorphology: An Introduction, 2nd ed. John Wiley and Sons Ltd. West Sussex, England. The sea level change that caused the submergence of a river valley may be either eustatic (where global sea levels rise), or isostatic (where the local land sinks). The result is often a very large estuary at the mouth of a relatively insignificant river (or else sediments would quickly fill the ria). The Kingsbridge Estuary in Devon, England, is an extreme example of a ria forming an estuary disproportionate to the size of its river; no significant river flows into it at all, only a number of small streams. Etymology The word ria comes from Galician r√≠a, which is related to Spanish and Galician r√≠o and Portuguese rio (river). Rias are present all along the Galician coast in Spain. As originally defined, the term was restricted to drowned river valleys cut parallel to the structure of the country rock that was at right angles to the coastline. However, the definition of ria was later expanded to other flooded river valleys regardless of the structure of the country rock. For a period of time, European geomorphologists regarded rias to include any broad estuarine river mouth, including fjords. These are long, narrow inlets with steep sides or cliffs, created in a valley carved by glacial activity. In the 21st century, however, the preferred usage of ria by geologists and geomorphologists is to refer solely to drowned unglaciated river valleys. It therefore excludes fjords by definition, since fjords are products of glaciation.

It is one of the most widespread of the curlews, breeding across temperate Europe and Asia. In Europe, this species is often referred to just as the \\"curlew\\", and in Scotland known as the \\"whaup\\" in Scots. This is the largest wader in its range, at in length, with an wingspan and a body weight of . It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back, greyish- blue legs and a very long curved bill. Males and females look identical, but the bill is longest in the adult female. It is generally not possible to recognize the sex of a single Eurasian curlew, or even several ones, as there is much variation; telling male and female of a mated pair apart is usually possible however. The familiar call is a loud curloo-oo. The only similar species over most of the curlew's range is the Eurasian whimbrel (N. phaeopus). The whimbrel is smaller and has a shorter bill with a kink rather than a smooth curve. Flying curlews may also resemble bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica) in their winter plumages; however, the latter have a smaller body, a slightly upturned beak, and legs that do not reach far beyond their tail tips. The Eurasian curlew's feet are longer, forming a conspicuous \\"point\\". The curlew exists as a migratory species over most of its range, wintering in Africa, southern Europe and south Asia. Occasionally a vagrant individual reaches places far from its normal range, such as Nova Scotia and the Marianas. It is present all year in the milder climates of Ireland and the United Kingdom and its adjacent European coasts. Etymology The English name \\"curlew\\" is imitative of the Eurasian curlew's call, but may have been influenced by the Old French corliu, \\"messenger\\", from courir , \\"to run\\". It was first recorded in 1377 in Langland's Piers Plowman \\"Fissch to lyue in √æe flode..√ûe corlue by kynde of √æe eyre\\". The genus name Numenius is from Ancient Greek ŒΩŒøœÖŒºŒÆŒΩŒπŒøœÇ, noumƒìnios, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlew because it appears to be derived from neos, \\"new\\" and mene \\"moon\\", referring to the crescent-shaped bill. The species name arquata is the Medieval Latin name for this bird, derived from Latin arcuatus, \\"bow-shaped\\", and again referring to the shape of the bill. Subspecies There are three subspecies of the Eurasian curlew: * N. a. arquata, (Linnaeus, 1758): breeds in west, north & central Europe. * N. a. orientalis, Brehm, 1831: breeds in west & central Siberia through to Northeast China. * N. a. suschkini, Neumann, 1929: breeds from western Kazakhstan to southwestern Siberia. It is generally wary. Highly gregarious outside the breeding season, the Eurasian curlew feeds by probing soft mud for small invertebrates, but will also pick small crabs and earthworms off the surface if the opportunity arises.

Each curlew lays between 3 and 6 eggs in April or May and incubates them for about a month until they begin to hatch. It has been observed that curlews tend to nest close to common kestrel's nests, as they can offer protection from other predators, such as corvids, even though kestrels also predate curlew nests Norrdahl, K., Suhonen, J., Hemminki, O. et al. Oecologia (1995) 101: 105. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00328906. The curlew is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African- Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Formerly classified as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN, it was suspected to be rarer than generally assumed. Following the evaluation of its population size, the classification was found to be incorrect, and it was consequently promoted to Near Threatened status in 2008. Though it is a common bird, its numbers are noticeably declining, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland, which have about a quarter of the global population. In the twenty years up to 2016, the population is estimated to have declined by more than 50% in England and Scotland, more than 80% in Wales, and more than 90% in Ireland. At the end of 2015 it was placed on the United Kingdom's red list of most endangered bird species.

It was built from 1856 to 1860 for Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and his wife, Charlotte of Belgium, later Emperor Maximilian I and Empress Carlota of Mexico, based on a design by Carl Junker. The castle's grounds include an extensive cliff and seashore park of designed by the archduke. The grounds were completely re-landscaped to feature numerous tropical species of trees and plants. History =Miramare Castle= crown of Mexico. Miramare Castle and its park were built by order of Ferdinand Maximilian (1832‚Äì1867), of the House of Habsburg - younger brother of Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria. In 1850, at the age of eighteen, Maximilian came to Trieste with his brother Charles and, immediately afterwards, he set off on a short cruise toward the Near East. This journey confirmed his intention to sail and to get to know the world. In 1852 he was appointed an officer and in 1854 he became Commander in Chief of the Imperial Navy. He decided to move to Trieste and to have a home built facing the sea and surrounded by a park worthy of his name and rank. According to tradition, when the archduke was caught in a sudden storm in the Gulf, he took shelter in the little harbour of Grignano and he chose that bare rocky spur of limestone origin as the setting for his home. The whole complex, purchased for the first time at the beginning of March 1856, was called Miramar, after the name of Prince Ferdinand of Saxony‚Äôs residence in Pena, Portugal. Miramare Castle, ca. 1880 The gardens of Miramare Castle, ca. 1880 Designed in 1856 by Carl Junker, an Austrian architect, the architectural structure of Miramare was finished in 1860. The style reflects the artistic interests of the archduke, who was acquainted with the eclectic architectural styles of Austria, Germany and England. The craftsman Franz Hofmann and his son, Julius, were entrusted with the furnishing and decorations. Hofmann, who worked in the city of Trieste, was a skilful artisan who was willing to follow Maximilian‚Äôs suggestions. Both the artisan and his patron had a similar cultural formation and they were well acquainted with the eclectic tendencies of the time. The work, steadily supervised by Maximilian, was finished only after his departure in 1864 for Mexico; where after a brief reign as Emperor he was executed in June 1867. Maximilian intended to create an intimate atmosphere in the castle in the area reserved for his family ‚Äì an area which he wanted to be in contact with nature, reflecting both his own spirit and that of an epoch. Miramare Castle interior On the ground floor, destined for the use of Maximilian and his wife, Charlotte of Belgium, worthy of note are the bedroom and the archduke‚Äôs office, which reproduce the cabin and the stern wardroom respectively of the frigate Novara, the war-ship used by Maximilian when he was Commander of the Navy to circumnavigate the world between 1857 and 1859; the library, whose walls are lined with bookshelves and the rooms of the Archduchess with their tapestry of light-blue silk. All the rooms still feature the original furnishings, ornaments, furniture and objects dating back to the middle of the 19th century. Many coats of arms of the Second Mexican Empire decorate the castle, as well as stone ornamentations on the exterior depicting the Aztec eagle. The first floor includes guest reception areas and the Throne Room. Of note are the magnificent panelling on the ceiling and walls and the Chinese and Japanese drawing-rooms with their oriental furnishings. Of particular interest is the room decorated with paintings by Cesare Dell‚ÄôAcqua, portraying events in the life of Maximilian and the history of Miramare. Currently, the rooms in the castle are mostly arranged according to the original layout decided upon by the royal couple. A valuable photographic reportage commissioned by the archduke himself made accurate reconstruction possible. =Castelletto= Castello Miramare interior. Elevations of the castle annex (\\"Castelletto\\") taken from Junker‚Äôs plans After having been commissioned as an officer in the Imperial navy in 1852, Maximilian decided to move to Trieste where he stayed for increasingly longer and more frequent periods. He rented a villa on the slopes of the hill of San Vito from Niccol√≤ Marco Lazarovich with a clause in the contract that allowed him to make all the modifications he considered necessary. Subsequently, during the completion of Miramare Castle, the archduke had a small castle called the Gartenhaus or Castelletto built which reproduced on a smaller scale the fa√ßade of the main castle and which he lived in off and on until Christmas 1860. The Castelletto, situated in a panoramic area, faces Grignano on one side and on the other a parterre surrounded by trees and on a clearing in front of greenhouses at the centre of which there is a fountain. Modelled on eclectic forms on a square base with a terrace facing the castle, the tower and the arbour entrance, the Castelletto has a small number of simply furnished rooms. On the ground floor there is a decoration on plaster painted to resemble wood. On the first floor, on the other hand there is a decoration very similar to the one in Villa Lazarovich which can be connected to Maximilian‚Äôs decision to transfer to the Castelletto his own part of the ornaments of the Villa which was his first residence in Trieste. In fact, the rooms in Turkish and German styles and the room decorated with panels of female figures present strong parallels between the two buildings and highlight the artistic tendencies of the time: numerous decorations, walls covered in paintings, many ornaments, heavy curtains and rooms crowded with furniture. The Castelletto is linked to the history of Maximilian and Charlotte. It was here that Charlotte stayed from the end of 1866 to the summer of 1867, between her return from Mexico and journeying to Belgium. It also housed part of the furnishings of Miramare Castle during the period when the Duke of Aosta stayed there. =Miramare Park= Panorama of Miramare castle Miramare Park, which at one time had no vegetation, and has now a surface area of , stands on a rocky promontory overlooking the Adriatic Sea. The site was planned and arranged by Carl Junker, according to the wishes of Archduke Maximilian who carefully followed the building of his residence. As far as the botanical aspect was concerned, a gardener, Josef Laube, was called in but was replaced in 1859 by Anton Jelinek, a Bohemian who had taken part in the frigate Novara's expedition around the world. The park, on which work began in 1856, represents a classic example of a mixed, artificial implantation of ligneous forest-trees and bushes and it succeeds in blending the charm of a typically Northern environment and a Mediterranean context. In contrast to the baroque garden, the English one ‚Äì on which Miramare is modelled ‚Äì introduces a new relationship with nature, resulting from a different sensibility towards the material world. This is why, when strolling along the paths in the park, you can breathe in an atmosphere that is tightly bound up with the life of its owner and his romantic relationship with nature, which was typical of his epoch. Close-up of the parterre in the French formal garden. Miramare Castle Grounds, Trieste, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. Before 1856, the park area was bare, with only some shrubs and thorny bushes. Today, on the other hand, there is a group of different species of trees that are, for the most part, of non-European origin or in any case, that are not native to the area. Within a period of ten years, cedars of Lebanon, North Africa and the Himalayas were planted, along with firs and spruces from Spain, cypresses from California and Mexico, various species of pine from Asia and America, to which some exotic specimens, such as the giant sequoia and the ginkgo biloba, were added. Miramare was conceived as a private garden and not as a park. In fact it does not have a monumental entrance or a driveway up to the castle. It was a garden of wonders, not intended for public use, even though the archduke opened it to the public a few days per week. Watercourses, pools, twisting paths, trees placed according to natural models, some grassy areas, are typical of English gardens. The roughness of the ground favoured the irregular lay-out of the promontory, combining the artificial transformation with the natural environment. The park is also characterised by the presence of some buildings included in Junker‚Äôs project: the Castelletto ‚Äì inhabited off and on by Maximilian and Charlotte ‚Äì on which work began at the same time as work on the castle; the greenhouses, intended for the growing of the plants to be placed in the park; the ruins of the chapel dedicated to Saint Canciano, in whose apse is preserved a cross made from the wood of the frigate Novara, which was laid up in 1899; and lastly a little house, used nowadays as a coffee-shop, the \\"Swiss house\\", placed at the edge of the swans‚Äô lake. Until 1954, Miramare was used as the headquarters for German, New Zealand, British and American forces of occupation respectively. Finally in 1955, the complex was reopened to the public under the name Miramare Park, whose management was entrusted to the Sopraintendenza per i Beni Architettonici ed il Paesaggio e per il Patrimonio Storico, Artistico ed Etnoantropologico of the Friuli- Venezia Giulia region. Today the gardens play host during the summer season to spectacles such as the musical \\"Sissi\\", reliving the story of the Empire in its natural setting, and various concerts. =Miramare Castle‚Äôs stables= Miramar castle near Trieste, Italy. Maximilian commissioned the plan for Miramare Castle‚Äôs stables, the design of which was undertaken between 1856 and 1860 by the architect Carl Junker. He had already planned all the works to be done in the area of Miramare: the castle, the park and all its access paths, the Castelletto, the Porticciolo ('little port'), the conservatories, the Swiss house and the pavilion at the back of the parterre. Junker‚Äôs sketches set out the planning of the stable‚Äôs building, both in its totality and in each part devoted to a specific use. The building is made up of three parts surrounding a central yard opened to the sea. It is located on the road leading to Trieste, in a sheltered, healthy place at a distance from the castle. It is square. The central section was intended for horses: Junker‚Äôs sketches including the location of the animal stalls, lining the bottom perimeter. The two wings, perfectly symmetrical, are sub-divided into three parts: near the stables box-rooms for harness; then accommodations for the staff and, finally, the kitchens, near the sea. The great pavilion at the back was reserved for coaches. Its access on the west side is made up of two main doors (one probably the entrance, the other the exit). Between the two World Wars, when the castle was inhabited by the Dukes of Aosta, changes were made to the stables. =Miramare after 1867= Castle Maximilian's bed, a wedding gift from Pope Pius IX, was never slept in. Main entrance After the death of Maximilian I in Mexico in June 1867 and Charlotte‚Äôs departure for Belgium, the castle and the park continued to be a place where the Habsburgs spent short periods. Already in September 1882 the Emperor Franz Joseph with Elisabeth of Austria and the heir to the throne Rudolf with his consort St√©phanie of Belgium, stayed in Miramare during an official visit to Trieste and gave receptions for the notables of the city. In August 1885 the Archduchess St√©phanie stayed there for a few days. Between 1869 and 1896, the Empress Elisabeth is recorded as having stayed there on at least fourteen occasions. On March 22, 1900, St√©phanie of Belgium ‚Äì Charlotte‚Äôs niece and Rudolf‚Äôs widow ‚Äì chose the chapel of the castle for her second marriage to the Hungarian noble Elem√©r de L√≥nyay. From March 9 to April 11, 1914, the heir to the throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand lived in the castle with his wife and sons and gave hospitality to the German Emperor William; two months later the archduke was assassinated at Sarajevo. Worthy of note is also the visit of the last Emperor Charles and his wife Zita. During the First World War all the furniture and works of art belonging to the castle were moved to Vienna and stored in the Sch√∂nbrunn and Belvedere Palaces and in the court libraries. At the end of the war the whole territory of Miramare passed under the direct control of the Italian government. Between October 1925 and March 1926, by mutual consent of the two governments, Austria returned all the furnishings in order to make possible the reconstruction of the castle‚Äôs original interior. The restoration of the furnishings and rooms, under the direction of the Royal Superintendence, meant that the museum could be opened to the public on March 24, 1929. Two years later the government assigned Miramare to Duke Amedeo of Aosta, captain of the first air division stationed in Gorizia, who lived there continuously till 1937 when he was appointed viceroy of Ethiopia. The castle was also inhabited off and on by the Duke‚Äôs family until the middle of 1943. Castello Miramare interior. Nonetheless, the visitors were allowed access to the upper part of the park and, from 1931, to the Castelletto, furnished with Archduke Maximilian‚Äôs fittings which had not formed part of the Duke of Aosta‚Äôs furnishings. Afterwards the castle was used as a school for officers by the German troops who occupied the city. As a result of the opposition of the Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer to the conversion of the castle into a Nazi headquarters the building was saved from the possible danger of bombardment. In the meantime, the furnishings had been removed and were kept in various buildings in the city. At the end of 1945, the New Zealand troops under the command of the General Freyberg entered Trieste and settled in the castle, making many changes to the interior. The British troops followed, and set up the headquarters of XIII Corps in Miramare. Finally the Americans came and the castle served as headquarters for the American garrison Trieste United States Troops (TRUST) from 1947 to October 3, 1954. The Superintendence immediately began the work of restoration of the interior of the castle and the Castelletto and the layout of the park. On the basis of drawings and period photographs, wood decorations were restored in the rooms and furniture, furnishings, pictures and tapestries were rearranged. Finally, in March 1955, the park was reopened free of charge to the public and from June 2 of the same year, Maximilian‚Äôs residence was named the Historical Museum of Miramare Castle and entrusted to the Sopraintendenza per i Beni Architettonici ed il Paesaggio e per il Patrimonio Storico, Artistico ed Etnoantropologico of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. Over the years it has become an attraction for thousands of tourists interested in experiencing full immersion in one of the very few examples of European historical residences which have preserved almost entirely their original furnishings and which, still today, transmit the charm of living around the middle of the Nineteenth century. Museum Miramare Castelletto Visitors to the castle will be able to see the following: Maximilian's chambers and those of his consort, Charlotte; the guest rooms; the information room telling the history of the castle and the park's construction; the Duke Amedeo of Aosta's apartment with furnishings from the 1930s in the Rationalist style. All the rooms still feature the original furnishings, ornaments, furniture and objects dating back to the middle of the 19th century. Particularly noteworthy are the music room where Charlotte used to play the fortepiano, now on show in room VII. In room XIX there are a series of paintings by Cesare dell'Acqua depicting the history of Miramare. Lastly, visitors may visit the throne room, which was recently restored to its former splendour.

It is one of the most widespread of the curlews, breeding across much of subarctic Asia and Europe as far south as Scotland. This species and the Hudsonian whimbrel have recently been split, although some taxonomic authorities still consider them to be conspecific. The Eurasian whimbrel is a migratory bird wintering on coasts in Africa, and South Asia into Australasia. It is also a coastal bird during migration. It is fairly gregarious outside the breeding season.  Description  This is a fairly large wader though mid-sized as a member of the curlew genus. The English name is imitative of the bird's call. The genus name Numenius is from Ancient Greek noumenios, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlews because it appears to be derived from neos, \\"new\\" and mene \\"moon\\", referring to the crescent-shaped bill. The species name phaeopus is the Medieval Latin name for the bird, from Ancient Greek phaios, \\"dusky\\" and pous, \\"foot\\". It is in length, in wingspan, and in weight. It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back and rump (subspecies N. p. phaeopus and N. p. alboaxillaris only), and a long curved bill (longest in the adult female) with a kink rather than a smooth curve. It is generally wary. The usual call is a rippling whistle, prolonged into a trill for the song. The only similar common species over most of this bird's range are larger curlews. The whimbrel is smaller, has a shorter, decurved bill and has a central crown stripe and strong supercilia. = Subspecies = There are 5 subspecies: * N. p. islandicus ‚Äì Brehm, C.L., 1831: breeds mainly in Iceland, but also in Greenland, Faroe Islands and Scotland; winters mainly in West Africa, but ranges from southwestern Europe to Benin and Togo * N. p. phaeopus ‚Äì (Linnaeus, 1758): nominate, found from Norway to north central Siberia * N. p. alboaxillaris ‚Äì Lowe, 1921: found from western Kazakhstan to southwestern Siberia (rare, endangered) * N. p. rogachevae ‚Äì Tomkovich, 2008: found in central Siberia * N. p. variegatus ‚Äì (Scopoli, 1786): found in northeastern Siberia  Ecology  This species feeds by probing soft mud for small invertebrates and by picking small crabs and similar prey off the surface. Before migration, berries become an important part of their diet. It has also been observed taking insects, specifically blue tiger butterflies. The nest is a bare scrape on tundra or Arctic moorland. Three to five eggs are laid. Adults are very defensive of nesting area and will even attack humans who come too close. Near the end of the 19th century, hunting on their migration routes took a heavy toll on this bird's numbers; the population has since recovered. In the Ireland and Britain, it breeds in Scotland, particularly around Shetland, Orkney, the Outer Hebrides as well as the mainland at Sutherland and Caithness. The whimbrel is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

The design of the kite balloon, having a shape and cable bridling which stabilise the balloon and reduce drag, meant that it could be operated with more wind than a circular balloon could. Some examples carried small explosive charges that would be pulled up against the aircraft to ensure its destruction. Barrage balloons are not practical against very high altitude flying aircraft, due to the weight of the long cable required. First World War France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom used barrage balloons in the First World War. Sometimes, especially around London, several balloons were used to lift a length of \\"barrage net\\", in which a steel cable was strung between the balloons and many more cables hung from it. These nets could be raised to an altitude comparable to the operational ceiling (15,000 ft / 4,500 m) of the bombers of that time period. By 1918 the barrage balloon defences around London stretched for , and captured German pilots expressed great fear of them.Ege, L. \\"Balloons and Airships\\", Blandford (1973). Second World War Battle of Normandy. Note the barrage balloons, raised by the African American 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion. Balloons could be launched from specialised vehicles. In 1938 the British Balloon Command was established to protect cities and key targets such as industrial areas, ports and harbours. Balloons were intended to defend against dive bombers flying at heights up to 5,000 feet (1,500 m), forcing them to fly higher and into the range of concentrated anti-aircraft fire: anti-aircraft guns could not traverse fast enough to attack aircraft flying at low altitude and high speed. By the middle of 1940 there were 1,400 balloons, a third of them over the London area. While dive-bombing was a devastatingly effective tactic against undefended targets, such as Guernica and Rotterdam, dive- bombers were very vulnerable to attack by fighter aircraft while performing a dive, and their use in this role by Germany against the UK with its effective Royal Air Force was rapidly discontinued. Balloons proved to be of little use against the German high-level bombers with which the dive-bombers were replaced, but continued to be manufactured nonetheless, until there were almost 3,000 in 1944. They proved to be mildly effective against the V-1 flying bomb, which usually flew at 2,000 feet (600 m) or lower but had wire- cutters on its wings to counter balloons. Two hundred thirty-one V-1s are officially claimed to have been destroyed by balloons. The British added two refinements to their balloons, \\"Double Parachute Link\\" (DPL) and \\"Double Parachute/Ripping\\" (DP/R). The former was triggered by the shock of an enemy bomber snagging the cable, causing that section of cable to be explosively released complete with parachutes at either end; the combined weight and drag bringing down the aircraft. The latter was intended to render the balloon safe if it broke free accidentally. The heavy mooring cable would separate at the balloon and fall to the ground under a parachute; at the same time a panel would be ripped away from the balloon causing it to deflate and fall independently to the ground. RAF Museum online exhibition \\"Air Diagrams\\" In January 1945, during Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm raids on the Palembang oil refineries, the British aircrews were surprised by massive use of barrage balloons in the Japanese defences. These were spherical and smaller than the British type. One Grumman Avenger was destroyed, and its crew killed, from striking a balloon cable.Iredale, W. The Kamikaze Hunters 2015 pp189-208 =Power line disruption= In 1942 Canadian and American forces began joint operations to protect the sensitive locks and shipping channel at Sault Ste. Marie along their common border among the Great Lakes against possible air attack.\\"Protecting Steel Lifeline / Barrage balloon goes aloft at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to protect Soo canal against possible air raids...\\" [photo caption], The Lima News [Lima, OH], 9 Apr. 1942, p. 3. During severe storms in August and October 1942 some barrage balloons broke loose, and the trailing cables short-circuited power lines, causing some localised disruption to mining and manufacturing. In particular, metals production was disrupted. Canadian military historical records indicate that one of the more serious incidents, known as \\"The October Incident\\", caused an estimated loss of 400 tons of steel and 10 tons of ferro-alloys. The winter weather also, apparently, played a part. As a result, balloons were stored during the winter months and training was improved. Lessons learned from breakaway balloons led to Operation Outward, the intentional release of balloons trailing conductive cables to disrupt power supplies on the occupied European mainland. Post-war nuclear weapon tests After the war, some surplus barrage balloons were used as tethered shot balloons for nuclear weapon tests throughout most of the period when nuclear weapons were tested in the atmosphere. The weapon or shot was carried to the required altitude slung underneath the barrage balloon, allowing test shots in controlled conditions at much higher altitudes than test towers. Several of the tests in the Operation Plumbbob series were lifted to altitude using barrage balloons.

He graduated from St. Mary's College in Bardstown in 1844, then studied law at Transylvania University in Lexington. He served during the Mexican War, rising to the rank of first lieutenant in the 1st Kentucky Mounted Rifles. He was captured by the Mexicans and remained a prisoner of war until near the end of that conflict. In 1848, he moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, married the daughter of United States Senator Ambrose H. Sevier, and became a planter. Appointed by President James Buchanan, he served as postmaster from September 1857 to March 1861. American Civil War At the start of the Civil War, Churchill offered his services to the state and was elected colonel of the 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles. His first combat took place at the Battle of Wilson's Creek near Springfield, Missouri. On March 4, 1862, he was promoted to brigadier-general and soon thereafter took part in Maj. Gen. Kirby Smith's Kentucky Campaign. Churchill played an important role in the victory at Richmond, Kentucky, commanding a division of men from Texas and Arkansas. Leading his division along a ravine that became known as \\"Churchill's Draw\\" he delivered a successful and surprising flanking attack. On February 17, 1864, Churchill was cited as one of three officers to receive special recognition in a Thanks of Confederate Congress resolution for his actions at Richmond. In the latter part of 1862, Churchill was transferred back to Arkansas and placed in charge of the fortifications at Arkansas Post. In January 1863, the Post was attacked and seized in the Battle of Fort Hindman by an overwhelming Union force under Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand. After his exchange Churchill continued his service in the Trans-Mississippi Department and commanded a division during the Red River Campaign. He played a major role in the Battle of Jenkins Ferry and was promoted to major-general on March 17, 1865. Later life Churchill was elected Treasurer of Arkansas in 1873. He was subsequently re-elected in 1875, 1877, and 1879. During the Brooks‚ÄìBaxter War of 1874, Churchill supported Elisha Baxter and helped enroll volunteers in Baxter's militia. Elected governor of Arkansas in 1880, Churchill served until 1883. While governor, he was plagued by allegations of discrepancies in the treasurer's account from when he served as state treasurer. A special committee found a shortage in the state funds, and a lawsuit was brought against him. He was ordered to repay the missing funds. Churchill died in Little Rock and was buried in historic Mount Holly Cemetery with military honors.

A small, dark rain cloud perpetually hovers over his head to symbolize his bad luck. The hapless Btfsplk and his ever-present cloud became one of the most iconic images in Li'l Abner. Background One storyline in the early 1970s features him trapping his cloud in a special anti-pollutant jar. Joe becomes romantically involved with a gal for the first time‚Äîuntil her crazed ex- boyfriend shows up to kill him. Joe reluctantly opens the jar and releases his cloud in order to take care of the boyfriend, and wistfully realizes that he wasn't meant for any other kind of life. As he returns to his normal, loner existence, his cloud once again in tow, he is for the moment satisfied to be who he really is. In addition to the obvious comic effect, Capp often used Joe Btfsplk as a deus ex machina to produce miraculous rescues or to effect plot twists. Joe was later licensed for use in a series of animated TV commercials for Head & Shoulders, a dandruff shampoo. Etymology According to Al Capp, btfsplk is a rude sound. During public lectures, Capp demonstrated this sound by closing his lips, leaving his tongue sticking out, and then blowing out air, which is colloquially called a \\"raspberry\\" or Bronx cheer.

Natural asphalt (also called asphaltum, bitumen, pitch, or tar‚Äîbrea in Spanish) has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of years. The tar is often covered with dust, leaves, or water. Over many centuries, the tar preserved the bones of trapped animals. The George C. Page Museum is dedicated to researching the tar pits and displaying specimens from the animals that died there. La Brea Tar Pits is a registered National Natural Landmark. Formation Tar pits are composed of heavy oil fractions called gilsonite, which seeps from the Earth as oil. In Hancock Park, crude oil seeps up along the 6th Street Fault from the Salt Lake Oil Field, which underlies much of the Fairfax District north of the park. The oil reaches the surface and forms pools, becoming asphalt as the lighter fractions of the petroleum biodegrade or evaporate. The asphalt then normally hardens into stubby mounds. The pools and mounds can be seen in several areas of the park. La Brea Tar Pits display of mammoths trapped in tar The tar pits visible now were all created by human excavations: the lake pit was originally an asphalt mine; and the other visible pits were produced as a result of explorers excavating more than 100 sites between 1913 and 1915 in search of large mammal bones. (Since then, these excavations have gradually been filled in by an accumulation of asphaltum, dust, leaves, and water, but the tar pits they produced remain.) This seepage has been happening for tens of thousands of years, during which the asphalt sometimes formed a deposit thick enough to trap animals. The deposit would become covered over with water, dust, or leaves. Animals would wander in, become trapped, and die. Predators would enter to eat the trapped animals and would also become stuck. As the bones of a dead animal sink, the asphalt soaks into them, turning them dark-brown or black in color. Lighter fractions of petroleum evaporate from the asphalt, leaving a more solid substance, which then encases the bones. Dramatic fossils of large mammals have been extricated from the tar, but the asphalt also preserves microfossils: wood and plant remnants, rodent bones, insects, mollusks, dust, seeds, leaves, and even pollen grains. Examples of some of these are on display in the George C. Page Museum. Radiometric dating of preserved wood and bones has given an age of 38,000 years for the oldest known material from the La Brea seeps. The pits still ensnare organisms today, so most of the pits are fenced to protect humans and animals. History The Tar Pits in 1910. Oil derricks can be seen in the background. The Native American Chumash and Tongva people living in the area built boats unlike any others in North America prior to contact by settlers. Pulling fallen Northern California redwood trunks and pieces of driftwood from the Santa Barbara Channel, their ancestors learned to seal the cracks between the boards of the large wooden plank canoes by using the natural resource of tar. This innovative form of transportation allowed access up and down the coastline and to the Channel Islands. The Portol√° expedition, a group of Spanish explorers led by Gaspar de Portol√°, made the first written record of the tar pits in 1769. Father Juan Cresp√≠ wrote, > While crossing the basin, the scouts reported having seen some geysers of > tar issuing from the ground like springs; it boils up molten, and the water > runs to one side and the tar to the other. The scouts reported that they had > come across many of these springs and had seen large swamps of them, enough, > they said, to caulk many vessels. We were not so lucky ourselves as to see > these tar geysers, much though we wished it; as it was some distance out of > the way we were to take, the Governor [Portol√°] did not want us to go past > them. We christened them Los Volcanes de Brea [the Tar Volcanoes].. Harrison Rogers, who accompanied Jedediah Smith on his 1826 expedition to California, was shown a piece of the solidified asphalt while at Mission San Gabriel, and noted in his journal, \\"The Citizens of the Country make great use of it to pitch the roofs of their houses\\".Smith, J. S., & Brooks, G. R. (1977). The Southwest expedition of Jedediah S. Smith: His personal account of the journey to California, 1826‚Äì1827. Glendale, Calif: A. H. Clark, p. 239. The La Brea Tar Pits and Hancock Park are situated within what was once the Mexican land grant of Rancho La Brea, now part of urban Los Angeles in the Miracle Mile district. For some years, tar-covered bones were found on the Rancho La Brea property, but were not initially recognized as fossils because the ranch had lost various animals‚Äìincluding horses, cattle, dogs, and even camels‚Äìwhose bones closely resemble several of the fossil species. The original Rancho La Brea land grant stipulated that the tar pits be open to the public for the use of the local Pueblo. Initially, they mistook the bones in the pits for the remains of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) or cattle that had become mired. Union Oil geologist W. W. Orcutt is credited, in 1901, with first recognizing that fossilized prehistoric animal bones were preserved in pools of asphalt on the Hancock Ranch. In commemoration of Orcutt's initial discovery, paleontologists named the La Brea coyote (Canis latrans orcutti) in his honor. Scientific resource Columbian mammoth skeleton from the tar pits, displayed in the George C. Page Museum Contemporary excavations of the bones started in 1913‚Äì1915. In the 1940s and 1950s, public excitement was generated by the preparation of previously recovered large mammal bones. A subsequent study demonstrated the fossil vertebrate material was well preserved, with little evidence of bacterial degradation of bone protein. They are believed to be some 10‚Äì20,000 years old, dating from the last glacial period. =Bacteria= Methane gas escapes from the tar pits, causing bubbles that make the asphalt appear to boil. Asphalt and methane appear under surrounding buildings and require special operations for removal to prevent the weakening of building foundations. In 2007, researchers from UC Riverside discovered that the bubbles were caused by hardy forms of bacteria embedded in the natural asphalt. After consuming petroleum, the bacteria release methane. Around 200 to 300 species of bacteria were newly discovered here.Jia-Rui Chong, \\"Researchers learn why tar pits are bubbly\\", Los Angeles Times, May 14, 2007. =George C. Page Museum= The La Brea Tar Pits Museum in Hancock Park The George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries, part of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, was built next to the tar pits in Hancock Park on Wilshire Boulevard. Construction began in 1975, and the museum opened to the public in 1977. However, the history of the fossil museum began in 1913, when George Allan Hancock, the owner of Rancho La Brea, granted the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County exclusive excavation rights at the Tar Pits for two years. In those two years, the museum was able to extract 750,000 specimens at 96 sites, guaranteeing that a large collection of fossils would remain consolidated and available to the community. Then in 1924, Hancock donated 23 acres to LA County with the stipulation that the county provide for the preservation of the park and the exhibition of fossils found there. The museum tells the story of the tar pits and presents specimens excavated from them. Visitors can walk around the park and see the tar pits. On the grounds of the park are life-sized models of prehistoric animals in or near the tar pits. Of more than 100 pits, only Pit 91 is still regularly excavated by researchers and can be seen at the Pit 91 viewing station. In addition to Pit 91, the one other ongoing excavation is called \\"Project 23\\". Paleontologists supervise and direct the work of volunteers at both sites. Excavation of \\"Project 23\\" and newly uncovered pits VOA report about the new discoveries in the pits On February 18, 2009, George C. Page Museum formally announced the 2006 discovery of 16 fossil deposits that had been removed from the ground during the construction of an underground parking garage for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art next to the tar pits. Among the finds are remains of a saber-toothed cat, dire wolves, bison, horses, a giant ground sloth, turtles, snails, clams, millipedes, fish, gophers, and an American lion. Also discovered is a nearly intact mammoth skeleton, nicknamed Zed; the only pieces missing are a rear leg, a vertebra, and the top of its skull, which was sheared off by construction equipment in preparation to build the parking structure. These fossils were packaged in boxes at the construction site and moved to a compound behind Pit 91, on Page Museum property, so that construction could continue. Twenty-three large accumulations of tar and specimens were taken to the Page Museum. These deposits are worked on under the name \\"Project 23\\". As work for the public transit D Line is extended, museum researchers know more tar pits will be uncovered, for example near the intersection of Wilshire and Curson. In an exploratory subway dig in 2014 on the Miracle Mile, prehistoric objects unearthed included geoducks, sand dollars, and a 10-foot limb from a pine tree, of a type now found in Central California's woodlands. Flora and fauna La Brea Tar Pits fauna as depicted by Charles R. Knight Among the prehistoric species associated with the La Brea Tar Pits are Pleistocene mammoths, dire wolves, short-faced bears, American lions, ground sloths, and, the state fossil of California, the saber-toothed cat (Smilodon fatalis). The park is known for producing myriad mammal fossils dating from the last glacial period. While mammal fossils generate significant interest, other fossils, including fossilized insects and plants, and even pollen grains, are also valued. These fossils help define a picture of what is thought to have been a cooler, moister climate in the Los Angeles basin during the glacial age. Among these fossils are microfossils, which are retrieved from a matrix of asphalt and sandy clay by washing with a solvent to remove the petroleum, then picking through the remains under a high-powered lens. Tar and wild flower run within La Brea campus Tar pits around the world are unusual in accumulating more predators than prey. The reason for this is unknown, but one theory is that a large prey animal would die or become stuck in a tar pit, attracting predators across long distances. This predator trap would catch predators along with their prey. Another theory is that dire wolves and their prey may have been trapped during a hunt. Since modern wolves hunt in packs, each prey animal could take several wolves with it. The same may be true of saber-toothed cats known from the area. Human presence Only one human has been found, a partial skeleton of the La Brea Woman (1914) Preliminary report on the discovery of human remains in an asphalt deposit at Rancho La Brea, Science 40: 197‚Äì203 dated to around 10,000 calendar years (about 9,000 radiocarbon years) BP, (2009) Compilation, calibration, and synthesis of faunal and floral radiocarbon dates, Rancho La Brea, California, Contributions in Science 518: 1‚Äì16 who was 17 to 25 years old at death (1989) A note on the ontogenetic age of the Rancho La Brea hominid, Los Angeles, California, Bulletin, Southern California Academy of Sciences 88(3): 123‚Äì26 and found associated with remains of a domestic dog, so was interpreted to have been ceremonially interred. (1985) Domestic dog associated with human remains at Rancho La Brea, Bulletin, Southern California Academy of Sciences 84(2): 76‚Äì85 Nevertheless, later, in 2016, the dog was determined to be much younger in date. John C. Merriam of the University of California led much of the original work in this area early in the 1900s. Also, some even older fossils showed possible tool marks, indicating humans active in the area at the time. Saber-toothed cat bones from La Brea showing signs of ‚Äòartificial‚Äô cut marks at oblique angles to the long axis of each bone were radiocarbon dated to 15,200 ¬± 800 B.P. (uncalibrated).Moratto, M. 1984. California Archaeology. Florida: Academic Press, p.54 If these cuts are in fact tool marks resultant from butchering activities, then this material would provide the earliest solid evidence for human association with the Los Angeles Basin. Yet it is also possible that there was some residual contamination of the material as a result of saturation by asphaltum, influencing the radiocarbon dates.Technical report for power plant construction.

The ridged band is a band of highly erogenous mobile skin toward the end of the foreskin. Along with the frenulum of the penis, it is considered to be the most sensitive part of the penis to fine-touch. John R. Taylor, MB, a Canadian pathologist and medical researcher, first used the term \\"ridged band\\" instead of \\"wrinkly skin\\" and described the ridged band at the Second International Symposium on Circumcision, organized by NOCIRC in San Francisco, 1991, after examining the foreskins of 22 adults obtained at autopsy. The mean age was 37 years, range 22‚Äì58. The prepuces were studied grossly and histologically. The term ridged is used to describe the area instead of the more commonly used term wrinkled. It has, especially in regard to phimosis (and preputioplasty), been called preputial ring or phimotic ring, ring being analogous to band, referring to the shape, and preputial meaning pertaining to the prepuce. More particularly, it refers to the transitional area from the external to the internal surface of the prepuce, or foreskin. The term ridged band was subsequently used by Taylor in an anatomical and histological study of the foreskin published in the British Journal of Urology in 1996. (Reprint: cirp.org) Most or all of the ridged band is removed by male circumcision. Structure Part of a ridged band under 10√ó magnification. The delicate and highly innervated mucosa features many ridges which increase sensitivity through increased surface area. Taylor described the ridged band as a transversely ridged band of mucosal tissue, located just inside the tip of the foreskin near the mucocutaneous boundary, also known as the preputial sphincter. He characterized the ridged band as intensely vascular and richly innervated, stating that it \\"contains more Meissner's corpuscles than does the smooth mucosa\\", and noted that these tactile corpuscles were found only in the crests of ridges. Function The prepuce, including the ridged band, is a specific erogenous zone. Taylor (1996) postulates that \\"the ridged band with its unique structure, tactile corpuscles and other nerves, is primarily sensory tissue\\". He hypothesizes (2007) that Meissner's corpuscles in the ridged band are adapted to detect stretch: :Work in progress indicates that retraction and stretching of this accordion-like structure triggers reflex contraction of bulbocavernosus and bulbospongiosus. Taylor theorizes that the main function of the ridged band is to trigger sexual reflexes. In a letter to the editor of BJU International, 2007, Taylor writes: :Initial study (J.R.T. unpublished) indicates that the real importance of the ridged band to sexual intercourse lies in an ability to trigger a reflex contraction of muscles responsible for ejaculation. In the Journal of Sexual Medicine, 2007, Taylor states: :Both glans and prepuce contribute to the single mucocutaneous junctional zone of the penis and it is possible that these apparently dissimilar structures in fact share similar functions related more to sexual reflexes than to touch perception. The effect of circumcision on sexual function is the subject of intense debate. Taylor's view is that \\"almost certainly, removal of the prepuce and its ridged band distorts penile reflexogenic functions but exactly how and to what extent still remains to be seen\\". More recent research has demonstrated that the clinically important bulbocavernosus reflex is absent in 73% of circumcised men ostensibly due to the removal of fine-touch nerve endings in the ridged band.

The worm was first noticed and started spreading on August 11, 2003. The rate that it spread increased until the number of infections peaked on August 13, 2003. Once a network (such as a company or university) was infected, it spread more quickly within the network because firewalls typically did not prevent internal machines from using a certain port. Filtering by ISPs and widespread publicity about the worm curbed the spread of Blaster. On March 12, 2004, Jeffrey Lee Parson, an 18-year-old from Hopkins, Minnesota, was arrested for creating the B variant of the Blaster worm; he admitted responsibility and was sentenced to an 18-month prison term in January 2005.  Creation and effects  According to court papers, the original Blaster was created after security researchers from the Chinese group Xfocus reverse engineered the original Microsoft patch that allowed for execution of the attack. The worm spreads by exploiting a buffer overflow discovered by the Polish security research group Last Stage of Delirium in the DCOM RPC service on the affected operating systems, for which a patch had been released one month earlier in MS03-026 and later in MS03-039. This allowed the worm to spread without users opening attachments simply by spamming itself to large numbers of random IP addresses. Four versions have been detected in the wild. These are the most well-known exploits of the original flaw in RPC, but there were in fact another 12 different vulnerabilities that did not see as much media attention. The worm was programmed to start a SYN flood against port 80 of windowsupdate.com if the system date is after August 15 and before December 31 and after the 15th day of other months, thereby creating a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) against the site. The damage to Microsoft was minimal as the site targeted was windowsupdate.com, rather than windowsupdate.microsoft.com, to which the former was redirected. Microsoft temporarily shut down the targeted site to minimize potential effects from the worm. The worm's executable, MSBlast.exe, contains two messages. The first reads: > I just want to say LOVE YOU SAN!! This message gave the worm the alternative name of Lovesan. The second reads: > billy gates why do you make this possible ? Stop making money > and fix your software!! This is a message to Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and the target of the worm. The worm also creates the following registry entry so that it is launched every time Windows starts: > HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\ windows > auto update=msblast.exe  Timeline  *May 28, 2003: Microsoft releases a patch that would protect users from an exploit in WebDAV that Welchia used.

Side effects  Although the worm can only spread on systems running Windows 2000 or Windows XP, it can cause instability in the RPC service on systems running other versions of Windows NT, including Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. In particular, the worm does not spread in Windows Server 2003 because Windows Server 2003 was compiled with the /GS switch, which detected the buffer overflow and shut the RPCSS process down. When infection occurs, the buffer overflow causes the RPC service to crash, leading Windows to display the following message and then automatically reboot, usually after 60 seconds. This was the first indication many users had an infection; it often occurred a few minutes after every startup on compromised machines. A simple resolution to stop countdown is to run the \\"shutdown /a\\" command, causing some side effects such as an empty (without users) Welcome Screen. The Welchia worm had a similar effect. Months later, the Sasser worm surfaced, which caused a similar message to appear.

It used to be a prosperous trading outpost in the 8th and 9th centuries. A multi-ethnic settlement, it was dominated by Scandinavians who were called by the name of Rus'. For that reason, it is sometimes called the first capital of Russia. Origin and name The fortress of Ladoga was built in the 12th century and rebuilt 400 years later. It is now mostly reconstructed since being heavily damaged during World War II. Dendrochronology suggests that Ladoga was founded in 753. Until 950, it was one of the most important trading ports of Eastern Europe. Merchant vessels sailed from the Baltic Sea through Ladoga to Novgorod and then to Constantinople or the Caspian Sea. This route is known as the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks. An alternative way led down the Volga River along the Volga trade route to the Khazar capital of Atil, and then to the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, all the way to Baghdad. Tellingly, the oldest Arabian Middle Age coin in Europe was unearthed in Ladoga. Staraya is Russian for \\"Old\\". It is believed that the name Ladoga comes from the Finnish word Alode-joki (i.e., \\"lowland river\\"). Excavations have disproved most of the data about the Norman origin of Ladoga when it was apparent that the old settlement stretched to the mid-8th century and the excavated objects were mostly of Finno-Ugric and Slavic origin, also dated to the mid-8th century, which showed the settlement was not Scandinavian from the beginning. Ladoga under Rurik and Rurikids Viking burial mounds along the Volkhov River near Staraya Ladoga According to the Hypatian Codex that was created at the end of the 13th century, the legendary Varangian leader Rurik arrived at Ladoga in 862 and made it his capital. Rurik later moved to Novgorod and his successors then to Kiev where foundations for the powerful state of Kievan Rus' were laid. There are several huge kurgans, or royal funerary barrows, at the outskirts of Ladoga. One of them is said to be Rurik's grave, and another one‚Äîthat of his successor Oleg. The Heimskringla and other Norse sources mention that in the late 990s Eric Haakonsson of Norway raided the coast and set the town ablaze. Ladoga was the most important trading center in Eastern Europe from about 800 to 900 CE, and it is estimated that between 90% to 95% of all Arab dirhams found in Sweden passed through Ladoga. Ladoga's next mention in chronicles is dated 1019, when Ingigerd of Sweden married Yaroslav of Novgorod. Under the terms of their marriage settlement, Yaroslav ceded Ladoga to his wife, who appointed her father's cousin, the Swedish earl Ragnvald Ulfsson, to rule the town. This information is confirmed by sagas and archaeological evidence, which suggests that Ladoga gradually evolved into a primarily Varangian settlement. At least two Swedish kings spent their youths in Ladoga, Stenkil and Inge I, and possibly also King Anund G√•rdske. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Ladoga functioned as a trade outpost of the powerful Novgorod Republic. Later its trade significance declined and most of the population engaged in fishing in the 15th century. After new fortresses such as Oreshek and Korela were constructed in the 14th century further to the west of Ladoga, the town's military significance also decreased. Ladoga belonged to Vodskaya Pyatina of the Republic and contained eighty-four homesteads in the 15th century; most of the land belonged to the church. The Novgorodians built there a citadel with five towers and several churches. The reconstruction of one of the towers of Staraya Ladoga's fortress was scheduled to be completed in 2010. Sights and landmarks The heart of Staraya Ladoga is an old fortress where the Yelena River flows into the Volkhov. In earlier times, it was a strategic site because it was the only possible harbor for sea-vessels that could not navigate through the Volkhov River. The fortress was rebuilt at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1703, Peter the Great founded the town of Novaya Ladoga (New Ladoga) closer to the bank of Lake Ladoga. The ancient fortress thenceforth declined and came to be known as Staraya Ladoga (Old Ladoga), in order to distinguish it from the new town.

The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar √âirinn dates his reign to 113‚Äì116, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 119‚Äì122.Annals of the Four Masters M119-122 Genealogy According to Foras Feasa ar √âirinn, Cathaoir Mor was a son of Feidhlimidh Fiorurghlas, son of Cormac Gealta Gaoth, son of Nia Corb, son of Cu Corb, son of Mogh Corb, son of Conchubhar Abhradhruadh, son of Fionn File, son of Rossa Ruadh, son of Fearghus Fairrge, son of Nuadha Neacht, son of Seadna Siothbhac, son of Lughaidh Loithfhionn, son of Breasal Breac, son of Fiachaidh Foibhric, son of Oilill Glas, son of Fearadhach Foghlas, son of Nuadha Fullon, son of Ealloit, son of Art, son of Mogh Airt, son of Criomhthann Coscrach, son of Feidhlimidh Foirthriun, son of Fearghus Fortamhail, son of Breasal Breodhamhan, son of Aonghus Ollamh, son of Oilill Bracain, son of Labhraidh Loingseach of the race of Eireamhon.

Cathair's daughter Eithne Th√°ebfhota is fostered by a hospitable Leinsterman named Buchet who has many herds of cattle, but Cathair's sons so exploit Buchet's hospitality that he is left with only one bull and seven cows, and the king, now old and enfeebled, is unable to restrain them. Buchet and his family, including Eithne, are reduced to living in a hut in the forest in Kells, County Meath. Later, when Cormac mac Airt is king, he marries Eithne and restores Buchet's fortunes\\"The Melody of the House of Buchet (summarised by Miles Dillon) (in other stories the king who marries Eithne is Cathair's successor Conn C√©tchathach).The Adventures of Art son of Conn In another saga, Fotha Catha Cnucha (\\"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\\"), Cathair gives the hill of Almu (Knockaulin, County Kildare) to the druid Nuada son of Aichi.

Life and work Montgomery was born in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire.Whittle, David (2007). Bruce Montgomery/Edmund Crispin: A Life in Music and Books. Aldershot: Ashgate, p. 4. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and graduated from St John's College, Oxford, in 1943, with a BA in modern languages, having for two years been its organ scholarJohn Bowen in The Oldie, April 2011 and choirmaster. While there he became friendly with Philip Larkin and Kingsley Amis.Bodleian Libraries. Archive of Bruce Montgomery, Collection From 1943 to 1945 he taught at Shrewsbury School and began writing the first of his detective novels. Montgomery encouraged Larkin's writing ambitions, and according to Andrew Motion \\"by combining a devoted commitment to writing with a huge appetite for drinking and fooling around, he gave Larkin a model of the ways in which art could avoid pretension\\".Motion, Andrew. Philip Larkin, a Writer's Life (revised edition 2019) He first became established under his own name as a composer of vocal and choral music, including An Oxford Requiem (1951), but later turned to film work, writing the scores for many British comedies of the 1950s. For the Carry On series he composed six scores, (Sergeant, Nurse, Teacher, Constable, Regardless and Cruising), including the original Carry On theme subsequently adapted for later films by Eric Rogers. He also composed the scores to four films in the Doctor film series (House, Sea, Large and Love). Montgomery wrote both the screenplay and score of Raising the Wind (1961), and his other film scores included The Kidnappers (1953), Raising a Riot (1955), Eyewitness (1956), The Truth About Women (1957), The Surgeon's Knife (1957), Please Turn Over (1959), Too Young to Love (1959), Watch Your Stern (1960), No Kidding (1960), Twice Round the Daffodils (1962) and The Brides of Fu Manchu (1966). Detective novels Montgomery wrote detective novels and two collections of short stories under the pseudonym Edmund Crispin (taken from a character in Michael Innes's Hamlet, Revenge!). Nine volumes appeared between 1944 and 1953, starting with The Case of The Gilded Fly. The stories feature Oxford don Gervase Fen,Grosset, Philip. \\"Gervase Fen\\" who is a Professor of English at the university and a fellow of St Christopher's College, a fictional institution that Crispin locates next to St John's College. Fen is an eccentric, sometimes absent-minded, character reportedly based on his tutor, the Oxford professor W. G. Moore (1905-1978).W G Moore obituary, Oxford University Press The whodunit novels have complex plots and fantastic, somewhat unbelievable solutions, including examples of the locked room mystery. They are written in a humorous, literary and sometimes farcical style. They are also among the few mystery novels to break the fourth wall occasionally and speak directly to the audience. Perhaps the best example is from The Moving Toyshop, during a chase sequence ‚Äì \\"Let's go left\\", Cadogan suggested. \\"After all, Gollancz is publishing this book.\\"Crispin, Edmund (1946). The Moving Toyshop (Chapter 6). London: Four Square (paperback) Edition, 1965, p. 68. All of the novels contain frequent references to English literature, poetry, and (in particular) music. Frequent Hearses and Swan Song have a specifically musical backdrop. Swan Song (1947) explores the world of opera during rehearsals for a production of Wagner‚Äôs Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, while Frequent Hearses is set in a film studio, and includes among the characters Napier, a composer of film music. By 1950, when Frequent Hearses was published, Montgomery was already busy elsewhere, also establishing himself as a composer of film music. Crispin is considered by many to be one of the last great exponents of the classic crime mystery.BBC - Doctor Who - Classic Series - Ebooks - Introduction - Let me entertain you Composer Bruce Montgomery composed the scores for nearly forty films, including documentaries and thrillers. The Carry-On Suite, arranged by David Whittle from the scores of Carry On Sergeant (1958), Carry On Nurse (1959) and Carry on Teacher (1959), provides a representative example, dominated by the main theme, a comedy March. Although his film work got his music out to a huge audience, the numerous comedy scores in particular stand in stark contrast to Bruce Montgomery‚Äôs church music and concert works, with which he started out. These began to appear in the mid-1940s, at the same time his detective novels were appearing under the name Edmund Crispin. Church music predominates, the culmination being the Oxford Requiem, commissioned by the Oxford Bach Choir and first performed at the Sheldonian Theatre on 23 May 1951 (The Sheldonian was also the scene of a crime in his novel The Moving Toyshop). He may have been motivated to compose the piece following the death of his close friend and teacher, the organist and composer Godfrey Sampson (1902-1949) ‚Äì thought also to have been the inspiration behind the character Geoffrey Vintner, the organist and friend of Gervase Fen in The Case of the Gilded Fly. An Oxford Requiem ‚Äúis Montgomery‚Äôs most considerable achievement to date,‚Äù wrote The Times reviewer, ‚Äúand confirms the suspicion that he is a real composer with something of real significance to say.‚ÄùThe Times, 24 May 1951, p 6 The Requiem was followed by the secular choral work Venus‚Äô Praise, a setting of seven sixteenth and seventeenth century English poems. Even less known are the operas, which include a children‚Äôs ballad opera, John Barleycorn, and two intriguing collaborations with his friend Kingsley Amis providing the texts. The first, Amberley Hall, was described by Montgomery as ‚Äúa mildly scandalous burlesque set in England in the 18th century.‚Äù The second, To Move the Passions, was a ballad opera commissioned for the 1951 Festival of Britain. Both remained unfinished, and Amis complained that Montgomery was too busy ‚Äúwriting filthy film scores and stinking stories for the popular press.‚Äù Unfortunately, only the Concertino for String Orchestra of 1950, a substantial three movement piece despite the modest title, and the only purely instrumental work Montgomery ever had published, is generally available as a recording.English String Miniatures Vol 3, Naxos 8.555069 (2001) Philip Lane calls Montgomery \\"a composer of talent who was perhaps side-tracked, and, not helped by increasing alcoholism, unable to fulfil his full potential. On the other hand, not every composer has their music heard by millions throughout the world, even though not every listener is aware of the composer‚Äôs name.\\"Lane, Philip. Notes to Naxos 8.555069 (2001) Later career Montgomery returned to literature at the end of his life, with the final Crispin novel, Glimpses of the Moon. By now, the composer character, Broderick Thouless, is writing ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù film music and light concert works, rather than the other way round (as it was with Napier in Frequent Hearses). Such comic perversity is characteristic of Crispin. But Montgomery's output of music and fiction all but ceased after the 1950s, although he continued to write reviews of crime novels and science fiction works for The Sunday Times (praising the early works of both P. D. James and Ruth Rendell).The Passing Tramp. What Killed Crispin?, 11 December 2011 He had always been a heavy drinker and there was a long gap in his writing during a time when he was suffering from alcohol problems. Otherwise he enjoyed a quiet life (enlivened by music, reading, church-going and bridge) in Totnes, Devon, where he resisted all attempts to develop or exploit the district, and visited London as little as possible. He moved to a new house he had built at Week, a hamlet near Dartington, in 1964. The 1969 short story We Know You're Busy Writing, But We Thought You Wouldn't Mind If We Just Dropped in for a Minute humorously evokes the difficulties of a writer balancing his social and leisure inclinations with the discipline of writing. In 1976 he married his secretary Ann, two years before he died from alcohol-related problems. A biography by David Whittle, Bruce Montgomery/Edmund Crispin: A Life in Music and Books () was published in June 2007. A previously unpublished novella, featuring Gervase Fen, \\"The Hours of Darkness,\\" has been included in the 2019 edition of the annual anthology, Bodies from the Library. Influence Gareth Roberts has said that the tone of his Doctor Who novel The Well-Mannered War was modelled upon Crispin's style. He also remarks (of The Moving Toyshop) that \\"It's more like Doctor Who than Doctor Who.\\" Christopher Fowler pays homage to The Moving Toyshop in The Victoria Vanishes, his sixth Bryant & May novel.

The format was specified and the devices were first manufactured by SanDisk in 1994. CompactFlash became one of the most successful of the early memory card formats, surpassing Miniature Card and SmartMedia. Subsequent formats, such as MMC/SD, various Memory Stick formats, and xD-Picture Card offered stiff competition. Most of these cards are smaller than CompactFlash while offering comparable capacity and speed. Proprietary memory card formats for use in professional audio and video, such as P2 and SxS, are faster, but physically larger and more costly. CompactFlash remains popular and is supported by many professional devices and high-end consumer devices. As of 2017, both Canon and Nikon use CompactFlash for their flagship digital still cameras. Canon also chose CompactFlash as the recording medium for its professional high-definition tapeless video cameras. Ikegami professional video cameras can record digital video onto CompactFlash cards through an adaptor. Traditional CompactFlash cards use the Parallel ATA interface, but in 2008, a variant of CompactFlash, CFast was announced. CFast (also known as CompactFast) is based on the Serial ATA interface. In November 2010, SanDisk, Sony and Nikon presented a next generation card format to the CompactFlash Association. The new format has a similar form factor to CF/CFast but is based on the PCI Express interface instead of Parallel ATA or Serial ATA. With potential read and write speeds of 1 Gbit/s (125 MB/s) and storage capabilities beyond 2 TiB, the new format is aimed at high-definition camcorders and high-resolution digital cameras, but the new cards are not backward compatible with either CompactFlash or CFast. The XQD card format was officially announced by the CompactFlash Association in December 2011. Description A 16-GB CompactFlash card installed in a 2.5\\" IDE port with adapter There are two main subdivisions of CF cards, 3.3 mm-thick type I and 5 mm-thick type II (CF2). The type II slot is used by miniature hard drives and some other devices, such as the Hasselblad CFV Digital Back for the Hasselblad series of medium format cameras. There are four main card speeds: original CF, CF High Speed (using CF+/CF2.0), faster CF 3.0 standard and the faster CF 4.0 standard adopted as of 2007. CompactFlash was originally built around Intel's NOR-based flash memory, but has switched to NAND technology.http://www.karlfoster.com/text/DP_flashmemory.doc CF is among the oldest and most successful formats, and has held a niche in the professional camera market especially well. It has benefited from both a better cost to memory-size ratio and, for much of the format's life, generally greater available capacity than other formats. CF cards can be used directly in a PC Card slot with a plug adapter, used as an ATA (IDE) or PCMCIA storage device with a passive adapter or with a reader, or attached to other types of ports such as USB or FireWire. As some newer card types are smaller, they can be used directly in a CF card slot with an adapter. Formats that can be used this way include SD/MMC, Memory Stick Duo, xD-Picture Card in a Type I slot and SmartMedia in a Type II slot, as of 2005. Some multi-card readers use CF for I/O as well. Technical details The CompactFlash interface is a 50-pin subset of the 68-pin PCMCIA connector. \\"It can be easily slipped into a passive 68-pin PCMCIA Type II to CF Type I adapter that fully meets PCMCIA electrical and mechanical interface specifications\\", according to compactflash.org. The interface operates, depending on the state of a mode pin on power-up, as either a 16-bit PC Card (0x7FF address limit) or as an IDE (PATA) interface. 1 GB CF card in a Nikon D200 DSLR camera Unlike the PC Card interface, no dedicated programming voltages (Vpp1 and Vpp2) are provided on the CompactFlash interface.CF+ and CompactFlash Specification Revision 1.4, Section 4 Electrical Interface, Table 4 CompactFlash IDE mode defines an interface that is smaller than, but electrically identical to, the ATA interface. The CF device contains an ATA controller and appears to the host device as if it were a hard disk. CF devices operate at 3.3 volts or 5 volts, and can be swapped from system to system. CompactFlash supports C-H-S and 28-bit logical block addressing (CF 5.0 introduced support for LBA-48). CF cards with flash memory are able to cope with extremely rapid changes in temperature. Industrial versions of flash memory cards can operate at a range of ‚àí45 ¬∞C to +85 ¬∞C. NOR-based flash has lower density than newer NAND-based systems, and CompactFlash is therefore the physically largest of the three memory card formats introduced in the early 1990s, being derived from the JEIDA/PCMCIA Memory Card formats. The other two are Miniature Card (MiniCard) and SmartMedia (SSFDC). However, CF did switch to NAND type memory later. The IBM Microdrive format, later made by Hitachi, implements the CF Type II interface, but is a hard disk drive (HDD) as opposed to solid-state memory. Seagate also made CF HDDs. =Speed= CompactFlash IDE (ATA) emulation speed is usually specified in \\"x\\" ratings, e.g. 8x, 20x, 133x. This is the same system used for CD-ROMs and indicates the maximum transfer rate in the form of a multiplier based on the original audio CD data transfer rate, which is 150 kB/s. : R = {K \\\\cdot 150}\\\\ \\\\text{kB/s} where R = transfer rate, K = speed rating. For example, 133x rating means transfer speed of: 133 √ó 150 kB/s = 19,950 kB/s ‚âà 20 MB/s. These are manufacturer speed ratings. Actual transfer speed may be higher, or lower, than shown on the card depending on several factors. The speed rating quoted is almost always the read speed, while write speed is often slower. Solid state For reads, the onboard controller first powers up the memory chips from standby. Reads are usually in parallel, error correction is done on the data, then transferred through the interface 16 bits at a time. Error checking is required due to soft read errors. Writes require powerup from standby, wear leveling calculation, a block erase of the area to be written to, ECC calculation, write itself (an individual memory cell read takes around 100 ns, a write to the chip takes 1ms+ or 10,000 times longer). Because the USB 2.0 interface is limited to 35 MB/s and lacks bus mastering hardware, USB 2.0 implementation results in slower access. Modern UDMA-7 CompactFlash Cards provide data rates up to 145 MB/s and require USB 3.0 data transfer rates. A direct motherboard connection is often limited to 33 MB/s because IDE to CF adapters lack high speed ATA (66 MB/s plus) cable support. Power on from sleep/off takes longer than power up from standby. Magnetic media Many hard drives (often referred to by the trademarked name \\"Microdrive\\") typically spin at 3600 RPM, so rotational latency is a consideration, as is spin-up from standby or idle. Seagate's 8 GB ST68022CF drive spins up fully within a few revolutions but current drawn can reach up to 350 milliamps and runs at 40-50 mA mean current. Its average seek time is 8 ms and can sustain 9 MB/s read and write, and has an interface speed of 33 MB/s. Hitachi's 4 GB Microdrive is 12 ms seek, sustained 6 MB/s. =Capacities and compatibility= The CF 5.0 Specification supports capacities up to 128 PiB using 48-bit logical block addressing (LBA). Prior to 2006, CF drives using magnetic media offered the highest capacities (up to 8 GiB. Now there are solid-state cards with higher capacities (up to 512 GB). As of 2011, solid-state drives (SSDs) have supplanted both kinds of CF drive for large capacity requirements. Solid state capacities SanDisk announced its 16 GB Extreme III card at the photokina trade fair, in September, 2006.SanDisk Introduces the World's Highest Capacity Card for Professional Photographers That same month, Samsung announced 16, 32 and 64 GB CF cards. Two years later, in September, 2008, PRETEC announced 100 GB cards. Magnetic media capacities Seagate announced a 5 GB \\"1-inch hard drive\\" in June, 2004,Seagate Expands Consumer Electronics Leadership with First 5GB 1-Inch Hard Drive, First 5GB Compact Flash Hard Drive, and New 400GB DVR Hard Drive and an 8 GB version in June, 2005.Seagate Does it Again: Drives Innovation with 10 New, Groundbreaking Hard Disc Drives Use in place of a hard disk drive CompactFlash to SATA adapter with a card inserted In early 2008, the CFA demonstrated CompactFlash cards with a built in SATA interface. Several companies make adapters that allow CF cards to be connected to PCI, PCMCIA, IDE and SATA connections, allowing a CF card to act as a solid-state drive with virtually any operating system or BIOS, and even in a RAID configuration. CF cards may perform the function of the master or slave drive on the IDE bus, but have issues sharing the bus. Moreover, late-model cards that provide DMA (using UDMA or MWDMA) may present problems when used through a passive adapter that does not support DMA. =Reliability= Original PC Card memory cards used an internal battery to maintain data when power was removed. The rated life of the battery was the only reliability issue. CompactFlash cards that use flash memory, like other flash-memory devices, are rated for a limited number of erase/write cycles for any \\"block.\\" While NOR flash has higher endurance, ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000, they haven't been adapted for memory card usage. Most mass storage usage flash are NAND based. NAND flash were being scaled down to 16 nm. They are usually rated for 500 to 3,000 write/erase cycles per block before hard failure. This is less reliable than magnetic media.The comparison is not in the same terms as for magnetic media, for which hours of operation and reads also impose wear. Car PC HacksCar PC hacks, Damien Stolarz, 2005, Farnham:O‚ÄôReilly Media, Sebastopol, CA, USA, suggests disabling the Windows swap file and using its Enhanced Write Filter (EWF) to eliminate unnecessary writes to flash memory.EWF is available only in XP Embedded, not the XP Professional, Home, or Media Editions versions of Windows. Additionally, when formatting a flash-memory drive, the Quick Format method should be used, to write as little as possible to the device. Most CompactFlash flash-memory devices limit wear on blocks by varying the physical location to which a block is written. This process is called wear leveling. When using CompactFlash in ATA mode to take the place of the hard disk drive, wear leveling becomes critical because low-numbered blocks contain tables whose contents change frequently. Current CompactFlash cards spread the wear- leveling across the entire drive. The more advanced CompactFlash cards will move data that rarely changes to ensure all blocks wear evenly. NAND flash memory is prone to frequent soft read errors. The CompactFlash card includes error checking and correcting (ECC) that detects the error and re-reads the block. The process is transparent to the user, although it may slow data access. As a flash memory device is solid-state, it is less affected by shock than a spinning disk. The possibility for electrical damage from upside-down insertion is prevented by asymmetrical side slots, assuming that the host device uses a suitable connector. Power consumption and data transfer rate Small cards consume around 5% of the power required by small disk drives and still have reasonable transfer rates of over 45 MB/s for the more expensive 'high-speed' cards. However, the manufacturer's warning on the flash memory used for ReadyBoost indicates a current draw in excess of 500 mA. File systems CompactFlash cards for use in consumer devices are typically formatted as FAT12 (for media up to 16 MB), FAT16 (for media up to 2 GB, sometimes up to 4 GB) and FAT32 (for media larger than 2 GB). This lets the devices be read by personal computers but also suits the limited processing ability of some consumer devices such as cameras. There are varying levels of compatibility among FAT32-compatible cameras, MP3 players, PDAs, and other devices. While any device that claims FAT32-capability should read and write to a FAT32-formatted card without problems, some devices are tripped up by cards larger than 2 GB that are completely unformatted, while others may take longer to apply a FAT32 format. The way many digital cameras update the file system as they write to the card creates a FAT32 bottleneck. Writing to a FAT32-formatted card generally takes a little longer than writing to a FAT16-formatted card with similar performance capabilities. For instance, the Canon EOS 10D writes the same photo to a FAT16-formatted 2 GB CompactFlash card somewhat faster than to a same speed 4 GB FAT32-formatted CompactFlash card, although the memory chips in both cards have the same write speed specification.Rob Galbraith CompactFlash Performance Database Although FAT16 is more wasteful of disk space with its larger clusters, it works better with the write strategy that flash memory chips require. The cards themselves can be formatted with any type of file system such as Ext, JFS, NTFS, or by one of the dedicated flash file systems. It can be divided into partitions as long as the host device can read them. CompactFlash cards are often used instead of hard drives in embedded systems, dumb terminals and various small form-factor PCs that are built for low noise output or power consumption. CompactFlash cards are often more readily available and smaller than purpose-built solid- state drives and often have faster seek times than hard drives. =CF+ and CompactFlash specification revisions= When CompactFlash was first being standardized, even full-sized hard disks were rarely larger than 4 GB in size, and so the limitations of the ATA standard were considered acceptable. However, CF cards manufactured after the original Revision 1.0 specification are available in capacities up to 512 GB. While the current revision 6.0 works in [P]ATA mode, future revisions are expected to implement SATA mode. * CompactFlash Revision 1.0 (1995), 8.3 MByte/s (PIO mode 2), support for up to 128 GB storage space. * CompactFlash+ aka CompactFlash I/O (1997) * CF+ and CompactFlash Revision 2.0 (2003) added an increase in speed to 16.6 MByte/s data-transfer (PIO mode 4). At the end of 2003, DMA 33 transfers were added as well, available since mid-2004. * CF+ and CompactFlash Revision 3.0 (2004) added support for up to a 66 MByte/s data transfer rate (UDMA 66), 25 MByte/s in PC Card mode, added password protection, along with a number of other features. CFA recommends usage of the FAT32 filesystem for storage cards larger than 2 GB. * CF+ and CompactFlash Revision 4.0 (2006) added support for IDE Ultra DMA Mode 6 for a maximum data transfer rate of 133 MByte/s (UDMA 133). * CF+ and CompactFlash Revision 4.1 (2007) added support for Power Enhanced CF Storage Cards. * CompactFlash Revision 5.0 (2010) added a number of features, including 48-bit addressing (supporting 128 Petabyte of storage), larger block transfers of up to 32 Megabytes, quality-of-service and video performance guarantees, and other enhancementsCFA Announces Availability of the New CF5.0 Specification * CompactFlash Revision 6.0 (November 2010) added UltraDMA Mode 7 (167 MByte/s), ATA-8/ACS-2 sanitize command, TRIM and an optional card capability to report the operating temperature range of the card.CompactFlash 6.0 =CE-ATA= CE-ATA is a serial MMC-compatible interface based on the MultiMediaCard standard.http://www.hitachigst.com/tech/techlib.nsf/techdocs/98ABCD658D41637A8625706700616161/$file/Ready_for_CE- ATA.pdf =CFast= Pins of a CFast card A variant of CompactFlash known as CFast is based on the Serial ATA (SATA) interface, rather than the Parallel ATA/IDE (PATA) bus for which all previous versions of CompactFlash are designed. CFast is also known as CompactFast. CFast 1.0/1.1 supports a higher maximum transfer rate than current CompactFlash cards, using SATA 2.0 (300 MByte/s) interface, while PATA is limited to 167 MByte/s using UDMA 7. CFast cards are not physically or electrically compatible with CompactFlash cards. However, since SATA can emulate the PATA command protocol, existing CompactFlash software drivers can be used, although writing new drivers to use AHCI instead of PATA emulation will almost always result in significant performance gains. CFast cards use a female 7-pin SATA data connector, and a female 17-pin power connector, so an adaptor is required to connect CFast cards in place of standard SATA hard drives which use male connectors. The first CFast cards reached the market in late 2009. At CES 2009, Pretec showed a 32 GB CFast card and announced that they should reach the market within a few months. Delock began distributing CFast cards in 2010, offering several card readers with USB 3.0 and eSATAp (power over eSATA) ports to support CFast cards. Seeking higher performance and still keeping a compact storage format, some of the earliest adoptors of CFast cards were in the gaming industry (used in slot machines), as a natural evolution from the by then well-established CF cards. Current gaming industry supporters of the format include both specialist gaming companies (e.g. Aristocrat Leisure) and OEMs such as Innocore (now part of Advantech Co., Ltd.). The CFast 2.0 specification was released in the second quarter of 2012, updating the electrical interface to SATA 3.0 (600 MByte/s). As of 2014, the only product employing CFast 2.0 cards was the Arri Amira digital production camera, allowing frame rates of up to 200 fps; a CFast 2.0 adapter for the Arri Alexa/XT camera was also released. On 7 April 2014, Blackmagic Design announced the URSA cinema camera, which records to CFast media. On 8 April 2015, Canon Inc. announced the XC10 video camera, which also makes use of CFast cards. Blackmagic Design also announced that its URSA Mini will use CFast 2.0. As of October 2016, there are a growing number of medium to high-end professional devices making use of the faster data rates offered by CFast media. Examples include the Arri Amira and Arri Alexa Mini; the Hasselblad H6D-100C; the Canon C700, C300 Mark II, EOS 1D X II, and XC10; and the Blackmagic Ursa, Ursa Mini 4.6K and Ursa Mini 4K. Additional recording devices for video include Atomos Ninja Star and Atomos Shogun Studio 4K. As of 2017, in the wider embedded electronics industry, transition from CF to CFast is still relatively slow, probably due to hardware cost considerations and some inertia (familiarity with CF) and because a significant part of the industry is satisfied with the lower performance provided by CF cards, thus having no reason to change. A strong incentive to change to CFast for embedded electronics companies using designs based on Intel PC architecture is the fact that Intel has removed native support for the (P)ATA interface a few design platforms ago and the older CPU/PCH generations now have end-of-life status. = CFexpress = In September 2016, the CompactFlash Association announced a new standard based on PCIe 3.0 and NVMe, CFexpress. In April 2017, the version 1.0 of the CFexpress specification was published, with support for two PCIe 3.0 lanes in an XQD form-factor for up to 2 GB/s. =Type I and Type II= The only physical difference between the two types is that Type I devices are 3.3 mm thick while Type II devices are 5 mm thick. Electrically, the two interfaces are the same except that Type I devices are permitted to draw up to 70 mA supply current from the interface, while type II devices may draw up to 500 mA. Most Type II devices are Microdrive devices (see below), other miniature hard drives, and adapters, such as a popular adapter that takes Secure Digital cards. A few flash-based Type II devices were manufactured, but Type I cards are now available in capacities that exceed CF HDDs. Manufacturers of CompactFlash cards such as Sandisk, Toshiba, Alcotek and Hynix offer devices with Type I slots only. Some of the latest DSLR cameras, like the Nikon D800, have also dropped Type II support. =Microdrives= IBM 1 GB Microdrive Microdrive was a brand of tiny hard disks‚Äîabout 25 mm (1 inch) wide‚Äîin a CompactFlash Type II package. The first was developed and released in 1999 by IBM, with a capacity of 170 MB. IBM sold its disk drive division, including the Microdrive trademark, to Hitachi in 2002. Comparable hard disks were also made by other vendors, such as Seagate and Sony. They were available in capacities of up to 8 GB but have been superseded by flash memory in cost, capacity, and reliability, and are no longer manufactured. As mechanical devices, CF HDDs drew more current than flash memory's 100 mA maximum. Early versions drew up to 500 mA, but more recent ones drew under 200 mA for reads and under 300 mA for writes. (Some devices used for high speed‚Äîsuch as Readyboost, which had no low-power standby mode‚Äîexceeded the 500 mA maximum of the Type II standard.) CF HDDs were also susceptible to damage from physical shock or temperature changes. However, CF HDDs had a longer lifespan of write cycles than early flash memories. The iPod mini, Nokia N91, iriver H10 (5 or 6 GB model), PalmOne LifeDrive, and Rio Carbon used a Microdrive to store data. Compared to other portable storage * CompactFlash cards that use flash memory are more rugged than some hard drive solutions because they are solid-state. (See also Reliability above.) Separately, CompactFlash cards are thicker than other card formats, which may render them less susceptible to breakage from harsh treatment. * As CompactFlash cards support the IDE/ATA command protocol with the host device, a passive adapter lets them function as the hard disk drive of a personal computer, as described above. * CompactFlash does not have any built in DRM or cryptographic features found on some USB flash drives and other card formats. The absence of such features contributes to the openness of the standard, as card standards with such features may be subject to restrictive licensing agreements. * The initial CompactFlash specification envisaged a higher maximum capacity than other card formats. For this reason, many early CompactFlash host devices are usable with modern multi-gigabyte memories, where users of other families such as Secure Digital have had to migrate to SDHC and SDXC. * CompactFlash lacks the mechanical write protection switch that some other devices have, as seen in a comparison of memory cards. * CompactFlash is physically larger than other card formats. This limits its use, especially in miniature consumer devices where internal space is limited, such as point-and-shoot digital cameras. (An offsetting benefit of larger size is that the card is easier to insert and remove, and harder to misplace.) Counterfeiting The marketplace for CompactFlash is extensive and includes counterfeits. Off-brand or counterfeit cards may be mislabeled, might not contain the actual amount of memory their controllers report to the host device, and may use types of memory that are not rated for the number of erase/rewrite cycles that the purchaser expects.eBay.ie Guides - FAKE SanDisk Extreme Compact Flash Cards ExposedJuly 2007 - Counterfeit SanDisk Cards Other devices in the CF form factor Various CF I/O network interface cards Since CompactFlash interface is electrically identical to the 16-bit PC Card, the CompactFlash form factor is also used for a variety of Input/Output and interface devices.

IPL is increasingly used in optometry and ophthalmology as well, to treat evaporative dry eye disease due to meibomian gland dysfunction. The technology uses a high-powered, hand-held, computer- controlled flashgun to deliver an intense, visible, broad-spectrum pulse of light, generally in the visible spectral range of 400 to 1200 nm. Various cutoff filters are commonly used to selectively filter out shorter wavelengths, especially potentially damaging ultra violet light. The resulting light has a spectral range that targets specific structures and chromophores (e.g. melanin in hair, or oxyhemoglobin in blood vessels) that are heated to destruction and reabsorbed by the body. IPL shares some similarities with laser treatments, in that they both use light to heat and destroy their targets. But unlike lasers that use a single wavelength (color) of light which typically matches only one chromophore and hence only treats one condition, IPL uses a broad spectrum that when used with interchangeable filters, allowing it to be used against several conditions. This can be achieved when the IPL technician selects the appropriate filter that matches a specific chromophore. Description Intense pulsed light is the use of intense pulses of non-coherent light over a range of wavelengths from 500 nm to 1200 nm. Xenon flashlamps produce high output bursts of broad spectrum. Cooling is used to protect the skin in contact with the device. Regulations governing IPL vary by jurisdiction. A distinction is sometimes made between beauty-grade and medical-grade machines, mainly to get around regulations. The first FDA approval of IPL was for telangiectasias in 1995. Use quickly spread to a variety of medical and cosmetic settings. Treatment is generally safe and effective, but complications can occur, such as hyperpigmentation. The polychromatic light can reach multiple chromophores in human skin: mainly hemoglobin, water, and melanin. This results in selective photothermolysis of blood vessels, pigmented cells, or hair follicles. Hair removal IPL can reduce hair growth, most effectively in darker, coarser hair. There are many names and devices for pulsed light treatments such as E-Light, ELOS, and M-Light. IPL should not be confused with laser hair removal, a different procedure using coherent, monochromatic laser light. = Protocol = Broad- spectrum light is applied to the surface of the skin, targeting melanin. This light travels through the skin until it strikes the hair shafts or hair follicle. The follicle is usually where the highest concentration of melanin is located. As the light is absorbed, the bulb and most of the hair shaft are heated, destroying the hair-producing papilla. It is also claimed that heat conversion occurs directly in the darker capillaries that bring blood to the follicle. At any one time, not all hair follicles are ‚Äòactive‚Äô, and only active hair follicles can be affected by the treatment. ‚ÄòInactive‚Äô hair follicles can be treated as they become ‚Äòactive‚Äô over time. For IPL treatments, an average of 8‚Äì10 treatments, 4-6 weeks apart, are required to remove most visible hair. There is no common treatment protocol, as it depends on the equipment used and patient skin type. The area to be treated should be clean shaven and free of sunburn. Treatments are often given in doctors' offices and so-called \\"medspas\\" by trained practitioners. Although IPL treatments will permanently reduce the total number of body hairs, they will not result in a permanent removal of all hair. This distinction is only relevant in the USA because of FDA wording. Certain skin conditions, health irregularities, and medications can impact whether it is safe for a person to receive a light-based hair removal treatment. Photo-sensitizing medications, or damage to the skin are contraindications to treatment. According to Remington, manufacturer of an IPL device, all IPL and laser devices should only be used on light to medium skin tones, and work best on darker hair. =Efficacy= In August 1997, IPL was reported to have permanently removed terminal hair in two patients who underwent multiple treatments to their beards. In October of that year, the first IPL system developed for hair removal and resulted in 60% hair reduction after 12 weeks. It is important to note that these studies utilized a variety of IPL devices on patients with various hair types, skin types, and targeted skin areas. Thus the results are not directly comparable. According to the FDA, permanent hair removal means the \\"long-term, stable reduction in the number of hairs regrowing after a treatment regime.\\" In other words, the number of hairs regrowing must be consistently greater than the duration of the complete growth cycle of hair follicles, which varies from four to twelve months by body location. IPL has been found to be much less effective than laser hair removal; however, many patients experience satisfaction with significant hair reduction. A 2006 article in the journal Lasers in Medical Science compared IPL and both alexandrite and diode lasers. The review found no statistical difference in effectiveness, but a higher incidence of side effects with diode laser treatment. Hair reduction after 6 months was reported as 68.75% for alexandrite lasers, 71.71% for diode lasers, and 66.96% for IPL. Side effects were reported as 9.5% for alexandrite lasers, 28.9% for diode lasers, and 15.3% for IPL. All side effects were found to be temporary and even pigmentation changes returned to normal within 6 months. A 2009 study evaluated the rate of hair removal after a second generation IPL source. Results found that patients had 75% hair reduction after 4 months, and up to 80% after 8 months. It's important to remember that even a reduction of 75% indicates that 25% of the hair regrew after treatment. Medical use IPL was first developed for vascular conditions. It is at least as effective as pulsed dye lasers and can penetrate deeper with reduced risk of purpura and hyperpigmentation. IPL can also be used for the treatment of dry eye conditions such as meibomian gland dysfunction. IPL can treat pigmented lesions with rapid recovery. Dyschromia can be cleared after repeated sessions. Photoaging treatment has been explored. A series of IPL can be used for facial rejuvenation, improving skin laxity and collagen production. IPL combined with facial injections can be used for dynamic rhytids. Home IPL devices have been developed. BBL (Broadband Light), developed by US-based Sciton. is an advanced version of the IPL technology in light therapy that is noted to have set a higher standard for treating skin conditions associated with ageing, pigmentation irregularities and the removal of hair follicles. IPL is employed in the treatment of a range of dermatological conditions including photodamage induced dyspigmentation and vascular changes, poikiloderma of Civatte, rosacea, acne vulgaris, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, broken capillaries/telangiectases, vascular lesions (small blood vessels), pigmented lesions (freckles, liver spots, birth marks ), melasma, actinic keratosis, photorejuvenation, basal cell carcinoma, and Bowen's disease (squamous cell carcinoma).

Wilson was behind some of Manchester's most successful bands. He was one of the five co-founders of Factory Records and the founder and manager of the Ha√ßienda nightclub. Wilson was known as \\"Mr Manchester\\", dubbed as such for his work in promoting the culture of Manchester throughout his career. He was portrayed by Steve Coogan in Michael Winterbottom's film 24 Hour Party People (2002), and by Craig Parkinson in Anton Corbijn's film Control (2007). Depending on what he was working on, he would switch between alternate versions of his name. For example, when he was being a serious formal and respectable persona, such as certain TV presenting appearances, he would use \\"Anthony H Wilson\\", or for example when reporting for Granada Reports he was referred to as \\"Anthony Wilson\\", otherwise he would go by \\"Tony Wilson\\" most commonly while on Factory Records business. Early life Wilson was born 20 February 1950 in Hope Hospital in the Hope area of Pendleton, Salford, Lancashire, to Sydney Wilson and Doris Knupfer, and moved to Marple, near Stockport in Cheshire, at the age of five. His maternal grandfather was a Jewish German immigrant. After passing his Eleven plus exam, Wilson attended De La Salle Grammar School in Weaste Lane, Pendleton, Salford. He developed a love of literature and language, ignited by a performance of Hamlet at Stratford upon Avon. Wilson started his professional career in 1968 at the age of 17, working as an English and Drama teacher at Blue Coat School in Oldham. He later graduated with a degree in English from Jesus College, Cambridge. Broadcasting career After Dark in 2003. After his graduation in 1971, Wilson began as a trainee news reporter for ITN, before moving to Manchester in 1973, where he secured a post at Granada Television. He presented Granada's culture, music and events programme, So It Goes. Through the 1970s and 1980s he was one of the main anchors on Granada Reports, a regional evening news programme, where he worked with Judy Finnigan and Richard Madeley among others. He continued in this line of work even at the height of his success in the music industry. He reported for ITV's current affairs series, World in Action in the early 1980s and hosted some editions of After Dark, the UK's first open-ended, late night chat show, in which he chaired live discussions in a darkened studio, first on Channel 4 and later BBC Four. In 1988, Wilson hosted The Other Side of Midnight, another Granada weekly regional culture slot, covering music, literature and the arts in general. Wilson co-presented the BBC's coverage of The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium with Lisa I'Anson in 1992. He hosted the short-lived TV quiz shows Topranko! and MTV Europe's Remote Control in the 1990s, as well as the Manchester United themed quiz, Masterfan, for MUTV. In 2006 he became the regional political presenter for the BBC's The Politics Show. He presented a weekly radio show on Xfm Manchester ‚Äì Sunday Roast ‚Äì and a show on BBC Radio Manchester. In October he joined Blur bassist Alex James, Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq and previously unknown presenter Emily Rose to host the 21st century version of the 1980s music programme, The Tube, for Channel 4 Radio which ran until 2 March 2007. His final music TV show was filmed in December 2006 for Manchester's Channel M. Only one episode, entitled \\"The New Friday\\", was recorded before Wilson became ill. Music career Wilson's involvement in popular music stemmed from hosting Granada's culture and music programme So It Goes. Wilson, who intensely disliked the music scene of the mid-1970s which was dominated by such genres as progressive rock and arena rock, saw the Sex Pistols at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall, in June 1976, an experience which he described as \\"nothing short of an epiphany\\". He booked them for the last episode of the first series, probably the first television showing of their revolutionary British strand of punk rock. He was the manager of many bands, including A Certain Ratio and the Durutti Column, and was part owner and manager of Factory Records, home of Happy Mondays, Joy Division and New Order ‚Äì the band managed by friend and business partner Rob Gretton. He also founded and managed the Ha√ßienda nightclub and Dry Bar, together forming a central part of the music and cultural scene of Manchester. The scene was termed \\"Madchester\\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He made little money from Factory Records or the Ha√ßienda, despite the enormous popularity and cultural significance of both endeavours.About.com Music Careers: Tony Wilson Retrieved on 9 August 2008 Both Factory Records and the Ha√ßienda came to an abrupt end in the late 1990s. In 2000, Wilson and his business partners launched an early online music store, Music33. A semi-fictionalised version of his life and of the surrounding era was made into the film, 24 Hour Party People (2002), which stars Steve Coogan as Wilson. After the film was produced, Wilson wrote a novelisation based on the screenplay. He played a minor role (playing himself) in the film, A Cock and Bull Story (2005), in which his character interviews Steve Coogan. Wilson also co-produced the Ian Curtis biopic, Control (2007), being portrayed on this occasion by Craig Parkinson. He died a few months before its release. Wilson was a partner in the annual 'In the City' and 'Interactive City' music festivals and industry conferences, and also F4 Records, the fourth version of Factory Records, which was set up to be an online distributor for Wilson's long term prot√©g√© Vini Reilly, of the Durutti Column. Politics Wilson identified himself as a socialist and refused to pay for private healthcare on principle. Wilson was also an outspoken supporter of regionalism. Along with others including Ruth Turner, he started a campaign for North West England to be allowed a referendum on the creation of a regional assembly, called the \\"Necessary Group\\"Liverpool Links: Business Retrieved on 9 August 2008 after a line in the United States Declaration of Independence. Although his campaign was successful, with the British government announcing that a vote would take place, this was later abandoned when North East England voted against the introduction of a regional tier of government. Wilson later spoke at several political events on this subject. He was also known for using Situationist ideas.About.com: Factory Records Profile Retrieved on 9 August 2008 Wilson's goal of a strong regional political settlement was eventually achieved in 2017, ten years after his death, with the election of a \\"Metro Mayor\\" for Greater Manchester and an equivalent for Merseyside. Relationships Wilson was married twice, first to Lindsay Reade and then to Hilary, with whom he had a son, Oliver, and a daughter, Isabel. In 1990 he started a relationship with Yvette Livesey, a former Miss England and Miss UK, who was his girlfriend until his death in 2007. Livesey has since co- operated with a biography of Wilson's life, called You're Entitled to an Opinion ..., written by David Nolan and published in 2009. Illness After Wilson developed renal cancer and had one kidney removed in 2007, doctors recommended he take the drug Sutent. Manchester Primary Care NHS Trust refused to fund the ¬£3,500 per month cost of providing the drug, while patients being treated alongside him at the Christie Hospital and living just a few miles away in Cheshire did receive funding for the medication. A number of Wilson's music industry friends, including former Happy Mondays manager Nathan McGough, their current manager Elliot Rashman and TV stars Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan, formed a fund to help pay for Wilson's medical treatment. Wilson said: \\"This [Sutent] is my only real option. It is not a cure but can hold the cancer back, so I will probably be on it until I die. When they said I would have to pay ¬£3,500 for the drugs each month, I thought where am I going to find the money? I'm the one person in this industry who famously has never made any money. I used to say 'some people make money and some make history', which is very funny until you find you can't afford to keep yourself alive. I've never paid for private healthcare because I'm a socialist. Now I find you can get tummy tucks and cosmetic surgery on the NHS but not the drugs I need to stay alive. It is a scandal.\\" Death and legacy Peter Saville and Ben Kelly. In early 2007, emergency surgery was performed to remove one of his kidneys. This forced the postponement of plans to create a Southern Hemisphere version of the In the City festival. Despite the surgery, the cancer progressed and a course of chemotherapy was ineffective. Wilson died of a heart attack in Manchester's Christie Hospital on 10 August 2007 aged 57. Following the news of his death, the Union Flag on Manchester Town Hall was lowered to half mast as a mark of respect. Probate documents reveal his estate was valued at ¬£484,747 after tax. That figure includes the value of his city centre flat on Little Peter Street. The will, signed by Wilson on 4 July 2007, gave Yvette Livesey, 39, his girlfriend of 17 years, the proceeds from their home. He also left her his share of six businesses. His son Oliver and daughter Isabel shared the rest of his estate. His funeral was at St Mary's RC Church, Mulberry Street, Manchester (The Hidden Gem) on 20 August 2007. Among the music Wilson chose Happy Mondays‚Äô \\"Bob‚Äôs Yer Uncle\\".Observer review of Shaun Ryler's book \\"Wrote For Luck\\", 3 March 2019 As with everything else in the Factory empire, Tony Wilson's coffin was also given a Factory catalogue number: FAC 501. He is buried at Southern Cemetery in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. His black granite headstone, erected in October 2010, was designed by Peter Saville and Ben Kelly and features a quotation, chosen by Wilson's family, from Mrs G Linnaeus Banks's 1876 novel The Manchester Man, set in Rotis serif font. The quotation reads: \\"Mutability is the epitaph of worlds/ Change alone is changeless/ People drop out of the history of a life as of a land though their work or their influence remains.\\" The main square of the HOME/First Street development in Manchester, which opened in 2015, is named Tony Wilson Place.

Immunity involves both specific and nonspecific components. The nonspecific components act as barriers or eliminators of a wide range of pathogens irrespective of their antigenic make-up. Other components of the immune system adapt themselves to each new disease encountered and can generate pathogen-specific immunity. Immunity can be defined as a complex biological system endowed with the capacity to recognize and tolerate whatever belongs to the self, and to recognize and reject what is foreign (non-self).  Innate and adaptive  Scheme of a Fc receptor The immune system has two components: innate and adaptive immunity. The innate immunity is present in all metazoans, while the adaptive immunity only occurs in vertebrates. The innate system relies on the recognition of certain foreign molecules to stimulate two types of innate immune responses: inflammatory responses and phagocytosis.Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 4th edition. New York: Garland Science; 2002. Innate Immunity. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26846/ The adaptive system, on the other hand, is composed of more advanced lymphatic cells that are programmed to distinguish between specific \\"non-self\\" substances in the presence of \\"self\\". The reaction to foreign substances is etymologically described as inflammation, meaning to set on fire. The non- reaction to self substances is described as immunity - meaning to exempt. These two components of the immune system create a dynamic biological environment where \\"health\\" can be seen as a physical state where the self is immunologically spared, and what is foreign is inflammatorily and immunologically eliminated. \\"Disease\\" can arise when what is foreign cannot be eliminated or what is self is not spared. Innate immunity, also known as native immunity, is a semi-specific and widely distributed form of immunity. It is defined as the first line of defense against pathogens, representing a critical systemic response to prevent infection and maintain homeostasis, contributing to the activation of an adaptive immune response. It does not adapt to specific external stimulus or a prior infection, but relies on genetically encoded recognition of particular patterns. Adaptive or acquired immunity is the active component of the host immune response, mediated by antigen-specific lymphocytes. Unlike the innate immunity, the acquired immunity is highly specific to a particular pathogen, including the development of immunological memory.Janeway CA Jr, Travers P, Walport M, et al. Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 5th edition. New York: Garland Science; 2001. Glossary. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10759/ Like the innate system, the acquired system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components. Adaptive immunity can be acquired during either 'naturally' (by infection) or 'artificially' (through deliberate actions such as vaccination). Adaptive immunity can also be classified as 'active' or 'passive'. Active immunity is acquired through the exposure to a pathogen, which triggers the production of antibodies by the immune system. Passive immunity is acquired through the transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells derived from an immune host either artificially or through the placenta; it is short-lived, requiring booster doses for continued immunity. The diagram below summarizes these divisions of immunity. Adaptive immunity recognizes more diverse patterns. Unlike innate immunity it is associated with memory of the pathogen. 600x300px History of theories A representation of the cholera epidemic of the nineteenth century. The concept of immunity has intrigued mankind for thousands of years. The prehistoric view of disease was that supernatural forces caused it, and that illness was a form of theurgic punishment for \\"bad deeds\\" or \\"evil thoughts\\" visited upon the soul by the gods or by one's enemies. Between the time of Hippocrates and the 19th century, when the foundations of the scientific methods were laid, diseases were attributed to an alteration or imbalance in one of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile or black bile). Also popular during this time before learning that communicable diseases came from germs/microbes was the miasma theory, which held that diseases such as cholera or the Black Plague were caused by a miasma, a noxious form of \\"bad air\\". If someone were exposed to the miasma in a swamp, in evening air, or breathing air in a sickroom or hospital ward, they could get a disease. The modern word \\"immunity\\" derives from the Latin immunis, meaning exemption from military service, tax payments or other public services. The first written descriptions of the concept of immunity may have been made by the Athenian Thucydides who, in 430 BC, described that when the plague hit Athens: \\"the sick and the dying were tended by the pitying care of those who had recovered, because they knew the course of the disease and were themselves free from apprehensions. For no one was ever attacked a second time, or not with a fatal result\\". The term \\"immunes\\", is also found in the epic poem \\"Pharsalia\\" written around 60 B.C. by the poet Marcus Annaeus Lucanus to describe a North African tribe's resistance to snake venom. The first clinical description of immunity which arose from a specific disease-causing organism is probably A Treatise on Smallpox and Measles (\\"Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah, translated 1848A \\"al-Razi\\". 2003 The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press (from Answers.com, 2006.)) written by the Islamic physician Al-Razi in the 9th century. In the treatise, Al Razi describes the clinical presentation of smallpox and measles and goes on to indicate that exposure to these specific agents confers lasting immunity (although he does not use this term). The first scientist who developed a full theory of immunity was Ilya Mechnikov after he revealed phagocytosis in 1882. With Louis Pasteur's germ theory of disease, the fledgling science of immunology began to explain how bacteria caused disease, and how, following infection, the human body gained the ability to resist further infections. Louis Pasteur in his laboratory, 1885 by Albert Edelfelt The birth of active immunotherapy may have begun with Mithridates VI of Pontus (120-63 B.C.). To induce active immunity for snake venom, he recommended using a method similar to modern toxoid serum therapy, by drinking the blood of animals which fed on venomous snakes. He is thought to have assumed that those animals acquired some detoxifying property, so that their blood would contain transformed components of the snake venom that could induce resistance to it instead of exerting a toxic effect. Mithridates reasoned that, by drinking the blood of these animals, he could acquire a similar resistance. Fearing assassination by poison, he took daily sub-lethal doses of venom to build tolerance. He is also said to have sought to create a 'universal antidote' to protect him from all poisons. For nearly 2000 years, poisons were thought to be the proximate cause of disease, and a complicated mixture of ingredients, called Mithridate, was used to cure poisoning during the Renaissance. An updated version of this cure, Theriacum Andromachi, was used well into the 19th century. In 1888 Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin isolated diphtheria toxin, and following the 1890 discovery by Behring and Kitasato of antitoxin based immunity to diphtheria and tetanus, the antitoxin became the first major success of modern therapeutic Immunology. In Europe, the induction of active immunity emerged in an attempt to contain smallpox. Immunization, however, had existed in various forms for at least a thousand years. The earliest use of immunization is unknown, however, around 1000 A.D. the Chinese began practicing a form of immunization by drying and inhaling powders derived from the crusts of smallpox lesions. Around the fifteenth century in India, the Ottoman Empire, and east Africa, the practice of inoculation (poking the skin with powdered material derived from smallpox crusts) became quite common. This practice was first introduced into the west in 1721 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. In 1798, Edward Jenner introduced the far safer method of deliberate infection with cowpox virus, (smallpox vaccine), which caused a mild infection that also induced immunity to smallpox. By 1800 the procedure was referred to as vaccination. To avoid confusion, smallpox inoculation was increasingly referred to as variolation, and it became common practice to use this term without regard for chronology. The success and general acceptance of Jenner's procedure would later drive the general nature of vaccination developed by Pasteur and others towards the end of the 19th century. In 1891, Pasteur widened the definition of vaccine in honour of Jenner and it then became essential to qualify the term, by referring to polio vaccine, measles vaccine etc.  Passive  Passive immunity is the transfer of immunity, in the form of ready-made antibodies, from one individual to another. Passive immunity can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the foetus through the placenta, and can also be induced artificially, when high levels of human (or horse) antibodies specific for a pathogen or toxin are transferred to non-immune individuals. Passive immunization is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or immunosuppressive diseases. Passive immunity provides immediate protection, but the body does not develop memory, therefore the patient is at risk of being infected by the same pathogen later.. = Naturally acquired = Maternal passive immunity is a type of naturally acquired passive immunity, and refers to antibody-mediated immunity conveyed to a fetus by its mother during pregnancy. Maternal antibodies (MatAb) are passed through the placenta to the fetus by an FcRn receptor on placental cells. This occurs around the third month of gestation. IgG is the only antibody isotype that can pass through the placenta. Passive immunity is also provided through the transfer of IgA antibodies found in breast milk that are transferred to the gut of the infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its antibodies. Colostrum present in mothers milk is an example of passive immunity. One of the first bottles of diphtheria antitoxin produced (Dated 1895). = Artificially acquired = Artificially acquired passive immunity is a short- term immunization induced by the transfer of antibodies, which can be administered in several forms; as human or animal blood plasma, as pooled human immunoglobulin for intravenous (IVIG) or intramuscular (IG) use, and in the form of monoclonal antibodies (MAb). Passive transfer is used prophylactically in the case of immunodeficiency diseases, such as hypogammaglobulinemia. It is also used in the treatment of several types of acute infection, and to treat poisoning. Immunity derived from passive immunization lasts for only a short period of time, and there is also a potential risk for hypersensitivity reactions, and serum sickness, especially from gamma globulin of non-human origin. The artificial induction of passive immunity has been used for over a century to treat infectious disease, and before the advent of antibiotics, was often the only specific treatment for certain infections. Immunoglobulin therapy continued to be a first line therapy in the treatment of severe respiratory diseases until the 1930s, even after sulfonamide lot antibiotics were introduced. =Transfer of activated T-cells= Passive or \\"adoptive transfer\\" of cell-mediated immunity, is conferred by the transfer of \\"sensitized\\" or activated T-cells from one individual into another. It is rarely used in humans because it requires histocompatible (matched) donors, which are often difficult to find. In unmatched donors this type of transfer carries severe risks of graft versus host disease. It has, however, been used to treat certain diseases including some types of cancer and immunodeficiency. This type of transfer differs from a bone marrow transplant, in which (undifferentiated) hematopoietic stem cells are transferred.  Active  The time course of an immune response. Due to the formation of immunological memory, reinfection at later time points leads to a rapid increase in antibody production and effector T cell activity. These later infections can be mild or even unapparent. When B cells and T cells are activated by a pathogen, memory B-cells and T- cells develop, and the primary immune response results. Throughout the lifetime of an animal, these memory cells will \\"remember\\" each specific pathogen encountered, and can mount a strong secondary response if the pathogen is detected again. The primary and secondary responses were first described in 1921 by English immunologist Alexander Glenny although the mechanism involved was not discovered until later. This type of immunity is both active and adaptive because the body's immune system prepares itself for future challenges. Active immunity often involves both the cell-mediated and humoral aspects of immunity as well as input from the innate immune system. = Naturally acquired = Naturally acquired active immunity occurs when a person is exposed to a live pathogen and develops a primary immune response, which leads to immunological memory. This type of immunity is \\"natural\\" because deliberate exposure does not induce it. Many disorders of immune system function can affect the formation of active immunity such as immunodeficiency (both acquired and congenital forms) and immunosuppression. = Artificially acquired = Artificially acquired active immunity can be induced by a vaccine, a substance that contains antigen. A vaccine stimulates a primary response against the antigen without causing symptoms of the disease. Richard Dunning coined the term vaccination, a colleague of Edward Jenner, and adapted by Louis Pasteur for his pioneering work in vaccination. The method Pasteur used entailed treating the infectious agents for those diseases, so they lost the ability to cause serious disease. Pasteur adopted the name vaccine as a generic term in honor of Jenner's discovery, which Pasteur's work built upon.Poster from before the 1979 eradication of smallpox, promoting vaccination. In 1807, Bavaria became the first group to require that their military recruits be vaccinated against smallpox, as the spread of smallpox was linked to combat. Subsequently, the practice of vaccination would increase with the spread of war. There are four types of traditional vaccines: * Inactivated vaccines are composed of micro- organisms that have been killed with chemicals and/or heat and are no longer infectious. Examples are vaccines against flu, cholera, plague, and hepatitis A. Most vaccines of this type are likely to require booster shots. * Live, attenuated vaccines are composed of micro-organisms that have been cultivated under conditions which disable their ability to induce disease. These responses are more durable, however, they may require booster shots. Examples include yellow fever, measles, rubella, and mumps. * Toxoids are inactivated toxic compounds from micro-organisms in cases where these (rather than the micro-organism itself) cause illness, used prior to an encounter with the toxin of the micro-organism. Examples of toxoid-based vaccines include tetanus and diphtheria. * Subunit vaccines, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines are composed of small fragments or pieces from a pathogenic (disease- causing) organism. A characteristic example is the subunit vaccine against Hepatitis B virus. Two future vaccinations: * DNA vaccines: DNA vaccines are composed of DNA encoding protein antigens from the pathogen. These vaccines are inexpensive, relatively easy to make and generate a strong, long-term immunity. * Recombinant vector vaccines (platform-based vaccines): These vaccines are harmless live viruses that encode a one/or a few antigens from a pathogenic organism. They are used widely in veterinary medicine. Most vaccines are given by hypodermic or intramuscular injection as they are not absorbed reliably through the gut. Live attenuated polio and some typhoid and cholera vaccines are given orally in order to produce immunity based in the bowel.

It involves abnormal behavior during the sleep phase with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The major feature of RBD is loss of muscle atonia (i.e., the loss of paralysis) during otherwise intact REM sleep (during which paralysis is not only normal but necessary). REM sleep is the stage of sleep in which most vivid dreaming occurs. The loss of motor inhibition leads to a wide spectrum of behavioral release during sleep. This extends from simple limb twitches to more complex integrated movement. These behaviors can be violent in nature and in some cases will result in injury to either the individual or their bedmates. RBD is a very strong predictor of progression to a synucleinopathy (usually Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies). Melatonin is useful in the treatment of RBD. RBD was first described in 1986. Symptoms RBD is characterized by the dreamer acting out their dreams, with complex behaviors. These dreams often involve screaming, shouting, laughing, crying, arm flailing, kicking, punching, choking, and even jumping out of bed. The actions in an episode can result in injuries to oneself or one's bedmate. The sleeping person may be unaware of these movements. Dreams often involve violent or aggressive actions, and an attack theme like being chased by people or animals. Because violence in dreams is more likely to be recalled, this could be an artifact of recall bias or selection bias. The individual with RBD may not be aware of having it. In a normal sleep cycle, REM sleep may be experienced at intervals of between 90 minutes and two hours every night, which means RBD episodes may occur some four times a night. In a rare case, they may only happen once a week or once a month. Episodes occur more towards the morning hours because that is when REM sleep is more frequent. When awakened, people can usually recall the dream they were having, which will match the actions they were performing. As the first indication of an underlying neurodegenerative disorder, symptoms of RBD may begin years or decades before other the onset of another condition. Almost half of those with Parkinson's, at least 88% of those with multiple system atrophy, and about 80% of people with Lewy body dementia have RBD. RBD is a very strong predictor of progression to a synucleinopathy (for example, the Lewy body dementias). Original study here. On autopsy, up to 98% of individuals with polysomnography-confirmed RBD are found to have a synucleinopathy. Symptomatic RBD can also be associated with narcolepsy, Guillain Barre syndrome, limbic encephalitis, and Morvan's syndrome. Other symptoms found in patients with RBD are reduced motor abilities, posture and gait changes, mild cognitive impairment, alterations in the sense of smell, impairments in color vision, autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, constipation, urinary problems and sexual dysfunction), and depression. Causes Rapid eye movement behavior disorder occurs when there is a loss of normal voluntary muscle atonia during REM sleep resulting in motor behavior in response to dream content. It can be caused by adverse reactions to certain drugs or during drug withdrawal; however, it is most often associated with the elderly and in those with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, for example multiple system atrophy and the Lewy body dementias. The underlying cause of RBD is not well understood, but it is likely that RBD is an early symptom of synucleinopathy rather than a separate disorder. Brainstem circuits that control atonia during REM sleep may be damaged, including those in the pontomedullary brainstem. REM sleep circuits are located in caudal brainstem structures‚Äîthe same structures that are known to lead to be implicated in the synucleinopathies. Motor deficits like those seen in RBD are known to result from lesions in those circuits. Risk factors for developing RBD are a family history of acting out dreams, prior head injury, farming, exposure to pesticides, low education level, depression, and use of antidepressants. RBD has also been reported following cerebrovascular accident and neurinoma (tumor), indicating that damage to the brain stem area may precipitate RBD. RBD is usually chronic. However, it may be acute and sudden in onset if associated with drug treatment or withdrawal (particularly with alcohol withdrawal). Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenergic antagonists can induce or aggravate RBD symptoms and should be avoided in individuals with RBD. Diagnosis There are two ways to diagnose RBD: by documenting a history of complex, dream-enactment sleep behaviors, or by polysomnography recording of these behaviors along with REM sleep atonia loss. RBD may be established from clinical interview as well as several validated questionnaires, when sleep studies cannot be performed. Questionnaires such as the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ), the REM Sleep Behavior Questionnaires ‚Äì Hong-Kong (RBD-HK), the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Innsbruck REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Inventory are well-validated. Individuals with RBD may not be able to provide a history of dream enactment behavior, so bed partners are also consulted. The REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Single-Question Screen offers diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in the absence of polysomnography with one question: > \\"Have you ever been told, or suspected yourself, that you seem to 'act out > your dreams' while asleep (for example, punching, flailing your arms in the > air, making running movements, etc.)?\\" = Differential = Other conditions are similar to RBD in that individuals exhibit excessive sleep movement and potentially violent behavior. Such disorders include non-REM parasomnias (sleepwalking, sleep terrors), periodic limb movement disorder, severe obstructive sleep apnea, and disassociative disorders. Because of the similarities between the conditions, polysomnography plays an important role in confirming RBD diagnosis. =Classification= RBD is a parasomnia. It is categorized as either idiopathic or symptomatic. Idiopathic RBD is the term used when RBD is not associated with another ongoing neurological condition. When it results from an identifiable underlying etiology, RBD is referred to as symptomatic RBD (and considered a symptom of the underlying disorder). Up to almost 92% of patients with idiopathic RBD will go on to develop a neurodegenerative disorder. The disorders most strongly associated with RBD are the synucleinopathies, particularly Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and to a lesser extent, multiple system atrophy. The following diagnostic criteria for RBD are given by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3)American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2014). International classification of sleep disorders, 3rd edn. American Academy of Sleep Medicine, Darien, IL: # Repetition of vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors during sleep # Polysomnography (PSG) show that these behaviors occur during REM sleep # If documentation of these behaviors by PSG is not possible, they must at least be assumed to take place during REM sleep based on records of dream enactment # REM sleep without atonia (RWA) can be seen in polysomnographic recordings # Episodes cannot be explained by another mental disorder, sleep disorder, substance abuse or medication These ICSD criteria make sure that diagnosis of RBD can only be made with help of polysomnography.H√∂gl, B., & Stefani, A. (2017). REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD): Update on diagnosis and treatment. Somnologie : Schlafforschung und Schlafmedizin = Somnology : sleep research and sleep medicine, 21(Suppl 1), 1‚Äì8. doi:10.1007/s11818-016-0048-6 This method is not available everywhere and so a lot of questionnaires have been developed for the screening of RBD. However, these questionnaires only allow a preliminary diagnosis. Treatment RBD is treatable (even when the underlying synucleinopathies are not). Melatonin and clonazepam are the most frequently used, and are comparably effective, but melatonin offers a safer alternative, because clonazepam can produce undesirable side effects. Other medications and treatments are available, but have only anecdotal evidence. Medications that may worsen RBD and should be stopped if possible are tramadol, mirtazapine, antidepressants, and beta blockers. In addition to medication, it is wise to secure the sleeper's environment by removing potentially dangerous objects from the bedroom and either place a cushion around the bed or move the mattress to the floor for added protection against injuries. Some extreme sufferers sleep in a sleeping bag zipped up to their neck, and wear mittens so they can't unzip it until they awake in the morning. Patients are advised to maintain a normal sleep schedule, avoid sleep deprivation, and keep track of any sleepiness they may have. Treatment includes regulating neurologic symptoms and treating any other sleep disorders that might interfere with sleep. Sleep deprivation, alcohol, certain medications, and other sleep disorders can all increase RBD and should be avoided if possible. Prognosis Patients with RBD are at risk for sleep- related injury (SRI) : between 33% and 65% of RBD patients reported to have had sleep related injury to self or their partner.

REM sleep behavior disorder and degenerative dementia: an association likely reflecting Lewy body disease. Neurology. 51:363-70. doi:10.1212/wnl.51.2.363 Most people with RBD will convert to a synucleinopathy‚Äîusually Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies‚Äîwithin 4 to 9 years from diagnosis of RBD, and 11 to 16 years from onset of symptoms. For patients with degenerative dementia, symptoms of RBD and/or sleep related injuries can decline over time. Visuospatial and constructional impairments are also found in patient with idiopathic RBD who had no other neurological disorder.Ferini-Strambi, L., Di Gioia, M.

Neurology. 62:41-5. doi:10.1212/01.wnl.0000101726.69701.fa  Epidemiology  RBD prevalence as of 2017 is estimated to be 0.5‚Äì2% overall, and 5‚Äì13% of those aged 60 to 99. It is more common in males overall, but equally frequent among men and women below the age of 50. This may partially be due to a referral bias, as violent activity carried out by men is more likely to result in harm and injury and is more likely to be reported than injury to male bed partners by women, or it may reflect a true difference in prevalence as a result of genetic or androgenic factors. Typical onset is in the 50s or 60s. History In the 1960s and 1970s, Michel Jouvet described brain lesions in cats that led to loss of atonia in REM sleep. Carlos Schenck and Mark Mahowald and their team in Minnesota first described RBD in 1986. In animals RBD has also been diagnosed in animals; specifically dogs.

As he left Puerto Rico, he reputedly became the first European to sight the island on September 24, 1494, which was claimed for Spain. The name Mona derives from the Ta√≠no name √Åmona, bestowed by the natives in honor of the ruling Cacique or chief of the island. However, one amateur archaeologist (Rex Cauldwell) who has studied the Mona Island/Columbus sighting for over 14 years puts this in dispute with the following logic: \\"Mona island is to the southwest corner of PR. Columbus is in a bay on the northwest corner. He is to sail from there straight across to the north coast of Hispaniola. Why would he sail south to where he has already been and then sail north again to Hispaniola? This is illogical. Mona Island was probably picked by armchair historians because it is the only island in the passage between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola that is drawn on most maps. It is more logical that when Columbus left the northwest coast of Puerto Rico, the small island he saw had to be Desecheo‚Äîa famous diving destination not far off the northwest coast of PR. It was never considered by armchair authors because it is small, barren, and of no interest, it is not drawn on most maps.\\" In 1502, Fray Nicol√°s de Ovando was sent to Isla de la Mona to keep an eye, from a safe distance, on the native revolts occurring in Hispaniola. With a group of 2,000 Spanish settlers, Ovando was left in charge of creating a permanent settlement on the island. Due to its small size and location, the island proved inadequate to accommodate such a large settlement, and food became scarce as shipments from Hispaniola and Puerto Rico were received infrequently. Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, who accompanied Columbus on his first two voyages, became the first ruling governor of Puerto Rico.Vicente Ya√±ez Pinz√≥n was appointed as the first governor of Puerto Rico but he never arrived on the island In 1515, after some wrangling, Ferdinand II was able to reclaim the island from Diego Col√≥n, Viceroy of the Indies. By then, Isla de la Mona was an important point of trade between Spain and the rest of Latin America, as well as a rest stop for the crews of boats carrying slaves. With his possession of the island, King Ferdinand II gave the resident Ta√≠nos two options if they wished to continue living on the island: they could work by fishing, making hammocks and cultivating plants, or they could become miners and help in the mining of guano and other minerals. Realizing that mining would require intense labor, the majority of inhabitants chose to work as fishermen and farmers. By accepting this option, they also were exempted from paying imposed taxes, and were able to avoid the hard labor many other natives endured in mines. In time, natives from other neighboring islands were brought to Mona Island to assist with labor. After the death of Ferdinand II in 1516, ownership of the island was transferred to Cardenal Cisneros. The island changed ownership again in 1520, when Francisco de Barrionuevo became the island's new landlord. By 1524, Alonso Manso, bishop of Puerto Rico, had become interested in gaining personal wealth, and he accused Barrionuevo, among others, of various crimes under the Spanish justice system of the time. Because of this situation, Barrionuevo exiled himself to one of Spain's colonies in South America, taking many Ta√≠nos along with him, and leaving the island practically deserted. By 1522, ships from other major sea powers such as England, France, and the Netherlands began to arrive at Isla de la Mona to replenish supplies for their transatlantic voyages. The island also provided them and pirates with a refuge from which they could attack and plunder Spanish galleons. In 1561, during an audience held in Santo Domingo, it was recommended that Isla de la Mona should become a part of that colony (which at the time occupied the entirety of Hispaniola). The reasons offered were simply that the island was closer to Santo Domingo (presently the Dominican Republic) than to Puerto Rico, and that it had a small population which could help the colony's economy in overall agricultural production. However, the petition was turned down and the island continued to remain politically part of Puerto Rico. In 1583, the Spanish archbishop of Puerto Rico received royal permission to bring Christianity to Mona Island. However, by this time most Ta√≠nos remaining on the island had either died or fled to mainland Puerto Rico due to repeated raiding by European (especially French) ships. From the end of the 16th century up until the mid-19th century the island was largely abandoned by the colonial authorities. It seems to have been sporadically inhabited, although records from this period are somewhat sketchy. It continued to be used as a refuge by pirates and privateers, including the notorious Captain Kidd who hid out there in 1699.Hunters Flock To Puerto Rico's Remote And Rugged Mona Island, Puerto Rico Herald, June 18, 2003 The island's circumstances changed in the mid-19th century when it became the site of commercial guano mining operations. Various companies were granted licenses to extract the bat and seagull guano (a valuable fertilizer and key strategic commodity for the production of gunpowder) from the island's caves. Mining continued until 1927.\\"History of the guano mining industry, Isla de Mona, Puerto Rico\\", Edward F.

The population of Mona Isla then was 6. Within two years of occupation, the Mona Island Light, left in an unfinished state since the beginning of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, was completed and began operation. The lighthouse was not, as commonly believed, designed by Gustave Eiffel, but by the Spanish engineer Rafael Ravena in 1886. It was accessible by the Mona Island Tramway from the beach and remained in continuous operation until 1976 when it was replaced by a newer automated light near the centre of the island.Kraig Anderson: Isla de Mona Lighthouse. Retrieved on 25 August 2018. On December 22, 1919, the island was declared an \\"Insular Forest of Puerto Rico\\", under the auspices of the U.S. Forest Law #22. During Prohibition the island had a history of smuggling, with its geographic location making it a prime location for rum runners to smuggle rum, bourbon, and other liquor. In 1923, a stash of liquor, drugs, and perfumes, reportedly from the French islands of Martinique and Saint Martin and worth US$75,000, was found in a cave by customs officials. In 1942, at the height of World War II, a German submarine bombarded the southern coast of the island.Battle of the Caribbean This was one of the few incidents of that war in the Caribbean. On June 4, 1942, the oil tanker MV C.O. Stillman was sunk by the German submarine southwest of Isla de Mona. From 1945 to 1955 Mona Island was leased to the U.S. Air Force as a military exercise area. Since 1941 the island has also been used for camping and hunting goats and wild boar. In 1960 a small ranger post was established to monitor the island, operated by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. In July 1972 the Environmental Quality Board of Puerto Rico, because of growing interest in the development of the islands, made a full scientific assessment of Mona and Monita using a local team of volunteer scientists. A two-volume report with maps of natural and historic features was produced.Mona and Monito Islands an Assessment of their Natural and Historical Resources, assessment team directed by Frank H. Wadsworth, maps by John J. Whelan It evaluated the climate, geology and mineral resources, soils, water resources, archaeology, vegetation, animals and insects, and pelagic life around the island. Shortly thereafter geotechnical and bathymetry studies were conducted by engineering firms to determine the feasibility of using Mona as a deepwater terminal for transferring oil from supertankers to smaller tankers which would continue to the mainland US; this plan was never implemented. In 1981, the Mona Island Lighthouse was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as \\"Faro de la Isla de la Mona\\". On February 15, 1985, the passenger-cargo ferry ran aground on a reef on the southeastern side of Mona Island. While there were no deaths nor serious injuries, 143 passengers and 72 crew members landed on Mona Island to await rescue. The wreck of the ship was removed from the reef in 1990. In 1993, the island (perhaps all of it), as \\"Isla de la Mona\\", was listed on the National Register. Geography Mona has an area of about and lies west of the main island of Puerto Rico, east of the Dominican Republic, and southwest of Desecheo Island, another island in the Mona Passage. Mona has been designated an ecological reserve by the Puerto Rican government and is not permanently inhabited. The US census of 2000 reports six housing units, but a population of zero. The island is a ward (barrio) of the municipality of Mayag√ºez, together with Monito Island 3.1 mi (5 km) northwest (Isla de Mona e Islote Monito barrio). This is the largest ward of Mayag√ºez by area, and the only one without permanent population. The total land area of both islands in the barrio is about 21.98 square miles (56.93 km¬≤) (Mona Island 21.924 square miles [56.783 km¬≤] and nearby Monito Island 0.057 square miles [0.147 km¬≤]), and it comprises 28.3 percent of the total land area of the municipality of Mayag√ºez. Desecheo Island, 30 mi (49 km) to the northeast, is part of Sabanetas barrio. Mona is a mainly flat plateau surrounded by sea cliffs. It is composed of dolomite and limestone with many caves found throughout. With an arid climate and untouched by human development, many endemic species inhabit the island, such as the Mona ground iguana (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). Its topography, ecology, and modern history are similar to that of Navassa Island, a small limestone island located in the Jamaica Channel, between Jamaica and Haiti. =Land cover= Four types of land cover can be identified:Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales website (Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources; in Spanish) * Cactus (4.35 square miles) (11.27 km¬≤) * Highland Forest (15.55 square miles) (40.28 km¬≤) * Central Depression Forest (0.57 square miles) (1.47 km¬≤) * Coastal Forest (1.46 square miles) (3.77 km¬≤) =Beaches= Mona Island hosts a large and increasing hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) rookery with over 1,500 clutches laid annually on its beaches.

Hunting is permitted in season in order to control the population growth of non-indigenous species (goats, pigs and wild cats) because they can represent a threat to various endangered species. The hunting season usually commences in December and ends in April. Camping is allowed from May through November. In recent years, the island has become a major drop-off point especially for Dominicans, as well as Haitians and Cubans trying to reach Puerto Rico illegally.

Some haciendas were plantations, mines or factories. Many haciendas combined these activities. The word is derived from the Spanish word \\"hacer\\" or \\"haciendo\\", which means: to make or be making, respectively; and were largely business enterprises consisting of various money making ventures including raising farm animals and maintaining orchards. The term hacienda is imprecise, but usually refers to landed estates of significant size. Smaller holdings were termed estancias or ranchos that were owned almost exclusively by Spaniards and criollos and in rare cases by mixed-race individuals.Ida Altman, et al., The Early History of Greater Mexico, Pearson, 2003, p. 164. In Argentina, the term estancia is used for large estates that in Mexico would be termed haciendas. In recent decades, the term has been used in the United States to refer to an architectural style associated with the earlier estate manor houses. The hacienda system of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Mexico, New Granada, and Peru was a system of large land holdings. A similar system existed on a smaller scale in the Philippines and Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, haciendas were larger than estancias, ordinarily grew either sugar cane, coffee, or cotton, and exported their crops outside Puerto Rico. Origins and growth Hacienda of Xcanchakan Wheat mill and theatre of Vicente Gallardo; Hacienda Atequiza, Jalisco, Mexico, 1886. Haciendas originated in the Spanish colonization of the Americas as conquests followed a similar pattern in many places. As the Spanish established cities in the middle of conquered territories smaller plots of land were distributed in nearby while far-away areas were granted as large landholdings to conquistadores becoming haciendas and estancias.Villalobos et al. 1974, p. 87. Distribution of land happened in parallel to the distribution of indigenous people who entered servitude.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 109‚Äì113. New haciendas were formed in many places in the 17th and 18th century as most local economies moved away from mining and into agriculture and husbandry.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 160‚Äì165. Haciendas were developed as profit-making, economic enterprises linked to regional or international markets. Although the hacienda is not directly linked to the early grants of indigenous American labor, the encomienda, many Spanish holders of encomiendas did acquire land or develop enterprises where they had access to that forced labor. Even though the private landed estates that constituted most haciendas did not have a direct tie to the encomienda, they are nonetheless linked. Encomenderos were in a position to retain their prominence economically via the hacienda. Since the encomienda was a grant from the crown, holders were dependent on the crown for its continuation. As the crown moved to eliminate the encomienda with its labor supply, Spaniards consolidated private landholdings and recruited free labor on a permanent or casual basis. The long term trend then was the creation of the hacienda as secure private property, which survived the colonial period and into the 20th century. Estates were integrated into a market-based economy aimed at the Hispanic sector and cultivated crops such as sugar, wheat, fruits and vegetables and produced animal products such as meat, wool, leather, and tallow.James Lockhart, \\"Encomienda and Hacienda: The Evolution of the Great Estate in the Spanish Indies,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review, 1969, 59: 411-29,James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, Early Latin America: A History of Colonial Spanish America and Brazil, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 134‚Äì142. Haciendas originated in Spanish land grants, made to many conquistadors and crown officials, but many ordinary Spaniards could also petition for land grants from the crown. The system in Mexico is considered to have started when the Spanish Crown granted to Hern√°n Cort√©s the title of Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca in 1529. It gave him a tract of land that included all of the present state of Morelos. Cort√©s was also granted encomiendas that gave him access to a vast pool of indigenous labor. Personnel In Spanish America, the owner of an hacienda was called the hacendado or patr√≥n. Most owners of large and profitable haciendas preferred to live in Spanish cities, often near the hacienda, but in Mexico, the richest owners lived in Mexico City, visiting their haciendas at intervals.Ricardo Rend√≥n Garcini, Daily Life on the Haciendas of Mexico, Banamex-Accova;S/A/ de C.V., Mexico: 1998, p. 31. Onsite management of the rural estates was by a paid administrator or manager, which was similar to the arrangement with the encomienda. Administrators were often hired for a fixed term of employment, receiving a salary and at times some share of the profits of the estate. Some administrators also acquired landholdings themselves in the area of the estate they were managing.Altman et al. (2003), The Early History of Greater Mexico, pp. 165‚Äì66. The work force on haciendas varied, depending on the type of hacienda and where it was located. In central Mexico near indigenous communities and growing crops to supply urban markets, there was often a small, permanent workforce resident on the hacienda. Labor could be recruited from nearby indigenous communities on an as-needed basis, such as planting and harvest time. The permanent and temporary hacienda employees worked land that belonged to the patr√≥n and under the supervision of local labor bosses. In some places small scale cultivators or campesinos worked small holdings belonging to the hacendado, and owed a portion of their crops to him. In a number of places, the economy of the 18th century was largely a barter system, with little specie circulated on the hacienda. Jaral de Berrios, probably the most important Hacienda of colonial times. Its owner at one time was one of the largest landowners in the world. Located in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico Gardens of the Hacienda San Gabriel in Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico. Stock raising was central to ranching haciendas, the largest of which were in areas without dense indigenous populations, such as northern Mexico, but as indigenous populations declined in central areas, more land became available for grazing.Altman et al. (2003), The Early History of Greater Mexico, p. 163. Livestock were animals originally imported from Spain, including cattle, horses, sheep, and goats were part of the Columbian Exchange and produced significant ecological changes. Sheep in particular had a devastating impact on the environment due to overgrazing.Elinor G. K. Melville, A Plague of Sheep: Environmental Consequences of the Conquest of Mexico,\\" Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1997. Mounted ranch hands variously called vaqueros and gauchos (in the Southern Cone), among other terms worked for pastoral haciendas. Where the hacienda included working mines, as in Mexico, the patr√≥n might gain immense wealth. The unusually large and profitable Jesuit hacienda Santa Luc√≠a, near Mexico City, established in 1576 and lasting to the expulsion in 1767, has been reconstructed by Herman Konrad from archival sources. This reconstruction has revealed the nature and operation of the hacienda system in Mexico, its labor force, its systems of land tenure and its relationship to larger Hispanic society in Mexico. The Catholic Church and orders, especially the Jesuits, acquired vast hacienda holdings or preferentially loaned money to the hacendados. As the hacienda owners' mortgage holders, the Church's interests were connected with the landholding class. In the history of Mexico and other Latin American countries, the masses developed some hostility to the church; at times of gaining independence or during certain political movements, the people confiscated the church haciendas or restricted them. Haciendas in the Caribbean were developed primarily as sugar plantations, dependent on the labor of African slaves imported to the region, were staffed by slaves brought from Africa.African Aspects of the Puerto Rican Personality by (the late) Dr. Robert A. Martinez, Baruch College. (Archived from the original on 20 July 2007). Retrieved 13 July 2012.

Retrieved 20 November 2012. South American haciendas In South America, the hacienda remained after the collapse of the colonial system in the early 19th century when nations gained independence. In some places, such as Dominican Republic, with independence came efforts to break up the large plantation holdings into a myriad of small subsistence farmers' holdings, an agrarian revolution. In Argentina and elsewhere, a second, international, money-based economy developed independently of the haciendas, which sank into rural poverty. Palacio San Jos√©, Argentina; owned by Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, 19th century. In most of Latin America, the old holdings remained. In Mexico, the haciendas were abolished by law in 1917 during the revolution, but remnants of the system affect Mexico today. In rural areas, the wealthiest people typically affect the style of the old hacendados even though their wealth these days derives from more capitalistic enterprises. In Bolivia, haciendas were prevalent until the 1952 Revolution of V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro. He established an extensive program of land distribution as part of the Agrarian Reform. Likewise, Peru had haciendas until the Agrarian Reform (1969) of Juan Velasco Alvarado, who expropriated the land from the hacendados and redistributed it to the peasants. =Chile= The first haciendas of Chile formed during the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The Destruction of the Seven Cities following the battle of Curalaba (1598) meant for the Spanish the loss of both the main gold districts and the largest sources of indigenous labour.Salazar & Pinto 2002, p. 15. After those dramatic years the colony of Chile became concentrated in Central Chile which became increasingly populated, explored and economically exploited. Much land in Central Chile was cleared with fire during this period. On the contrary open fields in southern Chile were overgrown as indigenous populations declined due to diseases introduced by the Spanish and intermittent warfare.Otero 2006, p. 25. The loss of the cities meant Spanish settlements in Chile became increasingly ruralLorenzo 1986, p. 158. with the hacienda gaining importance in economic and social matters.Lorenzo 1986, p. 159. As Chilean mining activity declined in the 17th centuryVillalobos et al. 1974, p. 168. more haciendas were formed as the economy moved away from mining and into agriculture and husbandry. Beginning in the late 17th century Chilean haciendas begun to export wheat to Peru. While the immediate cause of this was Peru being struck by both an earthquake and a stem rust epidemic,Villalobos et al., 1974, pp. 155‚Äì160. Chilean soil and climatic conditions were better for cereal production than those of Peru and Chilean wheat was cheaper and of better quality than Peruvian wheat.Collier, Simon and Sater William F. 2004. A History of Chile: 1808-2002 Cambridge University Press. p. 10. Initially Chilean haciendas could not meet the wheat demand due to a labour shortage, so had to incorporate temporary workers in addition to the permanent staff. Another response by the latifundia to labour shortages was to act as merchants, buying wheat produced by independent farmers or from farmers that hired land. In the period 1700 to 1850, this second option was overall more lucrative.Gabriel Salazar. 2000. Labradores, Peones y Proletarios. pp. 40‚Äì41 It was primarily the haciendas of Central Chile, La Serena and Concepci√≥n that came to be involved in cereal export to Peru.

He is known for his work on robotics, artificial intelligence, and writings on the impact of technology. Moravec also is a futurist with many of his publications and predictions focusing on transhumanism. Moravec developed techniques in computer vision for determining the region of interest (ROI) in a scene.  Background  Moravec attended Loyola College in Montreal for two years and transferred to Acadia University, where he received his BSc in mathematics in 1969. He received his MSc in computer science in 1971 from the University of Western Ontario. He then earned a PhD from Stanford University in 1980 for a TV-equipped robot which was remote controlled by a large computer. The robot was able to negotiate cluttered obstacle courses. Another achievement in robotics was the discovery of new approaches for robot spatial representation such as 3D occupancy grids. He also developed the idea of bush robots. Moravec was a cofounder of Seegrid Corporationhttps://www.seegrid.com of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2003 which is a robotics company with one of its goals being to develop a fully autonomous robot capable of navigating its environment without human intervention. He is also somewhat known for his work on space tethers. A interview with Moravec on technical progress and artificial intelligence.  Publications  *1988 - Sensor Fusion in Certainty Grids for Mobile Robotshttp://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/676 appeared in AI Magazine.  Books  In his 1988 book Mind Children (), Moravec outlines Moore's law and predictions about the future of artificial life. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in this regard, in that the robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030-2040. In Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind (), published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence, generalizing Moore's law to technologies predating the integrated circuit, and extrapolating it to predict a coming \\"mind fire\\" of rapidly expanding superintelligence. Sir Arthur C. Clarke wrote about this book: \\"Robot is the most awesome work of controlled imagination I have ever encountered: Hans Moravec stretched my mind until it hit the stops.\\": Cover praise for Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind, by Sir Arthur C. Clarke, 1999 David Brin also praised the book: \\"Moravec blends hard scientific practicality with a prophet's far-seeing vision.\\": Cover praise for Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind, by Dr David Brin, 1999 On the other hand, the book was reviewed less favorably by Colin McGinn for the New York Times. McGinn wrote, \\"Moravec ‚Ä¶ writes bizarre, confused, incomprehensible things about consciousness as an abstraction, like number, and as a mere \\"interpretation\\" of brain activity.

Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 71 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. The musicologist Robert \\"Mack\\" McCormick opined that Hopkins is \\"the embodiment of the jazz-and-poetry spirit, representing its ancient form in the single creator whose words and music are one act\\". Life Hopkins was born in Centerville, Texas, and as a child was immersed in the sounds of the blues. He developed a deep appreciation for this music at the age of 8, when he met Blind Lemon Jefferson at a church picnic in Buffalo, Texas.[ Allmusic biography] That day, Hopkins felt the blues was \\"in him\\". He went on to learn from his older (distant) cousin, the country blues singer Alger \\"Texas\\" Alexander. (Hopkins had another cousin, the Texas electric blues guitarist Frankie Lee Sims, with whom he later recorded.) Hopkins began accompanying Jefferson on guitar at informal church gatherings. Jefferson reputedly never let anyone play with him except young Hopkins, and Hopkins learned much from Jefferson at these gatherings. In the mid-1930s, Hopkins was sent to Houston County Prison Farm; the offense for which he was imprisoned is unknown. In the late 1930s, he moved to Houston with Alexander in an unsuccessful attempt to break into the music scene there. By the early 1940s, he was back in Centerville, working as a farm hand. Hopkins took a second shot at Houston in 1946. While singing on Dowling Street in Houston's Third Ward (which would become his home base), he was discovered by Lola Anne Cullum of Aladdin Records, based in Los Angeles. She convinced Hopkins to travel to Los Angeles, where he accompanied the pianist Wilson Smith. The duo recorded twelve tracks in their first sessions in 1946. An Aladdin executive decided the pair needed more dynamism in their names and dubbed Hopkins \\"Lightnin'\\" and Wilson \\"Thunder\\". Gold Star promotional photograph, 1948 Hopkins recorded more sides for Aladdin in 1947. He returned to Houston and began recording for Gold Star Records. In the late 1940s and 1950s he rarely performed outside Texas, only occasionally traveling to the Midwest and the East for recording sessions and concert appearances. It has been estimated that he recorded between eight hundred and a thousand songs in his career. He performed regularly at nightclubs in and around Houston, particularly on Dowling Street, where he had been discovered by Aladdin. He recorded the hit records \\"T-Model Blues\\" and \\"Tim Moore's Farm\\" at SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston. By the mid- to late 1950s, his prodigious output of high-quality recordings had gained him a following among African Americans and blues aficionados. In 1959, the blues researcher Mack McCormick contacted Hopkins, hoping to bring him to the attention of a broader musical audience engaged in the folk revival. McCormack presented Hopkins to integrated audiences first in Houston and then in California. He made his debut at Carnegie Hall on October 14, 1960, alongside Joan Baez and Pete Seeger, performing the spiritual \\"Mary Don't You Weep\\". In 1960, he signed with Tradition Records. The recordings which followed included his song \\"Mojo Hand\\" in 1960. In 1968, Hopkins recorded the album Free Form Patterns, backed by the rhythm section of the psychedelic rock band 13th Floor Elevators. Through the 1960s and into the 1970s, he released one or sometimes two albums a year and toured, playing at major folk music festivals and at folk clubs and on college campuses in the U.S. and internationally. He toured extensively in the United States and played a six-city tour of Japan in 1978. Hopkins was Houston's poet-in-residence for 35 years. He recorded more albums than any other bluesman. Hopkins died of esophageal cancer in Houston on January 30, 1982, at the age of 69. His obituary in the New York Times described him as \\"one of the great country blues singers and perhaps the greatest single influence on rock guitar players.\\" His Gibson J-160e \\"hollowbox\\" is on display at the Rock Hall of Fame in Cleveland, and his Guild Starfire at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in DC, both on loan from the Joe Kessler collection. Musical style Hopkins's style was born from spending many hours playing informally without a backing band. His distinctive fingerstyle technique often included playing, in effect, bass, rhythm, lead, and percussion at the same time. He played both \\"alternating\\" and \\"monotonic\\" bass styles incorporating imaginative, often chromatic turnarounds and single-note lead lines. Tapping or slapping the body of his guitar added rhythmic accompaniment. Much of Hopkins's music follows the standard 12-bar blues template, but his phrasing was free and loose. Many of his songs were in the talking blues style, but he was a powerful and confident singer. Lyrically, his songs expressed the problems of life in the segregated South, bad luck in love and other subjects common in the blues idiom. He dealt with these subjects with humor and good nature. Many of his songs are filled with double entendres, and he was known for his humorous introductions to songs. Some of his songs were of warning and sour prediction, such as \\"Fast Life Woman\\": References in popular culture A statue of Hopkins sits in Crockett, Texas.Russell, pp. 145‚Äì146. Hopkins is mentioned in Erykah Badu's 2010 \\"Window Seat\\": \\"I don't want to time-travel no more, I want to be here. On this porch I'm rockin', back and forth like Lightnin' Hopkins.\\" R.E.M. included the song \\"Lightnin' Hopkins\\" on their 1987 album Document. Hopkins's song \\"Back to New Orleans (Baby Please Don't Go)\\" was performed by the fictional country singer Cherlene in the FX television comedy Archer (season 5, episode 1). Van Morrison and Them recorded the iconic rock version of this song in 1965. The hard rock bands AC/DC and Aerosmith also covered the song.

Such legal immunity may be from criminal prosecution, or from civil liability (being subject of lawsuit), or both. The most notable forms of legal immunity are diplomatic immunity, judicial immunity, and witness immunity. One author has described legal immunity as \\"the obverse of a legal power\\":Dudley Knowles, Political Obligation: A Critical Introduction (2009), p. 26. Criticism Legal immunities may be subject to criticism because they institute a separate standard of conduct for those who receive them. For example, as one author notes: Types =Immunity of government officials= Many forms of immunity are granted to government officials to enable them to carry out their functions without fear of being sued or charged with a crime for so doing: *Sovereign immunity, the prevention of lawsuits or prosecution against rulers or governments without their given consent **Sovereign immunity in the United States bars suit against federal, state, and tribal governments, which cannot be sued without their consent. Governmental consent to be sued is expressed through legislation as a limited waiver of sovereign immunity **Absolute immunity, a type of sovereign immunity for government officials that confers total immunity when acting in the course of their duties ***Judicial immunity, the absolute immunity of a judge or magistrate in the course of their official duties **Qualified immunity, in the United States, sovereign immunity of individuals performing tasks as part of the government's actions *Parliamentary immunity, immunity granted to elected officials during their tenure and in the course of their duties *Speech or Debate Clause, a provision in the United States Constitution that provides immunity to members of Congress for statements made in either house Grants of immunity are particularly important in intergovernmental relations, where traditions have arisen to prevent the diplomatic representatives of a country from being harassed by their host countries. *Diplomatic immunity, agreement between sovereign governments to exclude diplomats from local laws *Immunity from prosecution (international law), exclusion of governments or their officials from prosecution under international law *State immunity, principle of international law that the government of a state is not amenable before the courts of another state Such immunities may be granted by law (statutory or constitutional) or by treaty. =Immunity of individuals participating in the legal process= *Amnesty law, a law that provides immunity for past crimes *Spousal privilege, also called spousal immunity, protects a spouse from testifying against the defendant *Witness immunity, immunity granted to a witness in exchange for testimony *Reporter's privilege, a limited First Amendment right many jurisdictions by statutory law or judicial decision have by which journalists may not be prosecuted for protecting their confidential sources from discovery *Charitable immunity, immunity from liability granted to charities in many countries from the 19th century to the mid-20th century Such immunities may be granted by law or, for witness immunity, by prosecutors or other authorities on a case-by-case basis, commonly as an agreement with the witnesses.

From 1964 until his death he was Professor of Music at King's College London.  Early life  Dart was born on 3 September 1921 in Surbiton, then part of Surrey. His father, Henry Thurston Dart, married his mother, Elisabeth Martha (n√©e Orf) in 1915. Dart attended Hampton Grammar School and he sang in the choir at Hampton Court. Dart studied keyboard instruments at the Royal College of Music in London from 1938 to 1939, and then studied mathematics at University College, Exeter, being awarded his degree in 1942. He served as a Junior Scientific Officer and then as a statistician and researcher for the RAF Strategic Bombing Planning Unit under Air Vice Marshall Basil Embry from 1942 to 1945. Dart was injured in a plane crash in Calais in November 1944, and while convalescing from his injuries at a nursing home in Swanley, he first met Neville Marriner. After leaving the services, he studied for a year with Belgian musicologist Charles Van den Borren, returning to England in 1946 as research assistant to Henry Moule, a music lecturer at Cambridge University.  Musical career  In 1947 he was appointed assistant lecturer in music in the University of Cambridge, subsequently lecturer (1952) and professor (1962). During this time, Dart was the most effective British supporter of the modern early music revival, in part through his influence on those who ultimately formed such groups as the Early Music Consort of London. In 1964 he was appointed King Edward Professor of Music in the University of London (King's College). As a continuo player, Dart made numerous appearances on the harpsichord and made many harpsichord, clavichord and organ recordings, especially for the L'Oiseau-Lyre label; he was also a conductor. He served as editor of the Galpin Society Journal from 1947 to 1954 and secretary of Musica Britannica from 1950 to 1965. His book, The Interpretation of Music (London, 1954), was highly influential and is still widely read; he also wrote numerous seminal articles on aspects of musical sources, performance and interpretation.

Schil, Jack Boyce and Thurston Dart During the 1950s he participated in annual concerts featuring four harpsichordists, the three others being George Malcolm, Denis Vaughan and Eileen Joyce. In 1957 this group also recorded Bach's Concerto for Four Harpsichords, an arrangement after Vivaldi, with the Pro Arte Orchestra under Boris Ord. They also recorded Malcolm's Variations on a Theme of Mozart. Dart's distinguished students included the composer Michael Nyman, harpsichordist Davitt Moroney, conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner and conductor/musicologist Christopher Hogwood. He made one of the first historically informed recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos with the Philomusica of London. He later worked with Neville Marriner on a recording of both the Brandenburg Concerti and the four Orchestral suites though Dart died from stomach cancer on 6 March 1971 before this was complete.

A historian by education, Ardzinba led Abkhazia to de facto independence in the 1992‚Äì1993 War with Georgia, but its de jure independence from Georgia remained internationally unrecognised during Ardzinba's two terms as President from 1994 to 2005. A noted specialist in Hittitology, he was a member of the first parliament to be elected democratically in the Soviet Union in 1989. Early life and career Vladislav Ardzinba was born in the village of Lower Eshera, Sukhumi District, Abkhaz ASSR, Georgian SSR, Soviet Union. After graduating from the Historical Department of the Sukhumi Pedagogical Institute, Ardzinba studied at the Tbilisi State University where he received a doctoral degree. He then worked for eighteen years in Moscow specialising in ancient Middle Eastern civilizations under Yevgeniy Primakov, then head of the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, and later Russian foreign and Prime Minister. He then returned to Sukhumi and he served there as the director of the Abkhazian Institute of Language, Literature and History from 1987 until 1989, when he was elected a Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from Gudauta. From there, he was involved closely with national issues, including Abkhazia, and quickly emerged as one of the most active proponents of the Abkhaz secessionist cause. While a deputy to the USSR Supreme Soviet, Ardzinba forged close ties with the hardliners in Moscow, particularly with the parliamentary chairman Anatoly Lukyanov and other members of the hardline communist groups in Moscow that were responsible for the August 1991 coup attempt.Cornell, Svante E, Autonomy and Conflict: Ethnoterritoriality and Separatism in the South Caucasus ‚Äì Case in Georgia, pp. 168, 180, 182. Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Report No. 61. Uppsala. . Role in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict He was a member of the first parliament to be elected democratically in the Soviet Union in 1989. On 4 December 1990, Ardzinba was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Abkhazia. Ardzinba, a charismatic but excitable figure popular among the Abkhaz was believed by Georgians to have helped to instigate the violence of July 1989.Stuart J. Kaufman (2001), Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War, p. 117. Cornell University Press, . Ardzinba managed to consolidate his power relatively quickly and reneged on pre-election promises to increase the representation of Georgians in Abkhazia's autonomous structures; since then, Ardzinba tried to rule Abkhazia relatively single-handedly, but avoided, for the time being, overt conflict with the central authorities in Tbilisi. In mid-1991, he negotiated and accepted the Georgian concession on the reform of the electoral law that granted the Abkhaz wide over-representation in the Supreme Soviet. However, Ardzinba created the Abkhazian National Guard that was mono- ethnically Abkhaz, and initiated a practice of replacing ethnic Georgians in leading positions with Abkhaz. As the Georgian-Abkhaz tensions rose, Ardzinba's rhetoric mounted, as he claimed in late July 1992 that \\"Abkhazia is strong enough to fight Georgia.\\"Cornell, p. 180. In August 1992, a Georgian military force ousted Ardzinba and his group from Sukhumi when Abkhazian militants seized government buildings. They took shelter in Gudauta, a home to the Soviet-era Russian military base. Ardzinba benefited from his contacts with the Russian hardliner circles and military leaders to garner critical support in the war against the Georgian government.Cornell, p. 180 Presidency apsar commemorative coin minted in 2008 celebrating Vladislav Ardzinba After the hostilities ended in 1994 and the bulk of the Georgian population was forced out of Abkhazia, the Abkhazian parliament elected Ardzinba to the presidency, a move that was condemned by Georgia and the United Nations as illegal. He won the first direct polls on 3 October 1999, without an opponent and was re-elected as president of Abkhazia.The International Crisis Group. Abkhazia Today.

Tauris, . and remained politically untouchable until his health seriously deteriorated in 2003. He once stated that independence from Georgia is not negotiable, and he has tried to align the state with Russia, whose political and economic support was essential to the republic. As a leader of the Abkhaz side he met the two successive Russian presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, as well as a President of Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze. Under his rule, human rights records were extremely poor as most of the pre-war Georgian population of Abkhazia were deprived the right to return, and those who remained were subjected to systematic ethnic cleansing. Ardzinba aroused some further criticism from the international community after issuing a decree banning Jehovah's Witnesses in 1995. During the last years of his presidency Ardzinba faced criticism for both failing to bring stability to Abkhazia and his increasingly low public profile. He had not appeared in public since 2002. As a result, the role of governing the state had been increasingly left to Prime Minister Raul Khajimba. He had been in extremely poor health and underwent treatment in Moscow for some time. Despite increasing calls from the opposition (particularly the Amtsakhara movement) for him to resign he had stated that he would finish his term, which was supposed to end in October 2004, but in fact did not end until 12 February 2005, due to disputes over the election of his successor. There were also calls for him to be impeached. However, although the Abkhaz Constitution allows for impeachment, the process would likely have not been completed before the end of his term, so no serious steps were taken to bring it about. He was unable to run for a third term due to constitutional restrictions, and it is unlikely that his health would have enabled him to do so even if this was allowed. He was replaced by the winner of the presidential election of 12 January 2005, Sergei Bagapsh. A previous election had been held in late 2004 after the murder of opposition leader Garri Aiba, but the result was controversial. Death By 2010, Ardzinba's health was in decline and had been for some time. Ardzinba died on 4 March 2010, at the age of 64. He was in the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow at the time. He had been escorted there the previous week. The cause of death was not released to the public. He is survived by his wife and daughter. The President of Abkhazia, Sergei Bagapsh, paid tribute: \\"His service to the Abkhaz people was boundless\\". Three days of mourning were declared in Abkhazia in remembrance of Ardzinba.http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&sl;=ru&tl;=en&u;=http://www.natpress.net/stat.php%3Fid%3D5105&rurl;=translate.google.com&twu;=1&usg;=ALkJrhjeajqUnl8iXwwPFoL8pxehtZtGSg ‚Äì Translated from Russian to English by Google References External links *President of Abkhazia official site People from Sukhumi District Linguists from Abkhazia Abkhaz historians Hittitologists Presidents of Abkhazia 1945 births 2010 deaths Candidates in the 1994 Abkhazian presidential election Candidates in the 1999 Abkhazian presidential election Independence activists ","title":"Vladislav Ardzinba"},{"id":"298575","text":"\\"Nanhai Chao\\" (), or \\"Southern Sea Tides\\", is a Cantonese song of sung by Overseas Chinese of Cantonese origin.

Prior to this he commanded the Mounted Arkansas Infantry (also known as Mounted Arkansas Volunteers) following the death of Colonel Archibald Yell at the Battle of Buena Vista. Roane also served as a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded infantry in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. Early life and career John Selden Roane was born in Wilson County, Tennessee, and educated at Cumberland College, which at the time was located in Princeton, Kentucky. He migrated to the new state of Arkansas in 1837, studied law, and was admitted to the bar. He was Prosecuting Attorney for the 2nd Judicial District of Arkansas from 1840 to 1842, a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1842 to 1844, and the fourth Governor of Arkansas from 1849 to 1852. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War At the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Roane was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the Regiment of Arkansas Mounted Volunteers, succeeding to command when Colonel Archibald Yell was mortally wounded repelling the charge of the Mexican lancers at the Battle of Buena Vista. Roane was officially appointed Colonel on February 28, 1847. He was known to be jealous of the honor of his state and once challenged Albert Pike to a duel over what he perceived as derogatory statements made about the regiment's actions in the war. The duel was fought, but neither combatant was injured. American Civil War On March 20, 1862, Roane received a commission as brigadier-general in the Confederate States Army. After most troops were moved from Arkansas across the Mississippi River, he was placed in charge of the defense of Arkansas. At this time the state was nearly defenseless; and Roane, with the newly appointed commander of the Trans-Mississippi District Major-General Thomas Hindman, cobbled together a reasonable defensive force. His brigade took part in numerous battles in the Trans-Mississippi District, including the Battle of Whitney's Lane and then the Battle of Prairie Grove. Personal life On February 1, 1855, Roane married Mary Kim Smith (1833‚Äì1907) of Dallas, Arkansas.

Early life Titus Oates was born at Oakham in Rutland. His father Samuel (1610‚Äì1683), of a family of Norwich ribbon-weavers,Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, vol. 41, Nichols-O'Dugan, ed. Sidney Lee, Macmillan & Co., 1895, p. 296 was a graduate of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and became a minister who moved between the Church of England (sometime rector of Marsham, Norfolk)Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, vol. 41, Nichols-O'Dugan, ed. Sidney Lee, Macmillan & Co., 1895, p. 296 and the Baptists; he became a Baptist during the Puritan Revolution, rejoining the established church at the Restoration, and was rector of All Saints' Church at Hastings (1666‚Äì74). Oates was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and other schools. At Cambridge University, he entered Gonville and Caius College in 1667 but transferred to St John's College in 1669; he left later the same year without a degree. A less than astute student, he was regarded by his tutor as \\"a great dunce\\", although he did have a good memory. At Cambridge, he also gained a reputation for homosexuality and a \\"Canting Fanatical way\\". By falsely claiming to have a degree, he gained a licence to preach from the Bishop of London. On 29 May 1670 he was ordained as a priest of the Church of England. He was vicar of the parish of Bobbing in Kent, 1673‚Äì74, and then curate to his father at All Saints', Hastings. During this time Oates accused a schoolmaster in Hastings of sodomy with one of his pupils, hoping to get the schoolmaster's post. However, the charge was shown to be false and Oates himself was soon facing charges of perjury, but he escaped jail and fled to London. In 1675 he was appointed as a chaplain of the ship in the Royal Navy. Oates visited English Tangier with his ship, but was accused of buggery, which was a capital offence, and spared only because of his clerical status. He was dismissed from the Navy in 1676. In August 1676, Oates was arrested in London and returned to Hastings to face trial for his outstanding perjury charges, but he escaped a second time and returned to London. With the help of the actor Matthew MedburneMedburne was arrested under suspicion of involvement in the Popish Plot, he died in Newgate Prison in 1680. he joined the household of the Catholic Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk as an Anglican chaplain to those members of Howard's household who were Protestants. Although Oates was admired for his preaching, he soon lost this position. On Ash Wednesday in 1677 Oates was received into the Catholic Church. Oddly, at the same time he agreed to co-author a series of anti- Catholic pamphlets with Israel Tonge, whom he had met through his father Samuel, who had once more reverted to the Baptist doctrine.Alan Marshall, ‚ÄòTonge, Israel (1621‚Äì1680)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 He is described by John Dryden in Absalom and Achitophel (published 1681) thus‚Äî Contact with the Jesuits Oates was involved with the Jesuit houses of St Omer in France and the Royal English College at Valladolid in Spain. Oates was admitted to the training course for the priesthood in Valladolid through the support of Richard Strange, head of the English Province, despite a lack of basic competence in Latin. He later claimed, falsely, that he had become a Catholic Doctor of Divinity. His ignorance of Latin was quickly exposed, and his frequently blasphemous conversation and attacks on the British monarchy shocked both his teachers and the other students. Thomas Whitbread, the new Provincial, took a much firmer line with Oates than had Strange and, in June 1678, expelled him from St Omer. When he returned to London, he rekindled his friendship with Israel Tonge. Oates explained that he had pretended to become a Catholic to learn about the secrets of the Jesuits and that, before leaving, he had heard about a planned Jesuit meeting in London. Fabricating the Popish Plot Oates and Tonge wrote a lengthy manuscript that accused the Catholic Church authorities in England of approving the assassination of Charles II. The Jesuits were supposedly to carry out the task. In August 1678, King Charles was warned of this alleged plot against his life by the chemist Christopher Kirkby, and later by Tonge. Charles was unimpressed, but handed the matter over to one of his ministers, Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby; Danby was more willing to listen and was introduced to Oates by Tonge. Francis Barlow, c. 1679 The King's Privy Council questioned Oates. On 28 September, Oates made 43 allegations against various members of Catholic religious orders‚Äîincluding 541 Jesuits‚Äîand numerous Catholic nobles. He accused Sir George Wakeman, Queen Catherine of Braganza's doctor, and Edward Colman, the secretary to Mary of Modena, Duchess of York, of planning to assassinate Charles. Although Oates may have selected the names randomly, or with the help of the Earl of Danby, Colman was found to have corresponded with a French Jesuit, Father Ferrier, who was confessor to Louis XIV, which was enough to condemn him. Wakeman was later acquitted. Despite Oates' unsavoury reputation, his confident performance and superb memory made a surprisingly good impression on the Council. When he named \\"at a glance\\" the alleged authors of five letters supposedly written by leading Jesuits, the Council were \\"amazed\\". As Kenyon remarks, it is surprising that it did not occur to the Council that this was useless as evidence if Oates had written all the letters himself. Others whom Oates accused included Dr William Fogarty, Archbishop Peter Talbot of Dublin, Samuel Pepys MP, and John Belasyse, 1st Baron Belasyse. With the help of Danby, the list grew to 81 accusations. Oates was given a squad of soldiers and he began to round up Jesuits, including those who had helped him in the past. On 6 September 1678, Oates and Tonge had approached an Anglican magistrate, Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, and had sworn an affidavit before him detailing their accusations. On 12 October, Godfrey disappeared, and five days later his dead body was found in a ditch at Primrose Hill; he had been strangled and run through with his own sword. Oates subsequently exploited this incident to launch a public campaign against the \\"Papists\\" and alleged that the murder of Godfrey had been the work of the Jesuits. On 24 November 1678, Oates claimed the Queen was working with the King's physician to poison the King. Oates enlisted the aid of \\"Captain\\" William Bedloe, who was ready to say anything for money. The King personally interrogated Oates and caught him out in a number of inaccuracies and lies. In particular Oates unwisely claimed to have had an interview with the Regent of Spain, Don John, in Madrid: the King who had met Don John at Brussels during his Continental exile, pointed out that Oates' hopelessly inaccurate description of his appearance made it clear that he had never seen him. The King ordered his arrest. However, a few days later, with the threat of a constitutional crisis, Parliament forced the release of Oates, who soon received a state apartment in Whitehall and an annual allowance of ¬£1,200. Oates was heaped with praise. He asked the College of Arms to check his lineage and produce a coat of arms for him and subsequently received the arms of a family that had died out. Rumours surfaced that Oates was to be married to a daughter of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. After nearly three years and the execution of at least 15 innocent men, opinion began to turn against Oates. The last high-profile victim of the climate of suspicion was Oliver Plunkett, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, who was hanged, drawn and quartered on 1 July 1681. William Scroggs, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, began to declare more people innocent, as he had done in the Wakeman trial, and a backlash against Oates and his Whig supporters took place. Aftermath Engraving of a pilloried Titus Oates On 31 August 1681, Oates was told to leave his apartments in Whitehall, but he remained undeterred and even denounced the King and his Catholic brother, the Duke of York. He was arrested for sedition, sentenced to a fine of ¬£100,000 and imprisoned. When the Duke of York acceded to the throne in 1685 as James II, he had Oates retried, convicted and sentenced for perjury, stripped of clerical dress, imprisoned for life, and to be \\"whipped through the streets of London five days a year for the remainder of his life.\\"Pincus, Steve (2009). 1688: The First Modern Revolution. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. p. 153. Oates was taken from his cell wearing a hat with the text \\"Titus Oates, convicted upon full evidence of two horrid perjuries\\" and put into the pillory at the gate of Westminster Hall (now New Palace Yard), where passers-by pelted him with eggs. The next day he was pilloried in London and the third day was stripped, tied to a cart, and whipped from Aldgate to Newgate. On the next day but one he was whipped from Newgate to Tyburn. The presiding judge at his trial was Judge Jeffreys, who stated that Oates was a \\"shame to mankind\\", ignoring the fact that he himself had helped to condemn innocent people on Oates' perjured evidence. So severe were the penalties that it has been suggested by among others Thomas Babington Macaulay that the aim was to kill Oates by ill-treatment, as Jeffreys and his fellow judges openly regretted that they could not impose the death penalty in a case of perjury. Oates spent the next three years in prison. In 1689, upon the accession of the Protestant William of Orange and Mary, he was pardoned and granted a pension of ¬£260 a year, but his reputation did not recover. The pension was later suspended, but in 1698 was restored and increased to ¬£300 a year. Oates died on 12 or 13 July 1705, by then an obscure and largely forgotten figure. In popular culture Francis Barlow made a comic strip about the Popish Plot and Oates in c. 1682 named A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish Plot, which is generally considered the earliest example of a signed balloon comic strip. Oates was played by Nicholas Smith in the 1969 BBC TV serial The First Churchills. In Charles II: The Power and The Passion (2003), Eddie Marsan played Oates.

During World War II, he was active in the French Resistance. After the war, he served as foreign minister and prime minister on several occasions before he joined the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te. Biography =Early life= Bidault was born in Moulins, Allier. He studied in the Sorbonne and became a college history teacher. In 1932 he helped to found the Catholic Association of French Youth and the left-wing anti-fascist newspaper l'Aube. He had a column in the paper and, among other things, protested against the Munich Agreement in 1938. World War II After the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the French army. He was captured during the Fall of France and was briefly imprisoned. After his release in July 1941, he became a teacher at the Lyc√©e du Parc in Lyon and joined the Libert√© group of French Resistance that eventually merged with Combat. Jean Moulin recruited him to organize an underground press and the Combat underground newspaper. In his work in the resistance, he was helped by his private administrative assistant Laure Diebold. Bidault participated in the forming of the Conseil National de la R√©sistance and, after the Gestapo captured Moulin, he became its new chairman. In 1944 he formed a Resistance Charter that recommended an extensive post-war reform program. After the liberation of Paris he represented the Resistance in the victory parade. Charles de Gaulle appointed him as a foreign minister of his provisional government on 25 August. He was the founder of the Mouvement R√©publicain Populaire (MRP). He was head of the French delegation to the San Francisco Conference, which established the UN, from April to June 1945. At the conference, France succeeded in gaining a permanent seat on the Security Council. Fourth Republic On 4 January 1946, Bidault married Suzanne Borel, the first French woman to be employed as a diplomat. The same year he served as foreign minister in F√©lix Gouin's provisional government. On 19 June 1946 the National Constituent Assembly elected him as president of the provisional government. His government, formed on 15 June, was composed of socialists, communists and Bidault's own MRP. In social policy, Bidault's government was notable for passing important pension and workman's compensation laws. An act of 22 August 1946 extended coverage of family allowances to practically the entire population, while a law of October 1946 provided that insurance of occupation risks \\"would henceforth be mandatory and that such insurance would be granted by the Social Security that had been created in 1945.\\" In August 1946, an Act was passed that made provision for two-day's holiday a month up to a maximum of 24 working days for young persons between the ages of 14 and 18 and for one-and-a-half days' a month up to a maximum of 18 working days for those aged between 18 and 21. In addition, an Act was passed on 11 October 1946 that introduced occupational medical services. Bidault later became foreign minister once again. The government held elections to the National Assembly on 29 November after which Bidault resigned. His successor was L√©on Blum. Bidault served in various French governments, first as foreign minister under Paul Ramadier and Robert Schuman. In April 1947 he supported Ramadier's decision to expel the Communists from his government. Bidault had recently been to Moscow and was disturbed by the Soviet regime; he believed an agreement with Stalin was impossible. In 1949 he became the President of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) but his government lasted only 8 months. During his last term as prime minister, a law of February 1950 that regulated collective bargaining, and contained a guarantee of the right of workers to strike. The same law required the government to fix minimum wages for agriculture and for industry.Chambers Encyclopaedia new edition, Volume V: Edward-Franks, George Newnes Ltd. 1959, supplementary information 1961, printed and bound in England by Hazel Watson and Viney Ltd., Aylesbury and Slough In Henri Queuille's governments in 1950‚Äì1951 he held the office of Vice-president of the Council and under Rene Pleven and Edgar Faure also the post of defense minister. In 1952 Bidault became an honorary president of MRP. On 1 June 1953 President Vincent Auriol assigned him to form his own government but the National Assembly refused to give him the official mandate at 10 June. In 1953 Bidault became a presidential candidate but withdrew after the second round. Bidault was foreign minister during the siege of the French garrison at Dien Bien Phu from March to May 1954. He protested to the Red Cross that the Viet Minh were shooting at clearly marked French medical evacuation flights, killing some of the evacuees. The ongoing fighting in Indochina had exhausted him; he was described by American secretary of state John Foster Dulles as \\"a deeply harassed man\\" and later by a historian as \\"on the verge of a nervous breakdown\\". Caught between his desires to end the war and to maintain French rule over its colonies, he vacillated between pressing the war, perhaps by asking the Americans for air support, or seeking a negotiated solution. Bidault stated that John Foster Dulles (then Secretary of State of United States) offered France two atomic bombs in 1954. Fifth Republic In April 1958 Bidault again became prime minister but did not form a cabinet and had a hand in forming the conservative Christian Democratic Movement. He also supported De Gaulle's presidency after the outbreak of the Algerian War of Independence. In 1961 Bidault became President of the Executive Council of the Rally for French Algeria and opposed De Gaulle's policy of Algerian independence. He established his own National Resistance Council within the far-right paramilitary organization OAS (Organisation arm√©e secr√®te). In June 1962 he was accused of conspiring against the state and stripped of his parliamentary immunity. He left for exile in Brazil. In 1967 he moved to Belgium and in 1968 returned to France after benefiting from an amnesty. In his political memoirs, Bidault stated that he was never involved in the OAS, and was not qualified to give any precise information about its deeds.Bidault, Georges (1967) Resistance: The Political Autobiography of Georges Bidault. F.A. Praeger. p. 245. When the Front national was founded in October 1972 by members of Ordre nouveau, he participated but resigned from the organisation a few days later. Bidault died of a stroke in Cambo-les-Bains in January 1983.

He was born in Lyon, France, on 11 November 1905, into a Catholic family with a military tradition. He studied the Germanic languages at the University of Strasbourg. Afterwards, he became a soldier like his father and studied in Saint Cyr and the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Guerre and reached the rank of captain in 1934. At the outbreak of World War II, he rejoined the French army. German forces captured him in Vosges. He arrived in Marseille after escaping from a POW camp in Alsace on 27 June 1940. At first Frenay supported the Vichy Regime but was soon disillusioned by the Nazi tendency of the P√©tain regime, and he subsequently formed the French Resistance group Mouvement de Lib√©ration Nationale in 1940. He became an editor of underground newspapers such as V√©rit√©s (Truths) and had a hand in the formation of the Combat group in November 1941. In 1943, his group participated in the forming of the Conseil National de la R√©sistance of Jean Moulin, but Frenay refused a seat since he disagreed over the admission of political parties to the Conseil. When the Gestapo captured Moulin, Frenay fled to Algiers. In November 1943, he met Charles de Gaulle, who appointed him as a minister of prisoners, refugees and deportees. After the war, Frenay served in de Gaulle's first provisional government. He retired from the political life and became a businessman. He published his autobiography, The Night Will End: Memoirs of a Revolutionary in 1976 and criticised Moulin and de Gaulle as reckless. Frenay died at Porto-Vecchio, Corsica, on 8 August 1988.

It is most commonly used in dental procedures to numb the area around a tooth and is also used to reduce the pain of intramuscular injection of penicillin. Owing to the ubiquity of the trade name Novocain, in some regions, procaine is referred to generically as novocaine. It acts mainly as a sodium channel blocker. Today it is used therapeutically in some countries due to its sympatholytic, anti- inflammatory, perfusion-enhancing, and mood-enhancing effects. Procaine was first synthesized in 1905, shortly after amylocaine. It was created by the chemist Alfred Einhorn who gave the chemical the trade name Novocaine, from the Latin nov- (meaning \\"new\\") and -caine, a common ending for alkaloids used as anesthetics. It was introduced into medical use by surgeon Heinrich Braun. Prior to the discovery of amylocaine and procaine, cocaine was a commonly used local anesthetic. Einhorn wished his new discovery to be used for amputations, but for this surgeons preferred general anesthesia. Dentists, however, found it very useful. Pharmacology Procaine application before removal of a decayed tooth The primary use for procaine is as an anaesthetic. Aside from its use as a dental anesthetic, procaine is used less frequently today, since more effective (and hypoallergenic) alternatives such as lidocaine (Xylocaine) exist. Like other local anesthetics (such as mepivacaine, and prilocaine), procaine is a vasodilator, thus is often coadministered with epinephrine for the purpose of vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction helps to reduce bleeding, increases the duration and quality of anesthesia, prevents the drug from reaching systemic circulation in large amounts, and overall reduces the amount of anesthetic required. As a dental anesthesic, for example, more novocaine is needed for root canal treatment than for a simple filling. Unlike cocaine, a vasoconstrictor, procaine does not have the euphoric and addictive qualities that put it at risk for abuse. Procaine, an ester anesthetic, is metabolized in the plasma by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase through hydrolysis into para- amino benzoic acid (PABA), which is then excreted by the kidneys into the urine. A 1% procaine injection has been recommended for the treatment of extravasation complications associated with venipuncture, steroids, and antibiotics. It has likewise been recommended for treatment of inadvertent intra-arterial injections (10 ml of 1% procaine), as it helps relieve pain and vascular spasm. Procaine is an occasional additive in illicit street drugs, such as cocaine. MDMA manufacturers also use procaine as an additive at ratios ranging from 1:1 up to 10% MDMA with 90% procaine, which can be life- threatening. Adverse effects Application of procaine leads to the depression of neuronal activity. The depression causes the nervous system to become hypersensitive, producing restlessness and shaking, leading to minor to severe convulsions. Studies on animals have shown the use of procaine led to the increase of dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain. Other issues may occur because of varying individual tolerance to procaine dosage. Nervousness and dizziness can arise from the excitation of the central nervous system, which may lead to respiratory failure if overdosed. Procaine may also induce weakening of the myocardium leading to cardiac arrest. Procaine can also cause allergic reactions causing individuals to have problems with breathing, rashes, and swelling. Allergic reactions to procaine are usually not in response to procaine itself, but to its metabolite PABA. Allergic reactions are in fact quite rare, estimated to have an incidence of 1 per 500,000 injections. About one in 3000 white North Americans is homozygous (i.e. has two copies of the abnormal gene) for the most common atypical form of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and do not hydrolyze ester anesthetics such as procaine. This results in a prolonged period of high levels of the anesthetic in the blood and increased toxicity. However, certain populations in the world such as the Vysya community in India commonly have a deficiency of this enzyme. Synthesis Procaine can be synthesized in two ways. H√∂chst Ag #The first consists of the direct reaction of the 4-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester with 2-diethylaminoethanol in the presence of sodium ethoxide. #The second is by oxidizing 4-nitrotoluene to 4-nitrobenzoic acid, which is further reacted with thionyl chloride, the resulting acid chloride is then esterified with 2-diethylaminoethanol to give Nitrocaine. Finally, the nitro group is reduced by hydrogenation over Raney nickel catalyst.

A close friend and associate of lawman Wyatt Earp, Holliday is best known for his role in the events leading up to and following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. He developed a reputation as having killed more than a dozen men in various altercations, but modern researchers have concluded that, contrary to popular myth-making, Holliday killed only one to three men. Holliday's colorful life and character have been depicted in many books and portrayed by well-known actors in numerous movies and television series. At age 21, Holliday earned a degree in dentistry from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery. He set up practice in Griffin, Georgia, but he was soon diagnosed with tuberculosis, the same disease that had claimed his mother when he was 15, having acquired it while tending to her needs while she was still in the contagious phase of the illness. Hoping the climate in the American Southwest would ease his symptoms, he moved to that region and became a gambler, a reputable profession in Arizona in that day. Over the next few years, he reportedly had several confrontations. He saved Wyatt Earp, a famous lawman and gambler, while in Texas. Afterwards they became friends. In 1879, he joined Earp in Las Vegas, New Mexico and then rode with him to Prescott, Arizona, and then Tombstone. In Tombstone, local members of the outlaw Cochise County Cowboys repeatedly threatened him and spread rumors that he had robbed a stage. On October 26, 1881, Holliday was deputized by Tombstone city marshal Virgil Earp. The lawmen attempted to disarm five members of the Cowboys near the O.K. Corral on the west side of town, which resulted in the 30-second shootout. Following the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants while Morgan Earp was murdered. Unable to obtain justice in the courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the recently appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they pursued the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found Frank Stilwell lying in wait as Virgil boarded a train for California and Wyatt Earp killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of five members of the federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April 1882, before they rode to the New Mexico Territory. Wyatt Earp learned of an extradition request for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin to deny Holliday's extradition. Holliday spent the few remaining years of his life in Colorado, and died of tuberculosis in his bed at the Hotel Glenwood at age 36.  Early life and education  Holliday's graduation photo in March 1872 from the Pennsylvania School of Dentistry. Holliday was born in Griffin, Georgia, to Henry Burroughs Holliday and Alice Jane (McKey) Holliday. He was of English and Scottish ancestry. His father served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the American Civil War (as a Confederate). When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War ended, Henry brought home an adopted son named Francisco. Holliday was baptized at the First Presbyterian Church of Griffin in 1852. In 1864, his family moved to Valdosta, Georgia, where his mother died of tuberculosis on September 16, 1866. The same disease killed his adopted brother. Three months after his wife's death, his father married Rachel Martin. Holliday attended the Valdosta Institute, where he received a classical education in rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, history, and languages‚Äîprincipally Latin, but some French and Ancient Greek. In 1870, 19-year-old Holliday left home for Philadelphia. On March 1, 1872, at age 20, he received his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery (now part of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine). Holliday graduated five months before his 21st birthday, so the school held his degree until he turned 21, the minimum age required to practice dentistry.  Begins dental practice  Atlanta in 1864 Holliday moved to St. Louis, Missouri, so he could work as an assistant for his classmate, A. Jameson Fuches, Jr. Less than four months later, at the end of July, he relocated to Atlanta, where he joined a dental practice. He lived with his uncle and his family so he could begin to build up his dental practice. A few weeks before Holliday's birthday, dentist Arthur C. Ford advertised in the Atlanta papers that Holliday would substitute for him while Ford was attending dental meetings. = Fight in Georgia = There are some reports that Holliday was involved in a shooting on the Withlacoochee River, Georgia, in 1873. The earliest mention is by Bat Masterson in a profile of Doc he wrote in 1907. According to that story, when Holliday was 22, he went with some friends to a swimming hole on his uncles' land, where they discovered it was occupied by a group of African-American youth. Susan McKey Thomas, the daughter of Doc's uncle Thomas S. McKey, said her father told her: \\"They rode in on the Negroes in swimming in a part of the Withlacoochee River that \\"Doc\\" and his friends had cleared to be used as their swimming hole. The presence of the Negroes in their swimming hole enraged \\"Doc,\\" and he drew his pistol, shooting over their heads to scare them off.\\" Papa said, \\"He shot over their heads!\\" According to Masterson's story, Holliday leveled a double-barreled shotgun at them, and when they exited the swimming hole, killed two of the youths. Some family members thought it best that Holliday leave the state, but other members of Holliday's family dispute those accounts. Researcher and historian Gary Roberts searched for contemporary evidence of the event for many months without success. Allen Barra, an author who focuses on Wyatt Earp, also searched for evidence corroborating the incident and found no credibility in Masterson's story. = Diagnosis of tuberculosis = Shortly after beginning his dental practice, Holliday was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was given only a few months to live, but was told that a drier and warmer climate might slow the deterioration of his health. After Dr. Ford's return in September, Holliday left for Dallas, Texas, the \\"last big city before the uncivilized Western Frontier.\\" = Move to Dallas = When he arrived in Dallas, Holliday partnered with a friend of his father's, Dr. John A. Seegar. They won awards for their dental work at the Annual Fair of the North Texas Agricultural, Mechanical, and Blood Stock Association at the Dallas County Fair. They received all three awards: \\"Best set of teeth in gold\\", \\"Best in vulcanized rubber\\", and \\"Best set of artificial teeth and dental ware.\\" Their office was located along Elm Street, between Market and Austin Streets.Erik J. Wright (December 2001). \\"Looking For Doc in Dallas\\". True West Magazine, pp. 42‚Äì43; text: \\"...about three blocks east of the site of today's Dealey Plaza...\\" They dissolved the practice on March 2, 1874. Afterward, Holliday opened his own practice over the Dallas County Bank at the corner of Main and Lamar Streets. His tuberculosis caused coughing spells at inopportune times, and his dental practice slowly declined. Meanwhile, Holliday found he had some skill at gambling, and he soon relied on it as his principal income source. On May 12, 1874, Holliday and 12 others were indicted in Dallas for illegal gambling. He was arrested in Dallas in January 1875 after trading gunfire with a saloon keeper, Charles Austin, but no one was injured and he was found not guilty. He moved his offices to Denison, Texas, but after being fined for gambling in Dallas, he left the state. = Heads farther west = Holliday headed to Denver, following the stage routes and gambling at towns and army outposts along the way. During the summer of 1875, he settled in Denver under the alias \\"Tom Mackey\\" and found work as a faro dealer for John A. Babb's Theatre Comique at 357 Blake Street. He got in an argument with Bud Ryan, a well-known and tough gambler. They drew knives and fought and Holliday left Ryan seriously wounded. Holliday left when he learned about gold being discovered in Wyoming, and on February 5, 1876, he arrived in Cheyenne. He found work as a dealer for Babb's partner, Thomas Miller, who owned the Bella Union Saloon. In the fall of 1876, Miller moved the Bella Union to Deadwood (site of the gold rush in the Dakota Territory), and Holliday went with him. In 1877, Holliday returned to Cheyenne, and then Denver, and eventually to Kansas where he visited an aunt. When he left Kansas, he went to Breckenridge, Texas, where he gambled. On July 4, 1877, he had a disagreement with gambler Henry Kahn, and Holliday beat him repeatedly with his walking stick. Both men were arrested and fined, but Kahn was not finished. Later that same day, he shot and seriously wounded the unarmed Holliday. On July 7, the Dallas Weekly Herald incorrectly reported that Holliday had been killed. His cousin, George Henry Holliday, moved west to help him recover. Once healed, Holliday relocated to Fort Griffin, Texas. While dealing cards at John Shanssey's saloon, he met Mary Katharine \\"Big Nose Kate\\" Horony, a dance hall woman and occasional prostitute. Her nose was a prominent feature. \\"Tough, stubborn and fearless,\\" she was educated, but chose to work as a prostitute because she liked her independence.The Infamous Doc Holliday She is the only woman with whom Holliday is known to have had a relationship.  Befriends Wyatt Earp  In October 1877, outlaws led by \\"Dirty\\" Dave Rudabaugh robbed a Sante Fe Railroad construction camp in Kansas. Rudabaugh fled south into Texas. Wyatt Earp was given a temporary commission as deputy U.S. marshal, and he left Dodge City following Rudabaugh over to Fort Griffin, a frontier town on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River. Earp went to the Bee Hive Saloon, the largest in town and owned by John Shanssey, whom Earp had met in Wyoming when he was 21. Shanssey told Earp that Rudabaugh had passed through town earlier in the week, but he did not know where he was headed. Shanssey suggested Earp ask gambler Doc Holliday, who had played cards with Rudabaugh. Holliday told Earp that he thought Rudabaugh was headed back to Kansas. Earp sent a telegram to Ford County Sheriff Bat Masterson that Rudabaugh might be headed back in his direction. Photo of the interior of the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas, taken between 1870 and 1885 After about a month in Fort Griffin, Earp returned to Fort Clark and in early 1878, he went to Dodge City, where he became the assistant city marshal, serving under Charlie Bassett. During the summer of 1878, Holliday and Horony also arrived in Dodge City, where they stayed at Deacon Cox's boardinghouse as Dr. and Mrs. John H. Holliday. Holliday sought to practice dentistry again, and ran an ad in the local paper: According to accounts of the following event reported by Glenn Boyer in I Married Wyatt Earp, Earp had run two cowboys, Tobe Driscall and Ed Morrison, out of Wichita earlier in 1878. During the summer, the two cowboys‚Äîaccompanied by another two dozen men‚Äîrode into Dodge and shot up the town while galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized the room, and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst through the front door, and before he could react, a large number of cowboys were pointing their guns at him. In another version, there were only three to five cowboys. In both stories, Holliday was playing cards in the back of the room and upon seeing the commotion, drew his weapon and put his pistol at Morrison's head, forcing him and his men to disarm, rescuing Earp from a bad situation. No account of any such confrontation was reported by any of the Dodge City newspapers at the time. Whatever actually happened, Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two men became friends. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992)  Other known confrontations  Holliday was still practicing dentistry from his room in Fort Griffin, Texas, and in Dodge City, Kansas. In an 1878 Dodge newspaper advertisement, he promised money back for less than complete customer satisfaction. However, this was the last known time that he worked as a dentist. He gained the nickname \\"Doc\\" during this period. Holliday reportedly engaged in a gunfight with a bartender named Charles White. Miguel Otero, who would later become governor of New Mexico Territory, said he was present when Holliday walked into the saloon with a cocked revolver in his hand and challenged White to settle an outstanding argument. White was serving customers at the time and took cover behind a bar, then started shooting at Holliday with his revolver. During the fight, Holliday shot White in the scalp. But there are no contemporaneous newspaper reports of the incident. Bat Masterson reportedly said that Holliday was in Jacksboro, Texas, and got into a gunfight with an unnamed soldier whom Holliday shot and killed. Historian Gary L. Roberts found a record for a Private Robert Smith who had been shot and killed by an \\"unknown assailant\\" March 3, 1876, but Holliday was never linked to the death.  Move to New Mexico  Holliday developed a reputation for his skill with a gun, as well as with the cards. A few days before Christmas in 1878, Holliday and Horony arrived in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The 22 hot springs near the town were favored by individuals with tuberculosis for their alleged healing properties. Doc opened a dental practice and continued gambling as well, but the winter was unseasonably cold and business was slow. The New Mexico Territorial Legislature passed a bill banning gambling within the territory with surprising ease. On March 8, 1879, Holliday was indicted for \\"keeping [a] gaming table\\" and was fined $25. The ban on gambling combined with extreme low temperatures persuaded him to return to Dodge City for a few months. In September 1879, Wyatt Earp resigned as assistant marshal in Dodge City. Accompanied by his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock, his brother Jim, and his wife Bessie, they left for Arizona Territory. Holliday and Horony returned to Las Vegas where they rendezvoused with the Earps. The group arrived in Prescott in November. = Royal Gorge War = In Dodge City, Holliday joined a team being formed by Deputy U.S. Marshal Bat Masterson. Masterson had been asked to prevent an outbreak of guerrilla warfare between the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW;), which were vying to be the first to claim a right-of-way across the Royal Gorge, one of the few natural routes through the Rockies that crossed the Continental Divide. Both were striving to be the first to provide rail access to the boom town of Leadville, Colorado.United States Reports, Supreme Court: Cases Argued and Adjudged in the Supreme Court of the United States (October Term, 1878), by William T. Otto, published 1879, from Harvard University Royal Gorge was a bottleneck along the Arkansas, too narrow for both railroads to pass through, and with no other reasonable access to the South Park area. Doc remained there for about two and a half months. The federal intervention prompted the so-called \\"Treaty of Boston\\" to end the fighting. The D&RGW; completed its line and leased it for use by the Santa Fe.A Builder of the West: The Life of General William Jackson Palmer , by John Stirling Fisher and Chase Mellen, 1981, by Ayer Publishing. Holliday took home a share of a $10,000 bribe paid by the D&RGW; to Masterson to give up their possession of the Santa Fe roundhouse, and returned to Las Vegas where Horony had remained. = Builds saloon in Las Vegas = The Santa Fe Railroad built tracks to Las Vegas, New Mexico, but bypassed the city by about a mile. A new town was built up near the tracks and prostitution and gambling flourished there. On July 19, 1879, Holliday and John Joshua Webb, former lawman and gunman, were seated in a saloon. Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon tried to persuade one of the saloon girls, a former girlfriend, to leave town with him. She refused and Gordon stormed outside. He began firing into the building, and a few hours later, Gordon was found mortally wounded outside. Some attribute the shooting to Holliday, but no conclusive evidence of who killed Gordon was ever found. The next day, Holliday paid $372.50 to a carpenter to build a clapboard building to house the Doc Holliday's Saloon with John Webb as his partner. While in town, he was fined twice for keeping a gambling device, and again for carrying a deadly weapon.  Move to Arizona Territory  It appeared Holliday and Horony were settling into life in Las Vegas when Wyatt Earp arrived on October 18, 1879. He told Holliday he was headed for the silver boom going on in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. Holliday and Horony joined Wyatt and his wife Mattie, as well as Jim Earp and his wife and step daughter, and they left the next day for Prescott, Arizona Territory. They arrived within a few weeks and went straight to the home of Constable Virgil Earp and his wife Allie. Holliday and Horony checked into a hotel and when Wyatt, Virgil, and James Earp with their wives left for Tombstone, Holliday remained in Prescott, where he thought the gambling opportunities were better. Holliday finally joined the Earps in Tombstone in September 1880. Some accounts report that the Earps sent for Holliday for assistance with dealing with the outlaw Cowboys. Holliday quickly became embroiled in the local politics and violence that led up to the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in October 1881. = Accused in stagecoach robbery = Holliday and Horony had many fights. After a particularly nasty, drunken argument, Holliday kicked her out. County Sheriff Johnny Behan and Milt Joyce, both members of the Ten Percent Ring, saw an opportunity and exploited the situation. They plied Horony with more booze and suggested to her a way to get even with Holliday. She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in an attempted robbery and murder of passengers aboard a Kinnear and Company stage coach on March 15, 1881, carrying US$26,000 in silver bullion (). Bob Paul, who had run for Pima County sheriff and was contesting the election he lost due to ballot stuffing, was working as the Wells Fargo shotgun messenger. He had taken the reins and driver's seat in Contention City because the usual driver, a well-known and popular man named Eli \\"Budd\\" Philpot, was ill. Paul was riding in Philpot's place as shotgun when three cowboys stopped the stage between Tombstone and Benson, Arizona and tried to rob it. Paul fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers, wounding a cowboy, later identified as Bill Leonard, in the groin. Philpot and passenger Peter Roerig, riding in the rear dickey seat, were both shot and killed. Holliday was a good friend of Leonard, a former watchmaker from New York. Based on the affidavit sworn by Horony, Judge Wells Spicer issued an arrest warrant for Holliday. Rumors flew that Holliday had taken part in the shooting and murders. Later that day, drunk, Holliday returned to Joyce's saloon. He insulted Joyce and demanded his firearm back. Joyce refused and threw him out, but Holliday came back carrying a revolver and started firing. Joyce pulled out a pistol and Holliday shot the revolver out of Joyce's hand, putting a bullet through his palm. When Joyce's bartender, Parker, tried to grab his gun, Holliday wounded him in the toe. Joyce picked up his pistol and pistol-whipped Holliday, knocking him out. He shot and wounded both men and was convicted of assault. The Earps found witnesses who could attest to Holliday's location elsewhere at the time of the stagecoach murders, and Horony sobered up, revealing that Behan and Joyce had influenced her to sign a document she did not understand. With the cowboy plot revealed, Spicer freed Holliday. The district attorney threw out the charges, labeling them \\"ridiculous\\". Holliday gave Horony some money and put her on a stage out of town. = Gunfight at the O.K. Corral = On October 26, 1881, Virgil Earp was both a deputy U.S. marshal and Tombstone's city police chief. He received reports that cowboys with whom they had had repeated confrontations were armed in violation of the city ordinance that required them to deposit their weapons at a saloon or stable soon after arriving in town. The cowboys had repeatedly threatened the Earps and Holliday. Fearing trouble, Virgil temporarily deputized Holliday and sought backup from his brothers Wyatt and Morgan. Virgil retrieved a short coach gun from the Wells Fargo office and the four men went to find the cowboys. On Fremont Street, they ran into Cochise County Sheriff Behan, who told them or implied that he had disarmed the cowboys. To avoid alarming citizens and lessen tension when disarming the cowboys, Virgil gave the coach gun to Holliday so he could conceal it under his long coat. Virgil Earp took Holliday's walking stick. The lawmen found the cowboys in a narrow 15‚Äì to 20-ft-wide lot on Fremont Street, between Fly's boarding house and the Harwood house. Holliday was boarding at Fly's house and he possibly thought they were waiting there to kill him. Different witnesses offered varying stories about Holliday's actions. Cowboys witnesses testified that Holliday first pulled out a nickel-plated pistol he was known to carry, while others reported he first fired a longer, bronze-colored gun, possibly the coach gun. Holliday killed Tom McLaury with a shotgun blast in the side of his chest. Holliday was grazed by a bullet possibly fired by Frank McLaury who was on Fremont Street at the time. He supposedly challenged Holliday, yelling, \\"I've got you now!\\" Holliday is reported to have replied, \\"Blaze away! You're a daisy if you have.\\" McLaury died of shots to his stomach and behind his ear. Holliday may have also wounded Billy Clanton. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) One analysis of the fight gives credit to either Holliday or Morgan Earp for firing the fatal shot at McLaury on Fremont Street. Holliday may have been on McLaury's right and Morgan Earp on his left. McLaury was shot in the right side of the head, so Holliday is often given credit for shooting him. However, Wyatt Earp had shot McLaury in his torso earlier, a shot that alone could have killed him. McLaury would have turned away after having been hit and Wyatt could have placed a second shot in his head.Tombstone Nugget; October 27, 1881 A 30-day-long preliminary hearing found that the Earps and Holliday had acted within their duties as lawmen, although this did not pacify Ike Clanton. = Earp Vendetta Ride = The situation in Tombstone soon grew worse when Virgil Earp was ambushed and permanently injured in December 1881. Following that, Morgan Earp was ambushed and killed in March 1882. Several Cowboys were identified by witnesses as suspects in the shooting of Virgil Earp on December 27, 1881, and the assassination of Morgan Earp on March 19, 1882. Additional circumstantial evidence also pointed to their involvement. Wyatt Earp had been appointed deputy U.S. marshal after Virgil was maimed. He deputized Holliday, Warren Earp, Sherman McMaster, and \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson. After Morgan's murder, Wyatt Earp and his deputies guarded Virgil Earp and Allie on their way to the train for Colton, California where his father lived, to recuperate from his serious shotgun wound. In Tucson, on March 20, 1882, the group spotted an armed Frank Stilwell and reportedly Ike Clanton hiding among the railroad cars, apparently lying in wait with the intent to kill Virgil. Frank Stilwell's body was found at dawn alongside the railroad tracks, riddled with buckshot and gunshot wounds. Wyatt said later in life that he killed Stilwell with a shotgun. Tucson Justice of the Peace Charles Meyer issued arrest warrants for five of the Earp party, including Holliday. On March 21, they returned briefly to Tombstone, where they were joined by Texas Jack Vermillion and possibly others. On the morning of March 22, a portion of the Earp posse including Wyatt, Warren, Holliday, Sherman McMaster, and \\"Turkey Creek\\" Johnson rode about east to Pete Spence's ranch to a wood cutting camp located off the Chiricahua Road, below the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains. According to Theodore Judah‚Äîwho witnessed events at the wood camp‚Äîthe Earp posse arrived around 11:00 am and asked for Spence and Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz. They learned Spence was in jail and that Cruz was cutting wood nearby. They followed the direction Judah indicated and he soon heard a dozen or so shots. When Cruz did not return the next morning, Judah went looking for him, and found his body full of bullet holes. = Gunfight at Iron Springs = Two days later, Earp's posse traveled to Iron Springs located in the Whetstone Mountains, where they expected to meet Charlie Smith, who was supposed to be bringing $1,000 cash from their supporters in Tombstone. With Wyatt and Holliday in the lead, the six lawmen surmounted a small rise overlooking the springs. They surprised eight cowboys camping near the springs. Wyatt Earp and Holliday left the only record of the fight. Curly Bill recognized Wyatt Earp in the lead and immediately grabbed his shotgun and fired at Earp. The other Cowboys also drew their weapons and began firing. Earp dismounted, shotgun in hand. \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion's horse was shot and fell on him, pinning his leg and wedging his rifle underneath. Lacking cover, Holliday, Johnson, and McMaster retreated. Earp returned Curly Bill's gunfire with his own shotgun and shot him in the chest, nearly cutting him in half according to Earp's later account. Curly Bill fell into the water by the edge of the spring and lay dead. The Cowboys fired a number of shots at the Earp party, but the only casualty was Vermillion's horse, which was killed. Firing his pistol, Wyatt shot Johnny Barnes in the chest and Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him gain cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down around his legs. Wyatt's long coat was shot through by bullets on both sides. Another bullet struck his boot heel and his saddle horn was hit as well, burning the saddle hide and narrowly missing Wyatt. He was finally able to get on his horse and retreat. McMaster was grazed by a bullet that cut through the straps of his field glasses. = Earp and Holliday part company = Holliday and four other members of the posse were still faced with warrants for Stilwell's death. The group elected to leave the Arizona Territory for New Mexico Territory and then on to Colorado. Wyatt and Holliday, who had been fast friends, had a serious disagreement and parted ways in Albuquerque. According to a letter written by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero, Wyatt and Holliday were eating at Fat Charlie's The Retreat Restaurant in Albuquerque \\"when Holliday said something about Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left...\\" Earp was staying with a prominent businessman, Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque's Board of Trade. Jaffa was Jewish, and based on Otero's letter, Earp had, while staying in Jaffa's home, honored Jewish tradition by touching the mezuzah upon entering his home. According to Otero's letter, Jaffa told him, \\"Earp's woman was a Jewess.\\" Earp's anger at Holliday's ethnic slur may indicate that the relationship between Josephine Marcus and Wyatt Earp was more serious at the time than is commonly known. Holliday and Dan Tipton arrived in Pueblo, Colorado in late April 1882.  Arrives in Colorado  On May 15, 1882, Holliday was arrested in Denver on the Tucson warrant for murdering Frank Stilwell. When Wyatt Earp learned of the charges, he feared his friend Holliday would not receive a fair trial in Arizona. Earp asked his friend Bat Masterson, then chief of police of Trinidad, Colorado, to help get Holliday released. Masterson drew up bunco charges against Holliday. Holliday's extradition hearing was set for May 30. Late in the evening of May 29, Masterson sought help getting an appointment with Colorado Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin. He contacted E.D. Cowen, capital reporter for the Denver Tribune, who held political sway in town. Cowen later wrote, \\"He submitted proof of the criminal design upon Holliday's life. Late as the hour was, I called on Pitkin.\\" His legal reasoning was that the extradition papers for Holliday contained faulty legal language, and that there was already a Colorado warrant out for Holliday‚Äîincluding the bunco charge that Masterson had fabricated. Pitkin was persuaded by the evidence presented by Masterson and refused to honor Arizona's extradition request. Masterson took Holliday to Pueblo, where he was released on bond two weeks after his arrest. Holliday and Wyatt met again in June 1882 in Gunnison after Wyatt helped to keep his friend from being convicted on murder charges regarding Frank Stillwell. Holliday was able to see his old friend Wyatt one last time in the late winter of 1886, where they met in the lobby of the Windsor Hotel. Sadie Marcus described the skeletal Holliday as having a continuous cough and standing on \\"unsteady legs.\\" = Death of Johnny Ringo = On July 14, 1882, Holliday's long-time enemy Johnny Ringo was found dead in a low fork of a large tree in West Turkey Creek Valley near Chiricahua Peak, Arizona Territory. He had a bullet hole in his right temple and a revolver was found hanging from a finger of his hand. A coroner's inquest officially ruled his death a suicide;John Ringo at thewildwest.org, retrieved October 4, 2016. but according to the book I Married Wyatt Earp, which author and collector Glen Boyer claimed to have assembled from manuscripts written by Earp's third wife, Josephine Marcus Earp, Earp and Holliday traveled to Arizona with some friends in early July, found Ringo in the valley, and killed him. Boyer refused to produce his source manuscripts, and reporters wrote that his explanations were conflicting and not credible. New York Times contributor Allen Barra wrote that the book \\"is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax\\". A variant of the story, popularized in the movie Tombstone, holds that Holliday stepped in for Earp in response to a gunfight challenge from Ringo, and shot him. Evidence is unclear as to Holliday's exact whereabouts on the day of Ringo's death. Records of the District Court of Pueblo County, Colorado indicate that Holliday and his attorney appeared in court in Pueblo on July 11, and again on July 14 to answer charges of \\"larceny\\"; but a writ of capias was issued for him on the 11th, suggesting that he may not have been in court that day.Tanner, KH. Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait. University of Oklahoma Press (2012), Kindle location 2213. ASIN: B0099P9T8Q The Pueblo Daily Chieftain reported that Holliday was seen in Salida, Colorado on July 7, more than from where Ringo's body was found, and then in Leadville on July 18.Pueblo Daily Chieftain, July 19, 1882. Holliday biographer Karen Holliday Tanner noted that there was still an outstanding murder warrant in Arizona for Holliday's arrest, making it unlikely that he would choose to reenter Arizona at that time.Tanner (2012), Kindle location 2244 \\"Big Nose Kate\\" Horony  Death and burial  Holliday spent his remaining days in Colorado. After a stay in Leadville, he suffered from the high altitude. He increasingly depended on alcohol and laudanum to ease the symptoms of tuberculosis, and his health and his skills as a gambler began to deteriorate. Holliday's last known confrontation took place in Hyman's saloon in Leadville. Down to his last dollar, he had pawned his jewelry, and then borrowed $5 () from Billy Allen, a bartender and special officer at the Monarch Saloon, which enabled Allen to carry a gun and make arrests within the saloon. When Allen demanded he be repaid, Holliday could not comply. He knew Allen was armed, and when Allen appeared ready to attack him, he shot him, wounding him in the arm. Holliday was arrested and put on trial. He claimed self-defense, noting that Allen outweighed him by and he feared for his life. A witness testified that Allen had been armed and in Hyman's earlier in the day apparently looking for Holliday. On March 28, 1885, the jury acquitted Holliday. = Final days = Glenwood Springs erected a headstone, but it had the wrong birth year on it. This monument replaced the former monument. In 1887, prematurely gray and badly ailing, Holliday made his way to the Hotel Glenwood, near the hot springs of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. He hoped to take advantage of the reputed curative power of the waters, but the sulfurous fumes from the spring may have done his lungs more harm than good. As he lay dying, Holliday is reported to have asked the nurse attending him for a shot of whiskey. When she told him no, he looked at his bootless feet, amused. The nurses said that his last words were, \\"This is funny.\\" He always figured he would be killed someday with his boots on. Holliday died at 10 am on November 8, 1887. He was 36. Wyatt Earp did not learn of Holliday's death until two months afterward. Kate Horony later said that she attended to him in his final days, and one contemporary source appears to back her claim. = Service = The Glenwood Springs Ute Chief of November 12, 1887, wrote in his obituary that Holliday had been baptized in the Catholic Church. This was based on correspondence written between Holliday and his cousin, Sister Mary Melanie, a Catholic nun. No baptismal record has been found in either St. Stephen's Catholic Church in Glenwood Springs or at the Annunciation Catholic Church in nearby Leadville. Holliday's mother had been raised a Methodist and later joined a Presbyterian church (her husband's faith), but objected to the Presbyterian doctrine of predestination and reconverted to Methodism publicly before she died, saying that she wanted her son John to know what she believed. Holliday himself was later to say that he had joined a Methodist church in Dallas. At the end of his life, Holliday had struck up friendships with both a Catholic priest, Father E.T. Downey, and a Presbyterian minister, Rev. W.S. Randolph, in Glenwood Springs. When he died, Father Downey was out of town, and so Rev. Randolph presided over the burial at 4pm on the same day that Holliday died. The services were reportedly attended by \\"many friends\\". = Burial = Holliday is buried in Linwood Cemetery overlooking Glenwood Springs. Since Holliday died in November, the ground may have been frozen. Some modern authors such as Bob Boze Bell speculate that it would have been impossible to transport him to the cemetery, which was only accessible by a difficult mountain road, or to dig a grave because the ground was frozen. Author Gary Roberts located evidence that other bodies were transported to the Linwood Cemetery at the same time of the month that year. Contemporary newspaper reports explicitly state that Holliday was buried in the Linwood Cemetery, but the exact location of his grave is uncertain. Holliday's father, Major Henry Holliday, a man of means and influence, had his son reburied in Griffin's Oak Hill Cemetery. Father and son were buried beside one another. https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/doc-hollidays-grave-in-griffin  Public reputation  Holliday maintained a fierce persona as was sometimes needed for a gambler to earn respect. He had a contemporary reputation as a skilled gunfighter which modern historians generally regard as accurate. Tombstone resident George W. Parsons wrote that Holliday confronted Johnny Ringo in January 1882, telling him, \\"All I want of you is ten paces out in the street.\\" Ringo and he were prevented from a gunfight by the Tombstone police, who arrested both. During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Holliday initially carried a shotgun and shot at and may have killed Tom McLaury. Holliday was grazed by a bullet fired by Frank McLaury, and shot back. After Virgil was maimed in a January ambush, Holliday was part of a federal posse led by Deputy U.S. Marshal Earp who guarded him on his way to the railroad in Tucson. There they found Frank Stilwell apparently waiting for the Earps in the rail yard. A warrant for Holliday's arrest was issued after Stilwell was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds. Holliday was part of Earp's federal posse when they killed three other outlaw Cowboys during the Earp Vendetta Ride. Holliday reported that he had been arrested 17 times, four attempts had been made to hang him, and that he survived ambush five times. = Character = Throughout his lifetime, Holliday was known by many of his peers as a tempered, calm, Southern gentleman. In an 1896 article, Wyatt Earp said: In a newspaper interview, Holliday was once asked if his conscience ever troubled him. He is reported to have said, \\"I coughed that up with my lungs, years ago.\\" Bat Masterson, who had several contacts with Holliday over his lifetime, had a different opinion of Holliday. = Stabbings and shootings = Much of Holliday's violent reputation was nothing but rumors and self promotion. However, he showed great skill in gambling and gunfights. His tuberculosis did not hamper his ability as a gambler and as a marksman. Holliday was ambidextrous. No contemporaneous newspaper accounts or legal records offer proof of the many unnamed men whom Holliday is credited with killing in popular folklore. The only men he is known to have killed are Mike Gordon in 1879; probably Frank Mclaury and Tom McLaury in Tombstone; and possibly Frank Stilwell in Tucson. Some scholars argue that Holliday may have encouraged the stories about his reputation, although his record never supported those claims. In a March 1882 interview with the Arizona Daily Star, Virgil Earp told the reporter: = Arrests and convictions = Biographer Karen Holliday Tanner found that Holliday had been arrested 17 times before his 1881 shootout in Tombstone. Only one arrest was for murder, which occurred in an 1879 shootout with Mike Gordon in New Mexico, for which he was acquitted. In the preliminary hearing following the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Judge Wells Spicer exonerated Holliday's actions as those of a duly appointed lawman. In Denver, the Arizona warrant against Holliday for Frank Stilwell's murder went unserved when the governor was persuaded by Trinidad Chief of Police Bat Masterson to release Holliday to his custody for bunco charges. Among his other arrests, Holliday pleaded guilty to two gambling charges, one charge of carrying a deadly weapon in the city (in connection with the argument with Ringo), and one misdemeanor assault and battery charge (for his shooting of Joyce and Parker). The others were all dismissed or returned as \\"not guilty.\\" = Alleged murder of Ed Bailey = Wyatt Earp recounted one event during which Holliday killed a fellow gambler named Ed Bailey. Earp and his common- law wife Mattie Blaylock were in Fort Griffin, Texas, during the winter of 1878, looking for gambling opportunities. Earp visited the saloon of his old friend from Cheyenne, John Shannsey, and met Holliday at the Cattle Exchange. The story of Holliday killing Bailey first appeared nine years after Holliday's death in an 1896 interview with Wyatt Earp that was published in the San Francisco Enquirer. According to Earp, Holliday was playing poker with a well-liked local man named Ed Bailey. Holliday caught Bailey \\"monkeying with the dead wood\\" or the discard pile, which was against the rules. According to Earp, Holliday reminded Bailey to \\"play poker\\", which was a polite way to caution him to stop cheating. When Bailey made the same move again, Holliday took the pot without showing his hand, which was his right under the rules. Bailey immediately went for his pistol, but Holliday whipped out a knife from his breast pocket and \\"caught Bailey just below the brisket\\" or upper chest. Bailey died and Holliday, new to town, was detained in his room at the Planter's Hotel. In Stuart Lake's best-selling biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal (1931), Earp added to the story. He is quoted as saying that Holliday's girlfriend, \\"Big Nose Kate\\" Horony, devised a diversion. She procured a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol. However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey's death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed \\"a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room.\\" She laughed at the idea of \\"a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw up his hands, disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies.\\" Author and Earp expert Ben Traywick doubts that Holliday killed Bailey. He could find no newspaper articles or court records to support the story. He found evidence to support that Holliday was being held in his hotel room under guard, but for \\"illegal gambling\\", and that the story of Horony starting a fire as a diversion to free him was true. The story about Bailey as told in San Francisco Enquirer interview of Earp was likely fabricated by the writer. Years later, Earp wrote:  Photos of Holliday  Three photos of unknown provenance are often reported to be of Holliday, some of them supposedly taken by C.S. Fly in Tombstone, but sometimes reported to have been taken in Dallas. Holliday lived in a rooming house in front of Fly's photography studio. Many persons share similar facial features, and the faces of people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers, and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.

Corral. Holliday's friendship with the lawman has been a staple of popular sidekicks in American Western culture,Top Ten Greatest Sidekicks and Holliday himself became a stereotypical image of a deputy and a loyal companion in modern times. He is typically portrayed in films as being loyal to his friend Wyatt, whom he sticks with during the duo's greatest conflicts, such as the Gunfight at the OK Corral and Earp's vendetta, even with the ensuing violence and hardships which they both endured. Together with Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday has become a modern symbol of loyalty, brotherhood and friendship.Microsoft Encarta 2009; Doc Holliday The Holliday birth home is marked with a historical marker located in Fayetteville, Georgia.The Holliday- Dorsey-Fife House A life-sized statue of Holliday and Earp by sculptor Dan Bates was dedicated by the Southern Arizona Transportation Museum at the restored Historic Railroad Depot in Tucson, Arizona, on March 20, 2005, the 122nd anniversary of the killing of Frank Stilwell by Wyatt Earp. The statue stands at the approximate site of the shooting on the train platform. Wyatt Earp later claimed that Doc and I were the only ones in Tucson at the time Frank Stilwell was killed \\"Doc Holliday Days\\" are held yearly in Holliday's birthplace of Griffin, Georgia. Valdosta, Georgia held a Doc Holliday look- alike contest in January 2010, to coincide with its sesquicentennial celebration. Tombstone, Arizona also holds an annual Doc Holli-Days, which started in 2017 and celebrate the gunfighter-dentist on the 2nd weekend of August each year. Events include gunfights, a parade, and a Doc Holliday look- alike contest. Val Kilmer, who played Doc in 1993's Tombstone, was the grand marshal in 2017 and Dennis Quaid, who played Doc in 1994's Wyatt Earp, was the grand marshal in 2018.  In popular culture  Holliday was nationally known during his life as a gambler and gunman. The shootout at the O.K. Corral is one of the most famous frontier stories in the American West and numerous Western TV shows and movies have been made about it. Holliday is usually a prominent part of the story.Skyways.org , John Henry Holliday arrives in Dodge City from Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait, by Karen Holliday Tanner, 1998 = Documentary = * In Search of Doc Holliday (2016) = In film and television = Actors who have portrayed Holliday include:Doc Holliday characters at IMDB.com . * Harvey Clark in Law for Tombstone (1937) * Cesar Romero in Frontier Marshal (1939) * Kent Taylor in Tombstone, the Town Too Tough to Die (1942) * Walter Huston in The Outlaw (1943) * Victor Mature in My Darling Clementine directed by John Ford, with Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp (1946) * Harry Bartell in the 13th episode of the CBS radio program Gunsmoke (July 19, 1952) * Kim Spalding in the syndicated television series Stories of the Century (1954) * James Griffith in Masterson of Kansas (1954) * Barry Atwater in \\"The Gunfight at the O.K.

A government can declare such a state during a natural disaster, civil unrest, armed conflict, medical pandemic or epidemic or other biosecurity risk. Justitium is its equivalent in Roman law‚Äîa concept in which the Roman Senate could put forward a final decree (senatus consultum ultimum) that was not subject to dispute yet helped save lives in times of strife. States of emergency can also be used as a rationale or pretext for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's constitution or basic law, sometimes through martial law or revoking habeas corpus. The procedure for and legality of doing so vary by country. Relationship with international law Under international law, rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency, depending on the severity of the emergency and a government's policies. Use and viewpoints Though fairly uncommon in democracies, dictatorial regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights.See Judson, 2012, \\"Where is R2P grounded in international law\\". In some situations, martial law is also declared, allowing the military greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. Nicole Questiaux (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive United Nations Special Rapporteurs, have recommended to the international community to adopt the following \\"principles\\" to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. \\"Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency\\", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also √©tat d'exception). Article 4 to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), permits states to derogate from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in \\"time of public emergency\\". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the Secretary- General of the United Nations. The European Convention on Human RightsEuropean Convention on Human Rights, Article 15 and American Convention on Human RightsAmerican Convention on Human Rights, Article 27 have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the International Labour Conventions. Some political theorists, such as Carl Schmitt, have argued that the power to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines sovereignty itself. In State of Exception (2005), Giorgio Agamben criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their civil and political rights, producing his interpretation of homo sacer. =Graduation= In many democratic states there are a selection of legal definitions for specific states of emergency,USA ASTHO Emergency toolkit fact sheet when the constitution of the State is partially in abeyance depending on the nature of the perceived threat to the general public. In order of severity these may include: *Martial law when civil rights are severely restricted by the imposition of military force within a Sovereign state, for example during a period of extreme threat of invasion or actual hostilities by foreign forces * state of siege when the civil rights of specified persons or groups such as political activists are likely to be curtailed, for example to prevent an insurrection or organised acts of treason by suspected agents provocateurs * civil emergency dealing with disaster areas and requiring the deployment of extraordinary resources to contain dangerous situations such as natural disasters or extensive malicious property damage such as may occur during rioting or by arson. As well as regular emergency services, sometimes military forces may be assigned to deliver aid under especially dangerous conditions or to prevent looting =Abuse= The state of emergency can be abused by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the August 1991 attempted coup in the Soviet Union (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Derogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties. Law in selected countries =Argentina= The Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally estado de sitio, \\"state of siege\\"), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition. The American Convention on Human Rights (Pacto de San Jos√© de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the National Reorganization Process, restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected. =Australia= State-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia. With regard to emergency management, regions (usually on a local government area basis) that have been affected by a natural disaster are the responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency where access to the Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond to and recover from natural disasters. A State of Emergency does not apply to the whole state, but rather districts or shires, where essential services may have been disrupted. On 18 March 2020, a nationwide human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, after the National Security Committee met the previous day. The Biosecurity Act 2015 specifies that the Governor-General of Australia may declare such an emergency if the Health Minister (currently Greg Hunt) is satisfied that \\"a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale\\". This gives the Minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and evacuations. The Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020 was declared by the Governor-General, David Hurley, under Section 475 of the Act. New South Wales In New South Wales, the NSW Premier can, pursuant to the State Emergency and Rescue Management Act 1989, declare a state of emergency due to an actual or imminent occurrence (such as fire, flood, storm, earthquake, explosion, terrorist act, accident, epidemic or warlike action) which endangers, or threatens to endanger, the safety or health of persons or animals in the State, or destroys or damages, or threatens to destroy or damage, property in the State, or causes a failure of, or a significant disruption to, an essential service or infrastructure. The Premier declared a state of emergency on 11 November 2019 in response to the 2019-2020 New South Wales bushfires. It was the fifth time that a state of emergency had been declared in that state since 2006 and it lasted for seven days. Subsequent declarations were made on 19 December for a further seven days, and again on 2 January 2020. In NSW, the 2019-2020 bushfire season resulted in 26 deaths, destroyed 2,448 homes, and burnt . Victoria In Victoria, the Victorian Premier can declare a state of emergency under the Public Safety Preservation Act 1958 if there is a threat to employment, safety or public order. A declared state of emergency allows the Premier to immediately make any desired regulations to secure public order and safety. The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier. However, these regulations expire if Parliament does not agree to continue them within seven days. The Premier (or a delegate) may operate or prohibit operation of any essential service, such as transport, fuel, power, water or gas, under the Essential Services Act 1958. If there is an emergency which the Premier, after considering the advice of the relevant Minister and the Emergency Management Commissioner, is satisfied constitutes or is likely to constitute a significant and widespread danger to life or property in Victoria, the Premier, pursuant to the Emergency Management Act 1986, may declare a state of disaster to exist in the whole or in any part or parts of the State. The state of disaster addresses matters beyond public health issues and is intended to deal with emergencies such as natural disasters, explosions, terrorism or sieges, and it can also be used to deal with 'a plague or an epidemic'. The Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 gives the Chief Health Officer extensive powers to take action ‚Äòto investigate, eliminate or reduce public health risks‚Äô, including power to detain, restrict the movement of or prevent entry of any person in the emergency area, ‚Äúand to give any other direction that the authorised officer considers is reasonably necessary to protect public health.‚Äù Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 , s 200. =Brazil= Extreme act that, in Brazil (Estado de S√≠tio or Estado de Exce√ß√£o, in Portuguese), can be declared on the following circumstances: *Serious disturbance with national impact; *Inefficiency on the Defense State previously decreed; *Declaration of war; *Response to foreign armed aggression. The state of emergency could last for 30 days, being possible to extend it for more days in case of persistence of the reasons of exceptionality. Only the President is able to declare or prorogate this State; after receiving formal authorization from National Congress and after consultation with the National Security Council and the Council of the Republic. =Canada= The federal government of Canada can use the Emergencies Act to invoke a state of emergency. A national state of emergency automatically expires after 90 days, unless extended by the Governor-in- Council. There are different levels of emergencies: Public Welfare Emergency, Public Order Emergency, International Emergency, and War Emergency. The Emergencies Act replaced the War Measures Act in 1988. The War Measures Act was invoked three times in Canadian history, most controversially during the 1970 October Crisis, and also during World War I (from 1914 to 1920, against threat of Communism) and World War II (from 1942 to 1945, against perceived threat from Japanese Canadians following Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor). Under the current Emergency Act a state of emergency can also be declared by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments. In addition Canada's federal government and any of its provincial governments can suspend, for five years at a time, Charter rights to fundamental freedoms in section 2, to legal rights in sections 7 through 14, and to equality rights in section 15 by legislation which invokes the notwithstanding clause, section 33, and therefore emergency powers can effectively be created even without using the Emergency Act. Provincial governments can also invoke states of emergency, and have done to respond to at least 12 incidents during the 21st century. =Denmark= The police chief in a district can impose a zone in which people can be body searched without a specific suspicion. Such an order must be issued in writing, published, and imposed for a limited period. The police law (article 6) regulates this area. The normal procedure calls for assisting the suspect to a private area and stripping them.Politi: De unge klager over racistiske betjente (The police: Youth complain over racist cops), by Andreas Lindqvist, Politiken, 18 February 2008 The police can also impose a zone in which specific crimes such as violence, threats, blackmailing and vandalism can be punished with a double penalty length. The zone can only be imposed if there is an extraordinary crime development and the zone can only last up to three months unless the extraordinary crime development still applies after that period of time. If the police feel that a situation involving a crowd of people can get out of hand, they can order the assembly to be dissolved and \\"pass the street\\" in the name of the king. People that after three such warnings are still part of the crowd can then without further warning be subjugated to mass arrest. All people arrested can then be detained for 24 hours without charging them or taking them for a judge. This is called a precluding arrest. =Egypt= Egyptians lived under an Emergency Law (Law No. 162 of 1958)Law 1958/162 (Emergency Law) at EMERglobal Lex, part of the Edinburgh Middle East Report. Retrieved 2 April 2010. from 1967 to 2012, except for an 18-month break in 1980 and 1981. The emergency was imposed during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and reimposed following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat. The law continuously extended every three years since 1981. Under the law, police powers were extended, constitutional rights suspended and censorship was legalized. The law sharply circumscribed any non- governmental political activity: street demonstrations, non-approved political organizations, and unregistered financial donations were formally banned. Some 17,000 people were detained under the law, and estimates of political prisoners run as high as 30,000. The emergency rule expired on 31 May 2012, and was put back in place in January 2013. Egypt declared a month-long national emergency on 14 August 2013. The Egyptian president announced a one- month state of emergency across the country on 14 August 2013 and ordered the armed forces to help the Interior Ministry enforce security. The announcement made on state TV followed deadly countrywide clashes between supporters of deposed President Mohammed Morsi and the security forces. =Ethiopia= =France= State of emergency in Paris, November 2015 Three main provisions concern various kind of \\"state of emergency\\" in France: Article 16 of the Constitution of 1958 allows, in time of crisis, \\"extraordinary powers\\" to the president. Article 36 of the same constitution regulates \\"state of siege\\" (√©tat de si√®ge). Finally, the Act of 3 April 1955 allows the proclamation, by the Council of Ministers, of the \\"state of emergency\\" (√©tat d'urgence). The distinction between article 16 and the 1955 Act concerns mainly the distribution of powers: whereas in article 16, the executive power basically suspend the regular procedures of the Republic, the 1955 Act permits a twelve- day state of emergency, after which a new law extending the emergency must be voted by the Parliament. These dispositions have been used at various times, in 1955, 1958, 1961, 1988, 2005, and 2015. =Germany= The Weimar Republic constitution (1919‚Äì1933)Weimar constitution technically remained in effect throughout the Nazi era (1933‚Äì1945). allowed states of emergency under Article 48 to deal with rebellions. Article 48 was often invoked during the 14-year life of the Republic, sometimes for no reason other than to allow the government to act when it was unable to obtain a parliamentary majority. After the 27 February 1933, Reichstag fire, an attack blamed on the communists, Adolf Hitler declared a state of emergency using Article 48, and then had President von Hindenburg sign the Reichstag Fire Decree, which suspended some of the basic civil liberties provided by the Weimar Constitution (such as habeas corpus, freedom of expression, freedom of the speech, the freedom to assemble or the privacy of communications) for the whole duration of the Third Reich. On 23 March, the Reichstag enacted the Enabling Act of 1933 with the required two-thirds majority, which enabled Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the legislative. (The Weimar Constitution was never actually repealed by Nazi Germany, but it effectively became ineffective after the passage of the Enabling Act.) These two laws implemented the Gleichschaltung, the Nazis' institution of totalitarianism. In the postwar Federal Republic of Germany the Emergency Acts state that some of the basic constitutional rights of the Basic Law may be limited in case of a state of defence, a state of tension, or an internal state of emergency or disaster (catastrophe). These amendments to the constitution were passed on 30 May 1968, despite fierce opposition by the so- called extra-parliamentary opposition (see German student movement for details). =Hong Kong SAR (China)= During a state of war or turmoil which threatens national security or unity, and which the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress believes is beyond the control of the local government, the Standing Committee can invoke Article 18 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and declare a \\"State of Emergency\\" in Hong Kong; thus, the Central People's Government can selectively implement national laws not normally allowed in Hong Kong. Deployment of troops from the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison under the \\"Law of the People's Republic of China on Garrisoning the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\\" can happen. The Chief Executive of Hong Kong along with the Executive Council can prohibit public gatherings, issue curfew orders, prohibit the movement of vessels or aircraft, delegate authority, and other listed powers, under \\"Cap. 245 Public Order Ordinance\\". Although the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison may not interfere in internal Hong Kong affairs, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government may invoke Article 14 of the Hong Kong Basic Law and request permission of the Central People's Government to have the garrison assist in \\"maintenance of public order or disaster relief\\". Since 1997, a State of Emergency has never been declared. However, emergency measures have been used in varying degrees over the years during British rule and after the establishment of the Special Administrative Region. A few notable mentions are as follow: * Seamen's strike of 1922 - Enactment of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, 1922 within one day on 28 February 1922 * Canton-Hong Kong strike 1925 - with involvement of police and soldiers from multiple nations *Anti- Japanese riot of 1931 - with involvement of Hong Kong Police and British Armed Forces * Hong Kong 1956 riots ‚Äì with involvement of British Armed Forces and Hong Kong Police * Hong Kong 1966 riots ‚Äì with involvement of British Armed Forces and Hong Kong Police * Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots ‚Äì with involvement of British Armed Forces and Hong Kong Police * Hong Kong 1981 riots ‚Äì with involvement of Hong Kong Police *2005 WTO Conference Protests - with involvement of Hong Kong Police and anti-globalization protesters led by Hong Kong People's Alliance on WTO from 148 countries * 2014 Hong Kong protests - with involvement of Hong Kong Police * 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest - with involvement of Hong Kong Police * 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests - with involvement of Hong Kong Police On 4 October 2019, Carrie Lam, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong S.A.R., invoked Section 2(1) within \\"Cap. 241 Emergency Regulations Ordinance\\" implemented since 1922 and last amended by the Legislative Council in 1999, which allow the government to implement the new, \\"Cap. 241K Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation\\". The new regulation forbid public assembly participants from wearing masks or obscure faces during such events without reasonable excuses. The permitted excuses are: pre-existing medical or health reasons, religious reasons, and if the person uses the face covering for physical safety while performing an activity connected with their profession or employment. Any person defying the new regulation face possible criminal prosecution. The government's motive in doing so is to end months of social unrest and riots, however, did not declare a \\"State of Emergency\\". The new regulation took effect at 00:00 HKT on 5 October 2019. Offenders risked a maximum of one-year imprisonment or a fine of HK$25,000 (US$3,200). The High Court of Hong Kong denied an application for a judicial injunction of the anti-mask law, on the same night shortly before the new regulation took effect. A subsequent attempt by pro-democrats to halt the new regulation also failed, however, the court recommended a judicial review at a later date. On 18 November 2019, the High Court ruled the \\"Cap. 241 Emergency Regulations Ordinance\\" is \\"incompatible with the Basic Law\\", however, the court \\"leaves open the question of the constitutionality of the ERO insofar as it relates to any occasion of emergency.\\" The court also held the ordinance meets the \\"prescribed by law\\" requirement. However, the court deemed s3(1)(b), (c), (d) and s5 of the regulation do not meet the proportionality test as they impose restrictions on fundamental rights that goes beyond what is necessary in furthering its intended goals. On 22 November 2019, the High Court made the following remark: \\"Nevertheless, we recognise that our Judgment is only a judgment at first instance, and will soon be subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal. In view of the great public importance of the issues raised in this case, and the highly exceptional circumstances that Hong Kong is currently facing, we consider it right that we should grant a short interim suspension order so that the respondents may have an opportunity to apply to the Court of Appeal, if so advised, for such interim relief as may be appropriate. Accordingly, we shall grant an interim temporary suspension order to postpone the coming into operation of the declarations of invalidity for a period of 7 days up to the end of 29 November 2019, with liberty to apply.\\" On 26 November 2019, the High Court announced hearing for the government appeal against the judgement is on 9 January 2020. On 27 November 2019, the Court of Appeal extended the interim suspension of the judgment until 10 December 2019. On 10 December 2019, the Court of Appeal refused to suspend the \\"unconstitutional\\" ruling by the Court of First Instance on the anti-mask regulation. As scheduled, a full hearing will commence on 9 January 2020. =Hungary= According to the Hungarian Constitution, the National Assembly of Hungary can declare state of emergency in case of armed rebellion or natural or industrial disaster. It expires after 30 days, but can be extended. Most civil rights can be suspended, but basic human rights (such as the right to life, the ban of torture, and freedom of religion) cannot. During state of emergency, the Parliament cannot be disbanded. =Iceland= The Icelandic constitution provides no mechanism for the declaration of war, martial law nor state of emergency. =India= The State of Emergency can be proclaimed by the President of India, when he/she perceives grave threats to the nation, albeit through the advice of the cabinet of ministers. Part XVIII of the Constitution of India gives the President the power to overrule many provisions, including the ones guaranteeing fundamental rights to the citizens of India In India, a state of emergency was declared twice: # Between 26 October 1962 to 10 January 1968 during the India-China war ‚Äî \\"the security of India\\" having been declared \\"threatened by external aggression\\". # Between 3 December 1971 to 21 March 1977 originally proclaimed during the Indo Pakistan war, and later extended on 25 June 1975, along with the third proclamation ‚Äî \\"the security of India\\" having been declared \\"threatened by external aggression\\" and by \\"internal disturbances\\" The first internal Emergency was declared by the president, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed on advice of the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi The provisions of the Constitution allows the Prime Minister to rule by decree. =Ireland= In Ireland declaring a state of \\"national emergency\\" involves Article 28.3.3¬∞ of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, which states that: In addition, during a \\"war or armed rebellion\\", military tribunals may try civilians, and the Defence Forces are not bound by habeas corpus. The First Amendment of the Constitution of 1939 allows an emergency to be declared during wars in which the state is a non-belligerent, subject to resolutions by the houses of the Oireachtas. By the 2nd Amendment of 1941, an emergency ends, not automatically when the war does, but only by Oireachtas resolutions. The 21st Amendment of 2002 prevents the reintroduction of capital punishment during an emergency. The first amendment was rushed through the Oireachtas after the outbreak of the Second World War, in which the state remained neutral. Immediately after, the required resolution was passed, in turn enabling the passage of the Emergency Powers Act 1939 (EPA), which granted the government and its ministers sweeping powers to issue statutory orders termed \\"Emergency Powers Orders\\" (EPOs). (The period in Ireland was and is referred to as \\"The Emergency\\".) The EPA expired in 1946, although some EPOs were continued under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act 1946 until as late as 1957. Rationing continued until 1951. The 1939 state of emergency was not formally ended until a 1976 resolution, which also declared a new state of emergency in relation to the Troubles in Northern Ireland and in particular the recent assassination of the British ambassador to Ireland, Christopher Ewart Biggs.; The Emergency Powers Act 1976 was then passed to increase the Garda S√≠och√°na powers to arrest, detain, and question those suspected of offences against the state. President Cearbhall √ì D√°laigh referred the bill under Article 26 of the Constitution to the Supreme Court, which upheld its constitutionality.In re Article 26 and the Emergency Powers Bill 1976 Supreme Court The referral was condemned by minister Paddy Donegan as a \\"thundering disgrace\\", causing √ì D√°laigh to resign in protest. The 1976 EPA expired after one year, but the state of emergency persisted until 1995, when as part of the Northern Ireland peace process it was rescinded as a \\"confidence building measure\\" to satisfy physical force republicans after the Provisional IRA's 1994 ceasefire. The Offences against the State Act does not require a state of emergency under Article 28.3.3¬∞. Part V of the Act, which provides for a non-jury Special Criminal Court (SCC), is permitted under Article 38.3.1¬∞. Part V is activated by a declaration from the government that it is \\"necessary to secure the preservation of public peace and order\\", and it can be rescinded by vote of D√°il √âireann. Provision for internment is similarly activated and rescinded (originally by Part VI of the 1939 act, later by Part II of a 1940 amending act).; Hederman Report 2002, Chapter 5 generally, especially ¬ß¬ß5.28‚Äì33 Parts V and VI were both activated during the Second World War and the IRA's late 1950s Border Campaign; Part V has been continually active since 1972. Several official reviews of the Constitution and the Offences Against the State Acts have recommended a time limit within which the operation of Article 28.3.3¬∞ or Article 38.3.1¬∞ must either be explicitly renewed by resolution or else lapse.Hederman Report 2002, Chapter 9 generally, especially ¬ß9.44 =Israel= Israel's Emergency Defence Regulations are older than the state itself, having been passed under the British Mandate for Palestine in 1945. A repeal was briefly considered in 1967 but cancelled following the Six-Day War. The regulations allow Israel, through its military, to control movements and prosecute suspected terrorists in occupied territories, and to censor publications that are deemed prejudicial to national defense. =Italy= In Italy, the state of emergency planned by the legal system is implemented by the Council of Ministers, without the need of a parliamentary vote, due to the Law n. 225 of 1992 on Civil Protection.Stati di emergenza, Protezione Civile Moreover, the Article 120 of the Constitution provides that the government can exercise \\"substitute powers\\" of local authorities in typically situations: to protect the legal or economic unity of the state, in case of violation of supranational laws and to face a serious danger for safety and public safety.Le situazioni di emergenza e di grave necessit√† pubblica, in La pubblica sicurezza, G. Motzo, Vicenza, 1967 For other emergency, such as a war, a parliamentary vote is required to give extraordinary powers to the government.Lo stato di eccezione ed ordinamento democratico, Giampiero Buonomo The Parliament can also give extraordinary powers to the government in case of health emergency, as it occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when the Parliament approved a state of emergency from 31 January to 15 October 2020, thanks to what the government can implement administrative acts, without the approval of the Parliament.Conte Says Italy to Extend State of Emergency to October, Bloomberg =Macau SAR (China)= The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress can declare a state of emergency and deploy troops from the People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison under the Article 14 of Macau's Basic Law on the defence of the Macau Special Administrative Region. Since 1999 no emergency measure have been enacted. Prior to 1999 emergency measures have been used for 1 major incident: * 12-3 incident (1966) ‚Äì with martial law invoked and involvement of Portuguese troops =Malaysia= In Malaysia, if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Monarch) is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security, or the economic life, or public order in the Federation or any part thereof is threatened, he may issue a Proclamation of Emergency making therein a declaration to that effect.Clause 1(A), Article 150, Constitution of Malaysia In the history of Malaysia, a state of emergency was declared by the then-colonial government of Britain. The state of emergency lasted from 1948 until 1960 to deal with the communists led by Chin Peng. States of emergency were also declared during the Konfrontasi in 1962, the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis and 1977 Kelantan Emergency. When a race riot broke out on 13 May 1969, a state of emergency was declared. On 11 August 2005, a state of emergency was announced for the world's 13th-largest port, Port Klang and the district of Kuala Selangor after air pollution there reached dangerous levels (defined as a value greater than 500 on the Air Pollution Index or API). Thierry Rommel, the European Commission's envoy to Malaysia, told Reuters by telephone on 13 November 2007 (the last day of his mission) that, \\"Today, this country still lives under (a state of) emergency.\\" Although not officially proclaimed as a state of emergency, the Emergency Ordinance and the Internal Security Act had allowed detention for years without trial. On 23 June 2013, a state of emergency was declared by Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak for Muar and Ledang, Johor as smoke from land- clearing fires in Indonesia pushed air pollution index to above 750. This was the first time in years that air quality had dipped to a hazardous level with conditions worsening as dry weather persisted and fires raged in Sumatra. =Maldives= A state of emergency was declared on 26 December 2004, following the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami. The resulting tsunamis caused extensive damage to the country's infrastructure, cutting off communications from large swathes of the nation, decimating islands and forcing the closure of a number of resorts due to the damage. On 5 February 2018, a state of emergency was declared by Maldives's President Abdulla Yameen for 15 days and ordered security forces into the supreme court and arrested a former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and the Chief Justice of Honorable Supreme court of Maldives. = Namibia = Namibia declared last a State of Emergency due to an ongoing drought in 2016.0,Declaration of State of Emergency: National Disaster (Drought): Namibian Consitution. Government Gazette, Republic of Namibia, No 6056, 28 June 2016. =New Zealand= The Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 gives the Government of New Zealand and local-body councils the power to issue a state of emergency, either over the entire country or within a specific region. This may suspend ordinary work and essential services if need be. States of emergency in New Zealand expire on the commencement of the seventh day after the date of a declaration, unless extended. However, the Minister of Civil Defence or a local mayor may lift a state of emergency after an initial review of a region's status. * On 25 March 2020 at 12.21pm, the Minister for Civil Defence Peeni Henare declared a state of national emergency in response to the total cases of COVID-19 reaching 205. Combined with an epidemic notice issued under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006, the state of emergency declaration enabled authorities to close most premises in New Zealand and enforce a nationwide lockdown. This also provided access to special powers to combat COVID-19, including powers of requisition and closing roads and restricting movement. Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management Sarah Stuart-Black said these powers sat alongside other powers to ensure essential services could stay up and running. The state of national emergency was renewed four times, to last for a total of five weeks. * On 23 February 2011 at 11.28am the Minister of Civil Defence John Carter declared the first state of national emergency (for a civil-defence emergency) in New Zealand's history in response to the 22 February, 2011 Christchurch earthquake. A local state of emergency was declared following the 4 September, 2010 Canterbury earthquake. * In 1951 the Holland government issued emergency regulations in response to that year's waterfront dispute. Waterfront Strike Emergency Regulations 1951, via New Zealand Legal Information Institute. =Nigeria= In Nigeria, a state of emergency is usually declared in times of great civil unrest. In recent years, it has specifically been implemented in reaction to terrorist attacks on Nigerians by the Islamic jihadist group Boko Haram. On 14 May 2013, Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency for the entire northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. A more limited state of emergency had been declared on 31 December 2011 in parts of Yobe, Borno, Plateau and Niger states. This earlier declaration included the temporary shutdown of the international borders in those regions. =Pakistan= In Pakistan, a state of emergency was declared five times in its history: * In 1958 by President Iskander Mirza * In 1969 by President General Yahya Khan * In 1977 by President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq * In 1998 by President Muhammad Rafiq Tarar * In 2007 by President General Pervez Musharraf The first three were regarded as the imposition of direct martial law. = Philippines= =Portugal= Letter from the Portuguese President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, to the Speaker of the Assembly of the Republic, Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues, requesting Parliament for authorisation under the terms of the Constitution, for a declaration of the state of emergency in the context of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic The current Constitution of Portugal empowers the President of the Republic to declare a state of siege () or a state of emergency () in part or the entirety of the Portuguese territory, only in cases of actual or imminent aggression by foreign forces, serious threats to or disturbances of the democratic constitutional order, or public disasters. Such declarations allow the entities that exercise sovereignty from suspending the exercise of some of the constitutionally defined rights, freedoms and guarantees, so that the public authorities can take the appropriate and strictly necessary measures for the prompt restoration of constitutional normality; the Constitution, however, sets a temporal limit for these states of emergency (no more than fifteen days, even though renewal is possible) and forbids any suspension of the right to life, to personal integrity, to personal identity, to civil capacity and citizenship, the non-retroactivity of criminal law, the right to a fair trial, or the freedom of conscience and religion. They also may not affect the constitutionally-defined competences and mode of operation of the entities that exercise sovereignty. The Assembly of the Republic may not be dissolved while a state of siege or a state of emergency is in force, nor can the Constitution itself be subject to amendment. Before declaring a state of siege or a state of emergency, the President is required to consult with the Government and request authorisation to do so from the Assembly of the Republic. During the Third Portuguese Republic, the only two times such states of exceptional suppression of constitutional provisions were declared were during the failed left-wing coup d'√©tat of 25 November 1975 (state of siege, within the confines of the Lisbon Military Region), and during the COVID-19 pandemic (state of emergency, in the entirety of the Portuguese territory). Within the remit of the basic law of civil protection services, the Prime Minister can, through a Resolution of the Council of Ministers and without the need of parliamentary approval or presidential promulgation, decree a situation of calamity (). Lesser exceptional statuses, the situation of contingency () and the situation of alert () in descending order of importance, can also be set in motion by other civil protection authorities or Mayors. These three situations allow for some extraordinary measures and special restrictions, but not the suspension of constitutional rights and freedoms. =Romania= In Romania, there are two types of states of emergency, each designed for a different type of situation. * State of alert (Stare de alertƒÉ in Romanian): Non-military, can be enforced by a prefect. Roadblocks are enforced. Any utilitarian vehicle or equipment can be temporarily used by the state, without any restriction. Evacuation is not mandatory, unless extreme circumstances apply. Only EMS, Police and firefighting personnel are required to intervene. This situation can be enforced in case of natural disasters or civil unrest. * State of emergency (stare de urgentƒÉ in Romanian): Can only be enforced by the President of Romania with approval from Parliament. The military becomes the upper form of control in the country (under the rule of the president). The civilian population is subject to strict regulations, imposed by the type of emergency. All private and public non-crucial activities are suspended. Essential services might be disrupted. This situation can be enforced in case of extreme circumstances, such as a war. * Special zone of public safety (ZonƒÉ specialƒÉ de siguran»õƒÉ publicƒÉ in Romanian): Administrative, can be enforced by local police. This implies installation of road check-points and higher numbers in police and gendarmes/ riot police presence, patrolling the area. There is also a ban that restricts the right to travel for people in the area; any vehicle and individual transiting the zone are subject to screening.Silviu Molnar, Security Zone in Pungesti Heavily Criticized by European Greens, Natural Gas Europe, 19 December 2013, Retrieved 23 December 2013Comuna Punge»ôti, declaratƒÉ ‚ÄûzonƒÉ specialƒÉ de siguran»õƒÉ publicƒÉ, AdevƒÉrul, 19 December 2013, Retrieved 23 December 2013 The most well-known event in which the state of emergency has been enforced was because of 1977 Vrancea earthquake. The last instance in which the special zone of public safety was enforced was on 8 December 2013-ongoing, in Punge»ôti, Vaslui following civil unrest in Punge»ôti from Chevron's plans to begin exploring shale-gas in the village.Gabriel Petrescu, Chevron Moves Forward in Romania Following Establishment of Special Security Zone, Natural Gas Europe, 14 December 2013, Retrieved 23 December 2013 According to police officials, the special security zone will be maintained as long as there is conflict in the area that poses a threat to Chevron's operations. This special security zone has faced domestic and international criticism for alleged human-rights abuses. =Russia= = Sierra Leone = Sierra Leone declared, on 7 February 2019, a State of Emergency due to ongoing rape and sexual violence in the country.Statement for the Declaration of Rape and Sexual Violence as a National Emergency by His Excellency President Julius Maada Bio State House, 7th February 2019. On 24 March 2020, a state of emergency was declared by His Excellency (Rtd) Brigadier Julius Madaa Bio due to global pandemic of the coronavirus. =South Africa= States of emergency in South Africa are governed by section 37 of the Constitution and by the State of Emergency Act, 1997. The President may declare a state of emergency only when \\"the life of the nation is threatened by war, invasion, general insurrection, disorder, natural disaster or other public emergency\\" and if the ordinary laws and government powers are not sufficient to restore peace and order. The declaration is made by proclamation in the Government Gazette and may only apply from the time of publication, not retroactively. It can only continue for 21 days unless the National Assembly grants an extension, which may be for at most three months at a time. The High Courts have the power, subject to confirmation by the Constitutional Court, to determine the validity of the declaration of a state of emergency. During a state of emergency the President has the power to make emergency regulations \\"necessary or expedient\\" to restore peace and order and end the emergency. This power can be delegated to other authorities. Emergency measures can violate the Bill of Rights, but only to a limited extent. Some rights are inviolable, including amongst others the rights to life and to human dignity; the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or religion; the prohibition of torture or inhumane punishment; and the right of accused people to a fair trial. Any violation of a constitutional right must be strictly required by the emergency. Emergency measures may not indemnify the government or individuals for illegal actions. They may impose criminal penalties, but not exceeding three years' imprisonment. They may not require military service beyond that required by the ordinary laws governing the defence force. An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of Parliament or the provincial legislatures. The courts have the power to determine the validity of any emergency measure. The constitution places strict limits on any detention without trial during a state of emergency. A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the Government Gazette. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. He or she must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person. The provisions on detention without trial do not apply to prisoners of war in an international conflict; instead they must be treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and other international law. =Spain= In Spain, there are three degrees of state of emergency (estado de emergencia in Spanish): alarma (alarm or alert), excepci√≥n (exception[al circumstance]) and sitio (siege). They are named by the constitution, which limits which rights may be suspended, but regulated by the \\"Ley Org√°nica 4/1981\\" (Organic Law). On 4 December 2010, the first state of alert was declared following the air traffic controllers strike. It was the first time since the Francisco Franco's regime that a state of emergency was declared. The second state of alert was declared on 14 March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. =Sri Lanka= In Sri Lanka, the President is able to proclaim emergency regulations under the Public Security Ordinance in the constitution in order to preserve public security and public order; suppression of mutiny, riot or civil commotion; or maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. These regulations last for one month unless confirmed otherwise by Parliament. =Switzerland= According to Art. 185 of the Swiss Federal Constitution The Federal Council (Bundesrat) can call up in their own competence military personnel of maximum 4000 militia for three weeks to safeguard inner or outer security (called Federal Intervention or Federal Execution, respectively). A larger number of soldiers or of a longer duration is subject to parliamentary decision. For deployments within Switzerland the principle of subsidiarity rules: as a first step, unrest has to be overcome with the aid of cantonal police units. =Syria= An emergency prevailed in Syria from 1962 to 2011. Originally predicated on the conflict with Israel, the emergency acted to centralize authority in the presidency and the national security apparatus while silencing public dissent. The emergency was terminated in response to protests that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Under the 2012 constitution, the president may pass an emergency decree with a 2/3 concurrence of his ministers, provided that he presents it to the legislature for constitutional review. =Trinidad and Tobago= A state of emergency was declared in 1970 during the Black Power Revolution by then Prime Minister Eric Williams. During the attempted state coup by the Jamaat al Muslimeen against the NAR government of the then Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson, a state of emergency was declared during the coup attempt and for a period after the coup. On 4 August 1995, a state of emergency was declared to remove the Speaker of the House Occah Seepaul by Prime Minister Patrick Manning during a constitutional crisis. The government had attempted to remove the speaker via a no-confidence motion, which failed. The state of emergency was used to remove the speaker using the emergency powers granted. The Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar announced a state of emergency on 22 August 2011 at 8:00 pm in an attempt to crack down on the trafficking of illegal drugs and firearms, in addition to gangs. The decision of the President, George Maxwell Richards, to issue the proclamation for the state of emergency was debated in the country's Parliament as required by the Constitution on 2 September 2011 and passed by the required simple majority of the House of Representatives. On 4 September the Parliament extended the state of emergency for a further 3 months. It ended in December 2011. =Turkey= Since the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 the military conducted three coups d'√©tat and announced martial law. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency that lasted until November 2002. The latest state of emergency was declared by President Erdoƒüan on 20 July 2016 following a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016 by a faction of the country's armed forces. It was lifted on 18 July 2018. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, only the British Sovereign,The sovereign of the UK always follows the advice of the Prime Minister on any action with constitutional significance on the advice of the Privy Council, or a Minister of the Crown in exceptional circumstances, has the power to introduce emergency regulations under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, in case of an emergency, broadly defined as war or attack by a foreign power, terrorism which poses a threat of serious damage to the security of the UK, or events which threaten serious damage to human welfare or the environment of a place in the UK. The duration of these regulations is limited to thirty days, but may be extended by Parliament. A state of emergency was last invoked in 1974 by Prime Minister Edward Heath in response to increasing industrial action. The act grants wide-ranging powers to central and local government in the event of an emergency. It allows the modification of primary legislation by emergency regulation, with the exception of the Human Rights Act 1998 and Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. =United States= The United States Constitution implicitly provides some emergency powers in the article about the executive power : * Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion. * Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of habeas corpus \\"when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\\" * Felony charges may be brought without presentment or grand jury indictment in cases arising \\"in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger.\\" * A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if \\"actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\\" Aside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The National Emergencies Act regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency. Presidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1953) A state governor or local mayor may declare a state of emergency within his or her jurisdiction. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The Federal Emergency Management Agency maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on 10 December 2015, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains. The 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an \\"unusual and extraordinary threat\\" to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of Iran. Another ongoing national emergency, declared after the September 11 attacks, authorizes the president to retain or reactivate military personnel beyond their normal term of service.US Presidential Proclamation 7463 =Venezuela= Examples =Active in 2020= * On 15 October 2020, Thai's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha declared a state of extreme emergency in Bangkok due to 2020 Thai protests. * On 9 October 2020, Kyrgyzstan's President Sooronbay Jeenbekov declared a state of emergency due to the 2020 Kyrgyzstan protests. * On 25 August 2020, Wisconsin's Governor Tony Evers declared a state of emergency due to Kenosha unrest. * On 18 August 2020, California's Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency because of the multiple wildfires being battled across the state. * On 5 August 2020, Lebanon's Prime Minister Hassan Diab declared a state of emergency after the 2020 Beirut explosion. * On 6 July 2020, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency for the sudden rampant violent crime and property destruction in the state. * On 31 May 2020, Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency for the George Floyd protests. * On 31 May 2020, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency for the George Floyd protests. * On 31 May 2020, Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for the George Floyd protests. * On 31 May 2020, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency for the George Floyd protests. * On 31 May 2020, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey declared a state of emergency for the George Floyd protests. * On 28 May 2020, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz declared a state of emergency for the George Floyd protests. * On 9 April 2020, Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi declared a state of emergency. * On 25 March 2020, New Zealand Minister for Civil Defence Peeni Henare declared a National State Of Emergency for COVID-19. * On 25 March 2020, Prime Minister of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha declared a state of emergency for COVID-19.https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1885700/govt-to-invoke- emergency-rule/ * On 22 March 2020, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil declared a state of emergency for COVID-19.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-to-provide- covid-19-update-sunday-march-22-1.5505859 * On 21 March 2020, Kyrgyzstan Prime Minister Mukhammedkalyi Abylgaziev declared a state of emergency for COVID-19.https://tass.ru/obschestvo/8043667 * On 21 March 2020, Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili declared a state of emergency for COVID-19. * On 18 March 2020, Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel declared a state of emergency for COVID-19. *On 18 March 2020, Portugal President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa declared a state of emergency for COVID-19.

The series tells the story of a young man named Johnny ‚ÄúNny‚Äù C. as he explores the psychological and possibly supernatural forces which compel him to commit a string of murders with which he always seems to get away. JtHM began as a comic strip in the 1990s, then ran under alternative comics publisher Slave Labor Graphics as a limited series of seven issues, later collected in the trade paperback Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut. The series produced two spin-offs: Squee! and I Feel Sick. Creation Vasquez started drawing in kindergarten. He attended Mount Pleasant High School, where he took a part in a contest to design the Cardinal as a school's mascot. Vasquez submitted an entry, but the judges rejected it. On the back of a preliminary drawing for the contest, he drew his first sketch of the character he would later name Johnny C. Vasquez's high school's student newspaper published a number of comic strips titled Johnny the Little Homicidal Maniac. Vasquez says the character originated as a personal avatar who could carry out his own revenge fantasies. Comic book artist and filmmaker Rob Schrab makes the same observation. However, Vasquez later distanced himself from the character, saying that Johnny should not be mistaken for an author surrogate. Vasquez also created Happy Noodle Boy while attending Mount Pleasant as a way to stop his girlfriend from asking him to draw comics for her. In the early 1990s, Carpe Noctem, a magazine about the goth subculture, published several one-page strips featuring Johnny, now called Johnny the Homicidal Maniac.Carpe Noctem. Though he never planned to create comic books, Vasquez submitted samples of his artwork to alternative comics publisher Slave Labor Graphics. Between August 1995 and January 1997, the publisher released a series of seven full-length issues based on the character. Vasquez describes the production process for Johnny as a \\"mess\\" and a \\"spew\\". As Vasquez worked on the comic, he prepared less and less, foregoing outlines and sketches and writing dialogue as he inked. Vasquez wishes that he had taken more time to plan the series, and feels that the quality of the dialogue suffered from his haphazard approach. A photograph of one of Vasquez's friends, Leah England, serves as the middle of a portrait collection on the cover of the second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. England also gave Vasquez the inspiration for a filler strip about a child who was dangerously afraid of losing sight of his mother, as well as the \\"Meanwhile...\\" strip in the second issue. The two were discussing an event that had happened to a cheerleader, and thinking up the worst excuse possible. Jhonen based Psychodoughboy and Mr. Eff on two real Styrofoam Pillsbury Doughboy display figures that he found and painted. He created Nailbunny as he was drawing the first page on which the character appears. Vasquez modeled for himself while drawing the characters. Vasquez intended a tapeworm named Scolex to be one of Johnny's voices, but the character never made it into the finished series. Vasquez now uses Chancre Scolex as a pen name for Everything Can Be Beaten and his LiveJournal. Like many alternative comics, and other Slave Labor Graphics titles, Johnny is creator-owned. By September 1996, Vasquez announced in his introduction to the sixth issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac that he had reached sufficient success in his artistic career to be able to quit his day-job and devote himself full-time to his art. As his comics moved from dedicated comic book shops into shopping malls, Vasquez bemoaned the attendant change in his audience. Vasquez created his own animated series Invader Zim, and became uncomfortable with younger fans of Zim reading Johnny, because of the violence depicted. Director's Cut The front cover of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut trade paperback shows Happy Noodle Boy, Mr. Samsa and Nailbunny. Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut, a trade paperback released by Slave Labor Graphics in July 1997, collected the series. Slave Labor also released a hardcover version of the collection. Rob Schrab provides a foreword. The trade paperback includes a \\"Gallery of Ancient Horrors\\" that features a few strips previously published in the Mount Pleasant High School newspaper and Carpe Noctem, as well as some strips previously unpublished, all with commentary by Vasquez. The paperback also introduces some new supplementary materials such as sketches, an issue-by-issue synopsis, character profiles, and a fictional interview with Vasquez, but leaves out many of the filler strips from the original series. The cover of the trade paperback features the logo \\"Z?\\", meaning \\"question sleep\\". \\"Z?\\" appears frequently throughout Vasquez's work and Question Sleep is the name of his official website. \\"Z?\\" is a reference to insomnia, a condition from which several of his characters suffer. Spin-offs Johnny the Homicidal Maniac spawned two spin-offs: a four-issue series titled Squee!, and a double-shot titled I Feel Sick. The trade paperback release of Squee!, titled Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors, includes the filler strips left out of Director's Cut. Johnny makes cameo appearances at the end of Squee! and in the second issue of I Feel Sick. Vasquez also maintains a Twitter account from the perspective of Johnny. Style The comic is high- contrast black and white with stylized and geometric cartoon characters. Graphical perspective is often very loose. The panel borders are jagged, and certain strips have messages hidden in the complex designs of the borders. Many of the characters are thin nearly to the point of being stick figures. Several of the characters, including Johnny, wear T-shirts with expressive messages that change from panel to panel. Vasquez often breaks the fourth wall with side comments to talk about the book, its audience, or himself. The speech balloons change with the moods of the characters. For example, Johnny's word balloons grow thorns when he becomes angry. Main characters =Johnny \\"Nny\\" C.= Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. The series focuses on Johnny C., a man in his early 20s who elaborately slaughters anyone who irritates him. He drains his victims of blood to paint over a wall in his house to prevent a monster from escaping. He is five feet, nine inches and one hundred and fifteen pounds. He likes stars, the emotionless function of insects, watching people get abducted by aliens, Cherry 'FizWiz', Cherry 'Brain-Freezies', all kinds of movies, Fruity Pops, the moon, little chubby babies, pop rocks and soda, and drawing Happy Noodle Boy. He dislikes humidity, sleep, the physical and mental need for anything, being abducted by aliens, people who've \\"GOTTA HAVE A SMOKE!\\", certain words (such as \\"wacky\\"), losing his mind, Satan's attitude and getting shot in the head (or just using a gun in general). Not much is known about Johnny's history. All that is known is that his parents were killed by an evil man, thus setting the course for Nny's life as a masked crime fighter, or, perhaps not. At present, Nny is more his own enemy than any external mind could be. What with the decomposure of what may have been, at one time, a fine, intelligent mind, Johnny is, possibly, more hideously mentally malformed than the people he seems to think have ruined his world. =Todd \\"Squee\\" Casil= Todd Casil (known as \\"Squee\\" due to the noise that he makes when frightened) is a young boy who lives in the house next to Johnny. Neither of his parents care for him, especially his father, who works countless hours at a dead end job and leads a miserable life after raising Squee. Squee's closest friend is a small teddy bear named Shmee. Shmee tells Squee that all of his fears and nightmares are inside of him in a dream. Squee is also friends with Satan's son, with whom he attends school. Squee has his own series called Squee!, which was later collected in the TPB Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book Of Unspeakable Horrors. Setting The series is set in the mid-1990s in an unspecified city. Decaying urban streets, shadowed back alleys and filthy convenience stores serve as the series‚Äô backdrop. Crumbling and covered with litter and graffiti, everything is in a state of bleak decay, overlit by the neon signs of trashy consumer capitalism. Johnny lives in a decrepit, single-story house with the street address 777. The house has an extensive labyrinth of tunnels underneath. Johnny uses the subterranean rooms as dungeons and torture chambers, as well as a storage place for corpses, though he also buries the remains of his victims. The tunnels also provide him with a network to various locations, such as his neighbor Squee's residence. Johnny perceives the layout of the house as constantly changing, though he does not state if this shifting is the result of the supernatural forces at work within the house or his own psychosis. Johnny states that he found the house and moved in some time ago. He also constructed an unidentified flying object landing pad on the roof. Throughout the series, there is no case where the authorities or the police are looking for Johnny, and they seem unaware of his existence. A later part of the story takes place in the afterlife. After accidentally shooting himself, Johnny journeys first to Heaven and then to Hell, and both turn out to have more in common with Earth than he expected. Synopsis The story is told in vignettes that reflect Johnny's disjointed mental state. Vasquez leaves unexplained which events in the story are objective and which are subjective, and provides no back-story about Johnny's origins. The series begins when Squee wakes in the middle of the night to find Johnny in the bathroom of his family's new house. After a confrontation with Squee's teddy bear, Shmee, Johnny leaves, informing Squee that they are neighbors. Later, Johnny goes on a rampage with a spork in a \\"Taco Hell\\" restaurant, incited by an elderly patron referring to him as \\"wacky\\". Following the slaughter, Johnny watches its coverage on the news. Later, Johnny captures and kills a man named Edgar Vargas and a beautiful woman. He goes on a date with Devi, a cashier, and attempts to stab her, but Devi escapes after nearly killing Johnny. Sometime afterward, he kills everyone in the Caf√© le Prick. Johnny realizes he cannot die or be brought to justice for his murders. He and the sentient floating head Nailbunny journey through the bowels of his house and discuss the nature of Johnny's psychosis. Along the way, Johnny kills a cockroach named Mr. Samsa (after Gregor Samsa, the main character of Franz Kafka's short story The Metamorphosis). Johnny also rigs a robotic arm and handgun to shoot him if he were to answer the phone if someone calls, further flaunting his belief in his own immortality. Eventually, Johnny's soul arrives in Heaven, where he meets St. Peter, who becomes physically ill with all that Johnny has done throughout his life. With him distracted, Johnny enters Heaven and meets a demon woman named Damned Elise who gives Johnny a tour. Johnny starts a massive psychic battle when he discovers that the souls in Heaven are immortal and have mental powers which includes the ability to explode people's heads. Later on in the tour, Johnny is brought before God, who is a lazy, obese man sitting in a chair in a state of exhaustion. Johnny starts a tirade that ends with Elise sending him to Hell. Johnny meets Se√±or Diablo, who gives Johnny a tour of the underworld and reveals that Johnny is a \\"flusher\\" or \\"waste lock\\", a creature chosen to concentrate the spiritual byproducts generated by humans into a specific object or point in space, in this case the wall in Johnny's house. As Johnny died, the wall unleashed the built-up negative energy, in the process destroying the universe, which was then restored. Later on Earth, Johnny is unsure if he really died or if he experienced some kind of hallucination. He resolves to become emotionless. When a copycat killer named \\"Jimmy\\" pays Johnny a visit and confesses to several murders and a rape, Johnny eviscerates Jimmy. Afterward, Johnny visits Squee and tells him that he should look out for himself, otherwise he may become as mentally damaged as Johnny himself. The series ends with Johnny sitting on a cliff overlooking the city, writing in his diary, with the hopes that he will be \\"as cold as the moonlight\\" that touches the diary's pages. Filler strips Johnny the Homicidal Maniac features several filler strips, which, for the most part, have nothing to do with the main storyline. Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut collects \\"Happy Noodle Boy\\", \\"Public Service Announcement\\", and \\"Anne Gwish\\" while Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors includes \\"Wobbly- Headed Bob\\", \\"Meanwhile...\\", and \\"True Tales of Human Drama\\". =Happy Noodle Boy= There is also a comic within a comic in the form of \\"Happy Noodle Boy\\", written and drawn by Johnny himself. =Public Service Announcement= In a few issues, there are \\"Public Service Announcement\\" strips that parody television public service announcements on topics such as teen pregnancy and substance abuse. =Anne Gwish= Anne Gwish is a young goth woman that has her own strip in the later part of the series. Her name is a pun on the word \\"anguish.\\" Her storyline is completely unrelated to Johnny's, though she lives in the same fictional universe. The strips featuring her are largely a satire on the goth subculture. =Wobbly-Headed Bob= Wobbly-Headed Bob resolves to commit suicide. Wobbly-Headed Bob lives in a separate fictional universe from the main storyline, one inhabited by funny animals who, with the exception of Bob, live in a state of innocence and bliss. In contrast, Bob is a megalomaniac who believes himself to be the most intelligent person in the world, and the only one who understands the true nature of reality, which he sees in entirely pessimistic terms. His extreme negativity leaves him isolated and depressed. He overwhelms anyone he meets with his despair and often causes them to either commit suicide or flee from him in horror. =Meanwhile...= In one \\"Meanwhile...\\" strip, a group of pi√±atas come to life to exact revenge on a girl whose birthday party claimed one of their own. In another, two ancient gods of war possess a pair of grade school crossing guards to reenact an epic battle. In yet another, a na√Øve goth teenager, a character who also appears in I Feel Sick, dreams of becoming a sexy vampire like those found in The Vampire Chronicles, but transforms instead into a vampire more like Count Orlok. In one of the more infamous \\"Meanwhile...\\" strips, a nervous man on a date with Devi D. tries to conceal his explosive diarrhea. In an act of self- insertion, Jhonen Vasquez himself appears in other \\"Meanwhile...\\" strips. =True Tales of Human Drama= The strips titled \\"True Tales of Human Drama\\" tell stories about things such as a baby exploding, a plane crashing into a bus full of boy scouts, and a man blowing something out of his nose so horrible that a priest commands him to jump off a building. Reception On 5 April 2008, Wizard placed the third issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac at number 151 in its rundown of the 200 greatest comics since the magazine started in July 1991. Merchandise Over the years, Slave Labor Graphics has sold Johnny the Homicidal Maniac merchandise such as clothing, posters, and toys. Slave Labor released a Spooky squeeze toy, first shown in Johnny the Homicidal Maniac #4, as part of its promotion for I Feel Sick. Several years ago, a mug based on the design of the wall monster with the Question Sleep logo was under development.

When an action potential is generated, the membrane potential rises above this level in four distinct phases. The beginning of the action potential, phase 0, specialized membrane proteins (voltage-gated sodium channels) in the cell membrane selectively allow sodium ions to enter the cell. This causes the membrane potential to rise at a rate of about 300 V/s. As the membrane voltage rises (to about 40 mV) sodium channels close due to a process called inactivation. The Na+ channel opening is followed by inactivation. Na+ inactivation comes with slowly activating Ca2+ channels at the same time as a few fast K+ channels open. There is a balance between the outward flow of K+ and the inward flow of Ca2+ causing a plateau of length in variables. The delayed opening of more Ca2+-activated K+ channels, which are activated by build-up of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm, while the Ca2+ channels close, ends the plateau. This leads to repolarization. The depolarization of the membrane allows calcium channels to open as well. As sodium channels close calcium provides current to maintain the potential around 20 mV. The plateau lasts on the order of 100 ms. At the time that calcium channels are getting activated, channels that mediate the transient outward potassium current open as well. This outward potassium current causes a small dip in membrane potential shortly after depolarization. This current is observed in human and dog action potentials, but not in guinea pig action potentials. Repolarization is accomplished by channels that open slowly and are mostly activated at the end of the action potential (slow delayed-rectifier channels) and channels that open quickly but are inactivated until the end of the action potential (rapid delayed rectifier channels). Fast delayed rectifier channels open quickly but are shut by inactivation at high membrane potentials. As the membrane voltage begins to drop the channels recover from inactivation and carry current.

OPG continues to operate the Pickering stationhttps://www.opg.com/powering-ontario/our-generation/nuclear/pickering- nuclear-generation-station/. The Pickering station is one of the larger nuclear facilities in the worldList of nuclear power stations, comprising six operating CANDU nuclear reactors with a total output of 3,100 MW when all units are on line, and two non-operating units currently shut down in safe storagehttps://www.opg.com/powering-ontario/our-generation/nuclear/pickering- nuclear-generation-station/. The facility is connected to the North American power grid via numerous 230,000 and 500,000-volt transmission lineshttps://www.hydroone.com/abouthydroone/CorporateInformation/regionalplans/gtaeast/Documents/2016-Pickering- Ajax-Whitby-IRRP-Appendices.pdf. The facility was operated as two distinct stations, Pickering A (Units 1 to 4) and Pickering B (Units 5 to 8) until 2011https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-government- supports-opg-proposal-to-operate-pickering-nuclear/. While primarily administrative in nature, the division was not wholly artificial, as there are some distinct differences in design between the two groups of stations. (Example: The Pickering A units employ a moderator dump as a shutdown mechanismhttps://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/resources/research/technical-papers- and-articles/2016/Use-of-rod-based-guaranteed-shutdown-state-in-candu- reactors.cfm, a feature not found in Pickering B, which instead uses what is called an over-poisoned reaction guaranteed shutdownhttps://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:41126193.) There are, however, a number of systems and structures in common between the two stations; the most notable of these is the shared vacuum building, a negative pressure containment systemhttps://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/reactors/power- plants/nuclear-facilities/pickering-nuclear-generating-station/index.cfm. The operation of Pickering A and B was unified in 2010https://www.oeb.ca/oeb/_Documents/Decisions/dec_reasons_OPG_20141120.pdf, to reduce costs now that Pickering A Units 2 and 3 are shut down in safe storage. Partial shutdown On December 31, 1997 the four Pickering A reactors were shut down by Ontario Hydro and placed in lay up, suspending work on upgrades to the shutdown system. Ontario Hydro committed to restarting the units, but the project underwent long delays and large cost over-runs. Premier Mike Harris asked former federal energy Minister Jake Epp to study and make recommendations on the problems with the Pickering restart. The review panel was established in May 2003. Unit 4 was refurbished and then restarted in Sept. 2003. The election of the Ontario Liberal Party in October 2003 delayed action on the Epp report. In late 2003, the new government fired the top three executives of OPG for botching the Unit 4 restoration, which was years late and millions of dollars over budgethttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on- business/opg-cancels-pickering-repairs/article1121297/. Mr. Epp and the Pickering A Review Panel released their report in December 2003https://collections.ola.org/mon/7000/10317476.pdf, which acknowledged the large cost over-runs and delays, attributing blame to bad management. The Epp Review estimated the cost of restarting the remaining three reactors at $3 ‚Äì 4 billion and supported the continuation of the project. The government of Dalton McGuinty appointed Epp to the Ontario Power Generation Review headed by John Manley to examine the future role of Ontario Power Generation (OPG) in the province's electricity market, examine its corporate and management structure, and decide whether the public utility should proceed with refurbishing three more nuclear reactors at the Pickering nuclear power plant. The report recommended proceeding with the restart of Pickering ‚ÄúA‚Äù reactors 1, 2, and 3, sequentially. The report argued that the restart of units 2 and 3 would be contingent on whether ‚ÄúOPG will be able to succeed at the Unit 1 project.\\"Ontario Power Generation Review Committee, Transforming Ontario‚Äôs Power Generation Company, March 2004, p. 47 The McGuinty government accepted the OPG Review Committee's recommendation and allowed the refurbishment and restart of reactor 1, which still underwent cost over-runs and delays. The anti-nuclear group Sierra Club of Canada criticized the 2004 OPG Review Committee report for not attributing any blame to the problems of nuclear technology, noting that there were no energy or environmental experts appointed to the panel. Numerous changes in executive-level staff and project management strategy were made for the follow-on project to refurbish Unit 1. The experience of refurbishing Pickering A Unit 1 was significantly different from Unit 4, with a much tighter adherence to schedule and budget. In August 2005, the OPG Board of Directors announced that Units 2 and 3 would not be refurbished due to specific technical and cost risks surrounding the material condition of these two units. Unit 1 was returned to service in November 2005, providing 542 MW of generating capacity for Ontario's electricity system. Waste The used nuclear fuel and some refurbishment waste generated by the plant sits on-site at the Pickering Waste Management Facility. All operational low and intermediate-level waste is transported to OPG's Western Waste Management Facility at the Bruce nuclear site near Kincardine, Ontario. OPG has proposed the construction and operation of a deep geologic repository for the long-term storage of low and intermediate level waste on lands adjacent to the Western Waste Management Facility. The Nuclear Waste Management Organization is currently seeking a site for a potential repository for the used fuel from all Canadian nuclear reactors. Records \\\\- On October 7th, 1994, Pickering Unit 7 set the world record for continuous runtime at 894 days, a record that was held until 2016 when it was surpassed by Heysham 2 in the UK, owned by EDF. https://www.powermag.com/new-record-nuclear-power-plant- online-for-940-continuous-days/ \\\\- In 2019, Pickering set a site capacity factor record of 87.07%, producing 23.6TWh and putting it roughly on-par with the much newer Darlington and Bruce facilities. https://www.opg.com/story/pickering-nuclear-celebrates-record- setting-year/ Future In January 2016, the Province of Ontario approved plans to pursue continued operation of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station to 2024.Ontario Moving Forward with Nuclear Refurbishment at Darlington and Pursuing Continued Operations at Pickering to 2024. Ontario Government news release, Jan 11, 2016 OPG will work with the Ministry of Energy, the Independent Electricity System Operator and the Ontario Energy Board to pursue continued operation of the Pickering Station to 2024. All six units would operate until 2022; two units would then shut down and four units would operate to 2024. Extending Pickering's operation will ensure a reliable, clean source of base load electricity during refurbishment of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station and the initial Bruce Nuclear refurbishments. Any plan to extend Pickering's life requires approval from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). OPG is currently working on a licence application to the CNSC for approval in 2018. After operation of Pickering concludes, OPG will begin the longer term decommissioning process as refurbishment will not be pursued. The first step in the long term decommissioning process is to layup the reactors and place them into safe storage. Pickering staff will have future employment opportunities placing the Pickering units in a safe storage state, at the Darlington refurbishment and operations, or at the potential new build at Darlington. OPG has begun planning for the station's end of commercial operations including the potential repurposing of the Pickering site location.Repurposing Pickering, Ontario Power Generation website, Retrieved June 27, 2016 OPG will proceed with a detailed planning phase for the mid-life refurbishment of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station east of Toronto, with construction expected to start in 2016. The business decision to move forward with an investment in Darlington came after initial studies on the plant's condition operating performance returned positive results. In January 2016, the Province of Ontario announced its decision to proceed with refurbishment of Darlington. Incidents A serious incident occurred on 1 August 1983. Pressure tube G16 in the Pickering A Unit 2 reactor developed a 2 metre long split. The reactor was safely shut down and the damage investigated. The cause was found to be the mis-location of annulus gas spacer springs which allowed the hot pressure tube to sag and touch the inside of the cold calandria tube leading to hydrogen enrichment of the cooler areas. This created a series of small cracks which linked up and caused the long rupture. There was some local fuel damage and the reactor was safely shut down by the operators with no increase in radioactive emissions. The eventual resolution was Large Scale Fuel Channel Replacement and all the pressure tubes were replaced in all Pickering A reactors. The new pressure tubes were supported by an improved design of the annulus gas spacer springs. Since then, careful monitoring of the location of the annulus gas spacer rings has been a significant part of routine reactor inspections.EXAMINATION OF THE PRESSURE TUBE RUPTURE AT PICKERING NGS ‚ÄòA‚Äô UNIT 2, FUEL CHANNEL G16 On December 10, 1994 there was a loss of coolant accident. It is said to be the most serious accident in Canadian history (June 2001) by The Standing Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources. The Emergency Core Cooling System was used to prevent a meltdown.\\"Nuclear Threat in the Eastern Mediterranean\\" David H. Martin, June 2000, Page 10 (or page 17 of 106) \\"Pickering A Shutdown and Rehabilitation: A Brief History\\" page 4 (or page 11 of 51) In 1994 Pickering Unit 7 set a world record for continuous operation (894 days) without a shutdown. This record remained standing for 22 years, before finally being broken in August 2016 by Heysham 2 Unit 8, an AGR type reactor in the United Kingdom. On March 14, 2011, there was a leak of 73 cubic metres of demineralized water into Lake Ontario from a failed pump seal. There was negligible risk to the public according to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission.Pickering Nuclear plant reports water leak, CBC News, March 16 2011 = 2020 nuclear incident alert = On January 12, 2020 at 7:24 a.m. ET, an emergency alert was issued via Alert Ready on all radio stations, television stations, television providers, and wireless networks in the province of Ontario, containing an advisory of an unspecified \\"incident\\" that had been reported and was being addressed at the plant. The alert stated that no immediate action was required for those within of the plant. Approximately 40 minutes later, OPG issued a statement via Twitter that the alert had been sent in error, and a second emergency alert was issued at around 9:10 a.m. with a similar message cancelling the previous alert. Solicitor General Sylvia Jones stated that the alert was accidentally issued during a \\"routine training exercise\\" by Ontario's emergency operations centre. The incident prompted criticism from government officials, including MPP Peter Tabuns, Pickering mayor Dave Ryan, and Toronto mayor John Tory. The false alarm also prompted renewed interest in preparedness for actual nuclear accidents: OPG reported a surge in the sales of potassium iodide kits via its \\"Prepare to Be Safe\\" website between January 12 and 13, increasing from its monthly average of 100 to 200, to over 32,000. The website is applicable for those who live within of the plant; per Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) requirements, OPG is required to distribute these pills to all residences within of a nuclear facility.

Used primarily for training purposes, MCB Quantico is known as the \\"Crossroads of the Marine Corps\\". Quantico Station is a census-designated place (CDP) in Prince William and Stafford counties in the U.S. state of Virginia, used by the Census Bureau to describe base housing. The population was 4,452 at the 2010 census. The U.S. Marine Corps' Combat Development Command, which develops strategies for U.S. Marine combat and makes up most of the community of over 12,000 military and civilian personnel (including families), is based here. It has a budget of around $300 million and is the home of the Marine Corps Officer Candidates School. The Marine Corps Research Center at Quantico pursues equipment research and development, especially telecommunications, for the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps Brig, a military prison, was also located at Quantico, until its closure on 31 December 2011 and its subsequent demolition. The FBI Academy, the principal research and training facility of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the principal training facility for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) are also located on the base. In 2001, the base was designated as part of the Quantico Marine Corps Base Historic District by the National Register of Historic Places. This district includes 122 buildings, two landscapes, a sculpture, and a water tower located within the Mainside area of the base. The contributing properties with separate entries include Tennessee Camp, Camp French, Commanding General's Quarters, and Rising Hill Camp.

History =Before the establishment of the Marine base= The Quantico base is close to the Potomac River. The area was originally inhabited by the Patowomacks (Algonquian) in the 16th century. The name \\"Quantico\\" is presumed to come from a Native American term, and has been translated to mean \\"by the large stream\\". Accounts show that the area was first visited by European explorers in the summer of 1608 with settlement beginning later that year. After the start of the 18th century, the area became popular because of tobacco trade in Aquia Harbor. Because traveling on muddy roads in those days was slow, many villages sprang up along the river and its inlets. Additionally, the area was a bustling stopping point on the north-south routes between New York and Florida. Early settlements and plantations rooted along the flatlands bordering the Potomac. The hills west of the river remained essentially uninhabited until the early 18th century. Prince William County was organized in 1731, when the \\"Quantico Road\\" was also opened. This road gave vital access from the western part of the county to this area. By 1759, the road stretched across the Blue Ridge Mountains into the Shenandoah Valley. The first military presence at Quantico came during the American Revolutionary War, when the Quantico Creek village became a main naval base for the Commonwealth of Virginia's 72-vessel fleet on which many state militia served. The land was first visited by the Marine Corps in 1816, when a group of Marines traveling by ship to Washington were stopped when their vessel was halted by ice in the Potomac, forcing them to debark and march to the town of Dumfries, Virginia. Here they met a young Captain Archibald Henderson who lived close by. A generous-natured man, Henderson hired a wagon for them and sent them on their way. During the American Civil War, control of the Potomac River became very important to the armies of both sides. The Confederates picked the Quantico Creek area on the Potomac to set up gun batteries. This enabled them to make full use of several points where their artillery could reach anything on the water, thus deterring Union use of the water highway. One of these sites included Shipping Point, the present day site of the Marine Corps Systems Command. Another site is Tennessee Camp, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. While battles took place in Manassas, Virginia and Fredericksburg, Virginia, the gun positions around Quantico were used until the end of the war. After a 12-day battle at the Spotsylvania Courthouse where the Union lost about 25,000 soldiers, the war moved out of the Quantico area. Following the war, railroads became an integral part of transportation in Virginia. In 1872, the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad was formed when several railroads north and south met at Quantico Creek. This railroad still runs through the base and is used daily. The village came to be called \\"Quantico\\" and was built by the Quantico Company. This was the start of a thriving tourist and fishing town that would later be encompassed by Marine Corps Base Quantico. =Establishing the base= The former logo of MCB Quantico Prior to the base's establishment, the land was owned by the Town of Quantico. Around the start of the 20th century, the Quantico Company was formed on Quantico Creek. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Quantico was being advertised as a recreational day trip. The Quantico Company promoted the town as a tourist and excursion center, and brought in tourists from Washington and Richmond by the steamer St. Johns and trains using the RF&P; railroad lines and depot developed at Quantico in 1872. A beach was developed with dressing rooms and refreshment stands. In one week in 1916, Quantico was visited by 2,600 visitors who came by steamer or train. By 1916, the Quantico Company began advertising Quantico as \\"The New Industrial City,\\" and pushed for industry to come to the area. At the same time, the Quantico Shipyards were established on Hospital Point (the land that formerly held the Naval Medical Clinic but is now home to Marine Corps Systems Command) to build ocean freighters and oil tankers. With growing tensions of war in Europe, the construction of U.S. Navy ships was a major money-maker for the Quantico Shipyards. While the Town of Quantico was rapidly growing as a fishing village, excursion center and a shipbuilding center in early 1917, the town was not large or significant, and was suffering many financial difficulties. Around the same time, Major General George Barnett, then Commandant of the Marine Corps, sent a board to find possible sites for a new Marine Corps base in the Washington, D.C., vicinity. In 1917, Marine Barracks, Quantico was established on the land currently occupied by today's base. Marine Barracks personnel consisted of 91 enlisted men and four officers. Thousands of Marines were trained here during World War I. The Commanding General's Quarters was built in 1920 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. By 1920, the Marine Corps schools were founded, as Colonel Smedley Butler put it, \\"to make this post and the whole Marine Corps a great university\\". These schools eventually developed into today's Marine Corps University. Virtually all Marine officers receive their basic training here, as well as enlisted technicians from many different disciplines. Around the same time, as a part of these schools, an American football team was established at the base, playing as a college football team. Until its disbanding in 1972, the team played against various NCAA Division I college teams, as well as teams from other military installations.http://jarheadjocks.com/doc/Football%201964-72-2013.pdf The first Marine Aircraft Wing was developed at Quantico, as well as the Corps' first helicopter squadron, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the first helicopter squadron to provide rapid transportation for Presidents of the United States (\\"Marine One\\"). It continues that mission today. In 1934, Amphibious Warfare Doctrine, along with special amphibious landing crafts for World War II were developed here. These Amphibious Warfare techniques, developed in the years before World War II, made victory possible in the Pacific theater. Quantico trained over 15,000 USMC and other service officers in these techniques. In 1942, over were purchased by the federal government and added to Quantico, making up what is now the base west of Interstate 95. The expansion was needed for additional range and maneuver training areas during World War II. In 1987, the Marine Corps Development and Education Command here was changed to the Marine Corps Combat Development Command. On the night of 21 March 2013, a Marine opened fire killing two other Marines before killing himself. In 2015, the base held first Department of Defense organized Warrior Games. Units and commands The Corps' Combat Development Command, which develops strategies for Marine combat and makes up most of the community of over 12,000 military and civilian personnel (including families) is based here. It has a budget of around $300 million and is the home of the Marine Corps Officer Candidates School. The Marine Corps Research Center at Quantico pursues equipment research and development, especially telecommunications, for the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps Brig, a military prison, was formerly located at Quantico. The base was designated as part of the Quantico Marine Corps Base Historic District by the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. This district includes 122 buildings, two landscapes, a sculpture, and a water tower located within the Mainside area of the base. The contributing properties with separate entries include Tennessee Camp, Camp French, Commanding General's Quarters, and Rising Hill Camp. It is the site of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command and Marine Helicopter 1 HMX-1. HMX-1 was the first helicopter squadron to provide rapid transportation of U.S. Presidents, a mission they have continued to carry out to the present day. * Marine Corps Embassy Security Group * Marine Corps Marathon * Marine Corps Combat Development Command ** Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory * Marine Corps Recruiting Command * Manpower and Reserve Affairs Division, Headquarters Marine Corps * Marine Corps Systems Command * Marine Corps Training and Education Command ** The Basic School ** Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Staff Training Program ** Marine Corps University ** Officer Candidates School * Marine Corps Cyber Operations Group * Marine Corps Wounded Warrior Regiment Tenant activities Marine Corps Memorial at the front gate of MCB Quantico The base is the home of major training institutions for both the Marine Corps and federal law enforcement agencies, including: * Defense Intelligence Agency * Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (Headquarters) * Drug Enforcement Administration training academy * FBI Academy, the principal research and training facility of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. * FBI Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) * FBI Laboratory * Marine Raider Museum * Naval Criminal Investigative Service Headquarters, Army Criminal Investigation Division Headquarters, Air Force Office of Special Investigations Headquarters A replica of the United States Marine Corps War Memorial, depicting the 2nd U.S. flag-raising on Iwo Jima, stands at the entrance to the base.

Until 2004, the quarter of Gandria was an independent municipality, joining with Lugano in that year. The quarter of Gandria includes the rural slopes surrounding the village and stretching along the lakeside from the neighboring quarter of Castagnola-Cassarate to the border with Italy. It also includes the slopes on the opposite, (southern) side of the lake around the small settlement of Cantine di Gandria, that are accessible only by boat or on foot. The historically protected center of the village of Gandria, which is also not accessible by car, attracts visitors from all over the world. While roads now reach the outskirts of the village, many of these visitors arrive by boat services on the lake. It is also possible to walk from Lugano to Gandria and back to Lugano via a footpath, now branded the Olive path, which passes plantations of olive trees and offers views of the Lake of Lugano.  History  Aerial view (1948) = Early history = The first lasting human traces on the immediate area around Gandria come from the iron-age people of the Celts (as of 800 B.C.). A large stone (Sasso della Predescia) carved with mysterious signs, probably used for Celtic religious purposes, is located within hiking distance. Many modern locations nearby have Celtic names. Gandria sits at the base of Mt. Br√®, which means ‚Äúmountain‚Äù in Celtic. The name of the Lake of Lugano in Italian, Ceresio, could be derived from the Celtic word keresios, a reference to a god of fertility who is always pictured with the antlers of a deer ‚Äì the lake‚Äôs resemblance to the prongs of an antler can be more easily imagined when viewed from above.Good, Elmar, Magisches Tessin, Wanderungen zu Orten der Kraft, 2008, p. 241 Good, Elmar, Magisches Tessin, Wanderungen zu Orten der Kraft, 2008, p. 242 Rome conquered the region in 196 B.C. Tombs and artifacts from the neighbouring villages of Castagnola and Br√® are testimonials to the Roman presence. Present-day Gandria, however, was not yet inhabited. = First settlement = ‚ÄúGandrio‚Äù is first mentioned in archives from the bishop of Como in 1237. Grossi, Plinio, Gandria: storia, presenze, tradizioni, problemi, 1984, p. 17 At the time, the village was located halfway up Mt. Br√© ‚Äì the ruins are still visible today along the trail to the Sasso della Predescia. In the 14th century, a new settlement was established along the lake in the present-day site. Eventually the upper part of the village was abandoned, perhaps due to fire, perhaps due to the advantages of living near the lake. Gandria was only accessible by boat and steep trails, locals had to be self- sufficient. In addition to gardening and raising livestock, they benefited from the lake‚Äôs abundant fish. = Olives, silk and smuggling = Until the unusually hard winter of 1709 killed most of the olive trees, Gandria was known for its olive oil. In recent years, olive trees have been replanted and information panels posted along a scenic lakeside trail to Lugano (Sentiero dell‚Äôolivo). In 1856 silk production began in Gandria, Grossi, Plinio, Gandria: storia, presenze, tradizioni, problemi, 1984, p. 138 using leaves from local mulberry trees to feed the silkworms. Because of the difficult-to- control border, the area around Gandria became infamous for smuggling. Cigarettes, meat and alcohol were especially profitable due to high Swiss customs duties. (A notable item at the Swiss Customs Museum is a confiscated ‚Äúsubmarine‚Äù used to smuggle salami). The year 1935 was the beginning of a new era for Gandria, as tunnels and a new road above the lake shore connected the village to Lugano and Italy. = Merger with Lugano = In 2004, the municipality of Gandria merged with the city of Lugano. Since Gandria became a part of Lugano, needed infrastructure projects have been carried out, including a sewage treatment plant that went on line in August 2010. Work to place electrical lines underground is ongoing.Confirmed by the municipal office in Lugano (Dicastero del territorio) responsible for this project by phone on August 30, 2010.  Sights  = Church of Saint Vigilio = The Church of Saint Vigilio in Gandria was completed in 1463. The oldest part is the gray, unfinished wall facing the lake, adorned with memorials from well- known local families. The baroque facades were completed in the 1870s. Behind the altar of the church is a large oil painting by Giovanni and Giuseppe Torricelli that shows the martyrdom of Saint Vigilio, a bishop of Trento in Italy, who was stoned to death by pagan shepherds. Grossi, Plinio, Gandria: Storia, Presenze, Tradizioni, Problemi, 1984, p. 26Benedetta, Giorgio; Felber, Markus; Maspoli, Guido, et al., Gandria: Naturkundlichhistorischer Pfad, Fondo SNAG, Eusi Verlag, Lugano, 2000, pp. 39-39. The connection with Gandria comes from local artisans who worked on the construction of the cathedral in Trento, and were presumably impressed by the patron saint. The Torricelli brothers also painted scenes in the house of local architect Vigilio Rabaglio, who achieved fame by designing the Bourbon royal palace in Segovia in Spain. An archeological guide to the area notes that stones with Celtic bowl-shaped indentations, carried there by villagers in past centuries, can be seen in the walls and on doorsteps around the Church of San Vigilio. = Swiss Customs Museum = On the opposite side of the lake to Gandria village, but still within the Gandria quarter, is the Swiss Customs Museum. This was once a border post on the adjacent border with Italy, but now forms part of the Swiss National Museum. The museum covers the history of smuggling in the area, and the work of customs officers to counteract it. In a modern context, it covers the work of the Swiss Federal Customs Administration and the Swiss Border Guard.  An international village  Today, Gandria is a mix of tradition and modernity. Many of 200 inhabitants who live there year-round are from families that go back for many generations. Others have arrived from various cantons of Switzerland as well as countries as diverse as Colombia, Germany, Haiti, Italy, Nicaragua, Palestine and the United States.Bird, Richard, Gandria at a Glance, 2010, p. 2 Most people work in the nearby financial center of Lugano, although there is a tradition of architects, musicians, painters, ceramic makers and other artists in the village.  Transport  Gandria village and its surrounding areas are connected to Lugano, and to Italy, by the main road that runs along the northern shore of Lake Lugano. This passes above the village centre, which, by virtue of its extremely narrow streets and steep gradients, is inaccessible to vehicles. In addition to the higher level road, it is also possible to walk from Gandria to Lugano and other surrounding villages via the publicly maintained lakeside Olive Path hewn into the rock in 1936. A boat service between Gandria and other towns on the lake is provided by the Societ√† Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (SNL) and is regular. The same company also operates a bus service between Gandria and Lugano. The portion of Gandria on the south side of the lake, around Cantine di Gandria and the Swiss Customs Museum, has no roads. The shore-side footpath, which links the area to Caprino, is subject to rockfalls and not recommended for the inexperienced walker. The SNL provide several crossings a day from Gandria village (and central Lugano) to piers at both the Cantine di Gandria and the Customs Museum.

History Takeda Midosuji Building, headquarters of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, in Chuo-ku, Osaka, Japan The Uroko logo, used as Takeda's Japanese logo until 2019 Takeda Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1781, and was incorporated on January 29, 1925. In 1977, Takeda first entered the U.S. pharmaceutical market by developing a joint venture with Abbott Laboratories called TAP Pharmaceuticals. Through TAP Pharmaceuticals, Takeda and Abbott launched the blockbusters Lupron (leuprorelin) in 1985 and Prevacid (lansoprazole) in 1995. One of the firm's mainstay drugs is Actos (pioglitazone), a compound in the thiazolidinedione class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It was launched in 1999. In February 2005, Takeda acquired San Diego, California, based Syrrx, a company specializing in high-throughput X-ray crystallography, for US$270 million. In February 2008, Takeda acquired the Japanese operations of Amgen and rights to a dozen of the California biotechnology company's pipeline candidates for the Japanese market. In March 2008, Takeda and Abbott Laboratories announced plans to conclude their 30-year-old joint venture, TAP Pharmaceuticals. The split resulted in Abbott acquiring U.S. rights to Lupron and the drug's support staff. On the other hand, Takeda received rights to Prevacid and TAP's pipeline candidates. The move also increased Takeda's headcount by 3,000 employees. In April 2008, Takeda acquired Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a company specializing in cancer drug research, for US$8.8 billion. The acquisition brought in Velcade, a drug indicated for hematological malignancies, as well as a portfolio of pipeline candidates in the oncology, inflammation, and cardiovascular therapeutic areas. Millennium now operates as an independent subsidiary. In May 2008, the company licensed non-exclusively the RNAi technology platform developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, creating a potentially long-term partnership between the companies. In September 2011, Takeda acquired Nycomed for ‚Ç¨9.6 billion. In June 2012, Takeda announced it would acquire URL Pharma, then run by the founder's son Richard Roberts, for US$800 million. On 25 May 2012, Takeda purchased Brazilian pharmaceutical company Multilab for R$540 million. On 26 September 2014, Takeda announced it would team up with BioMotiv to identify and develop new compounds over a five-year period, worth approximately US$25 million. On 30 September 2014, Takeda announced it would expand a collaboration with MacroGenics, valued up to US$1.6 billion. The collaboration focused on the co-development of the preclinical autoimmune compound MGD010. MGD010 is a therapy which targets the B-cell surface proteins CD32B and CD79B, and is indicated for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In 2015, Takeda sold its respiratory drugs business to AstraZeneca for $575 million (about ¬£383 million), which included roflumilast and ciclesonide.Julia Bradshaw for The Daily Telegraph, 16 December 2015.

On November 20, 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ixazomib developed by Takeda for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma after at least one prior therapy. On December 2, 2016, the company spun out its neuroscience research division into Cerevance, a joint venture along with Lightstone Ventures. In February 2017, Takeda acquired Ariad Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion, expanding the company's oncology and hematology divisions. In January 2018, the company acquired stem cell therapy developer TiGenix for up to ‚Ç¨520 million ($632 million). In January 2019, Takeda acquired Shire for more than . In October 2019, Takeda announced it had sold a portfolio of over-the-counter and prescription medicines in the Middle East and Africa to Swiss pharmaceuticals company Acino International for more than $200 million. In March 2020, Takeda announced that it has entered into an exclusively agreement to divest a portfolio of non-core products in Latin America to Hypera S.A. for a total value of $825 million.

Lawsuits In April 2015 Takeda agreed to pay a settlement of $2.37 billion to an estimated 9,000 people who submitted claims alleging that pioglitazone was responsible for giving them bladder cancer. In 2014, a plaintiff was awarded $9 billion in punitive damages after a federal court found Takeda hid the cancer risks of their diabetes medicine, but the amount was later reduced to $26 million by a judge who deemed the charge excessive.

This name is actually used to refer to two different types of web crawlers: a desktop crawler (to simulate desktop users) and a mobile crawler (to simulate a mobile user).  Behavior  A website will probably be crawled by both Googlebot Desktop and Googlebot Mobile. The subtype of Googlebot can be identified by looking at the user agent string in the request. However, both crawler types obey the same product token (useent token) in robots.txt, and so a developer cannot selectively target either Googlebot mobile or Googlebot desktop using robots.txt. If a webmaster wishes to restrict the information on their site available to a Googlebot, or another well-behaved spider, they can do so with the appropriate directives in a robots.txt file, or by adding the meta tag \`\` to the web page. Googlebot requests to Web servers are identifiable by a user-agent string containing \\"Googlebot\\" and a host address containing \\"googlebot.com\\". Currently, Googlebot follows HREF links and SRC links. There is increasing evidence Googlebot can execute JavaScript and parse content generated by Ajax calls as well. There are many theories regarding how advanced Googlebot's ability is to process JavaScript, with opinions ranging from minimal ability derived from custom interpreters. Currently, Googlebot uses a web rendering service (WRS) that is based on Chromium rendering engine (version 74 as on 7 May 2019). Googlebot discovers pages by harvesting all the links on every page it finds. It then follows these links to other web pages. New web pages must be linked to from other known pages on the web in order to be crawled and indexed or manually submitted by the webmaster. A problem that webmasters with low-bandwidth Web hosting plans have often noted with the Googlebot is that it takes up an enormous amount of bandwidth. This can cause websites to exceed their bandwidth limit and be taken down temporarily. This is especially troublesome for mirror sites which host many gigabytes of data. Google provides \\"Search Console\\" that allow website owners to throttle the crawl rate. How often Googlebot will crawl a site depends on the crawl budget. Crawl budget is an estimation of how often a website is updated. Technically, Googlebot's development team (Crawling and Indexing team) uses several defined terms internally to takes over what \\"crawl budget\\" stands for. Since May 2019, Googlebot uses the latest Chromium rendering engine, which supports ECMAScript 6 features. This will make the bot a bit more \\"evergreen\\" and ensure that it is not relying on an outdated rendering engine compared to browser capabilities.  Mediabot  Mediabot is the web crawler that Google uses for analysing the content so Google AdSense can serve contextually relevant advertising to a web page. Mediabot identifies itself with the user agent string \\"Mediapartners-Google/2.1\\". Unlike other crawlers, Mediabot does not follow links to discover new crawlable URLs, instead only visiting URLs that have included the AdSense code. Where that content resides behind a login, the crawler can be given a login so that it is able to crawl protected content. Mediabot will usually first visit a page within seconds of AdSense code first being called from that page. Thereafter it revisits pages on a regular but unpredictable basis. Changes made to a page therefore do not immediately cause changes to the ads displayed on the page. Ads can still be shown on a page even if the Mediabot has not yet visited it. In this instance ads chosen will be based on a combination of the overall domain theme and keywords appearing in the URL string. If no ads can be matched to the page, either public service ads, blank space, or a solid color are shown, depending on the settings for that ad unit.

He is best known for his non-fiction books about comics: Understanding Comics (1993), Reinventing Comics (2000), and Making Comics (2006), all of which also use the medium of comics. He established himself as a comics creator in the 1980s as an independent superhero cartoonist and advocate for creator's rights. He rose to prominence in the industry beginning in the 1990s for his non-fiction works about the medium, and has advocated the use of new technology in the creation and distribution of comics.

Retrieved November 16, 2011. Career =Fiction= During his high school years, he collaborated on comics with his schoolmate Kurt Busiek. While still teenagers, the two of them, together with fellow teenagers Christopher Bing (a 2001 Caldecott Medal winner) and Richard Howell, created the first licensed Marvel/DC crossover comic Biff! Bang! Pops!, a one-shot sold in conjunction with a 1978 Boston Pops performance of comics-themed music. While working as a production artist at DC Comics, McCloud created the light-hearted science fiction/superhero comic book series Zot! in 1984, in part as a reaction to the increasingly grim direction that superhero comics were taking in the 1980s. His other print comics include Destroy!! (a deliberately over-the-top, oversized single-issue comic book, intended as a parody of formulaic superhero fights), the 1998 graphic novel The New Adventures of Abraham Lincoln (done with a mixture of computer-generated and manually drawn digital images), 12 issues writing DC Comics' Superman Adventures in the late 1990s and the 2005 three-issue series Superman: Strength, and the 2015 graphic novel The Sculptor. =Creator's Bill of Rights= McCloud was the principal author of the Creator's Bill of Rights, a 1988 document with the stated aim of protecting the rights of comic book creators and help aid against the exploitation of comic artists and writers by corporate work-for-hire practices.Coogan, Pete (September, 1990). \\"Creator's Rights\\". The Comics Journal p. 65-71 The group that adopted the Bill also included artists Kevin Eastman, Dave Sim, and Stephen R. Bissette.McCloud, Scott (2000). Reinventing Comics, New York: Paradox Press.

It was a mutual challenge with cartoonist Steve Bissette, intended to compel creative output with a minimum of self-restraining contemplation. Thousands of cartoonists have since taken up the challenge, including Neil Gaiman; Kevin Eastman, co-creator of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; Dave Sim, who published some of his work from this challenge in Cerebus the Aardvark;Cerebus #142 (Aardvark/Vanaheim, January 1991). and Rick Veitch who used it as a springboard for his comic Rarebit Fiends.McCloud, Scott.

Retrieved October, 2013. = Non-fiction about comics = McCloud signing his book Making Comics in 2006 In the early 1990s, McCloud began a series of three books about the medium and business of comics, all done in comics form. The first of these was Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art, published in 1993, which established him as a popular comics theorist, described as the \\"Aristotle of comics\\"Wardrip-Fruin, Noah & Montfort, Nick (2003). The New Media Reader. The MIT Press. and the \\"Marshall McLuhan of comics\\". The book was a wide-ranging exploration of the definition, history, vocabulary, and methods of the medium of comics, and is widely cited in academic discussions of the medium. In 2000, McCloud published Reinventing Comics: How Imagination and Technology Are Revolutionizing an Art Form, in which he outlined twelve \\"revolutions\\" taking place, that he argued would be keys to the growth and success of comics as a popular and creative medium. McCloud returned to focus on the medium itself in 2006 with Making Comics: Storytelling Secrets of Comics, Manga, and Graphic Novels, an instructional guide to the process of producing comics, which he followed with a promotional lecture tour with his family of all 50 U.S. states and parts of Europe. = Technology = Beginning in the late 1990s, McCloud was an early advocate of micropayments. He was an adviser to BitPass, a company that provided an online micropayment system, which he helped launch with the publication of The Right Number, an online graphic novella priced at US$0.25 for each chapter. McCloud maintains an active online presence on his web site where he publishes many of his ongoing experiments with comics produced specifically for the web. Among the techniques he explores is the \\"infinite canvas\\" permitted by a web browser, allowing panels to be spatially arranged in ways not possible in the finite, two-dimensional, paged format of a physical book.

It has about 196,308 members. From its beginning in 1628 until 1819, it was the North American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church. The RCA is a member of the National Council of Churches (founding member), the World Council of Churches (WCC), Christian Churches Together, and the World Communion of Reformed Churches (WCRC). Some parts of the denomination belong to the National Association of Evangelicals, the Canadian Council of Churches, and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. The denomination is in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Presbyterian Church (USA), and United Church of Christ and is a denominational partner of the Christian Reformed Church in North America. Names Colloquially, it is sometimes referred loosely to as the Dutch Reformed Church in America, or simply as the Dutch Reformed Church when an American context has already been provided. In 1819, it incorporated as the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church. The current name was chosen in 1867. History The early settlers in the Dutch colony of New Netherland first held informal meetings for worship. In 1628 Jonas Michaelius organized the first Dutch Reformed congregation in New Amsterdam, now New York City, called the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, now the Marble Collegiate Church. During Dutch rule, the RCA was the established church of the colony and was under the authority of the classis of Amsterdam. Even after the English captured the colony in 1664, all Dutch Reformed ministers were still trained in the Netherlands. Services in the RCA remained in Dutch until 1764. (Dutch language use faded thereafter until the new wave of Dutch immigration in the mid-19th century. This revived use of the language among Dutch descendants and in some churches.) In 1747 the church in the Netherlands had given permission to form an assembly in North America; in 1754, the assembly declared itself independent of the classis of Amsterdam. This American classis secured a charter in 1766 for Queens College (now Rutgers University) in New Jersey. In 1784 John Henry Livingston was appointed as professor of theology, marking the beginning of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. The First Reformed Church in Albany started in 1642 to serve the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck. The current church was built in 1798. The Dutch-speaking community, including farmers and traders, prospered in the former New Netherland, dominating New York City, the Hudson Valley, and parts of New Jersey while maintaining a significant presence in southeastern Pennsylvania, southwestern Connecticut, and Long Island. In the early 18th century nearly 3,000 Palatine German refugees came to New York. Most worked first in English camps along the Hudson River to pay off their passage (paid by Queen Anne's government) before they were allowed land in the Schoharie and Mohawk Valleys. There they created numerous German-speaking Lutheran and Reformed churches, such as those at Fort Herkimer and German Flatts. Thousands more immigrated to Pennsylvania in the 18th century. They used German as the language in their churches and schools for nearly 100 years, and recruited some of their ministers from Germany. By the early 20th century, most of their churches had joined the RCA.W.N.P. Dailey, \\"The History of Montgomery Classis, R.C.A.\\", Recorder Press, Amsterdam, NY, 1916, accessed 31 January 2011 During the American Revolution, a bitter internal struggle broke out in the Dutch Reformed church, with lines of division following ecclesiastical battles that had gone on for twenty years between the \\"coetus\\" and \\"conferentie\\" factions. One source indicates that defections may have occurred as early as 1737. > \\"Desolation pervaded many of the churches, whereas prior to 1737 good order > was maintained in the churches, and peace and a good degree of prosperity > were enjoyed. ...But in 1754, the Coetus of the previous year, having > recommended the changing of the Coetus into a Classis with full powers, the > opposition became violent, and the opponents were known as the > Conferentie.\\"Benjamin C. Taylor D. D., Annals of the Classis of Bergen of > the Reformed Dutch Church and of the Churches Under its Care: Including, The > Civil History of the Ancient Township of Bergen, in New Jersey, Hosford & > Co. NY, NY 1857 A spirit of amnesty made possible the church's survival after the war. The divisiveness was also healed when the church sent members on an extensive foreign missions program in the early 19th century. In 1792 the classis adopted a formal constitution; and in 1794 the denomination held its first general synod. Following the American Civil War, in 1867 it formally adopted the name \\"Reformed Church in America\\". In the nineteenth century in New York and New Jersey, ethnic Dutch descendants struggled to preserve their European standards and traditions while developing a taste for revivalism and an American identity. =19th century= Phebe Johnson Ditmis (4 January 1824 ‚Äì 27 December 1866) was the wife of Reformed Church of Queens pastor George Onderdonk Ditmis (22 July 1818 ‚Äì 1 February 1896).American Biography (1919) The American Historical Society, New York Some members owned slaves, the most famous of the slaves being Sojourner Truth, and the church did not support abolitionism. In rural areas, ministers preached in Dutch until about 1830-1850, then switched to English, at the same time finally dropping the use of many traditional Dutch clothing and customs.Firth Haring Fabend, \\"The Synod of Dort and the Persistence of Dutchness in Nineteenth-century New York and New Jersey\\", New York History; 1996 77(3): 273-300 Although some ministers favored revivals, generally the church did not support either the First or the Second Great Awakenings, which created much evangelical fervor. =Midwest= Immigration from the Netherlands in the mid-19th century led to the expansion of the RCA into the Midwest. In 1837 Pastor Abram D. Wilson and his wife Julia Evertson Wilson from New Jersey established the first Dutch Reformed church west of the Allegany Mountains in Fairview, Illinois.History of Fairview Reformed Church http://churches.rca.org/fairviewreformed/History.html#1837 Hope College and Western Theological Seminary were founded in Holland, Michigan, Central College in Pella, Iowa, and Northwestern College in Orange City, Iowa. In the 1857 Secession, a group of more conservative members in Michigan led by Gijsbert Haan separated from the RCA. They organized the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRC), and other churches followed. In 1882 another group of congregations left for the CRC, mirroring developments in the church in the Netherlands. =Post-World War II= After 1945 the RCA expanded into Canada, which was the destination of a large group of Dutch emigrants. Between 1949 and 1958, the RCA opened 120 churches among non-Dutch suburban communities, appealing to mainline Protestants. It was a charter member of the Presbyterian Alliance, the Federal Council of Churches, and the World Council of Churches. =Recent decline= Like most other mainline denominations, the RCA has had a declining membership during the last thirty years. In 2018 the total membership was less 196,308, down from 220,000 in 2016, from 300,000 in 2000 and 360,000 in 1980. In the last thirty years, the church has lost more than 45% of its membership. Due to theological changes reflecting new interpretations of Scripture, the adoption of the Belhar Confession, the removal of the conscience clauses related to the ordination of women, and growing acceptance of homosexual behavior, a number of congregations have left the RCA to join the Presbyterian Church in America, which is more conservative on these issues.https://glendafayemathes.com/2014/11/11/churches-leaving-the-rca/ Beliefs The RCA confesses several statements of doctrine and faith. These include the historic Apostles' Creed, Nicene Creed, and Athanasian Creed; the traditional Reformed Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism (with its compendium), the Canons of Dort, and the Belhar Confession. =Life issues= The RCA opposes euthanasia. The report of the Commission on Christian Action stated in 1994: \\"What Christians say about issues of morality ought to be and usually is a reflection of their fundamental faith convictions. There are at least three of these convictions that appear especially relevant to the question of whether it is acceptable for Christians to seek a physician's assistance in committing suicide in the midst of extreme suffering./ A fundamental conviction Christians have is that they do not belong to themselves. Life, despite its circumstances, is a gift from God, and each individual is its steward... Contemporary arguments for the 'right' to assistance to commit suicide are based on ideas of each individual's autonomy over his or her life. Christians cannot claim such autonomy; Christians acknowledge that they belong to God... Christians yield their personal autonomy and accept a special obligation, as the first answer of the Heidelberg Catechism invites people to confess: 'I am not my own, but belong‚Äîbody and soul, in life and in death‚Äîto my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ' (Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A; 1)... A decision to take one's own life thus appears to be a denial that one belongs to God./ A second conviction is that God does not abandon people in times of suffering... Christians express their faith in God's love by trusting in God's care for them. A decision to end one's life would appear to be a cessation of that trust... Suffering calls upon people to trust God even in the valley of the shadow of death. It calls on people to let God, and not suffering, determine the agenda of their life and their death./ A third conviction is that in the community of God's people, caring for those who are dying is a burden Christians are willing to share. Both living and dying should occur within a caring community, and in the context of death, Christian discipleship takes the form of caring for those who are dying./ This is an era when many people find legislating morality a questionable practice. Should Christians promote legislation which embodies their conclusions about the morality of physician-assisted suicide?... If Christians are to be involved in debating laws regulating assisted suicide, it will be out of a concern for the health and well-being of society... As a society, there is no common understanding that gives any universal meaning to 'detrimental'. In humility, Christians can simply acknowledge this, and proceed...to share our own unique perspectives, inviting others to consider them and the faith that gives them meaning.\\" The Reformed Church also condemns the death penalty. The General Synod in 2000 expressed seven reasons why the Church opposes it: * Capital punishment is incompatible with the Spirit of Christ and the ethic of love. The law of love does not negate justice, but it does nullify the motives of vengeance and retribution by forcing us to think in terms of redemption, rehabilitation, and reclamation. The Christ who refused to endorse the stoning of the woman taken in adultery would have us speak to the world of compassion, not vengeance. * Capital punishment is of doubtful value as a deterrent. The capital punishment as a deterrent argument assumes a criminal will engage in a kind of rational, cost-benefit analysis before he or she commits murder. Most murders, however, are crimes of passion or are committed under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This does not excuse the perpetrator of responsibility for the crime, but it does show that in most cases capital punishment as a deterrent won't work. * Capital punishment results in inequities of application. Numerous studies since 1965 have shown that racial factors play a significant role in determining whether or not a person receives a sentence of death. * Capital punishment is a method open to irremediable mistakes. The increasing number of innocent defendants being found on death row is a clear sign that the process for sentencing people to death is fraught with fundamental errors‚Äîerrors which cannot be remedied once an execution occurs. * Capital punishment ignores corporate and community guilt. Such factors may diminish but certainly do not destroy the responsibility of the individual. Yet society also bears some responsibility for directing efforts and resources toward correcting those conditions that may foster such behavior. * Capital punishment perpetuates the concepts of vengeance and retaliation. As an agency of society, the state should not become an avenger for individuals; it should not presume the authority to satisfy divine justice by vengeful methods. * Capital punishment ignores the entire concept of rehabilitation. The Christian faith should be concerned not with retribution, but with redemption. Any method which closes the door to all forgiveness, and to any hope of redemption, cannot stand the test of our faith. The General Synod resolution expressed its will \\"to urge members of the Reformed Church in America to contact their elected officials, urging them to advocate for the abolition of capital punishment and to call for an immediate moratorium on executions.\\" The RCA is generally opposed to abortion. The position of the General Synod, stated in 1973 and later affirmed, has been that \\"in principle\\" abortion \\"should not be practiced at all\\", but in a \\"complex society\\" of competing evils there \\"could be exceptions\\". However, abortion should never be chosen as a matter of \\"individual convenience\\". The church personnel should promote \\"Christian alternatives to abortion\\", and church members are asked to \\"support efforts for constitutional changes\\" to protect the unborn. =Homosexuality= Since 1978 the General Synod has made a number of statements on homosexuality. Homosexual acts are considered sinful and \\"contrary to the will of God\\". But homosexuals are not to be blamed for their condition. The church must affirm civil rights for homosexuals while it condemns homosexual behavior (1978). The church must seek to lift the homosexual's \\"burden of guilt\\", recognizing that homosexuality is a \\"complex phenomenon\\" (1979). The church should encourage \\"love and sensitivity towards such persons as fellow human beings\\" (1990). In 1994 the Synod condemned the humiliation and degradation of homosexuals and confessed that many members had not listened to the \\"heartfelt cries\\" of homosexual persons struggling for \\"self-acceptance and dignity.\\" While calling for compassion, patience, and loving support toward those who struggle with same-sex desires, the 2012 General Synod determined that it is a \\"disciplinable offense\\" to advocate for homosexual behavior or provide leadership for a service of a same-sex marriage. The following year, however, the General Synod essentially rescinded this statement and rebuked the 2012 delegates for demonstrating \\"a lack of decorum and civility,\\" and usurping constitutional authority. In 2014, the General Synod recommended that the Commission on Church Order begin the process of defining marriage as heterosexual. However, in 2015, the General Synod approved a process for studying a way \\"to address the questions of human sexuality\\". Also in 2015, Hope College in Michigan, affiliated with the RCA, officially decided to provide benefits to employees' same-sex spouses though the school continues to maintain a statement on sexuality that espouses a traditional definition of marriage. Additionally, a number of congregations and classes have voted to publicly affirm LGBT members, including the Classis of New Brunswick and the Classis of Schenectady. Several of those congregations, including congregations dually affiliated with the RCA and United Church of Christ, perform same-sex marriages. \\"Some RCA churches have gay pastors, but their ordination is from other denominations\\". On 5 May 2017, the United Church of Christ and Reformed Church in America congregations that support LGBT inclusion announced the formation of an association for dually- affiliated congregations. In April 2016, a working committee of the RCA developed a report on human sexuality. The report offers different options, for review by the General Synod, and includes the option to define marriage as between a man and woman or to define marriage as between two persons thus allowing same-gender marriages. Of these options, General Synod 2016 voted to define marriage as \\"man/woman\\". However, that vote needed to receive the support of 2/3 of the classes and be ratified again in 2017. In March 2017, the proposal to define marriage as \\"man/woman\\" did not receive the necessary votes from 2/3 of the classes, and, as a result, it did not pass. On 12 June 2017, the General Synod voted for a \\"recommendation [which] says, 'faithful adherence to the RCA‚Äôs Standards, therefore, entails the affirmation that marriage is between one man and one woman.'\\" Also, in 2017, the RCA ordained the first openly gay and married pastor who was 'out' when he began the ordination process. =Women's ordination= The RCA first admitted women to the offices of deacon and elder in 1972 and first ordained women in 1979. By 1980 the General Synod of the RCA amended the Book of Church Order (BCO) to clarify their position on women's ordination, including amending the language of Part I, Article 1, Section 3 of the BCO from \\"persons\\" to \\"men and women\\". In 1980 the RCA added a conscience clause to the BCO stating, \\"If individual members of the classis find that their consciences, as illuminated by Scripture, would not permit them to participate in the licensure, ordination or installation of women as ministers of the Word, they shall not be required to participate in decisions or actions contrary to their consciences, but may not obstruct the classis in fulfilling its responsibility to arrange for the care, ordination, and installation of women candidates and ministers by means mutually agreed on by such women and the classis\\" (Part II, Article 2, Section 7). In 2012 by a vote of 143 to 69, the General Synod of the RCA voted to remove the conscience clauses. However, the vote by the General Synod had to be approved by a majority of the classes (a classis serving the same function as a presbytery). Eventually, 31 classes voted in favor of removal, with 14 voting to retain them, and the vote was ratified at the RCA's 2013 General Synod.\\"Removal of Conscience Clauses Ratified\\" 20 June 2013 accessed 22 June 2013 https://www.rca.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=9404 Polity The RCA has a presbyterian polity where authority is divided among representative bodies: consistories, classes, regional synods, and the General Synod. The General Synod meets annually and is the representative body of the entire denomination, establishing its policies, programs, and agenda. Measures passed at General Synod are executed and overseen by the General Synod Council. Council members are appointed by the General Synod. A General Secretary oversees day-to-day operations. The Rev. Eddy Alem√°n, D. Min., was installed as the current General Secretary at the 2018 General Synod. The Constitution of the RCA consists of three parts: the Liturgy, the Government, and the Doctrinal Standards. The Government, along with the Formularies and the By- laws of the General Synod, are published annually in a volume known as The Book of Church Order.http://www.rca.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?&pid;=1987&srcid;=2054 Colleges and seminaries The Dimnent Chapel at Hope College, in Holland, Michigan ;Colleges *Central College, Pella, Iowa *Hope College, Holland, Michigan *Northwestern College, Orange City, Iowa ;SeminariesRCA - About Us: Educational Institutions *New Brunswick Theological Seminary, New Brunswick, New Jersey *Western Theological Seminary, Holland, Michigan ;Certification agencies *Students who do not attend or receive their Master of Divinity degree from one of the two seminaries operated by the RCA are certified and credentialed for ministry in the RCA through the Ministerial Formation Certification Agency in Paramount, California. Ecumenical relations Through a document known as A Formula of Agreement, the RCA has full communion with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United Church of Christ, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The relationship between the United Church of Christ and the RCA has been the subject of controversy within the RCA, particularly a resolution by the UCC General Synod in 2005 regarding homosexuality. The ELCA's affirmation of the ordination of homosexuals as clergy in 2009 prompted some RCA conservatives to call for a withdrawal from the Formula of Agreement. In 2012 RCA discussed its own position regarding homosexuality. The two denominations undertook a dialogue and in 1999 produced a document discussing their differences (PDF). Along with their Formula of Agreement partners, the RCA retains close fellowship with the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRC). In 2005 the RCA and CRC voted to allow for the exchange of ministers. Faith Alive Christian Resources, the CRC's publishing arm, is also used by the RCA and in 2013 published a joint hymnal for use in both denominations. The two denominations have also collaborated on various other ministry ventures, voted to merge pension plans in 2013 in conformity with the Affordable Care Act, and plan to hold back-to-back General Synods at Central College in Pella, Iowa, in 2014.

It was formed by the union of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA), often referred to as the \\"Northern\\" Presbyterian Church, with the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA), a smaller church of Covenanter-Seceder tradition at a conference in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in May 1958. Vigorous ecumenical activity on the part of PCUSA leaders led to this merger, something of a reunion of two long- separated branches of the larger Presbyterian family deriving from the British Isles. Background Between 1937 and 1955, both the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, and the United Presbyterian Church of North America had been looking to merge with Reformed Churches. The PCUSA had discussed a merger with the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS), as well as with the Episcopal Church. Both denominations had also been in contact with the Reformed Church in America, as well as the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. History By the time of the merger, the PCUSA had churches in all 50 states, while the heaviest concentration of UPCNA congregations could be found in Western Pennsylvania and parts of Ohio. One institutional expression of the union was the consolidation of two nearby seminaries into the new Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. As had been customary for centuries, the UPCUSA originally held solely to the Westminster Confession of Faith and catechisms. But, one of the details of the 1958 merger was to revise the Westminster Confession. Realizing that the task of revising the Westminster Confession was too much of a burden and potentially divisive, the commission developed a new confession. Known as the Confession of 1967, it was heavily influenced by neo-orthodoxy. The commission also added several other confessional standards to what was called the Book of Confessions. Furthermore, the UPCUSA revised its ordination vows. Prior to 1967, the ordination vows required an affirmative to this question: \\"Do you sincerely receive and adopt the Confession of Faith and Catechisms of this Church as containing the system of doctrine taught in Holy Scripture?\\" After 1967, the ordination vows read: \\"Do you sincerely receive and adopt the essential tenets of the Reformed Faith as expressed in the confession of our church as authentic and reliable expositions of what Scripture leads us to believe and do, and will you be instructed and led by those confessions as you lead the people of God?\\" Despite strong opposition from conservative evangelicals, much of which dovetailed with their hostility toward the denomination's perceived focus on social action that the Confession of 1967 in particular appeared to endorse, nine-tenths of the presbyteries approved the new documents. Social stances and ecumenism Generally speaking, the UPCUSA, especially its leadership, was a strong supporter of progressive causes, such as civil rights and feminism. Eugene Carson Blake, who served as the stated clerk of the UPCUSA from 1954 until 1966, was particularly active in the civil rights movement, including partaking in the August 28, 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, with Martin Luther King Jr. The following year, the UPCUSA took an unprecedented step in electing Edler Garnet Hawkins (1908-1977), an African American, who had served as pastor of St. Augustine Presbyterian Church, as moderator, a position which he filled until 1970.\\"Edler Hawkins Civil Activist with His Ministry\\" http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/edler-hawkins-civil-activist- his-ministry However, despite the progressive views of many members, a scandal erupted in 1970 and 1971 when the denomination gave $25,000 to defend the Black Panthers and $10,000 to the Angela Davis Defense Fund.\\"Ten Valid Reasons for Opposing Union with the United Presbyterian Church\\" http://www.pcahistory.org/findingaids/concerned/TenValidReasons.pdf Katie Cannon was ordained on April 24, 1974, in Shelby, North Carolina, by the Catawba Presbytery, in the Synod of Catawba, becoming the first African- American woman to be ordained in the UPCUSA. Ecumenical endeavors In December 1960, UPCUSA stated clerk, Eugene Blake, preached a sermon at Grace Cathedral [Episcopal Church] in San Francisco, in which he laid down the plan for uniting UPCUSA, The Methodist Church (USA), the Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ. Following Blake's lead, the 1961 General Assembly sent invitations to the Presbyterian Church in the United States, the Methodists, the Episcopalians, and the United Church of Christ, beginning what was called the ‚ÄúConsultation on Church Union,‚Äù but would be eventually renamed the ‚ÄúChurches of Christ Uniting‚Äù. The UPCUSA was also part of both the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, the latter of which Blake would become the General Secretary of in 1966. Controversies and departures Despite being the largest Presbyterian body in the United States, controversies and schisms would soon shake the UPCUSA, which would lead to the exodus of several well-known congregations and members. In keeping with the practice of the PC-USA (which the PC-USA had begun in 1956) the UPCUSA continued the ordination of women. When the union between the UPCNA and the PC-USA occurred in 1958, it was understood that the new denomination would permit, but not require female ministers However, in 1974, Walter W. Kenyon, a student at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, informed his presbytery that, while he would be willing to work with female ministers, or not impede their ordination, he would not participate in their installation. While his ordination was narrowly approved, it was overturned by the Permanent Judicial Commission of the General Assembly the following year, with the commission stating that it was the denomination's responsibility to refuse ordination to those who did not theologically accept the ordination of women, as the General Assembly had no power to grant the presbytery an exception to an already explicit constitutional provision. Furthermore, in 1979, the General Assembly ruled that all congregations must elect both men and women to the office of ruling elder. The ruling resulted in an exodus of approximately forty congregations, including Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, which would eventually realign with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod. In 1976, the New York Presbytery petitioned the General Assembly asking for advice over what to do about a candidate who was a homosexual, yet who was otherwise qualified for ministry. A task force was assigned and came back with the proposal that the question should be up to the discretion of the presbyteries. However, after lobbying from the Presbyterians United for Biblical Concerns, the majority report was rejected by the General Assembly, which voted overwhelmingly to affirm instead that ‚Äúunrepentant homosexual practice does not accord with the requirements of ordination as set forth in the Book of Church Order.\\" Another controversy rocked the UPCUSA when the National Capital Union presbytery voted to receive a minister by the name of Mansfield Kaseman, a move that was upheld by the 1981 General Assembly. Ordained in the United Church of Christ, Kaseman declined to affirm straightforwardly the deity of Christ, His sinless nature and the bodily resurrection. This case resulted in a further wave of departures from the UPCUSA, including those who founded the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, along with longtime Pittsburgh Seminary professor John Gerstner. Reunion of the UPCUSA and the PCUS As the UPCUSA continued its more liberal shift, talks had begun regarding a merger between the UPCUSA and the Presbyterian Church in the United States, who had split from the main Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in 1861 due to the Civil War. Initially committed to ‚ÄúOld School‚Äù Presbyterianism, the PCUS had been beginning a shift towards liberalism in the 1950s and 1960s, including allowing the ordination of women in 1964. While there had been a failed attempt to merge the UPCUSA and the PCUS in 1954, there had been increased cooperation between the two denominations, including joint foreign mission boards, a new hymnal in 1955, union presbyteries in 1968, and in 1970, the so-called ‚ÄúPlan of Union‚Äù was drafted. With the December 1973 creation of the National Presbyterian Church, which would soon be renamed the Presbyterian Church in America, which led to an exodus of conservatives from the PCUS, plans for union accelerated, and were also hastened, albeit less decisively, by the creation of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church by conservatives leaving the UPCUSA in 1981. In 1983, the vote was finally held regarding the merger, with a unanimous 151 presbyteries in the UPCUSA affirming it, and the PCUS affirming it 53 to 8. On June 10, 1983, the first General Assembly was held for the new denomination, which would be called the Presbyterian Church (USA). Notable members Prominent leaders and theologians from the period included Eugene Carson Blake, Robert McAfee Brown, Lloyd John Ogilvie, William Sloane Coffin, and David H. C. Read. Among its members was President Dwight Eisenhower.

Interior of a gondola lift station, in this case, an intermediate station where gondolas detach from the line, automatically travel through the building on tracks and attach to the line of the second section. The drive motors for both sections are visible below the bull wheels. A gondola lift is a means of cable transport and type of aerial lift which is supported and propelled by cables from above. It consists of a loop of steel cable that is strung between two stations, sometimes over intermediate supporting towers. The cable is driven by a bullwheel in a terminal, which is typically connected to an engine or electric motor. They are often considered continuous systems since they feature a haul rope which continuously moves and circulates around two terminal stations.Cable Propelled Systems in Urban Environments Edward S. Neumann - Retrieved on 2010-08-05 In contrast, aerial tramways solely operate with fixed grips and simply shuttle back and forth between two end terminals. Depending on the combination of cables used for support and/or haulage and the type of grip (detachable grip vs. fixed grip), the capacity, cost, and functionality of a gondola lift will differ dramatically. Because of the proliferation of such systems in the Alpine regions of Europe, the Funicolare (Italian) or the French name of T√©l√©cabine are also used in English texts. The system may often be referred to as a cable car. Types =Passenger lift= In some systems the passenger cabins, which can hold between two and fifteen people, are connected to the cable by means of spring‚Äìloaded grips. These grips allow the cabin to be detached from the moving cable and slowed in the terminals, to allow passengers to board and disembark. Doors are almost always automatic and controlled by a lever on the roof or on the undercarriage that is pushed up or down. Cabins are driven through the terminals either by rotating tires, or by a chain system. To be accelerated to and decelerated from line speed, cabins are driven along by progressively swifter (or slower) rotating tires until they reach line or terminal speed. On older installations, gondolas are accelerated manually by an operator. Gondola lifts can have intermediate stops that allow for uploading and downloading on the lift. Examples of a lift with three stops instead of the standard two are the Village Gondola, the Excalibur Gondolas at Whistler Blackcomb and the Skyride at Alton Towers. In other systems the cable is slowed intermittently to allow passengers to disembark and embark the cabins at stations, and to allow people in the cars along the route to take photographs, such as Lebanon's T√©l√©f√©rique which offers an exceptional view to the Mediterranean, the historical Jounieh Bay and the pine forest at the 80% slope which this gondola lift goes over. Such a system is called Pulse Cabin because usually more than one cabin are loaded at a time before the trip begins. Tochal mountain telecabine in Tehran at 3,800 meters elevation Open-air gondolas, or cabriolet as commonly called, are fairly uncommon and are quite primitive because they are exposed to the elements. Their cabins are usually hollow cylinder, open from chest height up, with a floor and a cover on the top. They are usually used as village gondolas and for short distances. An example of these are the Cabriolets at Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec, Canada, and at Blue Mountain Ski Resort (summer only, in the winter it is converted to a six person high- speed chairlift.) in Ontario, Canada, The Canyons Resort in Park City, Utah, Mountain Creek, and the new Village Cabriolet at Winter Park Resort in Colorado. Open-air gondolas can also come in a style similar to a pulse gondola, like the Village Gondola at Panorama Ski Resort, British Columbia. The first gondola built in the United States for a ski resort was located at the Wildcat Mountain Ski Area. It was a two-person gondola built in 1957 and serviced skiers until 1999. The lift was later demolished in 2004. The lift and its cabins were manufactured by a former Italian lift company: Carlevaro- Savio. One of the longest gondola rides in the world, Gondelbahn Grindelwald- M√§nnlichen, is in the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland and connects Grindelwald with M√§nnlichen.  Urban transport  In recent years, gondola lifts are finding increased usage in urban environments. Cable cars used for urban transit include the Metrocable in Medell√≠n, Colombia; Portland Aerial Tram in Portland, Oregon, United States; Metrocable in Caracas, Venezuela; Trolcable in M√©rida, Venezuela; Cable A√©reo in Manizales, Colombia; Mi Telef√©rico in La Paz, Bolivia; Mexicable in the State of Mexico, Mexico; Yenimahalle-≈ûentepe teleferik in Ankara, Turkey; the Emirates Air Line in London, UK; and the TransMiCable in Bogot√°, Colombia, due to open at the end of 2018. The Metrocable systems in Medellin and Caracas are fully integrated with the public transit network which provides passengers the ability to seamlessly transfer to the local metro lines.Medellin/Caracas, Part 1 Gondola Project - Retrieved on 2011-03-16D√°vila, JD (ed.), 2013, Urban Mobility and Poverty: Lessons from Medellin and Soacha, Colombia, UCL and Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Disney Skyliner is a gondola-lift service, which opened on September 29, 2019 at Walt Disney World in central Florida. The system uses multiple lines and has five stations, and it connects Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios with one another and with several Disney-owned and -operated resort hotels. In terms of urban gondola systems for the future, TransLink in Metro Vancouver has proposed to build a gondola up Burnaby Mountain to Simon Fraser University in an announcement in September 2010. The project was sidelined in 2014, but was revived in 2017. In late 2012, a widespread aerial gondola system was proposed for Austin, Texas, in an effort to expand mass transit options in the rapidly growing city. The proposal was rejected by the local transit agency in 2017. A proposed gondola system in Montreal was ultimately rejected by the Old Port of Montreal. The technical department of Bergen municipality, Norway suggested in 2016 to build a cable car. The proposed gondola lift was inspired by a similar project in Gothenburg, Sweden and was planned for the Western part of Bergen harbor. =Ropeway conveyor= A ropeway conveyor or material ropewayErnst, Dr.-Ing. Richard (1989). W√∂rterbuch der Industriellen Technik (5th ed.). Wiesbaden: Oscar Brandstetter, 1989, p. 659. . is essentially a subtype of gondola lift, from which containers for goods rather than passenger cars are suspended. Ropeway conveyors are typically found around large mining concerns, and can be of considerable length. The COMILOG Cableway, which ran from Moanda in Gabon to Mbinda in the Republic of the Congo, was over in length. The Norsj√∂ cable car in Sweden had a length of . In Eritrea, the Italians built the Asmara-Massawa Cableway in 1936, which was long. The Manizales - Mariquita Cableway (1922) in Colombia was 73 km long. Conveyors can be powered by a wide variety of forms of power sources: electric motors, internal combustion engines, steam engines, or gravity. Gravity is particularly common in mountainous mining concerns, and directly employed; the weight of loaded down-going containers pulling the returning empties back up the slope. Gravity can also be used indirectly, where running water is available; a waterwheel is powered by gravity acting on water, and is used to power the cable. =Bicable and tricable gondola lifts= Conventional systems where a single cable provides both support and propulsion of the cabins are often called monocable gondola lifts. Gondola lifts which feature one stationary cable (known as the 'support' rope), and one haul rope are known as bicable gondola lifts, while lifts that feature two support ropes and one haul rope are known as tricable gondola lifts. Famous examples of bicable gondola lifts include the Ngong Ping 360 in Hong Kong, the Singapore Cable Car, and the Sulphur Mountain Gondola in Banff, Canada. This system has the advantage that the stationary cable's strength and properties can be tailored to each span, which reduces costs. They differ from aerial tramways , as these consist only of one or two usually larger cabins moving back and forth, rather than circulating. Bicable and tricable systems provide greater lateral stability compared with monocable systems, allowing the system to operate in higher cross-winds.

BID appears to be related to somatoparaphrenia. People with this condition may refer to themselves as \\"transabled\\". Signs and symptoms BID is a rare, infrequently studied condition in which there is a mismatch between the mental body image and the physical body, characterized by an intense desire for amputation of a limb, usually a leg, or to become blind or deaf. The person sometimes has a sense of sexual arousal connected with the desire for loss of a limb or sense. Some act out their desires, pretending they are amputees using prostheses and other tools to ease their desire to be one. Some people with BID have reported to the media or by interview over the telephone with researchers that they have resorted to self-amputation of a \\"superfluous\\" limb by, for example, allowing a train to run over it or otherwise damaging it so severely that surgeons will have to amputate it. However, the medical literature records few, if any, cases of actual self-amputation. To the extent that generalizations can be made, people with BID appear to start to wish for amputation when they are young, between eight and twelve years of age, and often knew a person with an amputated limb when they were children; however, people with BID tend to seek treatment only when they are much older. People with BID seem to be predominantly male, and while there is no evidence that sexual preference is relevant, there does seem to be a correlation with BID and a person having a paraphilia; there appears to be a weak correlation with personality disorders. Family psychiatric history does not appear to be relevant, and there does not appear to be any strong correlation with the site of the limb or limbs that the person wishes they did not have, nor with any past trauma to the undesired limb. Causes As of 2014 the cause was not clear and was a subject of ongoing research. Diagnosis As of 2014 there were no formal diagnostic criteria. =Classification= As of 2014 it remained unclear whether BID is a form of human diversity or a mental disorder. There was debate about including it in the DSM-5 and it was not included; it was also not included in the ICD-10. It has been included in the ICD-11, which reached a stable version in June 2018, as 'Body integrity dysphoria' with code 6C21. The ethics of surgically amputating the undesired limb of a person with BID are difficult and controversial. Treatment There is no evidence-based treatment for BID; there are reports of the use of cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants. Prognosis Outcomes of treated and untreated BID are not known; there are numerous case reports that amputation permanently resolves the desire in affected individuals. History Apotemnophilia was first described in a 1977 article by psychologists Gregg Furth and John Money as primarily sexually oriented. In 1986 Money described a similar condition he called acromotophilia; namely, sexual arousal in response to a partner's amputation. Publications before 2004 were generally case studies. The condition received public attention in the late 1990s after Scottish surgeon Robert Smith amputated limbs of two otherwise healthy people who were desperate to have this done. In 2004 Michael First published the first clinical research in which he surveyed fifty-two people with the condition, a quarter of whom had undergone an amputation. Based on that work, First coined the term \\"body integrity identity disorder\\" to express what he saw as more of an identity disorder than a paraphilia. After First's work, efforts to study BID as a neurological condition looked for possible causes in the brains of people with BID using neuroimaging and other techniques.

At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, Histiaeus and Aristagoras. The cities of Ionia had been conquered by Persia around 540 BC, and thereafter were ruled by native tyrants, nominated by the Persian satrap in Sardis. In 499 BC, the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great. In 498 BC, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they were followed by Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion, but the spread of the revolt to Caria meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there. While initially campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC. By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and they made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade, after the defection of the Samians. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was brought under Persian rule. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was generally considered to be both just and fair. The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, according to Herodotus, Darius decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, began as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt. Sources Coin of Chios just before the revolt, circa 525‚Äì510 BC.\\"a worn Chiot stater\\" described in Kagan p.230, Kabul hoard Coin no.12 in Daniel Schlumberger Tr√©sors Mon√©taires d'Afghanistan (1953) Coin of Lesbos, Ionia. Circa 510‚Äì480 BC. Practically the only primary source for the Ionian Revolt is the Greek historian Herodotus.Fine, pp269‚Äì277 Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',Cicero, On the Laws I, 5 was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek‚ÄîHistoria; English‚Äî(The) Histories) around 440‚Äì430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC). Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least from the point of view of Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it. As Holland has it: \\"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\\"Holland, pp. xvi‚Äìxvii. Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with Thucydides.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. I, 22Finley, p. 15. Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore presumably felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re- writing or correcting. Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay \\"On The Malignity of Herodotus\\", describing Herodotus as philobarbaros (œÜŒπŒªŒøŒ≤Œ¨œÅŒ≤Œ±œÅŒøœÇ, \\"barbarian-lover\\") and for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even- handed.Holland, p. xxiv. A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained widely read. However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by the age of democracy and some archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.Holland, p. 377. The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his Historia, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism. Nevertheless, there are still many historians who believe Herodotus' account has an anti-Persian bias and that much of his story was embellished for dramatic effect.Fehling, pp. 1‚Äì277. Background In the dark age that followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, significant numbers of Greeks emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the Aeolians, Dorians and Ionians.Herodotus I, 142‚Äì151 The Ionians had settled along the coasts of Lydia and Caria, founding the twelve cities which made up Ionia. These cities were Miletus, Myus and Priene in Caria; Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Clazomenae, Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia; and the islands of Samos and Chios.Herodotus I, 142 Although the Ionian cities were independent from each other, they acknowledged their shared heritage, and had a common temple and meeting place, the Panionion. They thus formed a 'cultural league', to which they would admit no other cities, or even other tribal Ionians.Herodotus I, 143Herodotus I, 148 The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king Croesus, in around 560 BC.Herodotus I, 26 The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great.Herodotus I, 141 Darius, with a label in Greek (ŒîŒëŒ°ŒïŒôŒüŒ£, top right), on the Darius Vase. While fighting the Lydians, Cyrus had sent messages to the Ionians asking them to revolt against Lydian rule, which the Ionians had refused to do. After Cyrus completed the conquest of Lydia, the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus. Cyrus refused, citing the Ionians' unwillingness to help him previously. The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves, and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer Ionia.Herodotus I, 163 He first attacked Phocaea; the Phocaeans decided to entirely abandon their city and sail into exile in Sicily, rather than become Persian subjects (although many subsequently returned).Herodotus I, 164 Some Teians also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos, but the rest of the Ionians remained, and were in turn conquered.Herodotus I, 169 The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects ‚Äì such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions.Holland, pp. 147‚Äì151. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, and have to be replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians. About 40 years after the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in the reign of the fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the stand-in Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament.Holland, pp. 153‚Äì154. Aristagoras's uncle Histiaeus had accompanied Darius on campaign in 513 BC, and when offered a reward, had asked for part of the conquered Thracian territory. Although this was granted, Histiaeus's ambition alarmed Darius's advisors, and Histiaeus was thus further 'rewarded' by being compelled to remain in Susa as Darius's \\"Royal Table- Companion\\". Taking over from Histiaeus, Aristagoras was faced with bubbling discontent in Miletus. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him to take control of the island.Herodotus V, 30 Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, with a proposal. If Artaphernes provided an army, Aristagoras would conquer the island, thus extending the boundaries of the empire for Darius, and he would then give Artaphernes a share of the spoils to cover the cost of raising the army.Herodotus V, 31 Artaphernes agreed in principle, and asked Darius for permission to launch the expedition. Darius assented to this, and a force of 200 triremes was assembled in order to attack Naxos the following year.Herodotus V, 32 Naxos campaign (499 BC) In the spring of 499 BC, Artaphernes readied the Persian force, and placed his cousin Megabates in command. He then sent ships on to Miletus, where the Ionian troops levied by Aristagoras embarked, and the force then set sail for Naxos.Herodotus V, 33 The expedition quickly descended into a debacle. Aristagoras fell out with Megabates on the journey towards Naxos, and Herodotus says that Megabates then sent messengers to Naxos, warning the Naxians of the force's intention. It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event, by way of a justification for the subsequent failure of the campaign. At any rate, the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege, and the Persians arrived to a well-defended expedition.Herodotus V, 34 The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory. Start of the Ionian Revolt (499 BC) Location of Ionia within Asia Minor. With the failure of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; he was unable to repay Artaphernes, and had, moreover, alienated himself from the Persian royal family. He fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.Herodotus V, 35 In autumn 499 BC, Aristagoras held a meeting with the members of his faction in Miletus. He declared that in his opinion the Milesians should revolt, to which all but the historian Hecataeus agreed.Herodotus V, 36 At the same time, a messenger sent by Histiaeus arrived in Miletus, imploring Aristagoras to rebel against Darius. Herodotus suggests that this was because Histiaeus was desperate to return to Ionia, and thought he would be sent to Ionia if there was a rebellion. Aristagoras therefore openly declared his revolt against Darius, abdicated from his role as tyrant, and declared Miletus to be a democracy.Holland, pp. 155‚Äì157. Herodotus has no doubt that this was only a pretence on Aristagoras's part of giving up power. Rather it was designed to make the Milesians enthusiastically join the rebellion.Herodotus V, 37 The army that had been sent to Naxos was still assembled at Myus and included contingents from other Greek cities of Asia Minor (i.e. Aeolia and Doris) as well as men from Mytilene, Mylasa, Termera and Cyme. Aristagoras sent men to capture all the Greek tyrants present in the army and handed them over to their respective cities in order to gain the cooperation of those cities. Bury and Meiggs stated that the handovers were done without bloodshed with the exception of Mytilene, whose tyrant was stoned to death; tyrants elsewhere were simply banished.Herodotus V, 38 It has also been suggested (Herodotus does not explicitly say so) that Aristagoras incited the whole army to join his revolt, and also took possession of the ships that the Persians had supplied. If the latter is true, it may explain the length of time it took for the Persians to launch a naval assault on Ionia, since they would have needed to build a new fleet. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras and Histiaeus's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place. Aristagoras had brought all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently realised that the Greeks would need other allies in order to successfully fight the Persians.Holland, pp. 157‚Äì159. In the winter of 499 BC, he first sailed to Sparta, the pre-eminent Greek state in matters of war. However, despite Aristagoras's entreaties, the Spartan king Cleomenes I turned down the offer to lead the Greeks against the Persians. Aristagoras therefore turned instead to Athens. Athens had recently become a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In their fight to establish the democracy, the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid (which was not in the end needed), in return for submitting to Persian overlordship.Holland, p. 142. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens.Herodotus V, 96 The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians had balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies. Aristagoras was also successful in persuading the city of Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians for reasons that are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, possibly referring to the Lelantine War.Herodotus V, 99 The Athenians sent twenty triremes to Miletus, reinforced by five from Eretria. Herodotus described the arrival of these ships as the beginning of troubles between Greeks and barbarians. Ionian offensive (498 BC) Ionian Revolt: Sardis campaign (498 BC) Over the winter, Aristagoras continued to foment rebellion. In one incident, he told a group of Paeonians (originally from Thrace), who Darius had brought to live in Phrygia, to return to their homeland. Herodotus says that his only purpose in doing this was to vex the Persian high command.Herodotus V, 98 =Sardis= Remains of the acropolis of Sardis. The burning of Sardis by the Greeks during the Ionian Revolt in 498 BC. In the spring of 498 BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, set sail for Ionia.Holland, pp. 160‚Äì162. They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus.Herodotus V, 100 Declining to personally lead the force, Aristagoras appointed his brother Charopinus and another Milesian, Hermophantus, as generals. This force was then guided by the Ephesians through the mountains to Sardis, Artaphernes's satrapal capital. The Greeks caught the Persians unaware, and were able to capture the lower city. However, Artaphernes still held the citadel with a significant force of men. The lower city then caught on fire, Herodotus suggests accidentally, which quickly spread. The Persians in the citadel, being surrounded by a burning city, emerged into the market-place of Sardis, where they fought with the Greeks, forcing them back. The Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus.Herodotus V, 101 Herodotus reports that when Darius heard of the burning of Sardis, he swore vengeance upon the Athenians (after asking who they indeed were), and tasked a servant with reminding him three times each day of his vow: \\"Master, remember the Athenians\\".Herodotus V, 105 =Battle of Ephesus= Herodotus says that when the Persians in Asia Minor heard of the attack on Sardis, they gathered together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes.Herodotus V, 102 When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability to catch up with the Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley of arrows.Lazenby, p. 232. It is clear that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were completely routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece. =Spread of the revolt= The Athenians now ended their alliance with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved to be anything but the easy prey that Aristagoras had described.Herodotus V, 103 However, the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians did not seem to follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.Herodotus V, 104 Persian counter-offensive (497‚Äì495 BC) Achaemenid cavalry in Asia Minor. Altƒ±kula√ß Sarcophagus. Herodotus's narrative after the Battle of Ephesus is ambiguous in its exact chronology; historians generally place Sardis and Ephesus in 498 BC. Herodotus next describes the spread of the revolt (thus also in 498 BC), and says that the Cypriots had one year of freedom, therefore placing the action in Cyprus to 497 BC.Herodotus V, 116 He next says that > \\"Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, all of them Persian generals and married to > daughters of Darius, pursued those Ionians who had marched to Sardis, and > drove them to their ships. After this victory they divided the cities among > themselves and sacked them.\\" This passage implies these Persian generals counter-attacked immediately after the Battle of Ephesus. However, the cities that Herodotus describes Daurises as besieging were on the Hellespont,Herodotus V, 117 which (by Herodotus's own reckoning) did not become involved in the revolt until after Ephesus. It is therefore easiest to reconcile the account by assuming that Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes waited until the next campaigning season (i.e., 497 BC), before going on the counter-offensive. The Persian actions that Herodotus described at the Hellespont and in Caria seem to be in the same year, and most commentators place them in 497 BC.Boardman et al, pp. 481‚Äì490. =Cyprus= Map showing the ancient kingdoms of Cyprus In Cyprus, all the kingdoms had revolted except that of Amathus. The leader of the Cypriot revolt was Onesilus, brother of the king of Salamis, Gorgus. Gorgus did not want to revolt, so Onesilus locked his brother out of the city and made himself king. Gorgus went over to the Persians, and Onesilus persuaded the other Cypriots, apart from the Amathusians, to revolt. He then settled down to besiege Amathus. The following year (497 BC), Onesilus (still besieging Amathus), heard that a Persian force under Artybius had been dispatched to Cyprus. Onesilus thus sent messengers to Ionia, asking them to send reinforcements, which they did, \\"in great force\\".Herodotus V, 108 A Persian army eventually arrived in Cyprus, supported by a Phoenician fleet. The Ionians opted to fight at sea and defeated the Phoenicians.Herodotus V, 109 In the simultaneous land battle outside Salamis, the Cypriots gained an initial advantage, killing Artybius. However, the defection of two contingents to the Persians crippled their cause, they were routed and Onesilus was killed. The revolt in Cyprus was thus crushed and the Ionians sailed home.Herodotus V, 113 =Hellespont and Propontis= The Persian forces in Asia Minor seem to have been reorganised in 497 BC, with three of Darius's sons-in-law, Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, taking charge of three armies. Herodotus suggests that these generals divided up the rebellious lands between themselves and then set out to attack their respective areas. Daurises, who seems to have had the largest army, initially took his army to the Hellespont. There, he systematically besieged and took the cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus, and Paesus, each in a single day according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion. This places the timing of the Carian revolt to early 497 BC. Hymaees went to the Propontis and took the city of Cius. After Daurises moved his forces towards Caria, Hymaees marched towards the Hellespont and captured many of the Aeolian cities as well as some of the cities in the Troad. However, he then fell ill and died, ending his campaign.Herodotus V, 122 Meanwhile, Otanes, together with Artaphernes, campaigned in Ionia (see below).Herodotus V, 123 =Caria (496 BC)= Battle of the Marsyas Ionian revolt: Carian campaign (496 BC). Hearing that the Carians had rebelled, Daurises led his army south into Caria. The Carians gathered at the \\"White Pillars\\", on the Marsyas River (the modern √áine), a tributary of the Meander.Herodotus V, 118 Pixodorus, a relative of the king of Cilicia, suggested that the Carians should cross the river and fight with it at their backs, so as to prevent retreat and thus make them fight more bravely. This idea was rejected and the Carians made the Persians cross the river to fight them. The ensuing battle was, according to Herodotus, a long affair, with the Carians fighting obstinately before eventually succumbing to the weight of Persian numbers. Herodotus suggests that 10,000 Carians and 2,000 Persians died in the battle.Herodotus V, 119 Battle of Labraunda The survivors of Marsyas fell back to a sacred grove of Zeus at Labraunda and deliberated whether to surrender to the Persians or to flee Asia altogether. However, while deliberating, they were joined by a Milesian army, and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting. The Persians then attacked the army at Labraunda, and inflicted an even heavier defeat, with the Milesians suffering particularly bad casualties.Herodotus V, 120 Battle of Pedasus After the double victory over the Carians, Daurises began the task of reducing the Carian strongholds. The Carians resolved to fight on, and decided to lay an ambush for Daurises on the road through Pedasus.Herodotus V, 121 Herodotus implies that this occurred more or less directly after Labraunda, but it has also been suggested that Pedasus occurred the following year (496 BC), giving the Carians time to regroup. The Persians arrived at Pedasus during the night, and the ambush was sprung to great effect. The Persian army was annihilated and Daurises and the other Persian commanders were slain. The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC. Greek hoplite and Persian warrior depicted fighting. 5th century BC =Ionia= The third Persian army, under the command of Otanes and Artaphernes, attacked Ionia and Aeolia.Herodotus V, 123 They re- took Clazomenae and Cyme, probably in 497 BC, but then seem to have been less active in 496 BC and 495 BC, probably as a result of the calamity in Caria. At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing his untenable position, decided to abandon his responsibilities as leader of Miletus and of the revolt. He left Miletus with all the members of his faction who would accompany him, and went to the part of Thrace that Darius had granted to Histiaeus after the campaign of 513 BC.Herodotus V, 124‚Äì126 Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled. Some modern historians have suggested that he went to Thrace to exploit the greater natural resources of the region, and thus support the revolt. Others have suggested that finding himself at the centre of an internal conflict in Miletus, he chose to go into exile rather than exacerbate the situation. In Thrace, he took control of the city that Histiaeus had founded, Myrcinus (site of the later Amphipolis), and started campaigning against the local Thracian population. However, during one campaign, probably in either 497 BC or 496 BC, he was killed by the Thracians.Thucydides IV, 102 Aristagoras was the one man who might have been able to provide the revolt with a sense of purpose, but after his death the revolt was left effectively leaderless. Shortly after this, Histiaeus was released from his duties in Susa by Darius and sent to Ionia. He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt. However, Herodotus leaves us in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi-captivity in Persia.Herodotus V, 106‚Äì107 When he arrived in Sardis, Artaphernes directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with Aristagoras: \\"I will tell you, Histiaeus, the truth of this business: it was you who stitched this shoe, and Aristagoras who put it on.\\"Herodotus VI, 1 Histiaeus fled that night to Chios and eventually made his way back to Miletus.Herodotus VI, 5 However, having just got rid of one tyrant, the Milesians were in no mood to receive Histiaeus back. He therefore went to Mytilene in Lesbos and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes. He set sail for Byzantium with all those who would follow him. There he established himself, seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the Bosporus, unless they agreed to serve him. End of the revolt (494‚Äì493 BC) =Battle of Lade= Ionian revolt, Battle of Lade and fall of Miletus (494 BC). By the sixth year of the revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The available land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre.Herodotus VI, 6 The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible that he was in overall command of this Persian offensive. Hearing of the approach of this force, the Ionians met at the Panionium, and decided not to attempt to fight on land, leaving the Milesians to defend their walls. Instead, they opted to gather every ship they could and make for the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus, in order to \\"fight for Miletus at sea\\". The Ionians were joined by the Aeolian islanders from Lesbos, and altogether they had 353 triremes.Herodotus VI, 8 According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were concerned that they would not be able to defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, would not be able to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians.Herodotus VI, 9 This approach was initially unsuccessful,Herodotus VI, 10 but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp.Herodotus VI, 12 These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.Herodotus VI, 13 Soon after, the Persian fleet moved to attack the Ionians, who sailed out to meet them. However, as the two sides neared each other, the Samians sailed away back to Samos, as they had agreed with the Persians. The Lesbians, seeing their neighbours in the battle-line sail away, promptly fled as well, causing the rest of the Ionian line to dissolve.Herodotus VI, 14 The Chians, together with a small number of ships from other cities, stubbornly remained and fought the Persians, but most of the Ionians fled to their cities.Herodotus VI, 15 The Chians fought valiantly, at one point breaking the Persian line and capturing many ships, but sustaining many losses of their own; eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away, thereby ending the battle.Herodotus VI, 16 =Fall of Miletus= The ruins of Miletus With the defeat of the Ionian fleet, the revolt was effectively over. Miletus was closely invested, the Persians \\"mining the walls and using every device against it, until they utterly captured it\\". According to Herodotus, most of the men were killed, and the women and children were enslaved.Herodotus VI, 19 Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this, showing widespread signs of destruction, and abandonment of much of the city in the aftermath of Lade. However, some Milesians did remain in (or quickly returned to) Miletus, though the city would never recapture its former greatness. Miletus was thus notionally \\"left empty of Milesians\\";Herodotus VI, 22 the Persians took the city and coastal land for themselves, and gave the rest of the Milesian territory to Carians from Pedasus.Herodotus VI, 20 The captive Milesians were brought before Darius in Susa, who settled them at \\"Amp√©\\" on the coast of the Persian Gulf, near the mouth of the Tigris. Many Samians were appalled by the actions of their generals at Lade, and resolved to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces of Samos, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle on the coast of Sicily, and took with them the Milesians who had managed to escape from the Persians. Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade.Herodotus VI, 25 Most of Caria now surrendered to the Persians, although some strongholds had to be captured through force. =Histiaeus's campaign (493 BC)= Chios When Histiaeus heard of the fall of Miletus, he seems to have appointed himself as leader of the resistance against Persia. Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to Chios. The Chians refused to receive him, so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus's leadership.Herodotus VI, 26 Battle of Malene Histiaeus now gathered a large force of Ionians and Aeolians and went to besiege Thasos. However, he then received the news that the Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia, so he quickly returned to Lesbos.Herodotus VI, 28 In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near Atarneus and Myus. A large Persian force under Harpagus was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing battle was hard fought, but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge, routing the Greek line.Herodotus VI, 29 Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians, thinking that he would be able to talk himself into a pardon from Darius. However, he was taken to Artaphernes instead, who, fully aware of Histiaeus's past treachery, impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to Darius.Herodotus VI, 30 =Final operations (493 BC)= The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos. On each, they made a 'human-net' of troops and swept across the whole island to flush out any hiding rebels.Herodotus VI, 31 They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia, similarly seeking out any remaining rebels. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. Herodotus says that the Persians chose the most handsome boys from each city and castrated them, and chose the most beautiful girls and sent them away to the king's harem, and then burnt the temples of the cities.Herodotus VI, 32 While this is possibly true, Herodotus also probably exaggerates the scale of devastation. In a few years, the cities had more-or-less returned to normal and they were able to equip a large fleet for the second Persian invasion of Greece, just 13 years later.Herodotus VI, 94 The Persian army then re- conquered the settlements on the Asian side of the Propontis, while the Persian fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.Herodotus VI, 33 Aftermath Ionian soldier (Old Persian cuneiform êéπêé¢êé¥, YaunƒÅ)Darius I, DNa inscription, Line 28 of the Achaemenid army, circa 480 BCE. Xerxes I tomb relief. Once the inevitable punishment of the rebels had occurred, the Persians were in the mood for conciliation. Since these regions were now Persian territory again, it made no sense to harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions. Artaphernes thus set out to re-establish a workable relationship with his subjects.Holland, pp. 175‚Äì177. He summoned representatives from each Ionian city to Sardis, and told them that henceforth, rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves, disputes would be resolved by arbitration, seemingly by a panel of judges. Furthermore, he re-surveyed the land of each city, and set their tribute level in proportion to its size.Herodotus VI, 42 Artaphernes had also witnessed just how much the Ionians disliked tyrannies, and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of Ionia. The following year, Mardonius, another son-in-law of Darius, would travel to Ionia and abolish the tyrannies, replacing them with democracies.Herodotus VI, 43 The peace established by Artaphernes would long be remembered as just and fair. Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices, especially those dealing with Apollo.Herodotus VI, 42‚Äì45 Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry, and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek names instead of Persian names. Darius' conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks, so that in 491 BC, when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission (earth and water), initially most city-states accepted the offer, Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions.Herodotus VI, 49 For the Persians, the only unfinished business that remained by the end of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria. Therefore, the first Persian invasion of Greece effectively began in the following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.Herodotus VI, 94‚Äì116 Significance Coin of Chios after the revolt, circa 490‚Äì435 BCE. Earlier types known. The Ionian Revolt was primarily of significance as the opening chapter in, and causative agent of, the Greco-Persian Wars, which included the two invasions of Greece and the famous battles of Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis. For the Ionian cities themselves, the revolt ended in failure, and substantial losses, both material and economic. However, Miletus aside, they recovered relatively quickly and prospered under Persian rule for the next forty years. For the Persians, the revolt was significant in drawing them into an extended conflict with the states of Greece which would last for fifty years, over which time they would sustain considerable losses.Holland, pp. 362‚Äì363. Militarily, it is difficult to draw too many conclusions from the Ionian Revolt, save for what the Greeks and Persians may (or may not) have learnt about each other. Certainly, the Athenians, and Greeks in general, seem to have been impressed by the power of Persian cavalry, with the Greek armies displaying considerable caution during the following campaigns when confronted by the Persian cavalry.Holland, pp. 191‚Äì193Lazenby, pp. 217‚Äì219. Conversely, the Persians seem not to have realised or noticed the potential of the Greek hoplites as heavy infantry. At the Battle of Marathon, in 490 BC, the Persians took little heed of a primarily hoplitic army, resulting in their defeat. Furthermore, despite the possibility of recruiting heavy infantry from their domains, the Persians began the second invasion of Greece without doing so, and again encountered major problems in the face of Greek armies.Lazenby, pp. 23‚Äì29. It is possible that, given the ease of their victories over the Greeks at Ephesus, and similarly armed forces at the battles of the Marsyas River and Labraunda, the Persians simply disregarded the military value of the hoplite phalanx‚Äîto their cost.Lazenby, p. 258. In Modern Literature Gore Vidal describes the Ionian Revolt in his historical novel \\"Creation\\", presenting events from the Persian point of view. Vidal suggests that the Ionian Revolt might have had far- reaching results not perceived by the Greeks, i.e., that King Darius had contemplated an extensive campaign of conquest in India, coveting the wealth of its kingdoms, and that this Indian campaign was aborted due to the Persians needing their military resources on the western side of their empire.

While tactically indecisive, the battle secured the Union control of northwestern Arkansas. A division of Union troops in the Army of the Frontier, commanded by James G. Blunt, was posted in northwestern Arkansas after winning the Battle of Cane Hill on November 28. A Confederate army commanded by Thomas Hindman moved towards Blunt's division in order to attack while it was isolated. However, Blunt was reinforced by two divisions commanded by Francis J. Herron, leading Hindman to take a defensive position on some high ground known as Prairie Grove. Herron attempted to assault Hindman's lines twice, but both attacks were beaten off with heavy casualties. Hindman responded to the repulse of each of Herron's attacks with unsuccessful counterattacks of his own. Later in the day, Blunt arrived and attacked Hindman's flank. Eventually, both sides disengaged and the fighting reached an inconclusive result. However, the unavailability of reinforcements forced Hindman's army to retreat from the field, giving the Union army a strategic victory and control of northwestern Arkansas. Today, a portion of the battlefield is preserved within Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park. Background In March 1862, a Confederate army under the command of Earl Van Dorn engaged a Union army led by Samuel Ryan Curtis at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwestern Arkansas. Curtis' army soundly defeated Van Dorn's. After being defeated at Pea Ridge, Van Dorn and a substantial portion of his army were reassigned across the Mississippi River, effectively ending Confederate control of the region. Following Pea Ridge, Curtis drove further into Arkansas and planned to attack Memphis, but was ordered by Henry Halleck to send half of his force to Cape Girardeau for transfer to Tennessee. Curtis complied and was forced to abandon his plan, instead heading towards Little Rock, Arkansas. After a defeat in a small action near Searcy, Curtis decided that his supply line was vulnerable, and fell back, eventually reaching Helena. In September, Curtis was assigned to command the Department of the Missouri, replacing its previous commander, John M. Schofield. Curtis later formed the Army of the Frontier and appointed Schofield to command the new army on October 12. However, on November 20, Schofield was forced to give up command of the army due to medical issues, and command passed to Brig. Gen. James G. Blunt. At the time of Schofield's relinquishment of command, Blunt's division was in Arkansas, while the rest of the Army of the Frontier was stationed near Wilson's Creek in Missouri, where a battle had been fought the year before. The Confederate commander in the region, Thomas C. Hindman, had previously commanded the Trans-Mississippi Department, but his firm control of the region led to protests from prominent Arkansas civilians, leading Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America, to relieve Hindman of command and replace him with Theophilus Holmes. On August 21, Holmes tasked Hindman with producing an organized army from the Confederate units in the Arkansas region and moving to regain control of Missouri for the Confederacy. In October, Blunt's force made an incursion into Arkansas, and Hindman sent 2,000 men under Marmaduke's command to intercept Blunt and prevent Blunt from joining the main Union force near Springfield, Missouri. Marmaduke gathered at Cane Hill, a ridge near the Boston Mountains. In response, Blunt marched his troops in two days, meeting Marmaduke's force near Canehill, Arkansas. In the ensuing Battle of Cane Hill, which took place on November 28, Blunt's 5,000 men defeated Marmaduke's 2,000 in a nine-hour battle. Opposing forces =Union= Herron At the beginning of the Prairie Grove campaign, the Union Army of the Frontier was commanded by John M. Schofield. Schofield's army was divided into three divisions, commanded by James G. Blunt, James Totten, and Francis Herron. Blunt's division was known as the 'Kansas Division', as many of the soldiers in the division were from Kansas. The division also contained sizable numbers of African American and Native American soldiers, which made Blunt's division unique among Union units in 1862. Totten's and Herron's divisions were both known as the 'Missouri Division', and contained men from Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Indiana. The division also contained a regiment of Arkansas cavalrymen who had remained loyal to the Union despite the secession of Arkansas. =Confederate= Hindman The Confederate army present at Prairie Grove was the Trans-Mississippi Army, commanded by Thomas Hindman. Hindman's command was formed of four divisions: one of cavalry, two of infantry, and a mixed reserve division. The cavalry division consisted of men from Arkansas, Texas, and Confederate Missouri, and was commanded by John S. Marmaduke. Marmaduke's division was poorly armed. The army's two infantry divisions were commanded by Daniel M. Frost and Francis Shoup. Shoup's division consisted of Arkansas infantrymen, while Frost's division was mostly Missourians, although some Arkansas troops were included. The reserve division was commanded by John S. Roane, and was poorly equipped, organized, and led (Theophilus Holmes stated that Roane was \\"useless as a commander\\"). Of Hindman and his division commanders, all had previous military experience. In particular, Hindman, Frost, and Roane had all seen action in the Mexican- American War. Maneuvering to battle =Hindman's offensive= After the Battle of Cane Hill, Hindman decided to send his entire army towards Cane Hill in order to assault Blunt. If all went according to Hindman's plan, he would be able to assault Blunt's position from both the front and along both flanks. At this time, Union forces menaced the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg, Mississippi. On November 11, Confederate government ordered Holmes to send 10,000 troops to reinforce Vicksburg. Holmes replied that two-thirds of his troops were in northwest Arkansas to oppose a Federal threat. Even so, he ordered Hindman to bring his troops to Little Rock. Holmes tried to dissuade Hindman from his plan to attack Blunt and the two generals engaged in an argument over the telegraph. Hindman had a forceful personality and won the argument with Holmes. By December 1, Hindman gathered 12,000 troops near Van Buren. The Confederate infantry and artillery moved out of their camps on December 3. Blunt's intelligence services alerted him to Hindman's preparations by the evening of December 2; a courier immediately set out for the telegraph station at Elkhorn Tavern. The messages included a situation report for Curtis in St Louis and an urgent request for Totten to send reinforcements. Blunt prepared to defend himself by posting William Weer's 2nd Brigade and William F. Cloud's 3rd Brigade on high ground south of Newburg with elements of Frederick Salomon's 1st Brigade watching Hogeye Road. A cavalry outpost was set up on Cove Creek Road to watch for Hindman's advance. Every morning from December 3 to 6, Blunt had his troops on the alert, with wagons packed and ready to move quickly. On 27 November, Curtis ordered Totten back to St Louis to be a witness on a court-martial. The unpopular Totten's departure pleased his soldiers and Daniel Huston Jr. assumed command of the 2nd Division. Within a few hours of receiving Blunt's telegraphed call for help, Herron started the 2nd and 3rd Divisions on \\"an epic of human endurance\\". From the afternoon of December 3 to the morning of December 7, Huston's and Herron's divisions marched respectively. Herron's two divisions averaged per day over rough roads in intensely cold weather with short stops to eat and sleep. In the early hours of December 6, Herron received a message from Blunt asking for cavalry. Herron promptly dispatched Dudley Wickersham with a 1,600-man provisional cavalry brigade which reached Blunt at 9:00 pm that same day after a march. =Hindman's new plan= On December 5, Joseph O. Shelby's 1,200-man Confederate cavalry brigade began pressing back the 400 troopers of the 2nd Kansas Volunteer Cavalry Regiment that guarded the Cove Creek Road. Blunt knew that if Hindman continued to use Cove Creek Road, it would be easy for him to cut off the Confederate retreat route. Blunt assumed correctly that Hindman intended to turn to the west and approach Newburg. However, Hindman's plan would change. The bad weather slowed down the march of Hindman's soldiers, so he postponed his planned attack until December 7. He believed that the nearest Union forces were near Springfield, but what he did not know was that Blunt anticipated the Confederate offensive and that Union reinforcements were approaching. On December 6 near mid-day, the 2nd Kansas Cavalry abandoned its blocking position on Cove Creek Road and withdrew northwest toward Newburg. That afternoon, James C. Monroe's Confederate cavalry brigade, supported by other units, skirmished with the 2nd Kansas Cavalry on Reed's Mountain. By nightfall Monroe's troopers occupied that terrain feature on the road to Newburg. That evening, Hindman and his commanders received startling intelligence that Herron's two divisions would reach Blunt the following day. Hindman realized that attacking Blunt at Newburg would simply push him back toward Herron's reinforcements. The Confederate commander knew that marching back to Van Buren would demoralize his soldiers, so he changed his plan. Hindman's new plan called for the army to march north on Cove Creek Road to Prairie Grove. At that location he would first crush Herron's force, then swing around and smash Blunt. The risk was that Hindman might be caught between the two Union forces if Blunt found out what was happening. At 4:00 am on December 7, the Confederate army began to march north along Cove Creek Road. =Morning clashes= Early on December 7, Marmaduke's 2,000 cavalrymen reached Prairie Grove and discovered 650 Union troopers of the 6th Missouri and 7th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry Regiments nearby. Helped by the fact that many Confederates wore captured blue uniforms, Shelby's troopers surprised and routed their opponents. The Union 1st Arkansas Cavalry Regiment soon appeared on the Fayetteville Road and was also routed when the Missourians fled through their ranks and Shelby's Confederates charged into them. The Confederate pursuit continued east past the Illinois River, but ended when it encountered the leading elements of Herron's main column. Shelby was briefly captured, then rescued during a melee with the 1st Missouri Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. During the early morning action, Marmaduke's horsemen inflicted casualties of 10 killed, 19 wounded, and 262 captured on the Union cavalry and seized 21 wagons. Herron's approaching infantry ignored the panicked Union horsemen and its bold front convinced Marmaduke to pull back to the west side of the river. By the time Frost's 6,300-strong division reached Prairie Grove, Hindman lost his nerve. The Confederate commander might have attacked Herron at once with Frost's powerful division. Fearing that Blunt might intervene, Hindman ordered Frost to face southwest and block the Fayetteville Road. While Hindman waited for Shoup's Arkansas division, Herron had time to push Marmaduke out of his way and reach the Illinois River. When Shoup's 3,200 soldiers arrived at 10:00 am, Shoup assumed a defensive position on the high ground at Prairie Grove. After directing the deployment of Frost's troops, Hindman returned to Prairie Grove. He scolded Shoup for not attacking Herron, but allowed the Arkansas soldiers to remain in position. =Blunt's march= Blunt When Hindman's army started north on Cove Creek Road, Monroe's 400 Confederate horsemen were left at Reed's Mountain to deceive Blunt. In the early morning, a Union officer detected Hindman's column marching along the Cove Creek Road. This information was reported to Union headquarters, but Blunt was not there and the critical message was not forwarded for two hours. About 9:00 am, Blunt was at Newburg expecting to be attacked when he finally realized that Hindman's army was no longer there. By 10:00 am Blunt got his division marching north on Fayetteville Road. Blunt sent William R. Judson with 400 cavalry and two M1841 mountain howitzers up the Cove Creek Road. Judson's column got within of Prairie Grove and fired its howitzers for 30 minutes, but withdrew when confronted by superior forces. Wickersham provisional cavalry brigade led Blunt's column as it hurried north on the Fayetteville Road. Believing that Rhea's Mill was his destination, Wickersham turned his brigade onto Bottom Road. By the time Blunt realized what happened, his division was marching toward Rhea's Mill. Wickersham's mistake turned out to Blunt's advantage because it brought his division to the battlefield by the least obstructed route. By 1:00 pm Blunt division reached Rhea's Mill where the soldiers rested. A half-hour later, Wickersham headed east on the Viney Grove Road toward Prairie Grove where the thunder of cannon was heard. Salomon's brigade stayed at Rhea's Mill guarding the wagon train. By 2:30 pm the infantry followed the cavalry. Since the countryside was flat, the different regiments spontaneously quit the road and set out cross-country at a rapid pace. Battle Battle of Prairie Grove. North is down. On December 7, the Confederate divisions of Shoup and Marmaduke aligned along the length of Prairie Grove. Later that morning, Herron's Union division reached the field, and, not suspecting that he faced a substantial portion of the Confederate army, opened up an artillery bombardment. Herron was soon joined by Huston's division. After Herron and Huston had fully deployed their troops, Herron reopened the artillery barrage, which had paused earlier. The Confederate artillery attempted to respond, but their cannons were of inferior quality and lacked the range to properly respond. In addition, the Confederates were also short of artillery ammunition. As a result, the Union gunners were able to wreak havoc in the Confederate line. Confident after watching the result of the artillery bombardment, Herron sent his two brigades, commanded by Colonel William W. Orme and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Bertram, towards the Confederate line near a farm owned by Archibald Borden. Herron's troops made contact with the main Confederate line and one of Bertram's regiments, the 20th Wisconsin, overran a Confederate artillery battery. However, a counterattack by elements from the brigades of James F. Fagan and Dandridge McRae (both of Shoup's Confederate division) drove off the Wisconsin unit, and brigade commander Bertram was wounded. After the repulse of Bertram's attack, some of Orme's men joined in the fight, only to be driven off. An abortive Confederate counterattack was then driven off by Herron's artillery. The two Union regiments that were the hardest engagedBertram's 20th Wisconsin and Orme's 19th Iowaboth suffered losses of approximately fifty percent. Borden House on the Prairie Grove Battlefield After the defeat of Herron's division, Huston deployed some of his men into the fray. The 26th Indiana attacked Marmaduke's Confederate cavalry, and were driven off by a force that included Shelby's brigade and Quantrill's Raiders. Huston ordered the 37th Illinois to charge towards the Borden house, and the Illinois soldiers experienced initial success. However, a Confederate counterattack drove the 37th Illinois back to the main Union line. Fagan and Shelby led their men further on towards Herron's main line, and the two brigades were joined by a third under Emmett MacDonald. This attack was also defeated, as the combined fire of Herron's artillery and the survivors of Orme's brigade broke the Confederate assault. Wickersham's 1,600 Union cavalry reached the battlefield, followed at 3:15 pm by Blunt with his staff and escort. A messenger from Blunt soon alerted Herron that his division was coming. As the news spread, Herron's men gave a cheer. Blunt opened fire on the Confederate army with 30 cannons. Hindman responded by ordering Frost to use his division to counter Blunt. Frost, in turn, sent a brigade commanded by Mosby M. Parsons to the left of Shoup's position. A brigade of dismounted Texas cavalry from Roane's command was also sent to the front, forming to the left of Parsons' brigade. Blunt's forces then prepared to attack the new Confederate left, strengthened by the addition of the 20th Iowa, one of Huston's Union regiments. The 20th Iowa and the First Indian Home Guard assaulted the Confederate line, only to be repulsed. The Confederates responded to the abortive Union assault with another counterattack, using several of McRae's brigade. Further down the line, Weer's Union brigade of began advancing towards Parsons' line. In response, Parsons moved his brigade forward from his original position, creating a confused fight between the two armies' main lines. Eventually, Parsons realized that his line was longer than Weer's, and pushed hard on both flanks of the Union position. Weer was forced to retreat, and Parsons began a counterattack. However, this attack was driven off by Blunt's massed artillery. As darkness fell, both sides gradually disengaged. While Hindman still held the field, he had no reinforcements and was running out of ammunition. Meanwhile, the Union armies had been reinforced by trailing elements of Herron's command. The Confederate army was forced to withdraw from the field, suffering many losses to desertion in the process. While the fighting was inconclusive, the Confederate withdrawal gave the Union a strategic victory. Aftermath Map of Prairie Grove Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Union forces reported suffering 1,251 casualties, including 175 dead, 813 wounded, and 263 missing. Confederate forces reported 1,317 casualties, including 164 dead, 817 wounded, and 336 missing. However, these reported totals may be too low, as only slightly wounded soldiers were not often counted. In addition, Confederate forces suffered from severe demoralization and lost many conscript soldiers during and after the campaign to desertion. The Confederates were forced to leave many of their dead on the field, but had to pile the bodies into heaps and surround them with makeshift barriers to keep feral pigs from desecrating the corpses. The retreat of the Confederate forces from the field gave Union forces control of northwestern Arkansas. On December 23, Blunt learned that Schofield was on his way to rejoin the army and take overall command. Blunt and Herron decided to attempt one last strike at Hindman's Confederate army before Schofield, who was concerned about the potential of Holmes reinforcing the Confederates army, arrived.

He was a member of the Liberal Party of Quebec and was the 25th Premier of the Province of Quebec, Canada for nine months in 1994 until his party's defeat in the provincial general election. Life and career Johnson was born in Montreal, Quebec. He is the son of Reine Gagn√© and Daniel Johnson Sr., who had been the Premier of Quebec from 1966 to his death in 1968, as the leader of the Union Nationale, a conservative political party. His brother is Pierre- Marc Johnson, Parti Qu√©b√©cois leader from 1985-1987 and Premier of Quebec from October 3 to December 12, 1985. Johnson received his Bachelor of Laws degree from the Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1966. He also received LL.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University College London in 1968 and 1971 respectively, as well as a Master of Business Administration from the Harvard Business School in 1973. Johnson immediately began his career in the business world and worked for Power Corporation of Canada from 1973 to 1981. He served as the Vice- President of Power Corp. from 1978 to 1981. During that period, Daniel Johnson was active in the Montreal community, acting as Vice-president of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, and sat on other non-profit boards, such as the Montreal Heart Institute and the Grands Ballets Canadiens. Political career Johnson was first elected to the National Assembly of Quebec in the riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges in the 1981 Quebec general election. He ran for the 1983 Quebec Liberal Party leadership convention but finished third behind Pierre Paradis and winner Robert Bourassa. He was re-elected in the 1985 election, which brought the Liberals to power. He became Minister of industry and Commerce in the Quebec government, and was Chairman of the Treasury Board from June 1988 until January 1994. In January 1994, he became leader of the Quebec Liberal Party and Premier of Quebec following the resignation of Liberal leader Robert Bourassa. He then lost the 1994 provincial election to Jacques Parizeau of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois. During the 1995 Quebec referendum, he headed the \\"No\\" federalist campaign, in opposition to the PQ's proposals for Quebec sovereignty. With the sovereignty campaign leading in polls, Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien and federal Progressive Conservative leader (and former Deputy Prime Minister) Jean Charest went to the province to help the \\"No\\" side campaign. The \\"No\\" side narrowly won the referendum. Johnson served as Liberal party leader and leader of the Opposition until 1998 when he was succeeded by Jean Charest. Post-political career Since 1998, Daniel Johnson has acted as Senior Counsel with the law firm McCarthy T√©trault LLP.

History The original Clapham Park Estate was a speculative development by Thomas Cubitt, who bought of Bleak Hall Farm in 1825, and marked out plots for building around the new, broad, tree-lined streets of Kings Avenue, Clarence Avenue, Poynders Road and Atkins Road. The estate was planned to consist of large detached houses in Cubitt's characteristic Italianate villa style, with each house set in extensive grounds. However, Cubitt's ambitions were never fulfilled, and some plots remained undeveloped at the outbreak of World War I. Cubitt's own residence, Lincoln House, was demolished in 1905, and Rodenhurst Road, a street of large, double-fronted, semi-detached Edwardian houses, was laid out on the site. British statesman Arthur Henderson once lived at number 13 and there is a Blue Plaque on the house indicating this. With the adoption of Poynders Road as the arterial \\"South Circular\\" road, this area is now severed from the area further south by traffic, and the streets south of Poynders Road are not generally referred to as being part of Clapham Park. = Clapham Park West Estate= Following World War II, Oaklands House, Oakfield House, Clarence House, and their associated grounds underwent much development as this area was significantly bombed. The area immediately to the east of the Estate had been developed by the London County Council (LCC) in the 1920s as council housing, mostly in characteristic blocks of neo-Georgian brick flats. After World War II most of the Cubitt houses were demolished and the northern part of the original area was redeveloped by the LCC in a very different Modern Movement style. On completion of the scheme the Clapham Park Estate became the largest single council estate within the London Borough of Lambeth. London Borough of Lambeth Council also built tower blocks west of Clarence Avenue, including three tower blocks (Barnsbury, Belgravia and Bloomsbury houses) commemorating Cubitt's more successful developments. An air raid shelter is still situated within the former grounds of Clarence House, now the Clapham Park West Estate. Some of the undeveloped plots on the southern part of the estate were developed with medium-density terraced and semi-detached houses, but the majority of the grounds associated with Oakfield House were transformed into the Poynders Garden Estate and an open green space now called Agnes Riley Gardens. =Metropolitan Clapham Park= Metropolitan Clapham Park is an estate, run in partnership with Metropolitan, a housing association that was formed to take over the ownership and management of houses on the Clapham Park estate following the stock transfer of the estate from the council to Metropolitan Housing in 2006. Since May 2006, Metropolitan Clapham Park has provided a housing management and maintenance service to Clapham Park tenants who are renting their homes. Clapham Park also offers services to leaseholders, shared ownership schemes, and private residents of the estate. Formerly known as Clapham Park Homes, the housing association was renamed Metropolitan Clapham Park in April 2012. Metropolitan Clapham Park is a limited company and is managed by a board that is responsible for the organisation. The board is made up of residents, local authority, local councillors, nominees and independent members. All board members serve in a voluntary capacity. =New Deals for Communities= In February 1999, the Clapham Park area was selected by a borough-wide strategic partnership to be Lambeth's New Deal for Communities (NDC) neighbourhood. A successful bid led to the award of ¬£56 million over a 10-year period, starting in April 2000. Clapham Park Project, a community led project team, was formed to take charge of the NDC programme and transform the lives and prospects of this deprived community. From 2001, the Clapham Park Project worked with residents and partners to develop a Masterplan to regenerate the Clapham Park area up to. In March 2005, residents voted yes to a stock transfer from Lambeth Council to Clapham Park Homes, which was specifically set up to take over the ownership and management of homes on Clapham Park. The regeneration programme has been funded in part by the Housing Corporation's Social Housing grant; the NDC grant through Clapham Park Project; and through private loans, a large proportion of which will be paid back through the outright sale of homes, mixed tenures and the balance from rental income. The programme has so far provided (or is on site to provide) a total of 489 new build properties and 512 refurbished properties. \\"Abbeville Village\\" From the 1880s the area to the west of Cubitt's land holdings between Clapham Common Southside and the site of Lincoln House was also developed. This area borrowed the name of Clapham Park, presumably because of its original social cachet, and its streets have predominantly remained in owner occupation. The grid of late Victorian era streets around Abbeville Road is frequently referred to by estate agents, such as Jacksons estate agents, as \\"Abbeville Village\\", although many of the independent local shops that gave the area a distinct character until the 1990s have made way for restaurants, cafes and bars, as the street has become the centre of local night life for the professional middle classes, and shop rentals have increased considerably. Agnes Riley Memorial Gardens Frederick George Riley gifted Oakfield House and its grounds to London County Council, on the proviso that it made the site into a public open space with the name 'Agnes Riley Memorial Gardens'. Riley gifted two acres in 1937 and work began immediately to develop these, but World War II intervened and the two acres were used for allotments and occupied by the military. Riley himself remained at Oakfield until his death in 1942. However, in 1952, and against his wishes, Lambeth Council decided to drop the word ‚Äòmemorial‚Äô from the name of the small park, which was completed in 1954. The southern part of the park is devoted to a children's playground, paddling pool, and hard games area; the rest is laid out with trees, shrubs, lawns, and an ornamental pond. A park lodge was built but this fell into disrepair and was demolished in 2002. Since 2005, the Friends of Agnes Riley Gardens (FoARGS) had worked with Lambeth Council to convert the site of the lodge into a community garden. Although the pond is much reduced in size compared to 1938, it and the community garden together form a much-loved local amenity, and residents in the neighbourhood wanted to see it restored to its original state for the benefit of the public. In December 2008, Vernon De Maynard, (Chair ‚Äì Clapham Park West Residents Association (CPWRA)) contacted Lambeth Parks to find out why the pond and community garden had been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair. He was told that funding issues and other priorities had resulted in these local amenities not being maintained to a satisfactory standard and that he should contact the FoARGS to find out what was happening with the community garden. It transpired that the FoARGS had been working on it since 2005, but due to financial constraints, and other priorities, the community garden had fallen into a state of disrepair. So, in March 2009, Vernon De Maynard discussed the issue with CPWRA and Poynders Garden TRA, and applied to the London Community Foundation for a grant to restore the community garden. In June 2009, a grant was awarded, and this was used to restore the garden.

He was the 24th Premier of Quebec from October 3 to December 12, 1985, making him the province's shortest-serving premier.  Early background  Born in Montreal, Quebec, on July 5, 1946, Johnson is of French-Canadian and Irish descent and is a Roman Catholic. He received a degree in law from the Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1970 and a medical degree from the Universit√© de Sherbrooke in 1976. He is the son of Reine Gagn√© and Daniel Johnson, Sr., who served as Premier of Quebec from 1966 to 1968. His brother, Daniel Johnson, Jr., served as Premier for nine months in 1994. Each of the Johnsons led different political parties: * Daniel, Sr., was leader of the conservative Union Nationale party, and had an ambiguous position on the question of independence for Quebec; * Pierre-Marc joined the sovereigntist PQ in the aftermath of the 1970 October Crisis; * Daniel, Jr. backed the federalist Liberals by 1977. Member of the Cabinet In 1976, Pierre-Marc Johnson successfully ran as the Parti Qu√©b√©cois candidate for the district of Anjou. Premier Ren√© L√©vesque appointed him to the cabinet in 1977 and he was re- elected in 1981. Johnson served as Minister of Labour from 1977 to 1980, Minister to Consumers, Cooperatives and Financial Institutions from 1980 to 1981, Minister of Social Affairs from 1981 to 1984 and Attorney General from 1984 to 1985.  Premier of Quebec  In the leadership election of 1985, Johnson was chosen, following PQ founder Ren√© L√©vesque as leader of the party and, consequently, as Quebec Premier. Johnson was generally considered to be soft on the sovereignty of Quebec issue. He put independence on the back burner, as L√©vesque had begun to do under the \\"Beau risque\\" approach and eventually made this approach the official constitutional policy of his party, calling it \\"National Affirmation\\". Johnson was described as somewhat to the right of the PQ as a whole.  Leader of the Official Opposition  He was re- elected to the legislature in 1985, but his party was defeated by the Liberals, led by Robert Bourassa. His leadership was contested by more radical PQ supporters, such as G√©rald Godin. On November 10, 1987, he resigned as head of the party, Leader of the Opposition and member of the National Assembly. He was succeeded as head of the PQ by interim leader Guy Chevrette and later Jacques Parizeau, who again made independence a primary goal.  Elections as party leader  Johnson lost in the December 1985 election after becoming leader in October. Johnson became as opposition leader and stepped down as party leader in 1987 (with next election in 1989).  Life after leaving politics  Both a lawyer and a physician, he is a former Professor of Law at McGill University in Montreal and was Counsel at the firm of Heenan Blaikie LLP in Montreal, Quebec until 2014. He is now Counsel at the firm of Lavery, also in Montreal. In 2001 he was appointed as chief advisor and negotiator of the Quebec government in the Softwood Lumber dispute between Canada and the United States by then Premier Bernard Landry. In October 2006, he was chosen by the Charest government to preside over a public inquiry into the collapse of a viaduct over Autoroute 19 in Laval, Quebec, leaving five dead and six injured. The choice of Johnson was criticized by both leaders in opposition Andr√© Boisclair (PQ) and Mario Dumont (Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec) because of the possibility of conflict of interest. As president, he was invested with the responsibility of investigating government administration while being a former Minister of the Quebec Government, a former Premier of Quebec, and, until shortly after this nomination, member of the board of directors of Ciment Saint-Laurent, a cement company. Johnson was appointed by the minority Conservative government to the Canadian delegation at the United Nations' Bali Conference on climate change. Johnson was Quebec's negotiator for CETA (Canada-European-union Trade Agreement).  Attitude about sovereignty  Johnson refused to take a stance regarding the 1995 Quebec referendum on independence. In December 2005 he made waves in sovereigntist circles by supporting Liberal candidate and close, longtime friend Raymond Bachand in a provincial by-election in the Outremont riding.

The event sparked a series of political controversies where, in the end, the police officers were found guilty of murder and several high-ranking local government officials were accused of planning and/or covering up the incident. Originally declared a police intervention against terrorists, the local media quickly questioned the officers' testimonies as well as the only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ (PNP), then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Justice Department to aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers' part. However, after one of the local opposing political parties launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.

As a student he enjoyed literature. He also wrote stories and went on to win second place in a competition held by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. When his parents went to Europe to finish their doctoral studies, he learned to speak French in a year. Upon returning from Europe, he enrolled at the Escuela Superior Rep√∫blica de Colombia, a high school in R√≠o Piedras, although in a lower grade, because the school officials did not want to credit his years of overseas study. Although Soto Arriv√≠ was interested in social issues from a very young age, his political activism started when he joined a pro- independence group in high school.Nation: Death at Cerro Maravilla from Time May 14, 1979. Arnaldo Dar√≠o Rosado Arnaldo Dar√≠o Rosado Torres was born on November 23, 1953, in Old San Juan. His parents were Pablo Rosado and Juana Torres Aymat. Rosado finished his high school studies and went to work at a cracker factory. Dario Rosado was married to Angela Rivera, and had a son called Manuel Len√≠n Rosado Rivera. From a very young age, Rosado identified with the cause of Puerto Rico's independence. He joined the socialist league with which he participated in several activities. Rosado was an autodidact and an avid reader of various kinds of literature, especially those related to the political processes of Puerto Rico and Latin America. He also wrote poems, essays, and had several pen-pals throughout Latin America. Incident Cerro Maravilla Incident Memorial Stone, near top of Cerro Maravilla On the night of July 25, 1978, Carlos Soto Arriv√≠ and Arnaldo Dar√≠o Rosado, two independence activists of the Armed Revolutionary Movement (), along with undercover police officer Alejandro Gonz√°lez Malav√© posing as a fellow group member, took taxi driver Julio Ortiz Molina hostage and ordered him to drive them to Cerro Maravilla where several communication towers were located. Their original plan was to take control of the towers to protest the imprisonment of Puerto Rican nationalists convicted of the 1950 assassination attempt on U.S. President Harry S. Truman, the 1954 United States Capitol shooting incident where five members of Congress were injured, the commemoration of the July 25 Constitution Day observance, the day U.S. soldiers landed in Puerto Rico in 1898.\\"Ex-agent Acquitted of Kidnapping in Puerto Rico\\" , The New York Times, February 22, 1986, retrieved August 2, 2006 State police officers were alerted of their plan prior to their arrival and the activists were ambushed and shot.\\"Romero: Mistake To Call Police 'Heroes' In Cerro Maravilla\\" by Laura Rivera Melendez (AP) The Puerto Rico Herald, September 15, 2003, retrieved August 2, 2006\\"Puerto Rican Governor Seen as Hurt by Officers' Arrest\\" , The New York Times, October 21, 1984, retrieved August 2, 2006\\"Senators Asked to Study Puerto Rico Killing Inquiry\\" , The New York Times, August 11, 1980, retrieved August 2, 2006 The undercover agent received a minor bullet wound during the shooting, while the taxi driver was left relatively unharmed. =Initial statements= The morning after the shootings, the officers argued that they acted in self defense, stating that they ordered the activists to surrender, at which time the activists started shooting at them and they returned fire. Initially, the taxi driver said he was under the dashboard of his cab when the shooting started and could not see who shot first, although he contradicted his statement a few days later in an interview with the San Juan Star, a local newspaper, stating that he ducked under the dashboard of the car after the three men (the two activists and the undercover agent) left the car, and that he saw \\"10 heavily armed men\\" approaching. When he emerged from the car, he saw the three men alive and two of them were being beaten by the armed men, who were later identified as policemen. Then-Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ (PNP) praised the officers in a televised address by calling them ‚Äúheroic‚Äù, stating that they acted in self-defense and stopped a terrorist attack. Two days later, in a follow-up interview by WAPA-TV news reporter Enrique Cruz, the taxi driver stated that when the first shooting occurred, he heard one of his three passengers shout \\"I'm an agent! Don't shoot me, I'm an agent!\\" while the others called for help and shouted \\"I give up! I give up!\\". (in Spanish) of Julio Ortiz Molina by WAPA-TV on July 27, 1978 (YouTube clip) He saw \\"10 heavily armed men\\" approaching, later identified as police agents, when the three passengers exited the car, and the taxi driver was ordered at gunpoint to exit the vehicle. He was extracted by an agent, kicked, and taken away from the scene. While being escorted, he saw the two activists directly in front of his vehicle being beaten by the armed men. =First investigations= Facing public pressure due to the taxi driver's conflicting statements, Governor Romero Barcel√≥ ordered two separate investigations by the P.R. Justice Department in addition to the ongoing standard Police investigation, all of which concluded that the officers' actions were free of any wrongdoing, despite various inconsistencies in their stories. P.R. District Attorney Pedro Colton informed reporters on July 29, four days after the incident, that the P.R. Justice Department's investigation revealed \\"no massacre, no beatings, and no aggressions, except for the shootings that occurred in Cerro Maravilla\\". Opposing political parties, mainly the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), insisted that the investigations were just cover-ups and demanded that a special independent prosecutor be assigned to investigate. Two special investigations by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were performed on separate occasions between 1978 and 1980, which confirmed the conclusions of the P.R. Justice Department that the officers acted in self-defense.\\"Ex-Justice Official Cites 'Coverup' By FBI in '78 Puerto Rico Shootings\\" by Jim McGee, The Washington Post, May 9, 1992, retrieved August 2, 2006 =Second investigations= In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero Barcel√≥ was re-elected by a margin of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost control of the state legislature to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by The New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time. Other news organizations, such as Time, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hern√°ndez Agosto, spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate. The second investigations performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature, the U.S. Justice Department, and the local press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible, though not conclusive, conspiracy to cover-up these actions. During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983, officer Miguel Cartagena Flores, a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department, testified: ‚ÄúWhen I arrived at the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them. I turned my eyes away and heard 5 gunshots.\\"\\"Puerto Ricans Were Kneeling When Killed By Police, Officer Says\\" , The New York Times, November 30, 1983, retrieved August 2, 2006 Cartagena, who was offered immunity for his testimony, added that several hours before the shooting, he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas, commander of the Intelligence Division, that ‚Äúthese terrorists should not come down (from the mountain) alive.‚Äù His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who, although he did not witness the fatal shooting, confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity. Other inquiries obtained similar testimony from witnesses, including the taxi driver who now stated that the activists were ‚Äúalive and disarmed‚Äù when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated that there was a short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex- officer Jesus Qui√±ones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview. Subsequently, the legislature and local press started questioning the actions of the Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy, asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barcel√≥ during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter's (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter's opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barcel√≥'s and Civiletti's meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including ‚Äúseveral unexplained contusions‚Äù on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact ‚Äútwo bursts of firing‚Äù. These and several other accusations brought public and political pressure to the investigating agencies. This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first investigations both at the local and federal level, though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover-up. These second investigations led to reassignments, demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department, including three different P.R. Secretaries of Justice (equivalent to State Attorney General) accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months.\\"10 From Puerto Rico Police Indicted on Cover-Up of '78 Killings\\" by Reginald Stuart, The New York Times, February 7, 1984, Retrieved August 2, 2006 On November 29, 1983, three prosecutors were relieved of their duties after a report by the state Senate Investigations Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings, citing 101 specific deficiencies in two investigations. This was the third state Attorney General to oversee the investigations since the shootings occurred in 1978. Aftermath The second investigations led to ten officers being indicted and found guilty of perjury, destruction of evidence, and obstruction of justice, four of which were convicted of second-degree murder in 1984. The convicted officers, who were no longer on active duty, and their status with the Puerto Rico Police were: # Col. √Ångel P√©rez Casillas (head of the Puerto Rico Police Department Intelligence Division during the incident; suspended) # Lieut. Nelson Gonz√°lez P√©rez (resigned) # Lieut. Jaime Qu√≠les Hern√°ndez (suspended) # Officer Juan Bruno Gonz√°lez (suspended) # Officer William Col√≥n Berr√≠os (suspended) # Officer Nazario Mateo Espada (suspended) # Officer Rafael Moreno Morales (suspended) # Officer Luis Rever√≥n Mart√≠nez (on disability leave) # Officer Jose R√≠os Polanco (suspended) # Officer Rafael Torres Marrero (on disability leave) That same year, in the general elections held in November, Romero Barcel√≥ lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barcel√≥ lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers as an indication of a possible conspiracy. =Undercover agent murdered= Alejandro Gonzalez Malav√©, the undercover agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted for his part in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.\\"Cerro Maravilla a 25 a√±os: Lo que queda por esclarecer\\" (25 Years After Cerro Maravilla: What‚Äôs Left to be Clarified) by Yaritza Cardona Mercado, WRTU Radio Universidad 89.7 FM, July 24, 2003, retrieved August 2, 2006 On the evening of April 29, 1986, just two months after his acquittal, Gonzalez was assassinated in front of his mother's house in Bayam√≥n. He sustained three gunshot wounds and his mother was slightly injured. A few hours later, a group identifying itself as the ‚ÄúVolunteer Organization for the Revolution‚Äù called local news agencies claiming responsibility. In their statements they swore to kill, \\"one by one,\\" all the policemen involved in the deaths in Cerro Maravilla.\\"Police Agent in Puerto Rico Deaths is Assassinated\\" The New York Times, May 1, 1986, Retrieved August 2, 2006 The FBI considered it one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the United States at the time, given that it was the same organization that claimed responsibility for an attack on a Navy bus in Puerto Rico on December 3, 1979, in which two Navy men were killed and 10 people injured, and the attack on a U.S. National Guard base on January 12, 1981, in which six fighter-jet planes were destroyed. To this day, no one has been identified as a possible suspect in Gonzalez's murder, and the case remains unsolved. =Public apologies= In 1992, former US Justice Department Civil Rights Division chief Drew S. Days III admitted before the P.R. Senate that the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI acted negligently during the 1978‚Äì1980 investigations of the Cerro Maravilla incident, such as rejecting interviews with key witnesses (including the taxi driver), refusing to offer immunity to certain witnesses, and avoiding various standard investigating tasks. Days stated: \\"I think that certainly an apology is justified with respect to the way the federal government handled its investigation: the FBI, the Justice Department, and my division... it was not done in the professional way that it should have been done.\\" FBI Director William S. Sessions had made similar concessions in a written statement in 1990, stating: ‚ÄúIn hindsight, the eyewitness should have been interviewed and a civil rights investigation initiated‚Äù. In 2003, 25 years after the incident, former Gov. Romero Barcel√≥ admitted in a public radio interview that it was ‚Äúan error of judgment‚Äù and ‚Äúa premature declaration‚Äù to laud the police officers, since at that time he believed they were telling the truth about their self-defense. However, he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover-up during the first investigations. Legacy *Since the conclusion of the final investigations, there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico, with some groups arguing that there are still others responsible for planning and/or ordering the plot to kill the activists as well as the subsequent cover-up, while others have argued that the incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media, maintaining that no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated, though not all, are actually innocent.\\"What Happened in Cerro Maravilla?\\" by Maggie Bob and Miguel Rocca, Pulso.org *Every year on July 25, Puerto Rican Nationalists and independence activists gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Soto and Arnaldo Dario, as well as to defend and celebrate the Puerto Rican independence ideology. It is usually organized by the family of the victims, former members of nationalist groups, and by the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The mountain has also been christened by them as ‚ÄúEl Cerro de los M√°rtires‚Äù (The Mountain of the Martyrs). *In 2007 the Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique√±a published a book by Manuel Suarez, Samuel Dash and William Kennedy titled \\"Dos linchamientos en el Cerro Maravilla : los asesinatos polic√≠acos en Puerto Rico y el encubrimiento del Gobierno Federal\\" (Two lynchings on Cerro Maravilla: the police killings in Puerto Rico and the cover-up by the Federal Government).

She is the daughter of Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister from 1979 to 1990, and Denis Thatcher. She has written biographies of both her parents and also produced a documentary about her father which contained his only public interview. She won the fifth series of the reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! Early life Thatcher was born at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London, on 15 August 1953. She and her twin brother, Mark, were born six weeks prematurely by C-section. According to Margaret Thatcher, her husband Denis Thatcher responded to seeing their children for the first time by saying, \\"My God, they look like rabbits. Put them back.\\" Thatcher's mother was selected for the constituency of Finchley in north London in 1958 and was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1959. In 1960, Thatcher was sent to Queenswood School, a girls' boarding school near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, before attending St Paul's Girls' School. She graduated with a law degree from University College London, before moving to Australia in 1977 to begin a journalism career. While she was there, her mother was elected Prime Minister. Thatcher later said, \\"You need quite good shock absorbers and a sense of humour to be the Prime Minister's child.\\" Journalism career Thatcher began her career as a journalist in Australia, working on the Sydney Morning Herald from 1977 to 1979. She became a TV reporter at Channel Seven, also in Sydney, and later a reporter on its news morning show, 11AM. On her return to Britain, she worked as a presenter for LBC, BBC Radio 4, TV-am and wrote travel articles for The Daily Telegraph. Due to her mother's high-profile political position, many newspapers refused to publish work with her byline. Her first book, Diary of an Election: with Margaret Thatcher on the campaign trail, was published in 1983. Her second book, a collaboration with tennis player Chris Evert (Mrs Lloyd) called Lloyd on Lloyd, was released three years later. It became Thatcher's first best-seller. Later publications included a 1996 best-selling biography of her father, Below the Parapet. In 2003, Thatcher produced a Channel 4 documentary about him called Married to Maggie. Thatcher captured the only public interview Denis Thatcher gave in his lifetime; he died shortly after its release. Thatcher's freelance career has included contributing articles to magazines and papers as well as television work. Reality shows =I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!= In November 2005 Thatcher was selected to appear with a number of fellow celebrities on the ITV television show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! The format of the show meant that she would be forced to spend at least a week in the Australian rainforest with a minimal supply of food in basic living conditions. She had to undergo one of the more infamous \\"Bushtucker Trials\\" during her stay in the jungle ‚Äì which saw her eat jungle bugs and kangaroo testicles as a challenge to earn food for her fellow celebrities. Ultimately, she emerged as the fifth series winner and second 'Queen of the Jungle'.Robin Stummer \\"Carol Thatcher: 'I partly blame Mark for Mummy's anguish'\\" ; The Independent, 11 December 2005; Retrieved 7 February 2009 =Most Haunted= Thatcher appeared on Living TV's Most Haunted on 13 February 2007 as a celebrity guest alongside presenter Yvette Fielding and medium David Wells as well as Joanne Gregory to search for paranormal activity at Tatton Hall in Cheshire. =Mummy's War= In 2007, Carol Thatcher travelled to the Falkland Islands and Argentina for the documentary Mummy's War, in order to explore the legacy of the Falklands War. Whilst receiving a positive reception from the pro-British islanders (who regard her mother as a heroine), her reception in Argentina provoked protests and demonstrations (including the cry \\"Your mother is a war criminal!\\"). During her stay in Argentina, she met a group of mothers who lost their sons during the conflict and stated, \\"We were fighting a war; we won, you lost,\\" and reminded them that it was their country that invaded the islands, thus initiating the conflict. The interview ended with one of the women claiming that \\"God will punish her (Margaret Thatcher)\\". The One Show From 2006 to 2009, Thatcher was a freelance contributor to the BBC One magazine programme The One Show, making filmed reports and joining the presenters and guests in the studio for discussions. On 3 February 2009, British media reported that during the 2009 Australian Open Thatcher had, in a conversation in the show's green room, referred to a black tennis player, reportedly Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, as a golliwog. According to The Times, Thatcher called Tsonga \\"half-golliwog\\" and \\"the golliwog Frog\\".Patrick Foster Carol Thatcher's golliwog remarks ‚Äòmade eyes roll in the green room‚Äô Times Online, 6 February 2009 Presenter Adrian Chiles, comedian Jo Brand, journalists and several guests were with Thatcher when she made the remark. The BBC stated that Thatcher would not work again on The One Show unless she made a more sincere apology. Thatcher refused, saying \\"I stand by what I said. I wasn't going to apologise. I never meant it in a racist way. It was shorthand. I described someone's appearance colloquially‚Äîsomeone I happen to greatly admire.\\" Bibliography Thatcher has written several books, including: Below the Parapet: the Biography of Denis Thatcher (1996) and Diary of an Election: with Margaret Thatcher on the Campaign Trail (1983).

It contains over 250 species in five genera, of which Scytodes is the best-known. Description Like recluse spiders and coneweb spiders, they have six eyes arranged in three pairs and are haplogyne, meaning they have less complex female genitalia. They differ from these families in having a dome-shaped carapace and in their characteristic flecked pattern of spots. Hunting technique Scytodidae catch their prey by spitting a fluid that congeals on contact into a venomous and sticky mass. The fluid contains both venom and spider silk in liquid form, though it is produced in venom glands in the chelicerae. The venom-laced silk both immobilizes and envenoms prey such as silverfish. In high-speed footage the spiders can be observed swaying from side to side as they \\"spit\\", catching the prey in a crisscrossed \\"Z\\" pattern; it is criss-crossed because each of the chelicerae emits half of the pattern. The spider usually strikes from a distance of and the entire attack sequence only lasts 1/700th of a second. After making the capture, the spider typically bites the prey with venomous effect, and wraps it in the normal spider fashion with silk from the spinnerets. Presocial behaviour Some species exhibit presocial behaviour, in which mature spiders live together and assist the young with food.

Collins Dictionary London Borough of Lambeth is a district in South London, England, in the London Borough of Lambeth, historically in the County of Surrey. It is situated south of Charing Cross. The population of the London Borough of Lambeth was 303,086 in 2011. The area experienced some slight growth in the medieval period as part of the manor of Lambeth Palace. By the Victorian era the area had seen significant development as London expanded, with dense industrial, commercial and residential buildings located adjacent to one another. The changes brought by World War II altered much of the fabric of Lambeth. Subsequent development in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has seen an increase in the number of high-rise buildings. The area is home to the International Maritime Organization. History The origins of the name of Lambeth come from its first record in 1062 as Lambehitha, meaning 'landing place for lambs', and in 1255 as Lambeth. In the Domesday Book, Lambeth is called \\"Lanchei\\", likely in error. The name refers to a harbour where lambs were either shipped from or to. It is formed from the Old English 'lamb' and 'hythe'. South Lambeth is recorded as Sutlamehethe in 1241 and North Lambeth is recorded in 1319 as North Lamhuth. The manor of Lambeth is recorded as being under ownership of the Archbishop of Canterbury from at least 1190. The Archbishops led the development of much of the manor, with Archbishop Hubert Walter creating the residence of Lambeth Palace in 1197. Lambeth and the palace were the site of two important 13th- century international treaties; the Treaty of Lambeth 1217 and the Treaty of Lambeth 1212.Cannon, John. \\"Treaty of Lambeth\\" A Dictionary of British History. Oxford University Press, 2009 Edward, the Black Prince lived in Lambeth in the 14th century in an estate that incorporated the land not belonging to the Archbishops, which also included Kennington (the Black Prince road in Lambeth is named after him). As such, much of the freehold land of Lambeth to this day remains under Royal ownership as part of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall. Lambeth was also the site of the principal medieval London residence of the Dukes of Norfolk, but by 1680 the large house had been sold and ended up as a pottery manufacturer, creating some of the first examples of English delftware in the country. The road names, Norfolk Place and Norfolk Row reflect the history and legacy of the house today. Map of 1897, showing Lambeth Palace and Lambeth Bridge Lambeth Palace lies opposite the southern section of the Palace of Westminster on the Thames. The two were historically linked by a horse ferry across the river. Until the mid-18th century the north of Lambeth was marshland, crossed by a number of roads raised against floods. The marshland in the area, known as Lambeth Marshe, was drained in the 18th century but is remembered in the Lower Marsh street name. With the opening of Westminster Bridge in 1750, followed by the Blackfriars Bridge, Vauxhall Bridge and Lambeth Bridge itself, a number of major thoroughfares were developed through Lambeth, such as Westminster Bridge Road, Kennington Road and Camberwell New Road. Until the 18th century Lambeth was still partly rural in nature, being outside the boundaries of central London, although it had experienced growth in the form of taverns and entertainment venues, such as theatres and Bear pits (being outside inner city regulations). The subsequent growth in road and marine transport, along with the development of industry in the wake of the industrial revolution brought great change to the area. The area grew with an ever-increasing population at this time, many of whom were considerably poor. As a result, Lambeth opened a parish workhouse in 1726. In 1777 a parliamentary report recorded a parish workhouse in operation accommodating up to 270 inmates. On 18 December 1835 the Lambeth Poor Law Parish was formed, comprising the parish of St Mary, Lambeth, \\"including the district attached to the new churches of St John, Waterloo, Kennington, Brixton, Norwood\\". Its operation was overseen by an elected Board of twenty Guardians. Following in the tradition of earlier delftware manufacturers, the Royal Doulton Pottery company had their principal manufacturing site in Lambeth for several centuries. The Lambeth factory closed in 1956 and production was transferred to Staffordshire. However the Doulton offices, located on Black Prince Road still remain as they are a listed building, which includes the original decorative tiling. Between 1801 and 1831 the population of Lambeth trebled and in ten years alone between 1831 and 1841 it increased from 87,856 in to 105,883. The railway first came to Lambeth in the 1840s, as construction began which extended the London and South Western Railway from its original station at Nine Elms to the new terminus at London Waterloo via the newly constructed Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct. With the massive urban development of London in the 19th century and with the opening of the large Waterloo railway station in 1848 the locality around the station and Lower Marsh became known as Waterloo, becoming an area distinct from Lambeth itself. The Lambeth Ragged school was built in 1851 to help educate the children of destitute facilities, although the widening of the London and South Western Railway in 1904 saw the building reduced in size. Part of the school building still exists today and is occupied by the Beaconsfield Gallery. The Beaufoy Institute was also built in 1907 to provide technical education for the poor of the area, although this stopped being an educational institution at the end of the 20th century. Lambeth Walk and Lambeth High Street were the two principal commercial streets of Lambeth, but today are predominantly residential in nature. Lambeth Walk was site of a market for many years, which by 1938 had 159 shops, including 11 butchers. The street and surrounding roads, like most of Lambeth were extensively damaged in the Second World War. This included the complete destruction of the Victorian Swimming Baths (themselves built in 1897) in 1945, when a V2 Rocket hit the street resulting in the deaths of 37 people. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's headquarters were located in Lambeth High Street from 1976 until 2015. Local governance The tower of St Mary-at-Lambeth, constructed in 1377 The current district of Lambeth was part of the large ancient parish of Lambeth St Mary in the Brixton hundred of Surrey. It was an elongated north‚Äìsouth parish with a two-mile River Thames frontage to the west. In the north it lay opposite the cities of London and Westminster and extended southwards to cover the contemporary districts of Brixton, West Dulwich and West Norwood, almost reaching Crystal Palace. Lambeth became part of the Metropolitan Police District in 1829. It continued as a single parish for Poor Law purposes after the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 and a single parish governed by a vestry after the introduction of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855. In 1889 it became part of the county of London and the parish and vestry were reformed in 1900 to become the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth, governed by Lambeth Borough Council. In the reform of local government in 1965, the Streatham and Clapham areas that had formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth were combined with Lambeth to form the responsible area of local government under the London Borough of Lambeth.

In the 2016 EU referendum, Lambeth issued the highest \\"Remain\\" vote in the United Kingdom (besides Gibraltar) with almost 79% of residents advocating the United Kingdom staying in the European Union. At the 2015 general election, all three Labour candidates were elected Kate Hoey for Vauxhall, Chuka Umunna for Streatham & Helen Hayes for Dulwich and West Norwood. The Conservative Party finished the runners up in all three seats. At the snap 2017 general election, Hoey, Umunna and Hayes were re-elected with increased majorities. The Liberal Democrat candidate George Turner finished the runner up in Vauxhall achieving a 5% swing in his favour. The Conservative candidates Rachel Wolf and Kim Caddy finished the runner up in Dulwich & West Norwood and Streatham respectively. At the 2018 local elections, Labour remained in control of the council with 57 of the 63 seats, (down 2 seats from 2014). The Greens gained 4 seats and achieved a total 5 seats. The Conservatives were reduced down to a single seat, and the Liberal Democrats failed to gain any seats, but did make some inroads into Wards in Northern Vauxhall and Southern Streatham. In the 2019 EU elections, the Liberal Democrats won Lambeth with 33% of the vote, Labour were second with 21%, The Greens third with 19% and Change UK and The Brexit Party joint fourth on 8%. In June 2019, Umunna defected to the Liberal Democrats. Hoey stood down at the 2019 General Election and was replaced with Labour MP Florence Eshalomi, who was the sitting London Assembly Member for Lambeth and Southwark. Ummuna stood down as an MP and was replaced with Bell Ribeiro-Addy where the Labour majority was cut by almost 10,000 by the 2nd placed Lib Dems. Hayes stood for re-election with the Green Party's Jonathan Bartley finishing in second place, for the first time. Buildings and churches The church of St Mary-at- Lambeth is the oldest above ground structure in Lambeth, the oldest structure of any kind being the crypt of Lambeth Palace itself. The church has pre- Norman origins, being recorded as early as 1062 as a church built by Goda, sister of Edward the Confessor. It was rebuilt in flint and stone between the years 1374 and 1377. The tower is the only original part still to survive, as much of the church was reconstructed by 1852. The church was de-consecrated in 1972 and since 1977 it has been the home of the Garden Museum. Lambeth Palace is the home of the Archbishop of Canterbury and has been occupied as a residence by the Archbishops since the early 13th century. The oldest parts of the palace are Langton's Chapel and its crypt, both of which date back to the 13th century. Although they suffered greatly from damage in the Second World War, they have seen been extensively repaired and restored. Morton's Tower, the main entrance to the palace, was built in 1490. The Great Hall, rebuilt over different centuries but primarily following damage during the English Civil War, contains the vast collections of the Lambeth Palace Library. Later additions to the palace including the Blore Building, a newer private residence for the Archbishop, which was completed in 1833. The waterfront of Lambeth including the International Maritime Organization and the former HQ of the London Fire Brigade The Albert Embankment, finished in 1869 and created by the engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette under the Metropolitan Board of Works, forms the boundary of Lambeth. The embankment includes land reclaimed from the river and various small timber and boat-building yards, and was intended to protect low-lying areas of Lambeth from flooding while also providing a new highway to bypass local congested streets. Unlike the Thames Embankment on the opposite side of the river, the Albert Embankment does not incorporate major interceptor sewers. This allowed the southern section of the embankment (upstream from Lambeth Bridge) to include a pair of tunnels leading to a small slipway, named White Hart Draw Dock, whose origins can be traced back to the 14th century. Centuries later, Royal Doulton's pottery works used the docks to load clay and finished goods for transport to and from the Port of London. The refurbishment of White Hart Dock was carried out as part of a local art project in 2009, which included the addition of wooden sculptures and benches to the 1868 dock boundary wall. Located on the Albert Embankment is the purpose-built headquarters of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The IMO is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for regulating shipping. The building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 May 1983. The architects of the building were Douglass Marriott, Worby & Robinson. The front of the building is dominated by a seven-metre high, ten- tonne bronze sculpture of the bow of a ship, with a lone seafarer maintaining a look-out from Lambeth to the Thames. From 1937 until 2007 the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade were in Lambeth, on Albert Embankment. The headquarters building, constructed in an art deco style, was designed by architects of the London City Council and opened in 1937. Occupying a prominent position on the Thames it is, however, still an operating fire station, although future plans have been submitted which may see redevelopment of the listed building. The Lambeth Mission is a church of the united Methodist Anglican denomination, located on Lambeth Road. The original church was founded in 1739 but was entirely destroyed by a bomb in the Second World War. A new church for the mission was constructed in 1950 and continues to function as an active church today. The Beaconsfield gallery is a public contemporary art gallery in Lambeth, which was established in 1995 and specialises in temporary exhibitions and art classes. Morley College is an adult education college, founded in the 1880s, that occupies sites on either side of the boundary between the London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth. Literary Lambeth In William Blake's epic Milton: A Poem in Two Books, the poet John Milton leaves Heaven and travels to Lambeth, in the form of a falling comet, and enters Blake's foot. This allows Blake to treat the ordinary world as perceived by the five senses as a sandal formed of \\"precious stones and gold\\" that he can now wear. Blake ties the sandal and, guided by Los, walks with it into the City of Art, inspired by the spirit of poetic creativity. The poem was written between 1804 and 1810. Liza of Lambeth, the first novel by W. Somerset Maugham, is about the life and loves of a young factory worker living in Lambeth near Westminster Bridge Road. Thyrza, a novel by George Gissing first published in 1887, is set in late Victorian Lambeth, particularly Newport Street, Lambeth Walk and Walnut Tree Walk. The novel was intended by Gissing to \\"contain the very spirit of London working-class life\\". The story tells of Walter Egremont, an Oxford-trained idealist who gives lectures on literature to workers, some of them from his father's Lambeth factory. Leisure and recreation Lambeth has several areas of public parks and gardens. This includes Old Paradise Gardens, which is a park occupying former burial ground on Lambeth High Street and old Paradise Street. A watch- house for holding the 'drunk and disorderely' existed on the site, from 1825 until 1930 and is today marked by a memorial stone. Lambeth Walk Open Space is a small public park to the east of Lambeth on Fitzalan walk and includes several open spaces and play areas. Pedlars' Park is another small public park in Lambeth, which was created in 1968 on the site of the former St. Saviour's Salamanca Street School. The Archbishop's Park is open to the public and borders the edge of Lambeth Palace and the neighbouring area of Waterloo and the hospital of St Thomas. Transport The nearest London Underground stations are Waterloo, Southwark and Lambeth North. London Waterloo is also a National Rail station as is Waterloo East which is located in-between both Waterloo and Southwark stations. Vauxhall station is also nearby in Vauxhall, situated more towards the South Lambeth area near Kennington as is Oval station nearby. The South Western Main Line runs through Lambeth on the Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct. The principal road through the area is Lambeth Road (the A3203). Lambeth Walk adjoins Lambeth Road. The current Lambeth Bridge opened on 19 July 1932. It replaced an earlier suspension bridge which itself was built between 1862 and 1928, but was eventually closed and demolished following the 1928 Thames flood.

It is also used to treat ventricular tachycardia and to perform nerve blocks. Lidocaine mixed with a small amount of adrenaline (epinephrine) is available to allow larger doses for numbing, to decrease bleeding, and to make the numbing effect last longer. When used as an injectable, lidocaine typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area. Common side effects with intravenous use include sleepiness, muscle twitching, confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low blood pressure and an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. This means it works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When it is used locally as a numbing agent, local neurons cannot signal the brain. Lidocaine was discovered in 1946 and went on sale in 1948. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It is sold under a number of brand names including Xylocaine. In 2017, it was the 208th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions.  Medical uses  =Local numbing agent= The efficacy profile of lidocaine as a local anaesthetic is characterized by a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delaying the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. Lidocaine is one of the most commonly used local anaesthetics in dentistry. It can be administered in multiple ways, most often as a nerve block or infiltration, depending on the type of treatment carried out and the area of the mouth worked on. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures. There is tentative evidence for topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain and skin graft donor site pain. As a local numbing agent, it is used for the treatment of premature ejaculation. An adhesive transdermal patch containing a 5% concentration of lidocaine in a hydrogel bandage, is approved by the US FDA for reducing nerve pain caused by shingles. The transdermal patch is also used for pain from other causes, such as compressed nerves and persistent nerve pain after some surgeries. =Heart arrhythmia= Lidocaine is also the most important class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute myocardial infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or cardiac catheterization) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventative dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing. =Epilepsy= A 2013 review on treatment for neonatal seizures recommended intravenous lidocaine as a second-line treatment, if phenobarbital fails to stop seizures. =Other= Intravenous lidocaine infusions are also used to treat chronic pain and acute surgical pain as an opiate sparing technique. The quality of evidence for this use is poor so it is difficult to compare it to placebo or an epidural. Inhaled lidocaine can be used as a cough suppressor acting peripherally to reduce the cough reflex. This application can be implemented as a safety and comfort measure for patients who have to be intubated, as it reduces the incidence of coughing and any tracheal damage it might cause when emerging from anaesthesia. Lidocaine, along with ethanol, ammonia, and acetic acid, may also help in treating jellyfish stings, both numbing the affected area and preventing further nematocyst discharge. For gastritis, drinking a viscous lidocaine formulation may help with the pain.  Adverse effects  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when lidocaine is used as a local anesthetic and is administered correctly. Most ADRs associated with lidocaine for anesthesia relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, and allergic reactions only rarely occur. Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of lidocaine mainly result in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects ‚Äì CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. ADRs by system are: *CNS excitation: nervousness, agitation, anxiety, apprehension, tingling around the mouth (circumoral paraesthesia), headache, hyperesthesia, tremor, dizziness, pupillary changes, psychosis, euphoria, hallucinations, and seizures *CNS depression with increasingly heavier exposure: drowsiness, lethargy, slurred speech, hypoesthesia, confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnoea. *Cardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, flushing, venous insufficiency, increased defibrillator threshold, edema, and/or cardiac arrest ‚Äì some of which may be due to hypoxemia secondary to respiratory depression. *Respiratory: bronchospasm, dyspnea, respiratory depression or arrest *Gastrointestinal: metallic taste, nausea, vomiting *Ears: tinnitus *Eyes: local burning, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal epithelial changes/ulceration, diplopia, visual changes (opacification) *Skin: itching, depigmentation, rash, urticaria, edema, angioedema, bruising, inflammation of the vein at the injection site, irritation of the skin when applied topically *Blood: methemoglobinemia *Allergy ADRs associated with the use of intravenous lidocaine are similar to toxic effects from systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (‚â•3 mg/min). Common ADRs include: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or paraesthesia. Infrequent ADRs associated with the use of lidocaine include: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle twitching, seizures, coma, and/or respiratory depression. It is generally safe to use lidocaine with vasoconstrictor such as adrenaline, including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers, and toes. While concerns of tissue death if used in these areas have been raised, evidence does not support these concerns. = Interactions = Any drugs that are also ligands of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 can potentially increase serum levels and potential for toxicity or decrease serum levels and the efficacy, depending on whether they induce or inhibit the enzymes, respectively. Drugs that may increase the chance of methemoglobinemia should also be considered carefully. Dronedarone and liposomal morphine are both absolutely a contraindication, as they may increase the serum levels, but hundreds of other drugs require monitoring for interaction. = Contraindications = Absolute contraindications for the use of lidocaine include: * Heart block, second or third degree (without pacemaker) * Severe sinoatrial block (without pacemaker) * Serious adverse drug reaction to lidocaine or amide local anesthetics * Hypersensitivity to corn and corn-related products (corn-derived dextrose is used in the mixed injections) * Concurrent treatment with quinidine, flecainide, disopyramide, procainamide (class I antiarrhythmic agents) * Prior use of amiodarone hydrochloride * Adams-Stokes syndrome * Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome * Lidocaine viscous is not recommended by the FDA to treat teething pain in children and infants. Exercise caution in patients with any of these: * Hypotension not due to arrhythmia * Bradycardia * Accelerated idioventricular rhythm * Elderly patients *Pseudocholinesterase deficiency * Intra-articular infusion (this is not an approved indication and can cause chondrolysis) * Porphyria, especially acute intermittent porphyria; lidocaine has been classified as porphyrogenic because of the hepatic enzymes it induces, although clinical evidence suggests it is not. Bupivacaine is a safe alternative in this case. * Impaired liver function ‚Äì people with lowered hepatic function may have an adverse reaction with repeated administration of lidocaine because the drug is metabolized by the liver. Adverse reactions may include neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, nausea, muscle twitches, vomiting, or seizures). =Overdosage= Overdoses of lidocaine may result from excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children (who are more susceptible to overdose), accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or from prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgery. Such overdoses have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. Lidocaine is often given intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parenteral feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more common. =Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis= Lidocaine in large amounts may be toxic to cartilage and intra-articular infusions can lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by prolonging the inactivation of the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for action potential propagation. With sufficient blockage, the voltage-gated sodium channels will not open and an action potential will not be generated. Careful titration allows for a high degree of selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other types of neurons. The same principle applies for this drug's actions in the heart. Blocking sodium channels in the conduction system, as well as the muscle cells of the heart, raises the depolarization threshold, making the heart less likely to initiate or conduct early action potentials that may cause an arrhythmia. = Pharmacokinetics = When used as an injectable it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half-life than lidocaine, but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker. The volume of distribution is 1.1 L/kg to 2.1 L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%. The elimination half-life of lidocaine is biphasic and around 90 min to 120 min in most patients. This may be prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment (average 343 min) or congestive heart failure (average 136 min). Lidocaine is excreted in the urine (90% as metabolites and 10% as unchanged drug).  History  Lidocaine, the first amino amide‚Äìtype local anesthetic, was first synthesized under the name 'xylocaine' by Swedish chemist Nils L√∂fgren in 1943. His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anesthesia experiments on himself. It was first marketed in 1949. Society and culture = Dosage forms = Lidocaine, usually in the form of its hydrochloride salt, is available in various forms including many topical formulations and solutions for injection or infusion. It is also available as a transdermal patch, which is applied directly to the skin.

Xylocaine is a brand name. = Recreational use = Lidocaine is not currently listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as an illegal substance. It is used as an adjuvant, adulterant, and diluent to street drugs such as cocaine and heroin. It is one of the three common ingredients in site enhancement oil used by bodybuilders. = Adulterant in cocaine = Lidocaine is often added to cocaine as a diluent.

His family was Jewish,The Power and Limits of Algorithms Richard Manning Karp, Kyoto Prize Address, 2008 and he grew up in a small apartment, in a then mostly Jewish neighborhood of Dorchester in Boston. Both his parents were Harvard graduates (his mother eventually obtaining her Harvard degree at age 57 after taking evening courses), while his father had had ambitions to go to medical school after Harvard, but became a mathematics teacher as he could not afford the medical school fees. He attended Harvard University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1955, his master's degree in 1956, and his Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1959. He started working at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. In 1968, he became Professor of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Operations Research at the University of California, Berkeley. Apart from a 4-year period as a professor at the University of Washington, he has remained at Berkeley. From 1988 to 1995 and 1999 to the present he has also been a Research Scientist at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, where he currently leads the Algorithms Group. Richard Karp was awarded the National Medal of Science, and was the recipient of the Harvey Prize of the Technion and the 2004 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science for his insights into computational complexity. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. He is the recipient of several honorary degrees. In 2012, Karp became the founding director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at the University of California, Berkeley.  Work  Karp has made many important discoveries in computer science, combinatorial algorithms, and operations research. His major current research interests include bioinformatics. In 1971 he co-developed with Jack Edmonds the Edmonds‚ÄìKarp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, and in 1972 he published a landmark paper in complexity theory, \\"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\\", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP- complete. In 1973 he and John Hopcroft published the Hopcroft‚ÄìKarp algorithm, the fastest known method for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs. In 1980, along with Richard J. Lipton, Karp proved the Karp- Lipton theorem (which proves that if SAT can be solved by Boolean circuits with a polynomial number of logic gates, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level). In 1987 he co-developed with Michael O. Rabin the Rabin-Karp string search algorithm. = Turing Award = His citation for the (1985) Turing Award was as follows: :For his continuing contributions to the theory of algorithms including the development of efficient algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial optimization problems, the identification of polynomial-time computability with the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most notably, contributions to the theory of NP-completeness. Karp introduced the now standard methodology for proving problems to be NP- complete which has led to the identification of many theoretical and practical problems as being computationally difficult.

Muse on stage at Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in San Francisco, 13 August 2011 AIDAPrima A laser lighting display or laser light show involves the use of laser light to entertain an audience. A laser light show may consist only of projected laser beams set to music, or may accompany another form of entertainment, typically musical performances. Laser light is useful in entertainment because the coherent nature of laser light allows a narrow beam to be produced, which allows the use of optical scanning to draw patterns or images on walls, ceilings or other surfaces including theatrical smoke and fog without refocusing for the differences in distance, as is common with video projection. This inherently more focused beam is also extremely visible, and is often used as an effect. Sometimes the beams are \\"bounced\\" to different positions with mirrors to create laser sculptures.  Function  = Scanning = Laser scanners reflect the laser beam on small mirrors which are mounted on galvanometers to which a control voltage is applied. The beam is deflected a certain amount which correlates to the amount of voltage applied to the galvanometer scanner. Two galvanometer scanners can enable X-Y control voltages to aim the beam to any point on a square. This is called vector scanning. This enables the laser lighting designer to create patterns such as Lissajous figures (such as are often displayed on oscilloscopes); other methods of creating images through the use of galvanometer scanners and X-Y control voltages can generate letters, shapes, and even complicated and intricate images. A planar or conical moving beam aimed through atmospheric smoke or fog can display a plane or cone of light known as a \\"laser tunnel\\" effect. = Diffraction = A less complicated way of spreading the laser beam is by means of diffraction. A grating splits the monochromatic light into several rays, and by using holograms, essentially complicated gratings, the beam can be split into various patterns. Diffraction uses something referred to as the Huygens-Fresnel principle. The basic idea is that on every wavefront exists a forward propagating spherical wavelet of light. The initial wavefront manifests itself in the form of a straight line, as if the subject was seeing a wave coming in towards themselves in the water. Aspects of the spherical waves that divert sideways are cancelled with the sideways components of the wave points on each respect point on either side. Diffraction is the primary method that many simple laser projectors work. Light is projected out towards multiple points. = Static beams = Uninterrupted stationary beams from one or more laser emitters are used to create aerial beam effects, which are turned on and off at varying intervals to create a sense of excitement. As the laser beam is not manipulated in any way, this could be considered the simplest form of a laser light show and also the least dynamic. Although this method is not as commonly used today due to the availability of scanners, these shows were precursors to laser light shows. Safety Some lasers have the potential to cause eye damage if aimed directly into the eye, or if someone were to stare directly into a stationary laser beam. Some high-power lasers used in entertainment applications can also cause burns or skin damage if enough energy is directed onto the human body and at a close enough range. In the United States, the use of lasers in entertainment, like other laser products, is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and additionally by some state regulatory agencies such as New York State which requires licensure of some laser operators. Safety precautions used by laser lighting professionals include beamstops and procedures so that the beam is projected above the heads of the audience. It is possible, and in some countries commonplace, to do deliberate audience scanning. In such a case, the show is supposed to be designed and analyzed to keep the beam moving, so that no harmful amount of laser energy is ever received by any individual audience member. Lasers used outdoors can pose a risk of \\"flash blindness\\" to pilots of aircraft if too-bright light enters the cockpit. In the U.S., outdoor laser use is jointly regulated by the FDA and the Federal Aviation Administration. For details, see the article Lasers and aviation safety. In Europe the standard EN60825 is the reference concerning the conformity of the equipments of every laser-sources-production industries. Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) is the maximum amount of visible laser radiation considered not to cause harm, for a given exposure time. In many European countries these exposure limits may also be a legal requirement. The MPE is 25.4W/m2 for a period of 250 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 1mW over 7mm circular aperture (the size of the human pupil). Origin One of the pioneers in the use of lasers in multimedia productions was the Polish-Australian artist Joseph Stanislaus Ostoja-Kotkowski, whose explorations of their artistic possibilities at Stanford University, California, and later at the Weapons Research Establishment at Salisbury, South Australia led to his innovative 'Sound and Image' show at the 1968 Adelaide Festival of Arts.June Edwards (2018), Ostoja- Kotkowski, Joseph Stanislaw (Stan) (1922‚Äì1994), Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University. Retrieved 8 December 2019. Laser light shows fully emerged in the early 1970s and became a form of psychedelic entertainment, usually accompanied with a live musical performance on stage or pre-recorded music. The Who, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Genesis, and Electric Light Orchestra were among the first high- profile rock acts to use lasers in their concert shows in the mid-1970s. Blue √ñyster Cult used laser shows on tours that supported their album Spectres, which shows a staged portrait of the band members seated among the laser beams, and Electric Light Orchestra made use of lasers during their 1978 Out of the Blue Tour which also featured the famous \\"Flying Saucer\\". This is now highly regulated in the U.S., to the point where almost no U.S. shows have laser beams that go into or close to the audience.

Troll was inactive until 2000. By that time Fafnir, now under the name Sinister Minister Twice, had rejoined Troll. Other members were also added, making Troll a group and no longer a solo project. With Nagash concentrating on guitar and synth, Troll released The Last Predators in 2000 and Universal in 2001. Significant progress took place between Drep de kristne and Last Predators. Lyrical content was now mainly English, and the imagery revolved less around Satanic symbols and hate for Christians. The music became less grim and more symphonic over the years. In 2007 Nagash had assembled a full line-up for Troll, and began recording a new album in January 2009. That album, Neo-Satanic Supremacy, was released in early 2010, and described by one critic as \\"An entertaining, if somewhat over-familiar slice of 90s-style symphonic black metal\\".OneMetal.com review, by Philip Whitehouse.

The band released six full-length albums released by Metal Blade Records to date and a variety of mini-albums, EPs and special releases. Ancient used to have the classic raw black metal sound, similar to Darkthrone's works. Beginning with The Cainian Chronicle, they moved towards a more Nordic/atmospheric black metal sound, akin to Emperor and a cleaner production. After a period of turmoil concerning their line-up, they went on to add gothic-style instruments such as violins, a female vocalist, and synthesizers to their music. To this day Ancient can be considered as one of the original Norwegian black metal bands that were part of the now famous scene of the early nineties. They were one of the first Norwegian black metal bands to sign for a semi-major label (Metal Blade Records). There is no evidence of any involvement of Ancient with the infamous occurrences of the Norwegian black metal scene, although they were part of the same scene. Ancient can be considered as a historical black metal act by all standards, whose path took a different course upon their relocation around the world and subsequent exit from the local Norwegian scene. History The band initially started out as a solo project of guitarist Aphazel in 1992.Ankeny, Jason \\"[ Ancient Biography]\\", AllMusic The following year, Grimm joined the band as drummer and vocalist. They released the Eerily Howling Winds demo in 1993 and the Det Glemte Riket EP in 1994. They subsequently signed to Listenable Records and released their debut album, Svartalvheim. After the release of the Trolltaar EP in 1995, Grimm left the band. Aphazel later moved to the United States where he met Lord Kaiaphas of Virginia-based black metal band Grand Belial's Key, who soon became the new vocalist and drummer of Ancient. In 1996, the band signed a contract with Metal Blade Records (which led to sellout accusations), and two new members joined the band: Kimberly Goss as a female vocalist and keyboardist, and Kjetil as a drummer. Together, they recorded Ancient's second full-length album The Cainian Chronicle, and later embarked on a European tour. In 1997, Goss was replaced by Erichte, Kjetil left the band, and a new guitarist/keyboardist entered Ancient under the name of Jesus Christ. With the new lineup, Ancient released their third album, Mad Grandiose Bloodfiends. After a world tour, Aphazel met Deadly Kristin, who became the new female vocalist, and he decided to move to Italy. 1998 brought more lineup changes: Krigse took over the drums, Dhilorz became the new bassist, and Lord Kaiaphas left the band. In 1999, The Halls of Eternity was released, with Aphazel as the new vocalist. Ancient \\"Night Visit lineup\\" 2005 Upon the exit of Krigse, Ancient went on to find a replacement in the local metal scene. A new tour followed, including the band's first concerts in Scandinavia, and in 2000, Ancient played at Wacken Open Air main stage with the new drummer GroM who joined in May 2000. A compilation EP, God Loves the Dead, was released in January 2001, featuring some remixes, a new single and a cover of Iron Maiden's 'Powerslave' song. Ancient's fifth album, Proxima Centauri, was recorded at Los Angered Recording (Andy LaRocque's studio) and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York. It was then released in October 2001. Another world tour followed, including Mexico, Eastern Europe and Israel. Ancient then proceeded to move closer to their classic black metal origins and began the writing of a new album as a 4-piece without female vocals. In July 2004, Ancient released their sixth album, Night Visit. Written in drummer Grom's studio at the feet of the Italian Alps, the album was recorded at Studio Fredman and mixed by Swedish producer Fredrik Nordstr√∂m. Following the release, the band embarked on another European tour called \\"A Night VisiTour\\" in 2005, with Illdisposed as co-headliners and Final Breath as support. In the end of 2005, GroM left the band. Aphazel and Deadly Kristin released an album with their side-project called 'Dreamlike Horror', for Greek label Sleaszy Rider Records in June 2005. Live, the band featured Aleister of Faust (a cult Italian death metal band) on guitar and following Grom's departure, also featured Nick Barker (Cradle Of Filth, Dimmu Borgir) on drums. Ancient's original demos, including Eerily Howling Winds, were re-released in 2005 in an album called Eerily Howling Winds - The Antediluvian Tapes. In 2009 and 2010 they reformed for a new set of live shows in Spain and Portugal with Nick Barker as drummer. Metal Blade has since then released a three-CD pack containing the band's three releases before the final Night Visit album: The Halls of Eternity, God Loves the Dead and Proxima Centauri. In 2011, band's lead singer Aphazel announced that he had converted to Christianity, had shortened his artist name to Zel and also announced plans for a new studio album. The album, Back to the Land of the Dead, was released in 2016 by EMP Label Group, with the group subsequently signing with Soulseller Records. In early 2016 the band recruited guitarist Ghiulz (Bulldozer) as session guitarist for live performances.

Samoa was the last German colonial acquisition in the Pacific basin, received following the Tripartite Convention signed at Washington on 2 December 1899 with ratifications exchanged on 16 February 1900.Ryden, George Herbert. The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa. New York: Octagon Books, 1975. (Reprint by special arrangement with Yale University Press. Originally published at New Haven: Yale University Press, 1928), p. 574; the Tripartite Convention (United States, Germany, Great Britain) was signed at Washington on 2 December 1899 with ratifications exchanged on 16 February 1900Flag raising at Mulinu'u Point was 1 March 1900 It was the only German colony in the Pacific, aside from the Kiautschou Bay concession in China, that was administered separately from German New Guinea. Expansion of German influence In 1855 J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn expanded its trading business into the Pacific following negotiations by August Unshelm, Godeffroy's agent in Valparaiso. He sailed out to the Samoan Islands, which were then known as the Navigator Islands. During the second half of the 19th century German influence in Samoa expanded with large scale plantation operations being introduced for coconut, cacao and hevea rubber cultivation, especially on the island of 'Upolu where German firms monopolised copra and cocoa bean processing. The trading operations of J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn extended to islands in the Central Pacific. In 1865 a trading captain acting on behalf of J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn obtained a 25-year lease to the eastern islet of Niuoku of Nukulaelae Atoll. J. C. Godeffroy und Sohn was taken over in 1879 by Handels-und Plantagen-Gesellschaft der S√ºdsee-Inseln zu Hamburg (DHPG). Competition in the trading operations in the Central Pacific came from Ruge, Hedemann & Co, established in 1875, which was succeeded by H. M. Ruge and Company until that firm failed in about 1887. Tensions caused in part by the conflicting interests of the German traders and plantation owners and British business enterprises and American business interests led to the first Samoan Civil War. The war was fought roughly between 1886 and 1894, primarily between Samoans though the German military intervened on several occasions. The United States and the United Kingdom opposed the German activity which led to a confrontation in Apia Harbour in 1887. In 1899 after the Second Samoan Civil War the Samoan Islands were divided by the three involved powers. The Samoa Tripartite Convention gave control of the islands west of 171 degrees west longitude to Germany, the eastern islands to the United States (present-day American Samoa) and the United Kingdom was compensated with other territories in the Pacific and West Africa. Economic development R. Hellgrewe, 1908), 10 miles east of Apia During the colonial years new companies were formed to greatly expand agricultural activities which in turn increased tax revenues for public works that further stimulated economic growth; ‚Äú... over all, the period of German rule was the most progressive, economically, that the country has experienced.‚ÄùDavidson, Samoa mo Samoa, p. 82 J. C. Godeffroy, as the leading trading and plantation company on Samoa, maintained communications among its various subdivisions and branches and the home base at Hamburg with its own fleet of ships.Washausen, Hamburg und die Kolonialpolitik des Deutschen Reiches, p. 56 Since the Samoan cultural envelope did not include ‚Äúlabor for hire,‚Äù the importation of Chinese (coolie) laborers (and to a lesser extent Melanesians from New Guinea working for DHPG) was implemented,Spoehr, White Falcon, p. 40-42 and ‚Äú ... by 1914 over 2,000 Chinese were in the colony, providing an effective labor force for the [German] plantations.\\" Davidson, p. 77 Major plantation enterprises on Samoa: *J.

Wilhelm Solf became the first governor. In its political relations with the Samoan people, Solf's government showed similar qualities of intelligence and care as in the economic arena.Davidson, p. 78 He skillfully grafted Samoan institutions into the new system of colonial government by the acceptance of native customs.Lewthwaite, in Western Samoa, p. 130 Solf himself learned many of the customs and rituals important to the Samoan people, observing cultural etiquette including the ceremonial drinking of kava. However, when a dissident Samoan matai (chief) exceeded the limits of his considerable tolerance, Solf stepped in assertively, pronouncing that ‚Äú... there was only one government in Samoa,‚Äù and it was him.Lewthwaite, p. 148 ‚ÄúGerman rule brought peace and order for the first time ... Authority, in the person of the governor, became paternal, fair, and absolute. Berlin was far away; there was no cable or radio.‚ÄùMcKay, Samoana, p. 18 Energetic efforts by colonial administrators established the first public school system; a hospital was built and staffed and enlarged as needed, and Samoan women were trained as nurses. Of all colonial possessions of the European powers in the Pacific, German Samoa was by far the best-roaded;Lewthwaite, p. 153 all roads up until 1942 had been constructed under German direction. The imperial grants from the Berlin treasury which had marked the first eight years of German rule were no longer needed after 1908. Samoa had become a self-supporting colony.Schultz-Naumann, Unter Kaisers Flagge, p. 163, the only other German protectorate in this category was Togoland Wilhelm Solf left Samoa in 1910 to be appointed Colonial Secretary at Berlin; he was succeeded as governor by Erich Schultz, the former chief justice in the protectorate. The Germans built the Telefunken Railroad from Apia onto the Mount Vaea for transporting building materials for the 120 m high mast of their Telefunken wireless station, which was inaugurated as planned on 1 August 1914, just a few days after the beginning of World War I. Occupation The Union Jack being hoisted at a building in Apia, 30 August 1914 Other than native Samoan police, Germany had no armed forces stationed in the islands. The small gunboat SMS Geier and the unarmed survey ship Planet were assigned to the so-called \\"Australian Station\\" (encompassing all German South Seas protectorates, not the British dominion Australia), but Geier never reached Samoa.At the outbreak of World War I, the gunboat was in transit from German East Africa to German New Guinea and met the light cruiser SMS Emden. Geier initially stayed on station in the German Caroline Islands, but the 20-year-old 'orphan' ship had no military value as a naval combatant and was short on coal and provisions. She proceeded in October 1914 to Honolulu in the United States Territory of Hawaii. Shadowed by the Japanese, she was interned. With United States entry into the war in April 1917, Geier was confiscated, renamed USS Schurz and operated by the United States Navy until 1918, when she sank after a collision mishap off the North Carolina coast. At the behest of the United Kingdom the colony was invaded unopposed on the morning of 29 August 1914 by troops of the Samoa Expeditionary Force. Vice Admiral Count Maximilian von Spee of the German East Asia Squadron gained knowledge of the occupation and hastened to Samoa with the armored cruisers SMS Scharnhorst and SMS Gneisenau, arriving off Apia on 14 September 1914. He determined however that a landing would only be of temporary advantage in an Allied dominated sea and the cruisers departed.The ships inflicted some damage at Papeete, Tahiti and then rejoined the squadron en route to South America New Zealand occupied the German colony through to 1920, then governed the islands until independence in 1962 as a League of Nations Class C Mandatedate of ratification by the League of Nations was 10 January 1920; Class C mandates were designed for populations considered incapable of self-government at first and then as a United Nations Trust Territory after 1946.  Planned symbols for German Samoa  In 1914, a series of drafts were made for proposed coats of arms and flags for the German colonies, including German Samoa. However, World War I broke out before the designs were finished, and the symbols were never used. Following its defeat in the war, Germany lost all its colonies, so the coats of arms and flags became redundant.

In 1913, he transferred to Harvard University so as to continue his studies. At the outbreak of World War I, Albizu Campos volunteered in the United States Infantry. Albizu was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Army Reserves and sent to the City of Ponce, where he organized the town's Home Guard. He was called to serve in the regular Army and sent to Camp Las Casas for further training. Upon completing the training, he was assigned to the 375th Infantry Regiment. The United States Army, then segregated, assigned Puerto Ricans of recognizably African descent as soldiers to the all-black units, such as the 375th Regiment. Officers were men classified as white. Albizu Campos was black. Lieutenant Pedro Albizu Campos (U.S. Army) Albizu Campos was honorably discharged from the Army in 1919, with the rank of First Lieutenant. However, his exposure to racism during his time in the U.S. military altered his perspective on U.S.- Puerto Rico relations, and he became the leading advocate for Puerto Rican independence. In 1919, Albizu returned to his studies at Harvard University, where he was elected president of the Harvard Cosmopolitan Club. He met with foreign students and world leaders, such as Subhas Chandra Bose, the Indian Nationalist leader, and the Hindu poet Rabindranath Tagore. He became interested in the cause of Indian independence and also helped to establish several centers in Boston for Irish independence. Through this work, Albizu Campos met the Irish leader √âamon de Valera and later became a consultant in the drafting of the constitution of the Irish Free State. Also while at Harvard University he co-founded the university's Knights of Columbus chapter along with other Catholic students.Marisa Rosado, Pedro Albizu Campos: Las Llamas de la Aurora (San Juan, PR: Ediciones Puerto, Inc., 2008), pp. 56‚Äì74. Albizu graduated from Harvard Law School in 1921 while simultaneously studying Literature, philosophy, Chemical Engineering, and Military Science at Harvard College. He was fluent in six modern and two classical languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Latin, and ancient Greek. Upon graduation from law school, Albizu Campos was recruited for prestigious positions, including a law clerkship to the U.S. Supreme Court, a diplomatic post with the U.S. State Department, the regional vice-presidency (Caribbean region) of a U.S. agricultural syndicate, and a tenured faculty appointment to the University of Puerto Rico. On June 23, 1921, after graduating from Harvard Law School, Albizu returned to Puerto Rico‚Äîbut without his law diploma. He had been the victim of racial discrimination by one of his professors. He delayed Albizu Campos' third-year final exams for courses in Evidence and Corporations. Albizu was about to graduate with the highest grade-point average in his entire law school class. As such, he was scheduled to give the valedictory speech during the graduation ceremonies.

This Charter of Autonomy was signed by Spanish Prime Minister Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta and ratified by the Spanish Cortes.Ribes Tovar et al., p.106‚Äì109 Despite this, just a few months later, the United States claimed ownership of the island as part of the Treaty of Paris, which concluded the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.

Their position was that, as a matter of international law, the Treaty of Paris could not empower the Spanish to \\"give\\" to the United States what was no longer theirs.Ribes Tovar et al., p.122‚Äì144 Several years after leaving Puerto Rico, in 1913 Charles Herbert Allen, the former first civilian U.S. governor of the island, became president of the American Sugar Refining Company,Charles H. Allen Resigns\\" , New York Times, 16 June 1915, accessed 2 November 2013 the largest of its kind in the world. In 1915, he resigned to reduce his responsibilities, but stayed on the board. This company was later renamed as the Domino Sugar company. According to historian Federico Ribes Tovar, Charles Allen leveraged his governorship of Puerto Rico into a controlling interest over the entire Puerto Rican economy.Federico Ribes Tovar; Albizu Campos: Puerto Rican Revolutionary, pp. 122‚Äì144, 197‚Äì204; Plus Ultra Publishers, 1971 Early career =Puerto Rican Nationalist Party leadership= Pedro Albizu Campos in 1936. Nationalist activists wanted independence from foreign banks, absentee plantation owners, and United States colonial rule. Accordingly, they started organizing in Puerto Rico. In 1919, Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠, a member of the Union Party of Puerto Rico, took followers with him to form the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico in San Juan, to work for independence. They gained legislative approval to repatriate the remains of Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances, the Puerto Rican patriot, from Paris, France. By the 1920s, two other pro- independence organizations had formed on the Island: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association of Puerto Rico. The Independence Association was founded by Jos√© S. Alegr√≠a, Eugenio Font Su√°rez and Leopoldo Figueroa in 1920. On September 17, 1922, these three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Coll y Cuchi was elected president and Jos√© S. Alegr√≠a (father of Ricardo Alegr√≠a) vice president. In 1924, Pedro Albizu Campos joined the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and was elected vice president. In 1927, Albizu Campos traveled to Santo Domingo, Haiti, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela, seeking support among other Latin Americans for the Puerto Rican Independence movement. In 1930, Albizu and Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠, president of the Party, disagreed on how the party should be run. Albizu Campos did not like what he considered to be Coll y Cuch√≠'s attitude of fraternal solidarity with the enemy.Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, By A. W. Maldonado, Pg. 86, Publisher: La Editorial, Universidad de Puerto Rico, (December 1, 2006), , As a result, Coll y Cuch√≠ left the party and, with some of his followers, returned to the Union Party. On May 11, 1930, Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. He formed the first Women's Nationalist Committee, in the island municipality of Vieques, Puerto Rico.Rosado, Marisa; Pedro Albizu Campos, pp. 127‚Äì188; pub. Ediciones Puerto, Inc., 1992; After being elected party president, Albizu declared: \\"I never believed in numbers. Independence will instead be achieved by the intensity of those that devote themselves totally to the Nationalist ideal.\\" Under the slogan, \\"La Patria es valor y sacrificio\\" (The Homeland is valor and sacrifice), a new campaign of national affirmation was carried out. Albizu Campos' vision of sacrifice was integrated with his Catholic faith. =Accusation against Dr. Cornelius P. Rhoads= In 1932, Albizu published a letter accusing Dr. Cornelius P. Rhoads, an American pathologist with the Rockefeller Institute, of killing Puerto Rican patients in San Juan's Presbyterian Hospital as part of his medical research. Albizu Campos had been given an unmailed letter by Rhoads addressed to a colleague, found after Rhoads returned to the United States.\\"Dr. Rhoads Cleared of Porto Rico Plot\\" , New York Times, 15 February 1932 Part of what Rhoads wrote, in a letter to his friend which began by complaining about another's job appointment, included the following: Albizu sent copies of the letter to the League of Nations, the Pan American Union, the American Civil Liberties Union, newspapers, embassies, and the Vatican.Starr, Douglas. \\"Revisiting a 1930s Scandal: AACR to Rename a Prize\\", Science, Vol. 300. No. 5619. 25 April 2003, pp. 574‚Äì5. He also sent copies of the Rhoads letter to the media, and published his own letter in the Porto Rico Progress. He used it as an opportunity to attack United States imperialism, writing: A scandal erupted. Rhoads had already returned to New York.Susan E. Lederer, \\" 'Porto Ricochet': Joking about Germs, Cancer, and Race Extermination in the 1930s\\" , American Literary History, Volume 14. No. 4, Winter 2002, Retrieved 12 December 2012. Governor James R. Beverley of Puerto Rico and his attorney general Ram√≥n Qui√±ones, as well as Puerto Rican medical doctors Morales and Otero appointed thereby, conducted an investigation of the more than 250 cases treated during the period of Rhoads' work at Presbyterian Hospital. The Rockefeller Foundation also conducted their own investigation. Rhoads said he had written the letter in anger after he found his car vandalized, and it was intended \\"as a joke\\" in private with his colleague. An investigation concluded that he had conducted his research and treatment of Puerto Ricans appropriately. When the matter was revisited in 2002, again no evidence was found of medical mistreatment. The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) considered the letter offensive enough to remove Rhoads' name from a prize established to honor his lifelong work in cancer research. =Early Nationalist efforts= The Ponce Massacre, 1937. Carlos Torres Morales, a photo journalist for the newspaper El Imparcial, took this when the shooting began. The Nationalist Party obtained poor electoral results in the 1932 election, but continued its campaign to unite the island behind an independent Puerto Rico platform. In 1933, Albizu Campos led a strike against the Puerto Rico Railway and Light and Power Company for its alleged monopoly on the island. The following year he represented sugar cane workers as a lawyer in a suit against the United States sugar industry. The Nationalist movement was intensified by some of its members being killed by police during unrest at the University of Puerto Rico in 1935, in what was called the R√≠o Piedras Massacre. The police were commanded by Colonel E. Francis Riggs, a former United States Army officer. Albizu withdrew the Nationalist Party from electoral politics, saying they would not participate until the United States ended colonial rule. In 1936, Hiram Rosado and El√≠as Beauchamp, two members of the Cadets of the Republic, the Nationalist youth organization, assassinated Colonel Riggs. After their arrest, they were killed without a trial at police headquarters in San Juan.Federico Ribes Tovar, Albizu Campos\\" Puerto Rican Revolutionary, pp. 57‚Äì62; Plus Ultra Publishers, Inc., 1972 Other police killed marchers and bystanders at a parade in the Ponce massacre (1937). The Nationalists believed these showed the violence which the United States was prepared to use in order to maintain its colonial regime in Puerto Rico.Manuel Maldonado-Denis, Puerto Rico: A Socio-Historic Interpretation, pp. 65‚Äì83; Random House, 1972 Historians Manuel Maldonado- Denis and C√©sar Ayala believe the motive for this repression, especially during the Great Depression, was because United States business interests were earning such enormous profits by this colonial arrangement.C√©sar J. Ayala; American Sugar Kingdom, pp.221‚Äì227; University of North Carolina Press, 1999 =First arrest= After these events, on April 3, 1936, a federal grand jury submitted an indictment against Albizu Campos, Juan Antonio Corretjer, Luis F. Vel√°zquez, Clemente Soto V√©lez and the following members of the cadets: Erasmo Vel√°zquez, Julio H. Vel√°zquez, Rafael Ortiz Pacheco, Juan Gallardo Santiago, and Pablo Rosado Ortiz. They were charged with sedition and other violations of Title 18 of the United States Code.FBI Files on Puerto Ricans Clemente Soto V√©lez, Juan Antonio Corretjer and Pedro Albizu Campos (L to R), immediately before their trial and federal imprisonment. The prosecution based some of its charges on the Nationalists' creation and organization of the Cadets, which the government referred to as the \\"Liberating Army of Puerto Rico\\". The prosecutors said that the military tactics which the cadets were taught were for the purpose of overthrowing the Government of the United States.\\"FBI Files\\"; \\"Puerto Rico Nationalist Party\\"; SJ 100-3; Vol. 23; pages 104‚Äì134. \\"Nationalist Insurrection of 1950\\" , Write of Fight A jury of seven Puerto Ricans and five Americans acquitted the individuals by a vote of 7-to-5. However, Judge Robert A. Cooper did not approve of this verdict. He called for a new trial and a new jury, which was composed of ten Americans and two Puerto Ricans. This second jury concluded that the defendants were guilty.Timelines: \\"The Imprisonment of Men and Women Fighting Colonialism, 1930 ‚Äì 1940\\" , Puerto Rican Dreams, Retrieved December 9, 2009. In 1937, a group of lawyers, including a young Gilberto Concepci√≥n de Gracia, appealed the case, but the Boston Court of Appeals, which held appellate jurisdiction, upheld the verdict. Albizu Campos and the other Nationalist leaders were sentenced to the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta. In 1939, United States Congressman Vito Marcantonio strongly criticized the proceedings, calling the trial a \\"frame-up\\" and \\"one of the blackest pages in the history of American jurisprudence.\\"Congressional Record, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 81:10780 Appendix In his speech Five Years of Tyranny, Congressman Marcantonio said that Albizu's jury had been profoundly prejudiced since it had been hand-picked by the prosecuting attorney Cecil Snyder. According to Marcantonio, the jury consisted of people \\"...who had expressed publicly bias and hatred for the defendants.\\" He said Snyder had been told that \\"the Department of Justice would back him until he did get a conviction.\\" Marcantonio argued for Puerto Rican rights, saying \\"As long as Puerto Rico remains part of the United States, Puerto Rico must have the same freedom, the same civil liberties, and the same justice which our forefathers laid down for us. Only a complete and immediate unconditional pardon will, in a very small measure, right this historical wrong.\\"Congressional Record, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 81:10780, (Appendix) In 1943, Albizu Campos became seriously ill and had to be interned at the Columbus Hospital of New York. He stayed there until nearly the end of his sentence. In 1947, after eleven years of imprisonment, Albizu was released; he returned to Puerto Rico. Within a short period of time, he began preparing for an armed struggle against the United States' plan to turn Puerto Rico into a \\"commonwealth\\" of the United States. Later career =Passage of the Gag Law= In 1948, the Puerto Rican Senate passed Law 53, also called the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law). At the time, members of the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (Popular Democratic Party), or PPD, occupied almost all the Senate seats, and Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n presided over the chamber.Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n , \\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948‚Äì2008)\\", Academia Jurisprudencia, Puerto Rico The bill was signed into law on June 10, 1948, by the United States-appointed governor of Puerto Rico Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero. It closely resembled the anti-communist Smith Law passed in the United States. The law made it illegal to own or display a Puerto Rican flag anywhere, even in one's own home. It limited speech against the United States government or in favor of Puerto Rican independence and prohibited one to print, publish, sell or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years imprisonment, a fine of $10,000 dollars (US), or both. Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, then a member of the Partido Estadista Puertorrique√±o (Puerto Rican Statehood Party) and the only non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, spoke out against the law, saying that it was repressive and in direct violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which guarantees Freedom of Speech.\\"Para declarar el d√≠a 21 de septiembre como el D√≠a del Natalicio de Leopoldo Figueroa Carreras\\" , Lex Juris, LEY NUM. 282 DE 22 DE DICIEMBRE DE 2006, accessed 8 December 2012 Figueroa noted that since Puerto Ricans had been granted United States citizenship they were covered by its constitutional protections. =1950s uprisings and second arrest= Jayuya. Pedro Albizu Campos was jailed again after the October 30, 1950 Nationalist revolts, known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s, in various Puerto Rican cities and towns against United States rule. Among the more notable of the revolts was the Jayuya uprising, where a group of Puerto Rican Nationalists, under the leadership of Blanca Canales, held the town of Jayuya for three days; the Utuado uprising which culminated in what is known as the \\"Utuado Massacre\\"; and the attack on La Fortaleza (the Puerto Rican governor's mansion) during the Nationalist attack of San Juan. On October 31, police officers and National Guardsmen surrounded Sal√≥n Boricua, a barbershop in Santurce. Believing that a group of Nationalists were inside the shop, they opened fire. The only person in the shop was Albizu Campos' personal barber, Vidal Santiago D√≠az. Santiago D√≠az fought alone against the attackers for three hours and received five bullet wounds, including one in the head. The entire gunfight was transmitted \\"live\\" via the radio airwaves, and was heard all over the island. Overnight Santiago D√≠az, the barber who survived an armed attack by forty police and National Guardsmen, became a legend throughout Puerto Rico. During the revolt, Albizu was at the Nationalist Party's headquarters in Old San Juan, which also served as his residence. That day he was accompanied by Juan Jos√© Mu√±oz Matos, Doris Torresola Roura (cousin of Blanca Canales and sister of Griselio Torresola), and Carmen Mar√≠a P√©rez Roque. The occupants of the building were surrounded by the police and the National Guard who, without warning, fired their weapons. Doris Torresola, who was shot and wounded, was carried out during a ceasefire by Mu√±oz Matos and P√©rez Roque. Alvaro Rivera Walker, a friend of Pedro Albizu Campos, somehow made his way to the Nationalist leader. He stayed with Albizu Campos until the next day when they were attacked with gas. Rivera Walker then raised a white towel he attached to a pole and surrendered. All the Nationalists, including Albizu, were arrested. On November 1, 1950, Nationalists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola attacked Blair House in Washington, D.C. where president Harry S. Truman was staying while the White House was being renovated. During the attack on the president, Torresola and a policeman, Private Leslie Coffelt, were killed. Because of this assassination attempt, Pedro Albizu Campos was immediately attacked at his home. After a shootout with the police, Albizu Campos was arrested and sentenced to eighty years in prison. Over the next few days, 3,000 independence supporters were arrested all over the island. =Lolita Lebr√≥n and third arrest= Albizu was pardoned in 1953 by then-governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n but the pardon was revoked the following year after the 1954 United States Capitol shooting incident, when four Puerto Rican Nationalists, led by Lolita Lebr√≥n, opened fire from the gallery of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. Though in ill health, Pedro Albizu Campos was arrested when Lolita Lebr√≥n, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores, unfurled a Puerto Rican flag and opened fire on the members of the 83rd Congress on March 1, 1954 with the intention of capturing world-wide attention to the cause of Puerto Rican independence. Ruth Mary Reynolds, the American Nationalist, went to the defense of Albizu Campos and the four Nationalists involved in the shooting incident with the aid of the American League for Puerto Rico's Independence. =Later years and death= During his imprisonment, Albizu suffered deteriorating health.Secret files: FBI File on Albizu Campos , Puerto Rico, Retrieved December 9, 2009. He alleged that he was the subject of human radiation experiments in prison and said that he could see colored rays bombarding him. When he wrapped wet towels around his head in order to shield himself from the radiation, the prison guards ridiculed him as El Rey de las Toallas (The King of the Towels).Federico Ribes Tovar, Albizu Campos: Puerto Rican Revolutionary, p. 136-139; Plus Ultra Publishers, 1971 Officials suggested that Pedro Albizu Campos was suffering from mental illness, but other prisoners at La Princesa prison including Francisco Matos Paoli, Roberto D√≠az and Juan Jaca, claimed that they felt the effects of radiation on their own bodies as well.Rosado, Marisa; Pedro Albizu Campos; pub. Ediciones Puerto, 2008; p. 386. Torres, Heriberto Mar√≠n; Eran Ellos, pub. Ediciones Ciba, 2000; pp. 32‚Äì62 Dr. Orlando Daumy, a radiologist and president of the Cuban Cancer Association, traveled to Puerto Rico to examine him. From his direct physical examination of Albizu Campos, Dr. Daumy reached three specific conclusions: :1) that the sores on Albizu Campos were produced by radiation burns :2) that his symptoms corresponded to those of a person who had received intense radiation, :3) that wrapping himself in wet towels was the best way to diminish the intensity of the rays.Federico Ribes Tovar, Albizu Campos: Puerto Rican Revolutionary, Plus Ultra Publishers, 1971; pp. 136‚Äì139. In 1956, Albizu suffered a stroke in prison and was transferred to San Juan's Presbyterian Hospital under police guard. On November 15, 1964, on the brink of death, Pedro Albizu Campos was pardoned by Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. He died on April 21, 1965. More than 75,000 Puerto Ricans were part of a procession that accompanied his body for burial in the Old San Juan Cemetery. Legacy The Pedro Albizu Campos Park built at his birthplace: the Tenerias community of Barrio Machuelo Abajo, Ponce, Puerto Rico. Pedro Albizu Campos's legacy is the subject of discussion among supporters and detractors. Lolita Lebr√≥n called him \\"Puerto Rico's most visionary leader\\"Ray Quintanilla. \\"From rebel to peacemaker.\\" The Chicago Tribune. 9 January 2006 and nationalists consider him \\"one of the island's greatest patriots of the 20th century.\\"Juan Manuel Carri√≥n. \\"Two variants of Caribbean nationalism: Marcus Garvey and Pedro Albizu Campos.\\" p. 27.

Centro Journal. Spring 2005. His followers state that Albizu's political and military actions served as a primer for positive change in Puerto Rico, including the improvement of labor conditions for peasants and workers, a more accurate assessment of the colonial relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States, and an awareness by the political establishment in Washington, D.C. of this colonial relationship.Marisa Rosado, Pedro Albizu Campos: Las Llamas de la Aurora (San Juan, PR: Ediciones Puerto, Inc., 2008), pp. 210‚Äì217, 244‚Äì248, 313‚Äì397.

Arckanum ranks among the most influential and popular in the Swedish BM scene. Shamaatae is also an author of occult literature and writes under the names Vexior/Ekortu. His first published work, titled Panparadox, was released the 13th of July 2009 by Ixaxaar. His second book, Gullveigarb√≥k, was released on December 2010 by Fall of Man. His third book was published on December, 21st 2014 called √ûursakyngi, it is said to be a \\"book series\\" with each book dedicated to the Thursatru tradition. As of 2018, he has published multiple books and has many more to come. He put the band to rest in favour for his authorship. History Shamaatae joined his first band, Conquest, aged eleven, the band later evolving into Grotesque. On leaving Grotesque, Shamaatae formed a technical death metal band called Disinterment, who recorded one demo and played a few gigs before splitting up. At the end of 1992, Shamaatae decided to return to black metal and Arckanum was started. Initially a full band, it became a solo project after six months. After several releases, by 1998 Shamaatae had discontinued working with Necropolis Records because they went under, and turned his attention to writing books on the subjects of Pan, Old Norse traditions, runic witchcraft and anti-cosmic Satanism/chaos-gnosticism. He was still involved in music during this time still working with Arckanum and playing drums with The Hearsemen. Arckanum's album √û√û√û√û√û√û√û√û√û√û√û was released on 1 June 2009. Antikosmos and √û√û√û√û√û√û√û√û√û√û√û featured the guest appearance of Set Teitan of the bands Dissection and Watain. Shamataae released 3 more full lengths and several EP's and splits before deciding to record Arckanum's final album Den f√∂rstf√∂dde which was released on September 29, 2017 through Folter Records, who are currently re-releasing the band's entire catalogue. Arckanum was split up in 2018 in order for Shamaatae to focus solely on his authorship and spiritual ventures. In April 26th, 2019, Folter Records released F√∂rsta trulen, an EP which contains the remixed and remastered recordings that were supposed to be the 1994 demo \\"Trulen\\", Shamaatae was unhappy with the original recordings and kept the material unreleased until after he disbanded Arckanum.  Lyrics  Arckanum's lyrics deal mainly with the worship of Chaos, as well as anti-cosmic Satanism. He is noted for writing lyrics resembling Old Swedish, and he has stated that he tries to write his lyrics as grammatically correct as he can. In his latest three albums however, the language is clearly meant to resemble Old East Norse.

If the parties to an agreement could specify their respective rights and duties for every possible future state of the world, their contract would be complete. There would be no gaps in the terms of the contract. However, because it would be prohibitively expensive to write a complete contract, contracts in the real world are usually incomplete. When a dispute arises and the case falls into a gap in the contract, either the parties must engage in bargaining or the courts must step in and fill in the gap. The idea of a complete contract is closely related to the notion of default rules, e.g. legal rules that will fill the gap in a contract in the absence of an agreed upon provision. In economics, the field of contract theory can be subdivided into the theory of complete contracts and the theory of incomplete contracts. Complete contracting theory is also called agency theory (or principal-agent theory) and closely related to (Bayesian) mechanism design and implementation theory. The two most important classes of models in complete contracting theory are adverse selection and moral hazard models. In this part of contract theory, every conceivable contractual arrangement between the contractual parties is allowed, provided it is feasible given the relevant technological and information constraints. In the presence of asymmetric information, the optimization problems can be handled due to the revelation principle. A leading textbook exposition of complete contract theory is Laffont and Martimort (2002).

The system eliminates cash and coins from the entire ship and instead requires sailors to add money from their personal bank accounts to one of two systems held on the cash card. A stored-value card (SVC) is a payment card with a monetary value stored on the card itself, not in an external account maintained by a financial institution. This means no network access is required by the payment collection terminals as funds can be withdrawn and deposited straight from the card. Like cash, payment cards can be used anonymously as the person holding the card can use the funds. They are an electronic development of token coins and are typically used in low-value payment systems or where network access is difficult or expensive to implement, such as parking machines, public transport systems, closed payment systems in locations such as ships or within companies. Stored-value cards differ from debit cards, where money is on deposit with the issuer, and credit cards which are subject to credit limits set by the issuer and are connected to accounts at financial institutions. Another difference between stored-value cards and debit and credit cards is that debit and credit cards are usually issued in the name of individual account holders, while stored-value cards may be anonymous, as in the case of gift cards. Stored-value cards are prepaid money cards and may be disposed when the value is used, or the card value may be topped up, as in the case of telephone calling cards or when used as a fare card. The term closed-loop means the funds and or data are physically stored on the token or card in the form of binary-coded data. This is unlike payment cards where data is maintained on the card issuer's computers. Like payment cards, value can be accessed using a magnetic stripe, chip or radio-frequency identification (RFID) embedded in the card; or by entering a code number, printed on the card, into a telephone or other numeric keypad. Names There is no common name for stored-value cards, which are country or company specific. Names for stored-value cards include APPH in US, Mondex in Canada, Chipknip in the Netherlands, Geldkarte in Germany, Quick in Austria, Moneo in France, Proton in Belgium, Carta prepagata (\\"Prepaid card\\") in Italy, FeliCa in Japan, China T-Union in mainland China, EZ-Link and NETS (CashCard and FlashPay) in Singapore, Octopus card in Hong Kong, SUBE card in Argentina, and Touch 'n Go and MyRapid Card in Malaysia. The U.S. Department of the Treasury manages three stored-value card programs: EZpay, EagleCash, and Navy Cash. Non- government stored-value cards include Aramark GuestExpress, Compass Zipthru, and Freedompay FreetoGo. Uses A vending machine sells farecards for the Washington Metro subway. Stored-value cards are most commonly used for low- value transactions, such as transit system farecards, telephone prepaid calling cards, cafeterias, or for micropayments in shops or vending machines. They also have an advantage over most other payment cards in that when making, say, a purchase, telecommunication facilities are not needed, which may be important in situations where the availability or reliability of these facilities are uncertain or costly, especially for low-value transactions. A benefit to the merchant is that bank transaction fees are not incurred as the transaction is processed offline and there need not be a reference to the bank for processing. A limitation is that these cards cannot be used for online, telephone, mail order and other \\"card not present transactions\\". The German Geldkarte and the Austrian Quick card can also be used to validate a customer's age at cigarette vending machines. Typical applications of organization specific or industry specific prepaid card include payroll cards, rebate cards, gift cards, cafeteria cards and travel cards and U.S. based health schemes such as HSA cards. The EZpay, EagleCash, and Navy Cash cards are used by the U.S. military as electronic alternatives to cash in areas characterized by difficult access and limited banking or telecommunications infrastructure. Stored-value cards can save organizations a considerable amount of money if customers add a large sum of funds at one time to the card and then pay a lower transaction fee for each use of the card on smaller purchases.http://www.ny.frb.org/regional/stored_value_cards.html  Prepaid cards  =Closed system prepaid cards= Closed system prepaid cards are cards issued by a merchant and may only be redeemed for purchases from the merchant. They are typically of fixed amounts and are commonly known as merchant gift cards or store cards. These cards are typically purchased to be used as gifts, and are increasingly replacing the traditional paper gift certificate. Generally, few if any laws govern these types of cards. Card issuers or sellers are not required to obtain a license. Closed system prepaid cards are not subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, as they generally cannot identify a customer. As debts owed to consumers who purchased the card, these purchases remain on the books of a merchant as a liability rather than an asset. Consequently, gift certificates and merchant gift cards have fallen under state escheat or abandoned property laws (APL). However, the emergence of closed system prepaid cards has blurred the applicability of APL. North Carolina and Illinois have excluded these types of cards from APL provided the card has no expiration date or a service fee. Maine and Virginia require the issuer to pay the state when the cards are abandoned. In Connecticut an issuer is required to identify the residence of the gift card owner. Since most merchant gift cards are anonymous, the residence of the card's owner is deemed to be the state's treasurer's office. Presently, no law requires a merchant to provide refunds for lost or stolen cards. Whether a refund is possible is specified in an issuer's cardholder agreement. In addition, most closed system cards cannot be redeemed for cash. When a cardholder redeems all but an insignificant portion of the card on merchandise, that amount is generally lost and is a windfall gain for the issuing merchant. The merchant also obtains a windfall gain if a card has an expiry date and the cardholder fails to use the full value by that date. Furthermore, the merchant has an interest- free use of the value until it is redeemed. =Semi-closed system prepaid cards= Semi-closed system prepaid cards are similar to closed system prepaid cards. However, cardholders are permitted to redeem the cards at multiple merchants within a geographic area. These types of cards are issued by a third party, rather than the retailer who accepts the card. Examples include university cards and mall gift cards. The laws governing these types of cards are unsettled. Depending on the state, the issuer may or may not be required to have a money transmitter license or other similar license. In addition to the District of Columbia, the states in the US that require a license include Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. Note, these states explicitly require licensing for card issuers. Other states may have more subtle licensing laws. Under 18 USC section 1960, it is a crime for an issuer to conduct a money transmitting business without a license. Cardholders generally suffer from the same redressability problems that closed system card holders suffer. It is unclear whether or not Chapters 7 and 11 of the Bankruptcy code are applicable to these types of cards. Money laundering It is common for countries to place limits on how much currency may be taken out of or brought into a country. However, these limits generally do not apply to money leaving a country in non-cash forms such as on stored-value cards. There is concern that stored- value cards can be used for money laundering, that is, moving offshore funds derived from criminal activities such as drug trafficking. There are reports of these cards being used by Mexican drug cartels to transfer money across borders. For example, in the United States, it is legal for anyone to enter or leave the country with money that is stored on cards, and (unlike cash in high amounts) does not have to be reported to customs or any other authority. Some members of the U.S. Congress are considering creating laws that would require travelers crossing, entering, or leaving the country to report these cards.Reuters, March 26, 2010, Drugs, terrorism and shadow banking, http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2010/03/26/drugs-terrorism-and-shadow- banking/ The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury has published a notice of proposed rulemaking on stored-value cards in the June 28, 2010 edition of the Federal Register. The proposed rules would require sellers of prepaid cards to register with the government and keep records on transactions and customers.http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/pdf/2010-15194.pdf See also * Prepaid \\"credit\\" card * Scrip * Gift card * Telephone card * Electronic money * Decoupled debit card References Sources  Payment cards Radio-frequency identification sv:Kontantkort ","title":"Stored-value card"},{"id":"298805","text":"Vincent Peter Colaiuta (born February 5, 1956) is an American drummer who has worked as a session musician in many genres. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1996, and the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2014. Music career Of Italian descent, Colaiuta was given his first drum kit when he was seven. He took to it naturally, with little instruction. When he was fourteen, the school band teacher gave him a book that taught him some of the basics. Buddy Rich was his favorite drummer until he heard the album Ego by Tony Williams, an event that changed his life. Colaiuta was also listening to organ groups, notably Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff and Don Patterson. While a student at Berklee College of Music, when jazz fusion was on the rise, he listened to and admired Alphonse Mouzon and Billy Cobham. After leaving school, he played local gigs in Boston. He joined a brief tour organized by Al Kooper, then worked in California on an album by Christopher Morris, which Kooper was producing. Although he returned to Boston, he was drawn back to California by friends. He took the bus from Boston to Los Angeles during the blizzard of 1978. After performing in jazz clubs, he won the audition to play drums for Frank Zappa. He toured with Zappa and appeared on the albums Joe's Garage, Tinsel Town Rebellion, and Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar. Modern Drummer magazine chose Joe's Garage as one of the top 25 drum performances of all time. Colaiuta was called out by name by Dale Bozzio (playing the character of Mary) in the lyrics of the song Catholic Girls. Colaiuta with Kenny Garrett in the Five Peace Band, 2008 In 1981, he left touring with Zappa to become a studio musician, recording for the band Pages and pop singer Gino Vannelli. Opportunities arose with saxophonist Tom Scott and bassist Larry Klein, who invited Colaiuta to play on a record by his then-girlfriend, Joni Mitchell. When Klein and Mitchell got married, Colaiuta was the best man at their wedding. During the 1980s, he toured with Mitchell. By the end of the 1980s he was living the busy life of a studio musician, recording albums, doing TV and film work during the day, and playing clubs at night. In addition to pop acts, he has worked with jazz musicians Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Buell Neidlinger, and the Buddy Rich Big Band. In 1990, Colaiuta got a phone call from Sting, flew to England, and won the audition to become a member of his band. He remained with Sting for much of the 1990s, touring and recording the albums Ten Summoner's Tales (1993), Mercury Falling (1996), Brand New Day (1999) and Sacred Love (2003). On November 12, 2016, he played with Sting in the first concert to be held at the Bataclan in Paris since the terrorist attack a year earlier. In 1994, he released his debut solo album. He has won over fifteen Drummer of the Year awards from Modern Drummer magazine's annual reader polls. These include ten awards in the \\"Best Overall\\" category.Modern Drummer interview , vinniecolaiuta.com; accessed October 26, 2014.

He was the youngest Premier in Ontario history, appointed at age 37. His personality was complex, as The Globe and Mail noted in its obituary for him: Early life Born in St. Thomas, Ontario, Hepburn attended school in Elgin County and hoped to become a lawyer. His formal education ended abruptly, however, when someone threw an apple at visiting dignitary Sir Adam Beck, knocking his silk top hat off his head. Hepburn was accused of the deed, denied it, but refused to identify the culprit. Refusing to apologize, he walked out of his high school and obtained a job as a bank clerk at the Canadian Bank of Commerce where he worked from 1913 to 1917. He eventually became an accountant at the bank's Winnipeg branch. At the outbreak of World War I, Hepburn had already enlisted in the 34th Fort Garry Horse, but was unable to obtain his parents' consent to sign up for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He then became a lieutenant in the 25th Elgin Regiment of the Canadian Militia, and was conscripted to the 1st (Western Ontario) Battalion in 1918. He transferred to the Royal Air Force and was sent to Deseronto for training, but suffered injuries in an automobile accident that summer, followed by being bedridden by the influenza in the fall, both of which kept him from active service. He returned to St. Thomas to run his family's onion farm. Early political career Hepburn After the war, Hepburn joined the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) helping to start its branch in Elgin County, but by the mid-1920s he switched to the Liberal Party. In the 1926 election, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a representative of Elgin West, and was overwhelmingly re-elected in the 1930 election. Later that year he became leader of the Liberal Party of Ontario. His support of farmers and free trade, and his former membership in the UFO allowed him to attract Harry Nixon's rump of UFO Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) into the Liberal Party (as Liberal-Progressives). This and the Great Depression led to the defeat of the unpopular Conservative premier George Stewart Henry in the 1934 provincial election. His stance against the prohibition of alcohol allowed him to break the Liberal Party from the militant prohibitionist stance that had helped reduce it to a rural, Protestant south western Ontario rump in the 1920s. Hepburn represented a type of agrarian democracy that detested Toryism and valued oratory. He once saw a pile of manure situated in a village square, and proceeded to jump on top of it to give a speech, apologizing to the crowd for speaking from a Tory platform. He also used the same line when standing on a manure spreader, only to have a heckler shout, \\"Well, wind 'er up Mitch, because she's never carried a bigger load!\\" at 10:00am On his death, the Toronto Star observed: Premier of Ontario Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn with Dionne quintuplets ca. 1934 Hepburn's premiership achieved international attention, which merited his appearance on Time magazine's cover in 1937. As premier, Hepburn undertook a number of measures which enhanced his reputation as the practitioner of a highly vigorous style. In a public show of austerity, he closed Chorley Park, the residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, auctioned off the chauffeur driven limousines used by the previous Conservative cabinet, and fired many civil servants. In order to improve the Province's welfare, he gave money to mining industries in Northern Ontario, and introduced compulsory milk pasteurization (in so doing, he has been credited with virtually wiping out bovine tuberculosis in the province). Breaking with the temperance stance of previous Liberal governments, Hepburn expanded the availability of liquor by allowing hotels to sell beer and wine. =Industrial labour reform= The Industrial Standards Act, which emulated the US National Industrial Recovery Act, was introduced in 1935 to set minimum wages and working conditions by industry and geographic area. It was described by then Minister of Labour David Croll as \\"the most controversial piece of legislation now on the Statute Books of the Province,\\" and it came about after federal efforts instituted under R.B. Bennett's \\"New Deal\\" were declared unconstitutional. =Guardianship of the Dionne Quintuplets= The government also made international news by making the Dionne quintuplets wards of the provincial crown in response to public outrage of plans by promoters to exploit the infants by putting them on display at the Chicago World's Fair. The Legislative Assembly passed legislation in that regard, subsequently replaced in 1944 (which was not repealed until 2006).Legislation Act, 2006, s. 98(3), as enacted by the =Tax collection= As Treasurer of Ontario, Hepburn adopted a more aggressive approach in the collection of succession duty on large estates, which resulted in millions of dollars in extra government revenues. He made no apologies for doing so, as he noted in a speech in 1938: One estate that was of particular focus in this campaign was that of the late John Rudolphus Booth, who had died in 1925. Although succession duties of $4.28 million ($ in current terms) were paid in 1927, Hepburn subsequently claimed more in 1937 and had the Legislative Assembly of Ontario pass the necessary legislation to overcome the legal obstacles. Booth's heirs eventually paid another $3 million ($ in current terms) in 1939. =Cancellation of Hydro contracts= As part of his drive to cut government spending, the Power Commission Act, 1935 was passed to cancel contracts that the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario had signed between 1926 and 1930 for delivery of electricity from power plants in Quebec, declaring them to be \\"void and unenforceable.\\" This move temporarily shut Ontario out of world bond markets. The Act was declared to be ultra vires by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1937 as being legislation in derogation of extraprovincial rights, (although later jurisprudence has suggested that the Court may have overreached in its rulings). Many such contracts were later renegotiated at lower volumes and prices. =Taking back the forests= Hepburn took an aggressive position with respect to timber licences in Northern Ontario that were being held by companies that would not (or could not) cut wood on them. In that regard, in 1936 the Forest Resources Regulation Act was passed that granted the government broad powers for mandating minimum production quotas, maximum limits in line with good forestry practice, reducing licensed acreages where they were in excess of requirements, and increasing stumpage fees on companies \\"operating or carrying on business in a manner detrimental to the public interest.\\" Great Lakes Paper saw its holdings reduced from to , and was assessed a $500,000 penalty ($ in current terms) for refusing to participate in a minimum price agreement set up by the Ontario and Quebec governments. In 1937, the Settlers' Pulpwood Protection Act was passed to govern the supply of pulpwood from private lands, together with fixing quotas and prices to be followed. The Crown Timber Act's provisions in effect since the time of Arthur Sturgis Hardy requiring logs to be manufactured as timber before being exported from the Province were relaxed by order in council in 1936, in order to create employment opportunities in the logging industry. When the Abitibi Power and Paper Company, in receivership since 1932, was ordered into liquidation in 1940, Hepburn appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the matter, in order to determine the best course of resolution. The Legislative Assembly imposed a moratorium on liquidation proceedings in 1941,, extended by and which was ultimately upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1943., setting aside . The appeal was facilitated by The Commission's recommended plan was accepted by all creditors, and it would emerge from receivership in 1946, one of the longest such receiverships in Canadian history. =Fight with the CIO= Although in later years Hepburn was to form a Liberal-Labour alliance with the Communist Party of Canada , yet as Premier he was opposed to unions and refused to let the CIO form unions in Ontario. On April 8, 1937, the CIO-backed General Motors plant in Oshawa went on strike, demanding 8-hour workdays, a seniority system, and recognition of their CIO-affiliated United Auto Workers union. The strikers were also supported by the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, Canada's left-wing party at the time. Hepburn, at the time professing a deep concern about radicals among auto workers and supported by the owners of the plant and General Motors, organized a volunteer police force to help him put down the strike when Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King refused to send the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. This force was somewhat derisively known as \\"Hepburn's Hussars,\\" or the \\"Sons of Mitches\\". Cabinet ministers who disagreed with Hepburn over the issue were forced to resign. However, the strike held out, and Hepburn capitulated on April 23, 1937. =Conflict with Mackenzie King= Mackenzie King and Hepburn in Hepburn's office (1934) Hepburn remained a bitter opponent of Mackenzie King after the strike, and harshly criticized King's war effort in 1940 after the outbreak of World War II introducing a resolution into the Ontario legislature which was passed 44 to 10, that accused the federal government of mishandling the war effort. The Conservative opposition voted unanimously for the resolution but the motion split the governing Liberals with nine members of Hepburn's caucus voting against and others leaving the chamber before the vote. Hepburn thought Canada should be doing more to support the war, and helped organize the military districts in Ontario, encouraging men to volunteer when Mackenzie King chose not to introduce conscription. Hepburn supported Mackenzie King's opponent, Arthur Meighen, in a by-election in Toronto in 1942, notwithstanding Hepburn's later alliance with the Communist Party of Canada. Meighen's unusual source of support did not bring him to success, as he lost the by-election because the Liberals did not run a candidate and the prime minister ordered party resources to be sent to the CCF candidate. However, King was politically much stronger than Hepburn and federal Liberal supporters, as well as those who thought an erratically driven rift between the provincial and federal parties was suicidal, called for him to step down. Hepburn ultimately resigned as Premier in October 1942, but continued to serve as Treasurer of Ontario and party leader until the following year. Aftermath Although Gordon Daniel Conant had become Premier of the province, many people continued to think that was in name only. Senior cabinet ministers such as Provincial Secretary Harry Nixon resigned, demanding a leadership convention. Due to pressure from both provincial and federal Liberals, one was held in May 1943. Hepburn finally tendered his resignation as leader (by telegram), and Nixon was elected the new party leader, and was thus appointed as Premier. The Liberals under Nixon were routed soon after in the 1943 Ontario election, falling to third party status behind the Progressive Conservatives led by George Drew, and the Co- operative Commonwealth Federation led by Ted Jolliffe. Hepburn himself was re- elected in his riding as an Independent Liberal while calling for a Liberal- Conservative coalition against the burgeoning CCF. The Liberal caucus unanimously asked Hepburn to resume the party's leadership in 1944. Now branding Drew's Conservatives as the greatest menace to Canada, he reversed his earlier criticism of Mackenzie King's war effort and campaigned for Liberal candidate General Andrew McNaughton in a 1945 federal by-election. Provincially, his earlier, vehement doubts about radicals among auto workers now muted, Hepburn formed a Liberal-Labour alliance with the Communist Party of Canada (at the time known as the Labor-Progressive Party) for the 1945 Ontario election, but lost his own seat in the Legislature. Hepburn retired to his farm in St. Thomas, where he died of a heart attack in 1953.https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/64013551/ His funeral was attended by five former premiers, and Rev. Harry Scott Rodney observed in his eulogy: Impact Hepburn was the first Liberal to become Premier since George William Ross, and was the last Liberal Premier to win two successive majority terms until Dalton McGuinty. In 2008 he had a school named after him only miles away from his family's farm Bannockburn Farms. It was officially opened in January 2009. References Further reading  External links  * Mitchell F.

A temporary connection is made to the battery of another vehicle, or to some other external power source. The external supply of electricity recharges the disabled vehicle's battery and provides some of the power needed to crank the engine. Once the vehicle has been started, its normal charging system will recharge, so the auxiliary source can be removed. If the vehicle charging system is functional, normal operation of the vehicle will restore the charge of the battery. Motorists may carry jumper cables in case of accidental discharge of the vehicle battery (for example, by headlights or ignition switch left on while the engine is not running). Safe procedures for connecting and disconnecting cables are given in the vehicle manual. Jumper cables (1) to (4) is a safe sequence to connect jumper cables from the dead battery on the left to the good battery on the right. If (2) were connected before (1) and the loose end accidentally touches bare metal on its car, the good battery is shorted; shorting the dead battery is less risky. (4) is connected to bare metal away from the battery to keep any sparking on circuit completion away from hydrogen potentially released by the battery. Cables are disconnected in reverse order. Jumper cable connected to positive post Jumper cables, also known as booster cables or jump leads, are a pair of insulated wires of sufficient capacity with alligator clips at each end to interconnect the disabled equipment/vehicle with an auxiliary source, such as another vehicle or equipment with the same system voltage or to another battery. The alligator clips may be covered in insulation to prevent inadvertent shorting. Clips may be made of copper or steel. Alligator clips are generally marked by black (‚àí) and red (+) to indicate the polarity. Limitations Operation of a lead-acid battery may, in case of overcharge, produce flammable hydrogen gas by electrolysis of water inside the battery. Jump start procedures are usually found in the vehicle owner's manual. The recommended sequence of connections is intended to reduce the chance of accidentally shorting the good battery or igniting hydrogen gas. Owner's manuals will show the preferred locations for connection of jumper cables; for example, some vehicles have the battery mounted under a seat, or may have a jumper terminal in the engine compartment. Jumper cables should not be used to interconnect between different voltage systems. Connecting 6V and 12V systems together may cause damage. If the dead battery is physically damaged, has a low electrolyte level, is decayed or frozen, a jump start will not repair the battery. A vehicle with a frozen battery should not be jump started, as the battery may explode. Other methods  A hand-portable battery, equipped with attached cables and charger, can be used similarly to another vehicle's battery. A self-contained jump box contains a battery and connects directly to the battery of the engine that needs a boost. Portable boosters may automatically sense the battery's polarity prior to sending power to the vehicle, eliminating the damage that can result from reversing the connection.Duracell jumpstart 17a There are various portable jump starters that are multi-functional and can be used to charge other electronic devices as well. =Cigarette lighter outlet= An alternative to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlets) of two vehicles. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, the amount of current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for cranking, as the engine cranking motor current draw will greatly exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Many vehicles turn off the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the 'accessory' or 'on' position, after which the cigarette lighter outlet and battery become electrically connected. =Battery charger= Motorists and service garages often have portable battery chargers operated from AC power. Very small \\"trickle\\" chargers are intended only to maintain a charge on a parked or stored vehicle, but larger chargers can put enough charge into a battery to allow a start within a few minutes. Battery chargers may be strictly manual, or may include controls for time and charging voltage. Battery chargers that apply high voltage (for example, more than 14.4 volts on a 12 volt nominal system) will result in emission of hydrogen gas from the battery, which may damage it or create an explosion risk. A battery may be recharged without removal from the vehicle, although in a typical roadside situation no convenient source of power may be nearby. = Battery booster and jump starter = AC charger with boost feature Jump starter with lithium battery Some AC battery chargers have a boost, engine start, or engine assist feature. Despite being able to assist in jump starting a dead vehicle battery, these types of battery chargers perform their task over a longer period of time, rather than an instantaneous boost. Boosting a dead battery through a battery charger can take anywhere from five to twenty minutes depending on the depth-of-discharge (DOD), health of the vehicle battery, and type of engine (engine displacement). AC power is not usually available for a roadside boost. Jump starters are portable battery devices that allow for jump starting of vehicles. These devices operate similar to jumper cables but do not require an additional vehicle to provide the power needed to boost the dead vehicle battery. Jump starters come in various sizes (typically rated in Amps). Most jump starters on the market today use lead-acid batteries and claim 300‚àí‚Å†1700 amp ratings. The main disadvantage of lead-acid jump starters is weight, size and battery chemistry. Lead-acid jump starters can be extremely heavy and large, making them less than convenient when transporting between vehicles. Lead-acid batteries may self-discharge if they develop a condition called sulfating, which permanently decreases battery capacity. It is entirely possible to destroy a new lead-acid battery within months, requiring a replacement. Jump starters using lithium-ion batteries began appearing in the market around 2013. Most lithium jump starter brands use a high discharge lithium polymer or lithium-ion battery. Lithium jump starters are compact and lightweight compared to their lead-acid equivalents. =Push starting= A vehicle with a manual transmission may be push started. This requires caution while pushing the vehicle and may require the assistance of several persons or another vehicle. If the vehicle battery cannot provide power to the ignition system, push starting may be ineffective. Most vehicles with automatic transmissions cannot be started this way because the hydraulic torque converter in the transmission will not allow the engine to be driven by the wheels. = Military vehicles = Slave receptacle on an M1009 CUCV Generally referred to as \\"slave starting\\" in military parlance, the jump starting procedure has been simplified for military vehicles. Tactical vehicles used by NATO militaries possess 24-volt electrical systems and, in accordance with STANAG 4074, have standard slave receptacles for easy connection. A slave cable is plugged into the receptacle on each vehicle, and the dead vehicle is started with the live vehicle's engine running. Hazards Motorists can be severely injured by a battery explosion. In the United States in 1994, a research note by the National Highway Traffic Safety Association estimated that about 442 persons were injured by exploding batteries while attempting a jump-start. The effects of accidentally reversing the cables will depend on the charge state of the depleted vehicle and the current carrying capacity of the cables. A partially depleted battery will result in more power flow through the reversed cables than if the battery were simply dead. Jumper cables typically do not have overload protection, so when reversed they may begin to function as resistive heaters and become hot enough that the wire insulation begins to melt. If this continues without the problem being detected, the insulation may melt until the wires inside make contact, resulting in an unfused direct short of the supply battery. A fully depleted battery will not draw more power if the cables are reversed, but reverse- charging a dead battery can damage its chemistry so that it loses charge capacity, and reverse voltage applied to the vehicle electronics may also damage them, resulting in expensive repairs.  Voltage problem Heavy vehicles such as large trucks, excavation equipment, or vehicles with diesel engines may use 24-volt electrical systems. Trucks usually have a 24 V supply using two 12 V automotive batteries in series: it is therefore possible to jump-start a vehicle with a 12 V electrical system using only one of the two batteries. Vintage cars may have 6-volt electrical systems, or may connect the positive terminal of the battery to the chassis. The methods intended for boosting 12-volt, negative-ground vehicles cannot be used in such cases. Hybrid vehicles may have a very small 12 volt battery system unsuitable for sourcing the large amount of current required to boost a conventional vehicle. However, as the 12-volt system of a hybrid vehicle is only required to start up the control system of the vehicle, a very small portable battery may successfully boost a hybrid that has accidentally discharged its 12-volt system; the main propulsion battery is unlikely to also have been discharged.

AAA is a privately held not-for-profit national member association and service organization with over 60 million members in the United States and Canada. AAA provides services to its members, including roadside assistance and others. Its national headquarters are in Heathrow, Florida. History The American Automobile Association (the \\"AAA\\" or \\"Triple-A\\") was founded on March 4, 1902, in Chicago, Illinois, when in response to a lack of roads and highways suitable for automobiles, nine motor clubs with a total of 1,500 members banded together to form the Triple-A. Those individual motor clubs included the Chicago Automobile Club, Automobile Club of America, Automobile Club of New Jersey, and others. The Automobile Club of Buffalo joined in 1903.

In 1904, the AAA merged with the very first American automobile organization, the American Motor League, under the direction of the first chairman, Augustus Post.Motor Age (magazine), Volume 5, 1904, p. 109.\\"Colonel Post Dies, Auto, Air Pioneer\\". The New York Times. October 5, 1952. Retrieved June 14, 2017. The first AAA road maps were published in 1905. AAA began printing hotel guides in 1917. The Triple-A began its School Safety Patrol Program in 1920, the first of the association's driver safety programs, which provided local schools with materials, including badges and ID cards to train and organize students into a patrol force. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, which conducts studies on motorist safety, was established as a separate entity in 1947. AAA created an organization called the Racing Board, and later known as the Contest Board, in 1902 to officiate the Vanderbilt Cup international automobile race in Long Island, New York. The Racing Board sanctioned the Indianapolis 500 and awarded national racing championships in 1905, 1916, 1920‚Äì1941, and 1946‚Äì1955. After the 1955 Le Mans disaster, AAA decided that auto racing distracted from its primary goals, and the United States Automobile Club was formed to take over the race sanctioning/officiating. In 2005, AAA re-entered racing as a sponsor of ISC- owned tracks. In 2006, AAA's foray into racing expanded when it made a three- year commitment to sponsor Roush Racing's number 6 car on the NASCAR Nextel Circuit. AAA 50th Anniversary US stamp, issued in 1952, promotes the School Safety Patrol. In 1935, AAA published Sportsmanlike Driving, the first course outline for high school teachers. In 1936, AAA published the first driver education curriculum for use in high schools (also titled Sportsmanlike Driving, now known as Responsible Driving). AAA has updated its driver training courses throughout the years and many clubs currently offer their own driving schools, or work with other companies to provide AAA‚Äôs driving curriculum. Knowing that vehicles pose a hazard to pedestrians, in 1936 AAA began a pedestrian safety program with a grant from the Automotive Safety Foundation. AAA went on to commission and publish (1938) an extensive study of pedestrian safety for the purpose of reducing pedestrian fatalities and injuries. AAA‚Äôs Pedestrian Protection Program began in 1937 and focuses national attention on pedestrian safety needs by recognizing cities, counties and states that have demonstrated successful pedestrian safety programs. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety was established as a separate entity in 1947, and continues to conduct research related to traffic and pedestrian safety. AAA has also provided services to the U.S. government in times of war. During the 1940s, AAA offered its services to the Advisory Commission of the Council of National Defense in anticipation of becoming involved in World War II. AAA President Thomas P. Henry was appointed consultant in the transportation unit of the Defense Council, and AAA pledged resources, including highway information, to national defense planning efforts as it had during World War I. Reductions in manufacturing because of the war increased the need for conservation in automobiles and their related products. AAA's efforts at conservation included supporting the manufacture of synthetic rubber in anticipation of a war-related tire/rubber shortage, urging motorists to reduce their driving speed to conserve fuel (1942); and backing a scrap rubber campaign (1942). In 1944, AAA‚Äôs Keep 'em Rolling campaign sponsored a cross-country tour featuring cars equipped with synthetic tires. The tour demonstrated the reliability of tires made with synthetic rubber. In doing its part to assist in the war effort, AAA placed its mapping facilities at the disposal of the Army department; conducted motor pool driver education (1943); secured an order from the War Production Board that stopped the sale of certain anti-freeze solutions harmful to motors (1943); launched a campaign to alleviate a growing shortage of auto mechanics (1943); monitored tire and gasoline rationing (1943); and established, in cooperation with the Red Cross and military hospitals, a driver training program for veterans with artificial limbs (1944). AAA also assisted in the development of a manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and their operation during wartime (1942). The end of the war brought new needs for motorists and AAA assisted by releasing the film \\"Traffic Jam Ahead\\", which outlined a practical program for postwar traffic safety, and publishing Post-war Travel Trends as a public service. In 1946, AAA launched a campaign called \\"Take It Easy\\", which was designed to reduce traffic fatalities. Subsequently, fatalities dropped 20 percent below the pre- war figure. In the 1960s, AAA helped draft the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, setting safety standards for automobiles, tires, and equipment. AAA also helped draft the Highway Safety Act, specifying standards for motor vehicle inspection and registration, motorcycle safety, driver education, driver licensing, traffic courts, highway design, construction, maintenance, and traffic control devices. During the oil crisis of the 1970s, the AAA Fuel Gauge Report was created to assist motorists in finding gas stations that had fuel and were open. AAA also began its Gas Watchers program with the endorsement of President Gerald Ford. The Gas Watchers Guide continues to be published to provide simple steps motorists can take to conserve gasoline in their daily driving. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed AAA President James B. Creal to the National Alcohol Fuels Commission. Creal also chaired a task force on gas rationing and was appointed to President Carter‚Äôs National Council on Energy Efficiency. AAA representatives serving on President Carter's Alcohol Fuels Commission were requested to sign the Energy Securities Act of 1980. In addition, Creal served on the Industries Advisory Board of Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus in the early 1980s. In the 1980s, AAA's mapping services received significant recognition when scenic highways were identified on AAA's sheet maps for the first time. AAA maps were used in the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition where more than 13,000 full-color AAA map images were provided on an optical laser disc for demonstration of an in-car navigation device in the Chrysler Pavilion. And in 1985 the AAA North American Road Atlas was sold at retail for the first time and made the New York Times best-seller paperback list within six weeks. AAA experimented in the 1980s with the On-line Touring Information System (OTIS), which eventually was combined with other automated services under the name AAA Travel Match. The self-service terminal worked like an ATM, with rotating menus and touch-control screens that allowed users to obtain local travel information. In Congressional hearings held in 1983 on the proposed Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act, the Michigan AAA affiliate (then known as Automobile Club of Michigan) presented testimony regarding the rapid growth in average per-vehicle costs of car theft, in support of stamping the vehicle identification number on individual car parts as a deterrent to such theft. The AAA School Safety Patrol Program and Lifesaving Medal Award won the Presidential Citation Award for Private Sector Initiatives which honors outstanding volunteer projects in 1985. A year later, on February 4, 1986, President Ronald Reagan honored a recipient of AAA's School Safety Patrol Lifesaving Medal in his State of the Union Address. In 1988, AAA focused its legislative efforts on the Truck & Bus Safety Regulatory Reform Act requiring interstate drivers and equipment to meet federal safety regulations. The act was signed into law in November 1988. AAA joined government and private-sector companies‚Äîthe Federal Highway Administration, Avis, General Motors and the Florida Department of Transportation‚Äîin 1990 for the Smart Car experiment, also known as the TravTek Project. This test of a computerized in-car navigation and travel information system demonstrated consumer acceptance of telematics technology that would make driving easier and reduce traffic congestion. A new driver's education program, \\"Teaching Teens to Drive\\", was introduced by AAA in 1996 to focus on parent involvement in teen driving education. A year later, in 1997, AAA launched Licensed to Learn, a campaign to increase awareness of the need for Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) laws in every state. At the outset of the campaign only eight states had enacted GDL laws. Today, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of GDL legislation. Research in the 1990s led AAA to pursue another issue of importance to US motorists: a transportation crisis resulting from infrastructure that had been under-funded for many years. The Crisis Ahead: America's Aging Highways and Airways research led to AAA helping to shape two pieces of landmark legislation: the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) in 1998 and the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21) in 2000. Both laws embrace the principle that user fees charged to motorists and air travelers should be fully invested in improving and modernizing the nation's surface and air transportation infrastructures. Because of its work in traffic safety AAA was cited in 1998 as the Clinton Administration's number one traffic safety partner by U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. And in 2000, NHTSA presented AAA with a public service award in appreciation of AAA's leadership in the Child Passenger Safety Certification Program, which teaches how to properly install infant/child safety seats, and for its continuing efforts in Graduated Driver Licensing. Skyrocketing gas prices led AAA to testify before three Congressional committees regarding increased gasoline prices in 2000, and to lobby to prevent Congress from repealing parts of the federal gasoline tax, which would have reduced Highway Trust Fund revenue without guaranteeing consumers any relief from high gas prices. Participating in the U.S. Department of Transportation secretary's Aviation Summit, AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet communicated AAA's stand on the aviation crisis saying that consistent underfunding of the nation‚Äôs air transportation infrastructure had led to the crisis and offering a four-point plan to help turn it around. Also that year, AAA testified before Congress and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, on proposed hours-of-service regulations for commercial truck drivers and launched Share With Care, a public education campaign on safely sharing the road with trucks. In the early 2000s (decade), AAA‚Äôs focus on helping seniors stay mobile longer and more safely led to an appointment to the White House Conference on Aging. AAA promoted solutions such as senior- friendly road design, screening tools, education for seniors and their families, and supplemental transportation. Reader's Digest highlighted AAA's transportation safety agenda by focusing on the importance of road safety improvements, particularly for seniors. To help seniors become safer drivers or to recognize signs that it‚Äôs time to stop driving, AAA developed Roadwise Review, a computer-based screening tool enabling older drivers to identify and address physiological changes that could affect driving. =Discrimination= During the Jim Crow era, AAA actively discriminated against African Americans, who could not join the association. Alternatives to AAA guides, such as The Negro Motorist Green Book, were written. Current operations AAA's office in Walnut Creek, California A typical AAA Car Care Plus center Members belong to one of 42 individual clubs (see List of AAA regional clubs), and the clubs in turn own AAA. The number of local clubs has decreased over time through consolidation; as late as the 1970s the membership roster included dozens of clubs that each served a single county, particularly in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The member clubs have arranged a reciprocal service system so that members of any participating club are able to receive member services from any other affiliate club. Member dues finance all club services as well as the operations of the national organization. The vast majority of AAA clubs have \\"AAA\\" as part of their name, although the two largest AAA clubs by membership do not: the Automobile Club of Southern California and Auto Club Group. From the standpoint of the consumer, AAA clubs primarily provide emergency road services to its members. These services, which include towing, lockouts, winching, tire changes, automotive first aid, battery replacement, and others, are handled by private local towing companies contracted by a state AAA club. AAA sells roadside assistance for a variety of motor vehicles, including motorcycles. In some areas, AAA also offers bicycle roadside assistance. Many AAA clubs have an automotive fleet division serving large metro areas, while private towing companies cover the surplus call volume by area. Recently, certain clubs have implemented an \\"on the go\\" diagnostic/installation automotive battery program. =Rating System= Clubs also distribute road maps (including customized map guides for specific journeys) and travel publications (TourBook guides), and rate restaurants and hotels according to a \\"diamond\\" scale (one to five). The AAA Diamond Program includes over 60,000 properties in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, it is composed of nearly 27,000 hotels and more than 30,000 restaurants.https://media.acg.aaa.com/aaa-announces-2020-four-and-five- diamond-awards.htm The best hotels and restaurants according to AAA's criteria receive the Five Diamond Award. Many offices sell automobile liability insurance, provide travel agency, auto-registration and notary services. Maps, TourBook guides, and travel agent services are generally free to members. AAA also offers member discounts through its \\"AAA Discounts & Rewards\\" program. TripTik is AAA's travel planning guide and online travel planner. The print version includes road maps and other travel information, such as gas prices. AAA is authorized by the U.S. Department of State to issue International Driving Permits in the United States, along with the National Automobile Club. International affiliates The AAA has reciprocal arrangements with a range of international affiliates. In general, members of affiliates are offered the same benefits as members of the AAA while traveling in the United States, while AAA members are offered equivalent benefits while traveling in the territory of the affiliate. International affiliates include: * ARC Europe, encompassing the leading European clubs, including the Automobile Association (United Kingdom), ANWB (Netherlands), ADAC (Germany), ACI (Italy), TCS (Switzerland), TCB (Belgium), √ñAMTC (Austria) and RACE (Spain) below. * The Royal Dutch Touring Club (ANWB) in the Netherlands * The Canadian Automobile Association in Canada (TourBooks guides and maps of Canadian places are published by AAA, and are distributed by AAA and CAA clubs using both AAA and CAA logos). An updated listing of International Affiliates can be found on AAA's Exchange website. AAA and motorist rights The AAA has weighed in over the years on numerous issues that affect motorists. The AAA is known for occasional high-profile motorist advisories of traffic enforcement, such as when it rented a billboard to warn motorists of the speed trap town of Lawtey, Florida. It also is a supporter of the Motor Vehicle Owners' Right to Repair Act, first introduced in 2001 but which has not become law. Additionally, the AAA supported measures that tax motorists‚Äîwith the goal of strengthening infrastructure and highway maintenance‚Äîas well as supported measures that curtail motorists' legal rights: * Virginia's now-repealed traffic citation tax because of its revenue generation potential. * The federal 55 mph (90 km/h) speed limit. * Opposing a 70 mph (115 km/h) speed limit on Illinois rural freeways even though the roads can safely accommodate that speed. * Supporting red light cameras. * Lobbied in favor of speed cameras in Maryland in 2002, several years before they were actually authorized. Provisionally supporting the expansion of speed cameras in Maryland in 2009, and opposing the repeal of speed cameras in Maryland in 2013. * Lobbied in favor of authorizing speed cameras in Indiana. * Supporting an increase in the federal gas tax, and supporting gas tax increases at the state level such as in Virginia in 2012. * Opposing Illinois increasing its rural speed limit from 65 to 70 mph (105‚Äì115 km/h). * Proposing the creation of a Vehicle miles traveled tax in Idaho * Opposing the raising of tolls on bridges and tunnels in the New York Metropolitan Area.(disable javascript) AAA and the environment In 2001, AAA launched its Great Battery Roundup to encourage motorists to recycle old automobile batteries, tires and various types of automotive fluids. Since then more than 4 million batteries have been recycled through that program and the mobile battery service. Typically holding events around Earth Day, AAA clubs often team up with other environmental organization such as the EPA and the Nature Conservancy to expand these recycling efforts. In 2006, AAA worked with the EPA to improve the fuel economy information provided to new car buyers by vehicle manufacturers. Using several different types of tests, AAA recreated real-world driving conditions to illustrate the difference in fuel economy, and the EPA incorporated AAA‚Äôs testing into their new procedures. The more accurate testing resulted in a reduction of miles per gallon claims between 5 and 25 percent, beginning with 2008 model year vehicles. As fuel prices rise, consumers often see increased marketing of fuel additives as a way to boost fuel economy. AAA has tested many of these products and has never found one that provides significant savings for consumers. AAA has warned consumers repeatedly against products that make such claims and encourages motorists to develop instead fuel-conserving driving habits, such as reducing the weight of the vehicle by removing unnecessary objects from the trunk, instituting smooth stops and starts, and reducing their speed. It is generally understood that the benefits of fuel conservation for consumers include financial savings, improved road safety and a healthier environment. To assist motorists in becoming more conscious about saving fuel, AAA published its first Gas Watcher‚Äôs Guide in the 1970s during the oil crisis. The annual guide provides information on a variety of factors that affect fuel economy, such as modifying driving behavior, keeping a vehicle well maintained, choosing the proper fuel, and choosing the most fuel-efficient vehicle for a family‚Äôs needs. Over the years, AAA has encouraged consumers to use public transportation by including these transportation options in its travel guidebooks. AAA has also called on government to invest adequately in a multi- modal transportation system that is widely accessible and affordable. In comments to the National Journal, AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet said that funding for high-speed rail from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a ‚Äúdrop in the bucket‚Äù of what is needed, and that those funds would be well spent if, going forward, additional sources of investment could be identified. In addition to encouraging fuel efficiency and conservation, AAA and other organizations initiated National Car Care Month during the 1980s to publicize the fact that poorly maintained vehicles contribute to excessive energy consumption and air pollution. AAA works in cooperation with businesses, civic groups, the government and the media in promoting and coordinating this annual event, held each October. In 1992, AAA launched a popular ecotourism promotion called Freedom's Way. With support from agencies such as the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and others, AAA produced travel tips and public service messages encouraging travelers to help protect America's scenic areas and respect the environment. Topics included reducing congestion and pollution, conserving energy, disposing of litter and enjoying wildlife at a distance. The prevailing theme was that heavy use or abuse of a site damages the quality of the experience for everyone and sometimes even results in the closure of parks and recreation areas. The message was simple but effective. In 2016, AAA introduced a new website focused on hybrid and electric vehicles, and offers mobile charging aid for stranded EVs, similar to fuel-starved piston cars. AAA clubs have also been a part of the organization‚Äôs century- long environmental advocacy efforts including: * In 1919, alarmed by rapid destruction of California‚Äôs giant redwood trees at the hands of commercial loggers, AAA's California State Automobile Association launched a multiyear publicity and lobbying campaign. Working with the Save the Redwoods League, CSAA continued promoting awareness and, in 1927, a bill creating a state park system that protected redwoods became law. * AAA Washington works with the state's Department of Ecology to assist with programs that help minimize the impact of automobile emissions, and the club's fleet services operations were named a county EnviroStar business in recognition of environment-friendly practices. * Since 1991, the California State Automobile Association and Bay Area Air Quality Management District have co-sponsored a Spare the Air campaign designed to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. CSAA also sponsors the AAA Outdoor Corps, a group of employee volunteers who clean beaches, clear park trails and plant trees in wetlands. * AAA Michigan sponsors Detroit Clean Sweep, an ongoing program involving club employees who help promote a cleaner environment through volunteer activities such as collecting litter. In addition, the club's Freeway Courtesy Patrol vans cruise local roadways to assist motorists and help reduce congestion. * AAA Mid- Atlantic was lead sponsor of a U.S. Department of Transportation Livable Communities workshop in Philadelphia that brought together bicycle, pedestrian, transit and safety groups regarding safe and efficient travel. In honor of Earth Day, AAA Mid-Atlantic planted trees in America's National Forests, literally, on behalf of their members who took advantage of AAA Mid- Atlantic's Mobile Battery Service program. For every member who called to have a new car battery installed and the old battery recycled, a tree was planted in the national forest. The tree plantings were made possible through the Arbor Day Foundation, a non-profit conservation and education organization. * AAA Oregon/Idaho is closely associated with Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism, and provides TripTik-style guides for annual beach clean-ups and habitat mitigation projects. * AAA Lancaster County earned an Outstanding Partner Award from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for its Ozone Action Program. The club also belongs to an advisory committee that promotes multiple modes of transportation systems that conform to federal air quality standards. * The Auto Club of Southern California helped establish the Southern California Rideshare program. The club has supported dozens of transit projects that provide an appropriate benefit for their expense, including commuter transit services in the Inland Empire. =Criticism= Despite its work promoting environmental responsibility in the automotive and transportation arenas, AAA's lobbying positions have sometimes been perceived to be hostile to mass transit and environmental interests. In 2006, the Automobile Club of Southern California worked against Prop. 87. The proposition would have established a \\"$4 billion program to reduce petroleum consumption (in California) by 25 percent, with research and production incentives for alternative energy, alternative energy vehicles, energy efficient technologies, and for education and training.\\" Daniel Becker, director of Sierra Club's global warming and energy program, described AAA as \\"a lobbyist for more roads, more pollution, and more gas guzzling.\\" He observed that among other lobbying activities, AAA issued a press release critical of the Clean Air Act, stating that it would \\"threaten the personal mobility of millions of Americans and jeopardize needed funds for new highway construction and safety improvements.\\" \\"AAA spokespeople have criticized open- space measures and opposed U.S. EPA restrictions on smog, soot, and tailpipe emissions.\\" \\"The club spent years battling stricter vehicle-emissions standards in Maryland, whose air, because of emissions and pollution from states upwind, is among the nation's worst.\\" , AAA continues to lobby against public transportation projects.Friedman, Gordon R. (June 20, 2017) Oregon highway funding bill thrown into peril as deadline looms The Oregonian =Response= While AAA's work on behalf of motorists and travelers seems at odds sometimes with its environmental stance, awareness of the underlying issues has led to greater understanding. For instance, in 2009, AAA asked the EPA not to increase the allowable ethanol content in gasoline from 10 percent to 15 percent, citing several concerns affecting vehicle emissions, engine performance, system component damage, and vehicle warranty agreements, among others. AAA said that more research needed to be done on the potential harmful effects prior to increasing the ethanol content in fuel. In another instance, AAA supported the overall goal of the Clean Air Act, but objected to several specific provisions in the legislation, requesting clarification of the proposed state inspection and maintenance program provision and asking that the implementation guidelines be fully evaluated prior to enactment. According to a Washington Times article, which referred to research by Energy & Environment Analysis Inc., tightening federal emissions standards had led to a role reversal for the automobile, making it less of a contributor to smog. Instead, stationary emission sources such as factories, as well as heavy and utility vehicles were more of a threat to air quality and would be appropriate targets in the battle against smog. \\"However, by primarily emphasizing vehicle regulations in the 1970s and ignoring gasoline regulations EPA actually caused fuels to become dirtier, effectively undermining a significant portion of any gains achieved through the tighter control of vehicles.\\" And more recently, although AAA supports the manufacture and use of hybrid vehicles, research by the British Columbia Automobile Association in 2010 shows that they do not result in significant financial savings for consumers, although they are often marketed that way. In response to these concerns, several competing organizations have emerged, including Better World Club. These organizations generally provide similar roadside assistance, trip planning and other services, in an environmentally friendly manner. This includes discounts for fuel-efficient vehicles and donations to environmental organizations. Also as a response to the critics, the California State Automobile Association, a branch of AAA, set up a booth at the San Francisco International Auto Show to raise awareness regarding plug-in hybrid vehicles.

Since the start of the twentieth century, the role of the car has become highly important though controversial. It is used throughout the world and has become the most popular mode of transport in the more developed countries. In developing countries, the effects of the car on society are not as visible, however they are significant. The development of the car built upon the transport sector first started by railways. This has introduced sweeping changes in employment patterns, social interactions, infrastructure and the distribution of goods. Nonetheless the positive effects on access to remote places and mobility, comfort provided by the automobile, allowing people to geographically increase their social and economic interactions, the negative effects of the car on everyday life are not negligible. Although the introduction of the mass-produced car represented a revolution in industry and convenience, creating job demand and tax revenue, the high motorisation rates also brought severe consequences to the society and to the environment. The modern negative consequences of heavy automotive use include the use of non- renewable fuels, a dramatic increase in the rate of accidental death, the disconnection of local community, the decrease of local economy, the rise in obesity and cardiovascular diseases, the emission of air and noise pollution, the emission of greenhouse gases, generation of urban sprawl and traffic, segregation of pedestrians and other active mobility means of transport, decrease in the railway network, urban decay and the high cost per unit- distance on which the car paradigm is based.  History  1831 cartoon warning about road hazards of the future. In the early 20th century, cars entered mass production. The United States produced 45,000 cars in 1907, but 28 years later, in 1935, that had increased nearly 90-fold to 3,971,000. The increase in production required a large new workforce. In 1913, 13,623 people worked for the Ford Motor Company, and by 1915 that had increased to 18,028. Bradford DeLong, author of The Roaring Twenties, noted that \\"Many more lined up outside the Ford factory for chances to work at what appeared to them to be, and (for those who did not mind the pace of the assembly line much) was an incredible boondoggle of a job.\\" There was a surge in the need for workers at big, new high-technology companies such as Ford. Employment increased greatly. Sacrifices to the Modern Moloch, a 1922 cartoon published in The New York Times, criticizing the apparent acceptance by society of increasing automobile-related fatalities. When the motor age arrived in western countries at the beginning of the 20th century, many conservative intellectuals opposed the increase in motor vehicles on the roads. Those increases removed space for pedestrians, made walking more dangerous, and brought a tremendous increase in pedestrian deaths caused by car collisions. W.S. Gilbert, the famous British librettist, wrote to The Times on 3 June 1903: Ten years later, Alfred Godley wrote a more elaborate protest, \\"The Motor Bus\\", a poem which cleverly combined a lesson in Latin grammar with an expression of distaste for the new form of motor transport. Access and convenience Convenience store in a rest area serving New Jersey Turnpike users. Worldwide, the car has allowed easier access to remote places. However, average journey times to regularly visited places have increased in large cities, as a result of widespread car adoption and urban sprawl, as well as the decommissioning of older tram systems. This is due to traffic congestion and the increased distances between home and work brought about by urban sprawl. Examples of car access issues in underdeveloped countries are for example the paving of Mexican Federal Highway 1 through Baja California, completing the connection of Cabo San Lucas to California. In Madagascar, another example, about 30% of the population does not have access to reliable all-weather roads and in China, 184 towns and 54,000 villages have no motor road (or roads at all). Certain developments in retail are partially due to car use, such as supermarket growth, drive-thru fast food purchasing, and gasoline station grocery shopping as well.  Economic changes  = Employment and consumption habits = High signs attract the attention of drivers on the adjacent freeway. A street without a sidewalk, where the pedestrian must walk on the road pavement. The development of the car has contributed to changes in employment distribution, shopping patterns, social interactions, manufacturing priorities and city planning; increasing use of cars has reduced the roles of walking, horses and railroads. In addition to money for roadway construction, car use was also encouraged in many places through new zoning laws that required any new business to construct a certain amount of parking based on the size and type of facility. The effect was to create many free parking spaces, and business places further back from the road. In aggregate, this led to less dense settlements and made a carless lifestyle increasingly unattractive. Retail parks attract revenue away from high streets and town centres. Many new shopping centers and suburbs did not install sidewalks, making pedestrian access dangerous. This had the effect of encouraging people to drive, even for short trips that might have been walkable, thus increasing and solidifying American auto-dependency. As a result of this change, employment opportunities for people who were not wealthy enough to own a car and for people who could not drive, due to age or physical disabilities, became severely limited. = Economic growth = Motorisation rateMotorisation Rate; Cars per 1000 inhabitants in Europe, Eurostat vs. Economic growthEconomic Growth, Real GDP growth rate - volume, Percentage change on previous year, Eurostat. in European countries whose population is greater than 1 million inhabitants. Source: Eurostat. In countries with major car manufacturers, such as USA or Germany, a certain degree of car dependency might be positive for the economy at a macroeconomic level, since it demands automobile production, therefore resulting also in job demand and tax revenue. These economic conditions were particularly valid during the 1920s when the number of automobiles, worldwide, had a substantial annual average increase, but also during the post‚ÄìWorld War II economic expansion. Notwithstanding the growing effects provided by the automobile on the economy of some countries, several other auto-dependent countries, deprived from automobile industry and oil resources, have to allocate substantial economic assets, to satisfy its mobility policies, affecting then their commercial balance. This situation is broadly valid in the majority of the European countries, since, disregarding some few exceptions such as Norway, Europe is largely dependent on imports for its fossil fuels. Furthermore, just few European countries, such as Germany or France, have car manufacturers productive enough to satisfy their country's internal demand for cars. All these factors related to high motorisation rates, affect therefore the economic growth in the majority of the European countries. = Employment in the automotive industry = As of 2009 the U.S. motor vehicle manufacturing industry employed 880,000 workers, or approximately 6.6% of the U.S. manufacturing workforce. Traffic Cycling steadily became more important in Europe over the first half of the twentieth century, but it dropped off dramatically in the United States between 1900 and 1910. Automobiles became the dominant means of transportation. Over the 1920s, bicycles gradually became considered children's toys, and by 1940 most bicycles in the United States were made for children. From the early 20th century until after World War II, the roadster constituted most adult bicycles sold in the United Kingdom and in many parts of the British Empire. For many years after the advent of the motorcycle and automobile, they remained a primary means of adult transport. =Postwar= In several places - both high and low income - bicycles have retained or regained this position. In Denmark, cycling policies were adopted as a direct consequence of the 1973 oil crisis whereas bike advocacy in the Netherlands started in earnest with a campaign against traffic deaths called \\"stop child murder\\". Today both countries have high modal shares of cycling despite high car ownership rates. Cultural changes =Modal split= Prior to the appearance of the automobile, horses, walking and (since the 19th century) streetcars were the major modes of transportation within cities. Horses require a large amount of care, and were therefore kept in public facilities that were usually far from residences. The wealthy could afford to keep horses for private use, hence the term carriage trade referred to elite patronage.Carriage trade The Free Dictionary Horse manure left on the streets also created a sanitation problem.Susan Strasser, Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash, Owl Books, 355 pages (1999) =Distance= The motorcycle made regular medium-distance travel more convenient and affordable and after World War I the automobile too, especially in areas without railways. Because cars did not require rest, were faster than horse-drawn conveyances, and soon had a lower total cost of ownership, more people were routinely able to travel farther than in earlier times. The construction of highways in the 1950s continued this. Some experts suggest that many of these changes began during the earlier Golden age of the bicycle, from 1880 to 1915.Smith, Robert (1972). A Social History of the Bicycle, its Early Life and Times in America. American Heritage Press. =Changes to urban society= Urban interchange in Shenzhen Beginning in the 1940s, most urban environments in the United States lost their streetcars, cable cars, and other forms of light rail, to be replaced by diesel-run motor coaches or buses. Many of these have never returned, but some urban communities eventually installed rapid transit. Another change brought about by the car is that modern urban pedestrians must be more alert than their ancestors. In the past, a pedestrian had to worry about relatively slow-moving streetcars or other obstacles of travel. With the proliferation of the car, a pedestrian has to anticipate safety risks of automobiles traveling at high speeds because they can cause serious injuries to a human and can be fatal, unlike in previous times when traffic deaths were usually due to horses escaping control. According to many social scientists, the loss of pedestrian-scale villages has also disconnected communities. Many people in developed countries have less contact with their neighbors and rarely walk unless they place a high value on walking. = Advent of suburban society = In the decades following World War II, the auto united in the United States with the single family dwelling to form suburbs. Suburban affluence led to a baby boomer generation far removed from the hardships of their parents. Community standards of the past, driven by scarcity and the need to share public resources, gave way to new credos of self-exploration. As the economy of the fifties and sixties boomed, car sales grew steadily, from 6 million units sold per year in the U.S. to 10 million. Married women entered into the economy and two car households with driveways and garages became commonplace. In the seventies, however, the comparative economic stagnation then experienced was accompanied by societal self- reflection on the changes the auto brought. Critics of automotive society found little positive choice in the decision to move to the suburbs; the physical movement was looked upon as flight. The auto industry was also under attack from bureaucratic fronts, and new emission and CAF√â regulations began to hamper Big Three (automobile manufacturers) profit margins. Kenneth Schneider in Autokind vs Mankind (1971) called for a war against the auto, derided it for being a destroyer of cities, and likened its proliferation to a disease. Renowned social critic Vance Packard in A Nation of Strangers (1972) blamed the geographic mobility enabled by the auto for loneliness and social isolation. Auto sales peaked in 1973, at 14.6 million units sold, and were not to reach comparable levels for another decade. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War was followed by the OPEC oil embargo, leading to an explosion of prices, long gas lines, and talk of rationing. While it may appear clear, in retrospect, that the automotive/suburban culture would continue to flourish, as it did in the 1950s and 1960s, no such certainty existed at the time when British architect Martin Pawley authored his seminal work, The Private Future (1973). Pawley called the automobile ‚Äúthe shibboleth of privatization; the symbol and the actuality of withdrawal from the community‚Äù and perceived that, in spite of its momentary misfortunes, its dominance in North American society would continue. The car was a private world that allowed for fantasy and escape, and Pawley forecasted that it would grow in size, and in technological capacities. He saw no pathology in consumer behavior grounded in freedom of expression. Improved transport accelerated the outward growth of cities and the development of suburbs beyond an earlier era's streetcar suburbs. Until the advent of the car, factory workers lived either close to the factory or in high density communities farther away, connected to the factory by streetcar or rail. The car and the federal subsidies for roads and suburban development that supported car culture allowed people to live in low density residential areas even farther from the city center and integrated city neighborhoods. were Industrial suburbs being few, due in part to single use zoning, they created few local jobs and residents commuted longer distances to work each day as the suburbs continued to expand. =Cars in popular culture= In The United States James Dean inside a Porsche Speedster The car had a significant effect on the culture of the United States. As other vehicles had been, cars were incorporated into artworks including music, books and movies. Between 1905 and 1908, more than 120 songs were written in which the automobile was the subject. Although authors such as Booth Tarkington decried the automobile age in books including The Magnificent Ambersons (1918), novels celebrating the political effects of motorization included Free Air (1919) by Sinclair Lewis, which followed in the tracks of earlier bicycle touring novels. Some early 20th century experts doubted the safety and suitability of allowing female automobilists. Dorothy Levitt was among those who laid such concerns to rest, so much so that a century later there was only one country where women were forbidden to drive. Where 19th-century mass media had made heroes of Casey Jones, Allan Pinkerton and other stalwart protectors of public transport, new road movies offered heroes who found freedom and equality, rather than duty and hierarchy, on the open road. George Monbiot writes that widespread car culture has shifted voter's preference to the right-wing of the political spectrum, and thinks that car culture has contributed to an increase in individualism and fewer social interactions between members of different socioeconomic classes. The American Motor League had promoted the making of more and better cars since the early days of the car, and the American Automobile Association joined the good roads movement begun during the earlier bicycle craze; when manufacturers and petroleum fuel suppliers were well established, they also joined construction contractors in lobbying governments to build public roads. As tourism became motorized, individuals, families and small groups were able to vacation in distant locations such as national parks. Roads including the Blue Ridge Parkway were built specifically to help the urban masses experience natural scenery previously seen only by a few. Cheap restaurants and motels appeared on favorite routes and provided wages for locals who were reluctant to join the trend to rural depopulation. Europe 1973 Triumph TR6 Roadster Road building was sometimes also influenced by Keynesian-style political ideologies. In Europe, massive freeway building programs were initiated by a number of social democratic governments after World War II, in an attempt to create jobs and make the car available to the working classes. From the 1970s, promotion of the automobile increasingly became a trait of some conservatives. Margaret Thatcher mentioned a \\"great car economy\\" in the paper on Roads for Prosperity. The 1973 oil crisis and with it fuel rationing measures brought to light for the first time in a generation, what cities without cars might look like, reinvigorating or creating environmental consciousness in the process. Green parties emerged in several European countries in partial response to car culture, but also as the political arm of the anti-nuclear movement. =Cinema= The rise of car culture during the twentieth century, played an important cultural role in cinema, mainly through blockbusters. Important characters such as James Bond, or the ones performed by James Dean, were always provided on scene with powerful automobiles, which through time, have become cultural icons. =Radio= With the advent of car radios, radio programming during rush hour became known as drive time. Music also references impacts such as Big Yellow Taxi. =Cars as a lifestyle= Saab Club meeting in Latvia. Over time, the car has evolved beyond being a means of transportation or status symbol and into a subject of interest and a cherished lifestyle amongst many people in the world, who appreciate cars for their craftsmanship, their performance, as well as the vast arrays of activities one can take part in with his/her car.http://www.aaca.org/About-AACA/an-introduction-to-aaca.html.

For those aged 5‚Äì34 in the United States, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death, claiming the lives of 18,266 Americans each year. It is estimated that motor vehicle collisions caused the death of around 60 million people during the 20th century around the same number of World War II casualties. Just in 2010 alone, 1.23 million people were killed due to traffic collisions. Notwithstanding the high number of fatalities, the trend of motor vehicle collision is showing a decrease. Road toll figures in developed nations show that car collision fatalities have declined since 1980. Japan is an extreme example, with road deaths decreasing to 5,115 in 2008, which is 25% of the 1970 rate per capita and 17% of the 1970 rate per vehicle distance travelled. In 2008, for the first time, more pedestrians than vehicle occupants were killed in Japan by cars.Pedestrians become chief victims of road accident deaths in 2008 Besides improving general road conditions like lighting and separated walkways, Japan has been installing intelligent transportation system technology such as stalled-car monitors to avoid crashes. In developing nations, statistics may be grossly inaccurate or hard to get. Some nations have not significantly reduced the total death rate, which stands at 12,000 in Thailand in 2007, for example.365 Days for Stopping Accident Deaths In the United States, twenty-eight states had reductions in the number of automobile crash fatalities between 2005 and 2006.People Killed in Motor Vehicle Crashes, by State, 2005-2006 55% of vehicle occupants 16 years or older in 2006 were not using seat belts when they crashed. Road fatality trends tend to follow Smeed's law, an empirical schema that correlates increased fatality rates per capita with traffic congestion. Crime Motoring offences and crimes related to cars include offences predating the automobile rather than exclusive to it. Many have become more prevalent with the rise of mass motoring. *Car bomb *Car theft *Drive-by shooting *DUI *Jaywalking *Parking violation *Speeding *Street racing *Vehicular homicide External and internal costs Health Impacts of Automobility Road Space Requirements =Public or external costs= According to the Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector made by the Delft University and which is the main reference in European Union for assessing the externalities of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are: *congestion and scarcity costs, *accident costs, *air pollution costs, *noise costs, *climate change costs, *costs for nature and landscape, *costs for water pollution, *costs for soil pollution and *costs of energy dependency. Use of cars for transportation creates barriers by reducing the landscape required for walking and cycling. It may look like a minor problem initially but in the long run, it poses a threat to children and the elderly. Transport is a major land use, leaving less land available for other purposes. Cars also contribute to pollution of air and water. Though a horse produces more waste, cars are cheaper, thus far more numerous in urban areas than horses ever were. Emissions of harmful gases like carbon monoxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, benzene and particulate matter can damage living organisms and the environment. The emissions from cars cause disabilities, respiratory diseases, and ozone depletion. Noise pollution from cars can also potentially result in hearing disabilities, headaches, and stress to those frequently exposed to it. external cost of driving, such as in S√£o Paulo (pictured). In countries such as the United States the infrastructure that makes car use possible, such as highways, roads and parking lots is funded by the government and supported through zoning and construction requirements.The High Cost of Free Parking by Donald C. Shoup Fuel taxes in the United States cover about 60% of highway construction and repair costs, but little of the cost to construct or repair local roads.Graph based on data from Transportation for Livable Cities By Vukan R. Vuchic p. 76. 1999. MacKenzie, J.J., R.C. Dower, and D.D.T. Chen. 1992. The Going Rate: What It Really Costs to Drive. Washington, DC: World Resources Institute. Payments by motor-vehicle users fall short of government expenditures tied to motor-vehicle use by 20‚Äì70 cents per gallon of gas.http://www.its.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/delucchi Zoning laws in many areas require that large, free parking lots accompany any new buildings. Municipal parking lots are often free or do not charge a market rate. Hence, the cost of driving a car in the US is subsidized, supported by businesses and the government who cover the cost of roads and parking. This is in addition to other external costs car users do not pay like accidents or pollution. Even in countries with higher gas taxes like Germany motorists don't fully pay for the external costs they create. This government support of the automobile through subsidies for infrastructure, the cost of highway patrol enforcement, recovering stolen cars, and many other factors makes public transport a less economically competitive choice for commuters when considering out-of-pocket expenses. Consumers often make choices based on those costs, and underestimate the indirect costs of car ownership, insurance and maintenance. However, globally and in some US cities, tolls and parking fees partially offset these heavy subsidies for driving. Transportation planning policy advocates often support tolls, increased fuel taxes, congestion pricing and market-rate pricing for municipal parking as a means of balancing car use in urban centers with more efficient modes such as buses and trains. When cities charge market rates for parking, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs. When municipal parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, most of the cost of vehicle usage is paid for by general government revenue, a subsidy for motor vehicle use. The size of this subsidy dwarfs the federal, state, and local subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation. By contrast, although there are environmental and social costs for rail, there is a very small impact. Walking or cycling often have net positive impacts on society as they help reduce health costs and produce virtually no pollution. =Private or internal costs= Compared to other popular modes of passenger transportation, especially buses or trains, the car has a relatively high cost per passenger-distance travelled. Motorists in the United Kingdom seem to spend on their cars an average of roughly 1/3 of their average net income, while motorists in Portugal seem to spend 1/2 of their net income. For the average car owner, depreciation constitutes about half the cost of running a car, nevertheless the typical motorist underestimates this fixed cost by a big margin, or even ignores it altogether. In the United States, out of pocket expenses for car ownership can vary considerably based on the state in which you live. In 2013, annual car ownership costs including repair, insurance, gas and taxes were highest in Georgia ($4,233) and lowest in Oregon ($2,024) with a national average of $3,201.Car-ownership costs by state.

Data provided by the American Automobile Association indicates that the cost of ownership for an automobile in the United States is rising about 2% per year.Which state is the most expensive for driving?. Retrieved 22 August 2013 2013 data provided by the Canadian Automobile Association concludes that the cost of ownership for a compact car in Canada, including depreciation, insurance, borrowing costs, maintenance, licensing, etc. was CA $9500 per year, or about US $7300. Consumer speed The Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich, a critic of the modern society habits, was one of the first thinkers to establish the so-called consumer speed concept. He defined the term in his 1974 book Energy and Equity as the distance that an average person commutes each year, divided by the amount of time dedicated to commuting and related activities. He calculated that the average American male spent 1,600 hours per year in car-related activities ‚Äî about 28% of the time they spend awake ‚Äî and traveled by car each year, giving a consumer speed of about . In comparison, their contemporaries in developing countries spent less than 8% of their time walking. In other words, \\"[w]hat distinguishes the traffic in rich countries from the traffic in poor countries is not more mileage per hour of lifetime for the majority, but more hours of compulsory consumption of high doses of energy, packaged and unequally distributed by the transportation industry.\\"  Car-Free Streets  Car-Free Streets is a growing concept which aims to protects citizens by limiting the issues raised by cars.

In 2017 & 2019, Bacolod was awarded the \\"Top Philippine Model City\\" as the most livable urban center in the country by The Manila Times. Etymology Bac√≥lod (), is derived from bak√≥lod (Old Spelling: bac√≥lod), the Old Hiligaynon (Old Ilonggo) (Old Spelling: Ylongo and Ilongo) word for a \\"hill, mound, rise, hillock, down, any small eminence or elevation\\", since the resettlement was founded on a stony, hilly area, now the barangay of Granada. It was officially called Ciudad de Bac√≥lod (City of Bacolod) when Municipalidad de Bac√≥lod (Municipality of Bacolod) was converted into a city in 1938. History =Spanish colonial period= Historical church accounts provide a glimpse of the early years of Bacolod as a mere small settlement by the riverbank known as Magsungay (translated as \\"horn-shaped\\" in English). When the neighboring settlement of Bago was elevated into the status of a small town in 1575, it had several religious dependencies and one of which was the village of Magsungay. The early missionaries placed the village under the care and protection of Saint Sebastian sometime in the middle of the 18th century. A corregidor () by the name of Luis Fernando de Luna, donated a relic of the saint for the growing mission, and since then, the village came to be known as San Sebasti√°n de MagsungÃÉay. A view of the Capitol Park and Lagoon looking towards the Negros Occidental Provincial Capitol building Bacolod was not established as a town until 1755 or 1756, after the inhabitants of the coastal settlement of San Sebasti√°n de MagsungÃÉay, were attacked by forces under Datu Bant√≠lan of Sulu on July 14, 1755 and the villagers transferred from the coast to a hilly area called Bac√≥lod (which is now the barangay of Granada). Bernardino de los Santos became the first gobernadorcillo (). The town of Bacolod was constituted as a parroquia () in 1788 under the secular clergy, but did not have a resident priest until 1802, as the town was served by the priest from Bago, and later Binalbagan. By 1790, slave raids on Bacolod by Moro pirates had ceased. On 11 February 1802, Fr. Eusebio Laurencio became acting parish priest of Bacolod. In September 1806, Fr. Le√≥n Pedro was appointed interim parish priest and the following year became the first regular parish priest. In September 1817, Fray () Juli√°n Gonzaga from Barcelona was appointed as the parish priest. He encouraged the people to settle once again near the sea. He also encouraged migration to Bacolod and the opening of lands to agriculture and industry. San Sebastian Cathedral at night. In 1846, upon the request of Romualdo Jimeno, bishop of Cebu and Negros at that time, Governor-General Narciso Claver√≠a y Zald√∫a sent to Negros a team of Recollect missionaries headed by priest Fernando Cuenca. A decree of 20 June 1848 by Gobernador General Claver√≠a ordered the restructuring of Negros politically and religiously. The following year (1849), Negros Island Gobernadorcillo Manuel Valdevieso y Morquecho transferred the capital of the Province of Negros from Himamaylan to Bacolod and the Augustinian Recollects were asked to assume spiritual administration of Negros, which they did that same year. Transfer of Bacolod to the Recollects, however, took place only in 1871. Fray Mauricio Ferrero became the first Augustinian Recollect parish priest of Bacolod and successor to the secular priest, Fr. Mariano √Åvila. In 1863, a compulsory primary public school system was set up. In 1889, Bacolod became the capital of Occidental Negros when the Province of Negros was politically divided into the separate provinces of Occidental Negros (Spanish: Negros Occidental) and Oriental Negros (Spanish: Negros Oriental). =Revolution and Republic of Negros= Fountain of Justice and the Bacolod Old City Hall, the site where the Spanish authorities surrender Bacolod to the forces of General Aniceto Lacson which took place on November 6, 1898 during the Negros Revolution. Last page of the Acta de Capitulaci√≥n (). The success of the uprising in Bacolod and environs was attributed to the low morale of the local imperial Spanish detachment, due to its defeat in Panay and Luzon and to the psychological warfare waged by Generals Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta. In 1897, a battle in Bacolod was fought at Matab-ang River. A year later, on November 5, 1898, the Negrense Revolucionarios (), armed with knives, bolos, spears, and rifle- like nipa palm stems, and pieces of sawali or amakan mounted on carts, captured the convent, presently Palacio Episcopal (), where Colonel Isidro de Castro y Cisneros, well-armed cazadores () and platoons of Guardias Civiles (), surrendered. On 7 November 1898, most of the revolutionary army gathered together to establish a provisional junta and to confirm the elections of Aniceto Lacson as president, Juan Araneta as war-delegate, as well as the other officials. For a brief moment, the provinces of Occidental Negros and Oriental Negros were reunited under the cantonal government of the Negrense Revolucionarios, from 6 November 1898 to the end of February 1899, making Bacolod the capital. In March 1899, the American forces led by Colonel James G. Smith occupied Bacolod, the revolutionary capital of Rep√∫blica Cantonal de Negros (). =American colonial period= Bacolod Public Plaza during bicycle races in 1901. The Cantonal Republic of Negros became a U.S. territory on April 30, 1901. This separated Negros Island once again, reverting Bacolod to its status as the capital of Occidental Negros. The public school of Instituto Rizal () opened its doors to students on 1 July 1902. Colegio de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Consolaci√≥n (), the first private institution in the province of Negros Occidental, was established in Bacolod by the Augustinian sisters on March 11, 1919 and opened in July 1919. A historic event took place in 1938 when Municipality of Bacolod was elevated into a city through Commonwealth Act No. 326 passed by the 1st National Assembly of the Philippines creating the City of Bacolod. Assemblyman Pedro C. Hern√°ez of the second district of Negros Occidental sponsored the bill. The law was passed on June 18, 1938. Bacolod was formally inaugurated as a chartered city on October 19, 1938 by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 404, highlighted by the visit of Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon. President Quezon appointed Alfredo Montel√≠bano, Sr. as the first city mayor of Bacolod. =Japanese occupation and allied liberation= Ancestral home of then Don Generoso Villanueva In World War II, Bacolod was occupied by the Japanese forces on May 21, 1942. Lieutenant General Kawano \\"Kono\\" Takeshi, the Japanese commanding officer of the 77th Infantry Brigade, 102nd Division, seized the homes of Don Generoso Villanueva, a prominent sugar planter‚Äîwhose home, the Daku Balay served as the \\"seat of power\\" (occupational headquarters for the Japanese Forces in Negros and all of the Central Visayan region of the Philippines) and being the tallest building of Bacolod it served as the city's watchtower‚Äîand the home of his brother-in-law, Don Mariano Ramos, the first appointed Municipal President of Bacolod. The home of Don Generoso was lived in by Lt. General Takeshi throughout the duration of the war and also served as his office and the home of Don Mariano was occupied by a Japanese Colonel serving under the command of Lt. General Takeshi. The city was liberated by joint Philippine and American forces on May 29, 1945. It took time to rebuild the city after liberation. However, upon the orders of Lt. General Takeshi, both the homes of Villanueva and Ramos were saved from destruction by the retreating Japanese forces. In March 1945, upon the invasion of the American and Philippine Commonwealth forces, the withdrawal of the Japanese army into the mountains and the temporary occupation of Bacolod by the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth armed forces, the house of Villanueva was then occupied by Major General Rapp Brush, commander of the 40th Infantry Division, known as the \\"Sun Burst\\" Division, for approximately five months. The local Philippine military built and established the general headquarters and camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army which was active from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946. The 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was also active from October 28, 1944 to June 30, 1946 and was stationed in Bacolod during and after World War II. =Independent Philippines= When the country finally gained independence from the United States, the city's public markets and slaughterhouses were rebuilt during the administration of then Mayor Vicente Remiti√≥ from 1947 to 1949. In 1948, a fire razed a portion of the records section of the old city hall that consumed the rear end of the building and with it, numerous priceless documents of the city. Bacolod was classified as a Highly Urbanized City. On September 27, 1984, by the provision of Section 166 and 168 of the Local Government Code and the DILG Memo Circular No. 83-49. In January 1985, the original hardwood and coral structure of Palacio Episcopal was almost entirely destroyed by a fire. Among the damage of the raging fire were items of significant historical value. The reconstruction of Palacio which took more than two years, was completed in 1990. Geography District map of Bacolod Bacolod is located on the northwestern coast of the large island of Negros. Within the island, it is bounded on the north by the city of Talisay, on the east by the town of Murcia and on the south by the city of Bago. As a coastal city, it is bounded on the west by the Guimaras Strait, serving as a natural border of northwestern Negros Island Region to the neighboring Western Visayas. The global location of Bacolod is 10 degrees, 40 minutes 40 seconds - north and 122 degrees 54 minutes 25 seconds - east with Bacolod Public Plaza as the benchmark.

Hursthouse is Professor Emerita of Philosophy at the University of Auckland. Biography Born in Bristol, England, in 1943, Hursthouse spent her childhood in New Zealand. Her aunt Mary studied philosophy and when her father asked her what that was all about, he could not understand her answer. Rosalind, 17 at the time, knew immediately that she wanted to study philosophy, too, and enrolled the next year. She taught for many years at the Open University in England. She was head of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Auckland from 2002 to 2005. Though she had written a substantial amount previously, Hursthouse entered the international philosophical scene for the first time in 1990‚Äì91, with three articles: Hursthouse, who was mentored by Elizabeth Anscombe and Philippa Foot, is best known as a virtue ethicist. Hursthouse's work is deeply grounded in the history of philosophy, and especially in Aristotle's ethics, about which she has written extensively. She has also emphasised the practical nature of virtue ethics in her books Beginning Lives and Ethics, Humans, and Other Animals. Her most substantial contribution to modern virtue ethics is her book On Virtue Ethics, which explores its structure as a distinctive action-guiding theory, the relationship between virtue, the emotions and moral motivation, and the place of the virtues within an overall account of human flourishing. It also expands Hursthouse's formulation of right action in terms of what a virtuous person would characteristically do in a situation. In 2016, Hursthouse was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

National Amusements-owned Viacom assumed control of the company as part of its acquisition of Paramount Pictures in 1994. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company acquired the company, and although licensed through 2017, Cedar Fair dropped Paramount/CBS-licensed names from the parks after the 2007 season. The operator has continued to be defunct despite efforts to use Paramount intellectual properties at various park projects after the sale in 2006 by entities unaffiliated with the original Paramount Parks company. About Paramount Parks The company once owned and operated Paramount's Kings Island, Paramount's Kings Dominion, Paramount's Great America, Paramount's Carowinds, and Paramount Canada's Wonderland and managed Bonfante Gardens in Gilroy, California. From late 2001 until late 2004, Paramount Parks also managed Terra M√≠tica, an amusement park in Benidorm, Valencia, Spain. History Paramount Communications, previously known as Gulf+Western, in turn had acquired the parks from Nelson Schwab and his management group. Schwab and his KECO Entertainment acquired the group in a management-led LBO from the Taft Broadcasting Company, which had built Kings Island in Cincinnati using cast off rides from the Coney Island amusement park in Cincinnati, Ohio. The parks were part of Viacom's Blockbuster Entertainment division until 2002 when they were moved back to Paramount Pictures. After another Viacom corporate shuffle in 2004 the parks became part of Viacom Recreation, a division of Nickelodeon and MTV Networks. On January 1, 2006, as Viacom went through a corporate split (creating a new version of Viacom and renaming the original company CBS Corporation), Paramount Parks was assigned to CBS Corporation. CBS Corporation, in order to \\"toss overboard\\" any unnecessary company assets, sought to sell the parks during the 2006 season, planning to continue their operation until a buyer was found. Cedar Fair Entertainment Co., owners of more well known Cedar Point and Knott's Berry Farm theme parks approached the company in 2006. Within the acquisition, there was a license for 10 years of use of the Paramount prefix on the parks and Paramount properties at the former Paramount parks. Cedar Fair opted to remove most mentions of Paramount and Paramount intellectual properties by mid-2007. The only references to a Viacom property remaining were the characters and titles used in Nickelodeon Universe (Kings Island) and Nickelodeon Central (Kings Dominion, Carowinds, Great America, and Canada's Wonderland), all of which were rethemed to the children's area utilized by most of Cedar Fair's legacy parks, Peanuts for the 2010 season. In June 2007, it was revealed that a Paramount Theme Park was to be developed and opened at the Dubailand complex (which itself is currently on hold) in the United Arab Emirates. No further developments were made, and the project was abandoned in 2016. In October 2011, plans for a new Paramount theme park to be developed in Alhama, Murcia were revealed in Madrid. The resort to be called Paramount Park was to be the second-largest theme park in Europe after Disneyland, Paris. Projects to continue with the construction of the park have been scrapped. In December 2018, it was announced that Paramount Pictures signed a deal with Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment to install the first Paramount-branded theme park in Incheon, South Korea. It is slated to open in 2025, three years after Inspire Integrated Entertainment Resort's opening. Paramount and Daewoo Motor Sales previously announced in 2008 that it will build Paramount Movie Park Korea in Songdo near Incheon, but the plans was never announced due to financial problems of Daewoo Motor Sales.https://variety.com/2018/film/news/paramount- theme-park-incheon-south-korea-inspire-1203089769/ In December 2019, it was announced that Paramount Pictures with London Resort Company Holdings Paramount-theme in London United Kingdom The London Resort will open in 2024 and start construction in 2021.  Park acquisitions  The Paramount Parks were not built by Paramount, but rather were pre-existing and purchased as a whole, rebranded with the Paramount name. Effectively, it seemed Paramount was attempting to enter into the movie-based theme-park business popularized by amusement park and resort companies, such as Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Six Flags Theme Parks, Cedar Fair and Universal Parks & Resorts. In the 1970s and 1980s, Taft Broadcasting created a division called KECO Entertainment (King's Entertainment Company), which was formed in order to build theme parks nationwide. In 1972 and 1975, KECO built Kings Island and Kings Dominion respectively. In 1975, KECO led a forced purchase on the Carowinds Corporation, a bankrupt company, leaving them no choice but to sell Carowinds theme park in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1981, KECO opened Canada's Wonderland in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. In 1984 hotel company Marriott, owner of two parks named Great America, was looking to divest itself of its parks. One of the parks was located in Silicon Valley in the exurbs of San Francisco and the other was located in the North Shore suburbs of Chicago. The California park was purchased by KECO, while the Illinois Park became part of the Six Flags chain. In 1992, after 22 years of great successful and thrill classic entertainment experience management, KECO Entertainment sold their six parks to Paramount Communications (which was later purchased by Viacom). Subsequently, in 1993, the \\"Paramount's\\" prefix was added to the parks, excluding Canada's Wonderland, which was renamed to \\"Paramount Canada's Wonderland\\", to avoid the use of a double possessive noun. Thus, the first five parks of the Paramount Parks were established: Paramount's Kings Island, Paramount's Kings Dominion, Paramount's Great America, Paramount's Carowinds, and Paramount Canada's Wonderland. In 2000, Paramount Parks purchased the majority of shares in Spanish theme park Terra Mitica (Land of Myth), branding it Terra Mitica: A Paramount Park. In 2004, Paramount dropped its shares in the park, and the name was reverted without the Paramount suffix.  Theme  Paramount Parks were one of the few remaining seasonal park operators to exclusively use themed layouts and rides (a practice usually observed only by annual park operators such as Universal Theme Parks, Six Flags Theme Parks, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts). It's this aspect that likely helped the parks stand out against other regional competitors such as Cedar Fair (who later purchased the parks), who ran lightly themed amusement parks exclusively. For example, while Cedar Fair's flagship park Cedar Point debuted Wicked Twister and Top Thrill Dragster in 2002 and 2003, respectively, Kings Island opened Tomb Raider: The Ride and Scooby-Doo and the Haunted Mansion. These two attractions, while costing only slightly less than Cedar Point's additions, were indoor, highly themed, immersive rides with synchronized musical scores and Hollywood special effects. The same can be said of Paramount's last additions to their parks, The Italian Job: Stunt Track, which are family- oriented roller coasters that also feature flames, water, synchronized music, and many movie props. When Cedar Fair acquired the Paramount Parks, they revolutionized their own season pass system using Paramount's as a blueprint, and also absorbed some of Paramount's theme-focused entertainment, combining it with their own well-proven thrills to create some of their most famous attractions: Maverick at Cedar Point and Diamondback at Kings Island, among others. Without the Paramount Pictures film licenses, many of the rides at the Paramount Parks were renamed to more generic names so as not to infringe on Paramount's copyrights. Many of these changes were \\"in name only,\\" having no actual bearing on the ride's appearance. Because of the level of theme involved in Paramount's later rides, though, (such as The Italian Job: Stunt Track and Tomb Raider: The Ride) some rides did lose core elements, such as synchronized musical scores, special effects, and pre-shows (thereby eliminating story lines). * Drop Zone: Stunt Tower was renamed Drop Tower: Scream Zone at all five former Paramount parks. * Top Gun was renamed Afterburn at Carowinds and Flight Deck at Canada's Wonderland and California's Great America. The ride at Kings Island was also first renamed Flight Deck from 2008-2013 then renamed The Bat (in honor of a previous suspended roller coaster at the park) in 2014. * Face/Off at Kings Island was renamed Invertigo. * The Italian Job: Stunt Track at Canada's Wonderland, Kings Dominion, and Kings Island were all renamed Backlot Stunt Coaster. * Tomb Raider: The Ride and Tomb Raider: FireFall at Kings Island and Kings Dominion respectively were both renamed The Crypt. Both have since been removed as of 2020. ** The roller coaster at Canada's Wonderland was renamed Time Warp. * Days of Thunder go-kart tracks were renamed Thunder Alley. * Paramount Action- FX Theater was renamed Action Theater. * The Paramount Theatre was renamed after each park it was located in (e.g. Kings Island Theatre). * BORG Assimilator Carowinds was renamed Nighthawk. * Cliffhanger was renamed Riptide at Canada's Wonderland. * Scooby Doo and the Haunted Mansion at Canada's Wonderland, Carowinds, Kings Dominion & Kings Island was renamed Boo Blasters on Boo Hill with the Scooby Doo theme removed. * The Nickelodeon and Hanna- Barbera children's areas in all of the parks remained dormant until after the 2009 season, when they rethemed to Cedar Fair's Peanuts characters, under the name Planet Snoopy. * There were two \\"Wayne's World\\" themed lands at Kings Dominion and Carowinds. Perhaps the most notable change between park owners, Kings Island's $20 million indoor Tomb Raider: The Ride had its water effects, lasers, Hollywood lighting, pre-show, synchronized musical score, film props, artificial fog, and flame effects removed. Notably, The Crypt at Kings Dominion, similar to the ride at Kings Island with the exception that it was outdoors, retained all of its original theming, music, film props, lighting, fog, and flames.  Sale to Cedar Fair  On January 27, 2006, the then-newly minted CBS Corporation announced its intent to sell Paramount Parks due to the fact that it did not fit well within the company's core business (producing and distributing television content). A number of groups expressed interest in purchasing the company, several placed bids, and On May 22, 2006, Cedar Fair announced it had outbid competitors and intended to purchase all five parks in the Paramount Parks chain, including Star Trek: The Experience at the Las Vegas Hilton and the management agreement of Bonfante Gardens. On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair announced that it had completed its acquisition of Paramount Parks from CBS Corporation in a cash transaction valued at US$1.24 billion. Shortly following the transfer of ownership, Cedar Fair began the process of integrating the two companies. With the purchase of the Paramount Parks, Cedar Fair LP announced that it would do business under the name Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Cedar Fair LP remains the legal company name. Removal of the Paramount references The individual parks continued to operate under their Paramount names during the 2006 season. After 14 years of operation under Paramount, Cedar Fair began removing the Paramount name and logo from the parks in January 2007. The names of the main parks were changed back to their original pre-Paramount names (the Paramount's prefix was removed) with the Cedar Fair corporate logo added. Bonfante Gardens was changed to Gilroy Gardens. Cedar Fair began deleting references to Paramount Pictures from all parks. Although the acquisition granted Cedar Fair a ten-year licensing deal for Paramount names and icons, such as Star Trek and Tomb Raider, Cedar Fair opted to terminate the agreement and not pay an annual licensing fee for all properties besides Nickelodeon, which was terminated during 2009. The process of removing references to Paramount/CBS properties began in the parks during the beginning of the 2007 season and by the 2008 season most of the major references were completely removed from the parks, besides some minor remnants and logos occasionally found in the park. Paramount Parks, Europe On 10 October 2011, it was reported that Paramount would develop a theme park in Murcia, Spain with work set to start in 2012. The $1.5 billion Paramount Murcia park was hoped to rival Disneyland Paris as a European tourist destination. The resort would have featured 30 attractions with an adjacent shopping center, hotels and casino.Paramount theme park set to debut in Spain in 2015 LATimes. By Brady MacDonald.

The little stint (Calidris minuta) (or Erolia minuta), is a very small wader. It breeds in arctic Europe and Asia, and is a long-distance migrant, wintering south to Africa and south Asia. It occasionally is a vagrant to North America and to Australia. The genus name is from Ancient Greek kalidris or skalidris, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific minuta is Latin for \\"small. Description Its small size, fine dark bird, dark legs and quicker movements distinguish this species from all waders except the other dark-legged stints. It can be distinguished from these in all plumages by its combination of a fine bill tip, unwebbed toes and long primary projection. The call is a sharp \\"stit\\". The breeding adult has an orange wash to the breast, a white throat and a strong white V on its back. In winter plumage identification is difficult. Juveniles have pale crown stripes and a pinkish breast. An apparent hybrid between this species and Temminck's stint has been reported from the Netherlands. Population dynamics The numbers of this species (and of curlew sandpiper) depend on the population of lemmings. In poor lemming years, predatory species such as skuas and snowy owls take Arctic-breeding waders instead. It is gregarious in winter, sometimes forming large flocks with other Calidris waders, particularly dunlin, on coastal mudflats or the edges of inland pools. The little stint is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Nesting This bird nests on a scrape in bare ground, laying 3‚Äì5 eggs. It is polygamous, and male and female may incubate separate clutches.

These microprocessors implement the \\"Amazon\\", or \\"PowerPC-AS\\", instruction set architecture (ISA). Amazon is a superset of the PowerPC instruction set, with the addition of special features not in the PowerPC specification, mainly derived from POWER2 and the original AS/400 processor, and has been 64-bit from the start. The processors in this family are optimized for commercial workloads (integer performance, large caches, branches) and do not feature the strong floating point performance of the processors in the IBM POWER microprocessors family, its sibling. The RS64 family was phased out soon after the introduction of the POWER4, which was developed to unite the RS64 and POWER families. History In 1990 the Amazon project was started to create a common architecture that would host both AIX and OS/400. The AS/400 engineering team at IBM was designing a RISC instruction set to replace the CISC instruction set of the existing AS/400 computers. Their original design was a variant of the existing \\"IMPI\\" instruction set, extended to 64 bits and given some RISC instructions to speed up the more computationally intensive commercial applications that were being put on AS/400s. IBM management wanted them to use PowerPC, but they resisted, arguing that the existing 32/64-bit PowerPC instruction set would not enable a viable transition for OS/400 software and that the existing instruction set required extensions for the commercial applications on the AS/400. Eventually, an extension to the PowerPC instruction set, called \\"Amazon\\", was developed. At the same time, the RS/6000 developers were broadly expanding their product line to include systems which spanned from low-end workstations, to mainframe competitor-large enterprise SMP systems, to clustered RS/6000-SP2 supercomputing systems. PowerPC processors developed in the AIM alliance suited the low-end RISC workstation and small server space well. But mainframe and large clustered supercomputing systems required more performance and reliability, availability and serviceability features than processors designed for Apple Power Macs. Multiple processor designs were required to simultaneously meet the requirements of the cost-focused Apple Power Mac, high-performance and RAS RS/6000 systems, and the AS/400 transition to PowerPC. Amazon was extended to support those features as well, so that processors could be designed for use in both high-end RS/6000 and AS/400 machines. The project to develop the first such processor was \\"Bellatrix\\" (the name of a star in the Orion constellation, also called the \\"Amazon Star\\"). The Bellatrix project was extremely ambitious in its pervasive use of self-timed & pulse based circuits and the EDA tools required to support this design strategy, and was eventually terminated. To address technical workstation, supercomputer, and engineering/scientific markets, IBM Austin (the home of the RS/6000s) then started developing a time-to-market single-chip version of the Power2 (P2SC) in parallel with the development of a sophisticated 64-bit PowerPC processor with the POWER2 extensions and twin sophisticated MAF floating point units (the POWER3/630). To address RS/6000 commercial applications and AS/400 systems, IBM Rochester (the home of the AS/400s) started developing the first of the high-end 64-bit PowerPC processors with AS/400 extensions, and IBM Endicott started developing a low-end single-chip PowerPC processor with AS/400 extensions. Cobra and Muskie In 1995 IBM released the Cobra, or A10 processor, the first implementation of PowerPC AS, for the AS/400 Advanced Series systems. It was a single-chip processor running at 50-77 MHz. It was designed with a semi-custom methodology, as a consequence of time-to-market constraints. The die contains 4.7 million transistors and measures 14.6 mm by 14.6 mm (213 mm2). It was fabricated by IBM in their CMOS 5L process, a 0.5 ¬µm, four-layer-metal CMOS process. It used a 3.0 V power supply and dissipated 17.7 W maximum, 13.4 W minimum at 77 MHz. It was packaged in a 625-contact ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) that measured 32 mm by 32 mm. In 1996 IBM released the high-end, 4-way SMP, multi-chip version called Muskie, A25 or A30 in AS/400 systems. It ran at 125-154 MHz. It was manufactured on a BiCMOS fabrication process. These processors were only used in AS/400 machines. RS64 The RS64 or Apache was introduced in 1997. It was developed from \\"Cobra\\" and \\"Muskie\\" but included a more complete PowerPC ISA and was therefore set to be used in RS/6000 machines as well as in AS/400 systems. It featured 128 KB total on-die L1 cache, 4 MB full speed off-chip L2 on a 128 bit bus, and a clock of 125 MHz. It scaled to a 12 processor SMP configuration in IBM's machines. RS64 was called A35 in AS/400 and was one time referred to as the PowerPC 625, between the defunct PowerPC 620 and the PowerPC 630 (later renamed POWER3). It was manufactured with a BiCMOS fabrication process. RS64-II The RS64-II or Northstar was introduced at 262 MHz in 1998 with 8 MB of full speed L2 on a 256 bit 6XX bus (also used in PowerPC 620 and POWER3). Processor boards containing 4 RS64-II's could be swapped into machines designed for similar 4-way RS64 boards, avoiding a \\"fork lift upgrade\\". The RS64-II contained 12.5 million transistors, was 162 mm¬≤ large and drew 27 Watts maximum power. Manufacturing changed to a 0.35 Œºm CMOS fabrication. RS64-II was the first mass-market processor to implement multithreading. Essentially, each chip stores state information for 2 threads at any given time and appears to be two processors to the OS. One logical processor runs what is called the foreground thread. When this thread encounters a high latency event (L2 cache miss, etc.) the background thread is switched to, on the second logical processor from the OS's point of view. In the event of a \\"less long\\" latency event (L1 miss, etc.), thread switching will only occur if the background thread is ready to execute. If the background thread is also waiting for a miss, thread switching will not occur. IBM calls this scheme \\"coarse grained multithreading\\". It is not exactly the same thing as simultaneous multithreading as found on later Pentium 4 processors. An IBM paper notes that the coarse grained scheme is a better fit for an in-order architecture like RS64. RS64-II was called A50 in AS/400 systems. RS64-III The RS64-III or Pulsar was introduced in 1999 at 450 MHz. Key changes included larger 128 KiB L1 instruction and data caches, improved branch prediction accuracy and reduced branch misprediction penalties of zero or one cycle. The RS64-III has a five-stage pipeline and a 256 bit wide L2 cache bus, which provided the processor with 14.4 GB/s of bandwidth from the 8 MiB L2 cache, implemented with 225 MHz DDR SRAMs. The RS64-III has 34 million transistors, a die size of 140 mm¬≤, and is manufactured on the 0.22 Œºm CMOS 7S process with six levels of copper interconnect. In 2000, IBM launched a refined version called IStar manufactured with a SOI fabrication process with copper interconnects, which increased the processor's clock frequency to 600 MHz. This was the first processor implemented in this process. Architecturally however, the IStar was identical to Pulsar. RS64-IV The RS64-IV or Sstar was introduced in 2000 at 600 MHz, later increased to 750 MHz. Up to 16 GB DDR L2 was supported in the same manner as the RS64-III (19.2 GB/s bandwidth). The RS64-IV had 44 million transistors and was 128 mm¬≤ large manufactured on a 0.18 Œºm process. Unlike POWER, energy consumption remained low, at under 15 watts per core. For a time, while the POWER line stagnated at half the clock speed of its competitors, the RS64 family was at the top of the IBM large SMP UNIX server line. The integer / commercial workload performance of the RS-64 IV was similar to the Sun Microsystems processors with which it competed, though its floating point power was not comparable to the contemporary POWER3-II, which remained reasonably competitive throughout its lifecycle.

He was the longest-serving and longest-lived Premier of Queensland,\\"Sir Joh celebrates 93rd birthday\\", Australian Broadcasting Corporation 13 January 2004. holding office from 1968 to 1987, during which time the state underwent considerable economic development.\\"Sir Joh, our home- grown banana republican\\" , The Age, 25 April 2005. He has become one of the most well-known and controversial figures of 20th-century Australian politics because of his uncompromising conservatism (including his role in the downfall of the Whitlam federal government), political longevity, and the institutional corruption that became synonymous with his later leadership. Bjelke-Petersen's Country (later National) Party controlled Queensland despite consistently receiving the smallest number of votes out of the state's leading three parties, achieving the result through a notorious system of electoral malapportionment that resulted in rural votes having a greater value than those cast in city electorates.Peter Charlton, \\"Law and order the making of unlikely leader,\\" The Courier-Mail, 25 April 2005, pg 25. The effect earned Bjelke-Petersen the nickname of \\"the Hillbilly Dictator\\". Yet he was a highly popular figure among conservative voters and over the course of his 19 years as premier he tripled the number of people who voted for his party and doubled the party's percentage vote. After the Liberals pulled out of the coalition government in 1983, Bjelke-Petersen reduced his former partners to a mere six seats in an election held later that year. In 1985 Bjelke-Petersen launched a campaign to move into federal politics to become prime minister, though the campaign was eventually aborted. Bjelke-Petersen was a divisive premier and earned himself a reputation as a \\"law and order\\" politician with his repeated use of police force against street demonstrators and strongarm tactics with trade unions, leading to frequent descriptions of Queensland under his leadership as a police state. From 1987 his administration came under the scrutiny of a royal commission into police corruption and its links with state government ministers. Bjelke-Petersen was unable to recover from the series of damaging findings and after initially resisting a party vote that replaced him as leader, resigned from politics on 1 December 1987. Two of his state ministers, as well as the police commissioner Bjelke-Petersen had appointed and later knighted, were jailed for corruption offences and in 1991 Bjelke- Petersen, too, was tried for perjury over his evidence to the royal commission; the jury failed to reach a verdict and Bjelke-Petersen was deemed too old to face a second trial. Early life Bjelke-Petersen was born in Dannevirke in the southern Hawke's Bay region of New Zealand,\\"Joh Bjelke- Petersen\\", Courier Mail Birth of our Nation, 2001. and lived in Waipukurau, a small town in Hawke's Bay. The Australian Bjelke-Petersen family are of Danish descent. Bjelke-Petersen's parents were both Danish immigrants, and his father, Carl (known to the family as George), was a Lutheran pastor. In 1913 the family moved to Australia, establishing a farm, \\"Bethany\\", near Kingaroy in south-eastern Queensland. The young Bjelke-Petersen suffered from polio, leaving him with a lifelong limp. The family was poor, and Carl Bjelke- Petersen was frequently in poor health. Bjelke-Petersen left formal schooling at age 14 to work with his mother on the farm, though he later enrolled in correspondence school and undertook a University of Queensland extension course on the \\"Art of Writing\\". He taught Sunday school, delivered sermons regularly in nearby towns and joined the Kingaroy debating society. In 1933, Bjelke-Petersen began work land-clearing and peanut farming on the family's newly acquired second property. His efforts eventually allowed him to begin work as a contract land-clearer and to acquire further capital which he invested in farm equipment and natural resource exploration. He developed a technique for quickly clearing scrub by connecting a heavy anchor chain between two bulldozers. By the time he was 30, he was a prosperous farmer and businessman. Obtaining a pilot's licence early in his adult life, Bjelke- Petersen also started aerial spraying and grass seeding to further speed up pasture development in Queensland. After failing in a 1944 plebiscite against the sitting member to gain Country Party endorsement in the state seat of Nanango, based on Kingaroy, Bjelke-Petersen was elected in 1946 to the Kingaroy Shire Council, where he developed a profile in the Country Party. With the support of local federal member and shire council chairman Sir Charles Adermann and Sir Frank Nicklin, he gained Country Party endorsement for Nanango and was elected a year later at age 36, going on to give regular radio talks and becoming secretary of the local Nationals branch. He would hold this seat, renamed Barambah in 1950, for the next 40 years. The Labor Party had held power in Queensland since 1932 and Bjelke-Petersen spent eleven years as an opposition member. Rise to power, 1952‚Äì1970 Flo on their wedding day (31 May 1952) On 31 May 1952, Bjelke-Petersen married typist Florence Gilmour, who would later become a significant political figure in her own right. In 1957, following a split in the Labor Party, the Country Party under Nicklin came to power, with the Liberal Party as a junior coalition partner. This was a reversal of the situation at the national level. Queensland is Australia's least centralised state; the provincial cities between them have more people than the Brisbane area. In these areas, the Country Party was stronger than the Liberal Party. As a result, the Country Party had historically been the larger of the two non-Labor parties, and had been senior partner in the Coalition since 1925. In 1963 Nicklin appointed Bjelke-Petersen as minister for works and housing, a portfolio that gave him the opportunity to bestow favours and earn the loyalty of backbenchers by approving construction of schools, police stations and public housing in their electorates. At various times, he also served as acting minister for education, police, Aboriginal and Island Affairs, local government and conservation and labour and industry. He would serve in cabinet without interruption until his retirement in 1987. Only Thomas Playford IV, who served in the South Australian cabinet without interruption from 1938 to 1965, served longer as a federal or state cabinet minister. Nicklin retired in January 1968 and was succeeded as Premier and Country Party leader by Jack Pizzey; Bjelke- Petersen was elected unopposed as deputy Country Party leader. On 31 July 1968, after just seven months in office, Pizzey suffered a heart attack and died. Deputy Premier and Liberal leader Gordon Chalk was sworn in as caretaker premier. The Country Party had 27 seats in Parliament; the Liberals had 20. Nonetheless, there was some dispute over whether the Liberals should take senior status, which would have made Chalk premier in his own right. Matters were brought to a head when Bjelke-Petersen‚Äîelected Country Party leader within days of Pizzey's death‚Äîthreatened to pull the Country Party out of the Coalition unless he became Premier. After seven days Chalk accepted the inevitable, and Bjelke-Petersen was sworn in as Premier on 8 August 1968. He remained Police Minister. =Conflict of interest, party revolt= Bjelke- Petersen in 1968 Within months of becoming premier, Bjelke-Petersen encountered his first controversy over allegations of conflict of interest. In April 1959, while still a backbencher, he had paid ¬£2 for an Authority to Prospect, giving him the right to search for oil over 150,000 km2 near Hughenden in far north Queensland. The next month he incorporated a company, Artesian Basin Oil Co. Pty Ltd, of which he was sole director and shareholder, and the same day entered an agreement to sell 51% of the company's shares to an American company for ¬£12,650. The following day he sought the consent of Mines Minister Ernie Evans to transfer the oil search authority to Artesian for ¬£2; the consent was given a week later. When the Taxation Commissioner ruled that the ¬£12,650 windfall from the ¬£2 authority was a taxable profit, Bjelke-Petersen appealed, eventually taking the matter to the High Court. The appeal was dismissed, with Justice Taylor ruling that Bjelke-Petersen's six million percent gain from the ¬£2 authority arose from \\"a profit-making undertaking\\". In 1962 Artesian transferred its Authority to Prospect to a new company, Exoil NL, for ¬£190,000, and Bjelke-Petersen in turn bought a million shares in Exoil. On 1 September 1968, three weeks after becoming premier, Bjelke-Petersen's government gave two companies, Exoil NL and Transoil NL‚Äîin both of which he was a major shareholder‚Äîsix-year leases to prospect for oil on the Great Barrier Reef north of Cooktown. Opposition Leader Jack Houston revealed the Premier's financial involvement in the companies at a press conference in March 1969, where he asserted Bjelke-Petersen had gained \\"fabulous wealth\\" from the ¬£2 prospecting authority, which had now mushroomed into Exoil shares worth AU$720,000. Bjelke-Petersen said he had done nothing wrong, but resigned his directorship of Artesian in favour of his wife. The Country-Liberal coalition was returned to power at the 1969 Queensland election, with the state's system of electoral malapportionment delivering the Country Party 26 seats‚Äîa third of the parliament's 78 seats‚Äîfrom 21.1% of the primary vote, the Liberals taking 19 seats from 23.7% of the vote and the Labor Party's 45.1% share of the vote leaving it with 31 seats. Further controversy followed. In June 1970 it was revealed that a number of Queensland government ministers and senior public servants, as well as Florence Bjelke- Petersen, had bought shares in the public float of Comalco, a mining company that had direct dealings with the government and senior ministers. The shares finished their first day of trading at double the price the ministers had paid. Bjelke-Petersen again rejected claims of a conflict of interest, but the Country Party state branch changed its policy to forbid the acceptance of preferential share offers by ministers or members of parliament. In October, the Country Party lost a by-election in the Gold Coast seat of Albert, prompting several nervous MPs to make plans to oust Bjelke-Petersen as leader and replace him with Ron Camm. Bjelke-Petersen spent the night and the next morning calling MPs to bolster support, surviving a party room vote by a margin of one, after producing a proxy vote of an MP who was overseas and uncontactable. Plans by Country Party members to support a Labor Party vote of no confidence in parliament were quashed after the intervention of party president Robert Sparkes, who warned that anyone who voted against Bjelke- Petersen would lose their status as the party's candidate at the next election. =1971 state of emergency= Bjelke-Petersen seized on the controversial visit of the Springboks, the South African rugby union team, in 1971 to consolidate his position as leader with a display of force. Springboks matches in southern states had already been disrupted by anti-apartheid demonstrations and a match in Brisbane was scheduled for 24 July 1971, the date of two Queensland by-elections. On 14 July Bjelke-Petersen declared a month-long state of emergency covering the entire state, giving the government almost unlimited power to quell what the government said was expected to be \\"a climax of violent demonstrations\\". Six hundred police were transported to Brisbane from elsewhere in the state. In the week before the match, 40 trade unions staged a 24-hour strike, protesting against the proclamation. A crowd of demonstrators also mounted a peaceful protest outside the Springboks' Wickham Terrace motel and were chased on foot by police moments after being ordered to retreat, with many police attacking the crowd with batons, boots and fists. It was one of a series of violent attacks by police on demonstrators during the Springboks' visit to Queensland.Springboks The football game was played to a crowd of 7000 behind a high barbed-wire fence without incident. The state of emergency, which gave the government the appearance of being strong-willed and decisive, helped steer the government to victory in both by-elections held on match day. Police Special Branch member Don Lane was one of those elected, becoming a political ally of the Premier.Whitrod, R. (18 October 2000). Full transcript of interview , australianbiography.gov.au/subjects/whitrod/interview9.html; accessed 21 June 2017. Bjelke-Petersen praised police for their \\"restraint\\" during the demonstrations and rewarded the police union for its support with an extra week's leave for every officer in the state. He described the tension over the Springboks' tour as \\"great fun, a game of chess in the political arena\\". The crisis, he said, \\"put me on the map\\". The following May‚Äîsix months before the Labor Party's landslide victory at the 1972 Australian federal election under Gough Whitlam‚Äîthe Country-Liberal coalition gained another comprehensive win at the 1972 Queensland state election: Bjelke-Petersen's party took 26 seats with 20% of the vote, the Liberals took 21 seats with a 22.2% share and Labor got 33 seats from 46.7%. It was the first state election to be fought following a 1971 electoral redistribution that added four seats to the parliament and created four electoral zones with a weightage towards rural seats, with the result that while Brisbane electorates averaged about 22,000 voters, some rural seats such as Gregory and Balonne had fewer than 7000. Political ascendancy, 1971‚Äì78 From 1971, under the guidance of newly hired press secretary Allen Callaghan, a former Australian Broadcasting Corporation political journalist, Bjelke-Petersen developed a high level of sophistication in dealing with news media. He held daily media conferences where he joked that he \\"fed the chooks\\", established direct telex links to newsrooms where he could feed professionally written media releases and became adept at distributing press releases on deadline so journalists had very little chance to research news items. The Premier's public profile rose rapidly with the resulting media coverage. Bjelke-Petersen began regular media and parliamentary attacks on the Whitlam Labor government, vowing to have it defeated, and he and Whitlam exchanged frequent verbal barbs, culminating in the prime minister's 1975 description of the Queensland premier as \\"a Bible- bashing bastard ... a paranoic, a bigot and fanatical\\". The pair clashed over federal plans to halt the sale of Queensland coal to Japan, take over the administration of Aboriginal affairs, remove outback petrol subsidies and move the Australian border in the Torres Strait southwards to a point midway between Queensland and Papua New Guinea. Bjelke-Petersen also vehemently opposed the Whitlam government's proposal for Medicare, a publicly funded universal health care system. The battles helped to consolidate Bjelke- Petersen's power as he used the media to emphasise a distinctive Queensland identity he alleged was under threat from the \\"socialist\\" federal government. The Queensland government bought a single-engine aircraft for the Premier's use in November 1971, upgrading it to a twin-engine aircraft in 1973 and even bigger model in 1975. Bjelke-Petersen, a licensed pilot, used it often to visit far-flung parts of the state to campaign and boost his public profile. In April 1974, in a bid to broaden its appeal beyond rural voters, the Country Party changed its name to the National Party. =The Gair affair= In April 1974 Bjelke-Petersen outmanoeuvred Whitlam after the prime minister offered Democratic Labor Party senator Vince Gair, a bitter opponent of the government, the position of ambassador to Ireland as a way of creating an extra vacant Senate position in Queensland. Whitlam, who lacked a majority in the Senate, hoped Gair's seat would be won by his Labor Party. But when the arrangement was disclosed by newspapers before Gair had resigned from the Senate, the Opposition conspired to keep Gair away from the Senate President (to whom Gair had not yet given his resignation) and ensured he voted in a Senate debate late that night to avoid any move to backdate the resignation. At 5.15pm the Queensland Cabinet met to pass a \\"flying minute\\" and advised the Governor, Sir Colin Hannah, to issue writs for five, rather than six, vacancies, denying Labor the chance of gaining Gair's Senate spot.Don't you worry about that! ‚Äì The Joh Bjelke-Petersen Memoirs (summary), Joh Bjelke- Petersen, 1990. Retrieved 13 January 2010. The intention was to have Gair's seat declared a casual vacancy, allowing Bjelke-Petersen to fill the vacancy until the next election. Labor argued that Gair's appointment, and hence his departure from the senate, was effective from no later than when the Irish government accepted his appointment, in March. This was a matter of protracted debate in the Senate over many days, and was never resolved, but it was rendered irrelevant when Whitlam called a double dissolution of both Houses, in an election gamble he only narrowly won. =1974 state election= In October 1974 Bjelke-Petersen called an early election, setting the 1974 Queensland election for 7 December, declaring it would be fought on \\"the alien and stagnating, centralist, socialist, communist-inspired policies of the federal Labor government\\". The premier visited 70 towns and cities in the five-week campaign and attracted record crowds to public meetings. The result was a spectacular rout for the Labor Party, which was left with just 11 of the legislature's 82 seats after a 16.5 percent swing to the Coalition, leading observers to call Labor's caucus a \\"cricket team.\\" The only seat Labor retained north of Rockhampton was Cairns, by fewer than 200 votes. The National Party, contesting its first state election under the new name and fielding candidates in just 48 seats, lifted its vote from 19.7 percent to 28 percent, creating a threat for the Liberal Party, and also picked up a number of city seats including its first in Brisbane, the eastern suburbs seat of Wynnum. The Nationals even managed to oust Labor leader Perc Tucker in his own seat. The Australian newspaper named Bjelke-Petersen, whom it described as the \\"undistinguished\\" Queensland premier, \\"Australian of the Year\\", citing \\"the singular impact he has exerted on national political life\\". =Role in the Whitlam dismissal= In 1975, Bjelke-Petersen played what turned out to be a key role in the political crisis that brought down the Whitlam government. When Queensland Labor Senator Bertie Milliner died suddenly in June 1975, Bjelke-Petersen requested from the Labor Party a short list of three nominees, from which he would pick one to replace Milliner. The ALP refused to supply such a list, instead nominating Mal Colston, an unsuccessful Labor candidate in the 1970 election, whom Bjelke-Petersen duly rejected. On 3 September Bjelke-Petersen announced that he had selected political novice Albert Field, a long-time ALP member who was critical of the Whitlam government. Field's appointment was the subject of a High Court challenge and he was on leave from October 1975. During this period, the Coalition led by Malcolm Fraser declined to allot a pair to balance Field's absence. This gave the Coalition control over the Senate. Fraser used that control to obstruct passage of the Supply Bills through Parliament, denying Whitlam's by now unpopular government the legal capacity to appropriate funds for government business and leading to his dismissal as Prime Minister. During the tumultuous election campaign precipitated by Whitlam's dismissal by Sir John Kerr, Bjelke-Petersen alleged that Queensland police investigations had uncovered damaging documentation in relation to the Loans Affair. This documentation was never made public and these allegations remained unsubstantiated. =Taxation reform= Queensland was renowned for being the lowest taxed state in Australia for much of Bjelke- Petersen's tenure. Over heated objections by Treasurer Gordon Chalk, Bjelke- Petersen in 1977 announced the removal of state death duties, a move that cost his state $30 million in revenue. So many New South Wales and Victorian residents sought to establish their permanent address in Queensland as a result, boosting state coffers with stamp duty from property transactions, that other states followed suit within months and also abolished the tax. To help compensate for lost revenue, the government introduced football pools; four years later the government granted a casino licence on the Gold Coast, although this too was mired in allegations of corruption and favouritism. =Restriction of civil liberties, growth of police power= Issues of police powers and civil liberties, first raised at the time of the 1971 Springboks tour, resurfaced in July 1976 with a major street demonstration in which more than a thousand university students marched towards the Brisbane city centre to demand better allowances from the federal government. Police stopped the march in Coronation Drive and television cameras captured an incident during the confrontation in which a police inspector struck a 20-year-old female protester over the head with his baton, injuring her. When Police Commissioner Ray Whitrod announced he would hold an inquiry, a move supported by Police Minister Max Hodges, Bjelke-Petersen declared there would be no inquiry. He told reporters he was tired of radical groups believing they could take over the streets. Police officers passed a motion at a meeting commending the premier for his \\"distinct stand against groups acting outside the law\\" and censured Whitrod. A week later Bjelke-Petersen relieved Hodges of his police portfolio. Secure in the knowledge that they had the Premier's backing, police officers continued to act provocatively, most notably in a military-style raid on a hippie commune at the Cedar Bay commune in Far North Queensland late the following month. The police, who had been looking for marijuana, set fire to the residents' houses and destroyed their property. Bjelke-Petersen rejected calls for an inquiry into the raid, declaring the government would believe the police and claiming the public clamour was \\"all part of an orchestrated campaign to legalise marijuana and denigrate the police\\". In defiance of the premier, Whitrod went ahead with an inquiry anyway and on 16 November ordered summonses be issued against four police officers on more than 25 charges, including arson. He chose the same day to announce that he was quitting his post. Whitrod claimed his resignation marked a victory for the forces of corruption, but said he had decided to quit rather than tolerate further political interference by the premier and new Police Minister Tom Newbery. Whitrod said Queensland showed signs of becoming a police state and he compared the growing political interference in law enforcement to the rise of the German Nazi state. Whitrod was replaced by Assistant Commissioner Terry Lewis, despite Whitrod's warning to the Police Minister that he was corrupt. In 1977, Bjelke-Petersen announced that \\"the day of street marches is over\\", warning protesters: \\"Don't bother applying for a march permit. You won't get one. That's government policy now!\\" Liberal parliamentarians crossed the floor defending the right of association and assembly. One Liberal MP, Colin Lamont, told a meeting at the University of Queensland that the premier was engineering confrontation for electoral purposes and was confronted two hours later by an angry Bjelke-Petersen who said he was aware of the comments. Lamont later said he learned the Special Branch had been keeping files on Liberal rebels and reporting, not to their Commissioner, but directly to the Premier, commenting: \\"The police state had arrived.\\" When, after two ugly street battles between police and right-to-march protesters, the Uniting Church Synod called on the government to change the march law, Bjelke-Petersen accused the clergy of \\"supporting communists\\". His attack sparked a joint political statement by four other major religious denominations, which was shrugged off by the premier. The government's increasingly hardline approach to civil liberties prompted Queensland National Party president Robert Sparkes to warn the party that it was developing a dangerous \\"propaganda-created\\" ultra-conservative, almost fascist image. He told a party conference: \\"We must studiously avoid any statements or actions which suggest an extreme right-wing posture.\\" Bjelke-Petersen ignored the advice. He condemned the use of Australian foreign aid to prop up communist regimes, urged Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to stop criticising the governments of South Africa and Rhodesia and from 1977 proposed Queensland secede from Australia and establish its own currency. He also accused political opponents of being covert communists bent on anarchy, observing: \\"I have always found ... you can campaign on anything you like but nothing is more effective than communism ... If he's a Labor man, he's a socialist and a very dangerous man.\\" Three weeks before the 1977 Queensland election, 400 demonstrators were arrested in what a Melbourne newspaper called \\"Joh's War\\". Aided by an electoral redistribution that removed two Liberal-held seats, the Nationals won 35 out of 82 seats, compared with 24 for the Liberals and 23 for a resurgent Labor Party. It was the first time in Queensland political history the Nationals had outpolled the Liberals. Bjelke-Petersen used the party's strength to move key Cabinet posts that had long held by the Liberals into the hands of National Party ministers. In October 1978 thousands of demonstrators again attempted to defy anti-march laws with a protest march in Albert St, Brisbane, which was again repulsed by police lined five deep. In a Brisbane byelection a month later National Party support slumped to just 10 percent, half of what party strategists had expected. But by the end of 1978, both the state Liberal and Labor parties had new parliamentary leaders‚Äîthe fourth Labor opposition leader during Bjelke- Petersen's reign and the third Liberal leader. Disintegration of National- Liberal coalition, 1980‚Äì86 Florence Bjelke-Petersen was elected to the Senate in October 1980 as a National Party member and six weeks later Joh was successful for a fifth time as premier at the 1980 Queensland election, with the Nationals converting a 27.9 percent primary vote‚Äîtheir highest ever‚Äîinto 35 of the parliament's 82 seats, or 43 percent of seats. It also created a record 13-seat lead over their coalition partners, the Liberals, who had campaigned by offering Queenslanders an alternative style of moderate government. The Nationals picked up all four Gold Coast seats and all those on the Sunshine Coast. Once again the premier took advantage of his party's dominance over the Liberals in Cabinet, this time demanding that the seven Liberal ministers sign a coalition agreement in which they promised unquestioned allegiance to Cabinet decisions. The move turned the Nationals' 35 votes to a guaranteed majority of 42 in the House, effectively neutralising any potential opposition by the 15 Liberal backbenchers. Bjelke-Petersen began making appointments, including judges and the chairmanship of the Totalisator Agency Board, that had traditionally been the domain of Liberal ministers, and accusations arose of political interference and conflicts of interest as mining contracts, casino licences and the rights to build shopping complexes were awarded to business figures with National Party links. Accusations of political interference also arose when police released without charge TAB chairman Sir Edward Lyons, a National Party trustee and close friend of Bjelke-Petersen, after a breathalyser test showed he was driving with more than double the legal blood alcohol limit. Relations with the Liberal Party continued to deteriorate. By August 1983, after 26 years of coalition, they had reached their nadir. Bjelke-Petersen was angered by a Liberal Party bid to establish a public accounts committee to examine government expenditure. Shortly afterward, Liberal leader Llew Edwards was ousted in a party room coup by Terry White, who had long advocated a greater role for the Liberals in the Coalition. Bjelke-Petersen refused to give Edwards' old post of deputy premier to White, choosing instead to adjourn parliament ‚Äî which had sat for just 15 days that year‚Äîdeclined to say when it would sit again, and insisted he could govern alone without the need of a coalition, commenting: \\"The government of Queensland is in very, very good hands.\\" Labor leader Tom Burns said the closure of parliament showed \\"that no rules exist in the state of Queensland.\\" In a fortnight of political crisis, Bjelke-Petersen defied an ultimatum by Liberal parliamentarians to accept their leader in Cabinet, prompting White to tear up the Coalition agreement and lead the Liberals to the crossbench. Watching with satisfaction as the Liberal Party engaged in vitriolic infighting, Bjelke-Petersen called an election for 22 October, claiming: \\"I really believe we can govern Queensland in our own right.\\" The campaign coincided with the launch of an \\"official\\" Bjelke-Petersen biography, Jigsaw, which lauded him as a \\"statesman extraordinaire\\" and \\"protectorate of Queensland and her people\\". Further rubbing salt in the wounds of his former coalition partners, his campaign was boosted by the support of prominent Liberals from other states including Tasmanian premier Robin Gray and former Victorian and NSW premiers Sir Henry Bolte and Tom Lewis. The Nationals also poured significant resources into Brisbane-area Liberal seats, seeing a chance to not only win government in their own right, but destroy their former Liberal partners. Three months before his 73rd birthday, Bjelke-Petersen and his party recorded a resounding victory, attracting 38.9 percent of the primary vote to give them exactly half the parliament's 82 seats, just one short of a majority. Labor, with 44 percent of the vote, won 32 seats. The Liberals were decimated, losing all but eight of their 21 seats. Bjelke- Petersen openly urged Liberals to cross the floor to the Nationals in hopes of getting an outright majority. Just three days later, two Liberals‚Äîformer ministers Don Lane and Brian Austin‚Äîtook up Bjelke-Petersen's offer and joined the Nationals in return for seats in cabinet. With Lane and Austin's defections, the National Party was able to form a majority government for the first time at the state level in Australia. In 1984 Bjelke-Petersen was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) for \\"services to parliamentary democracy\\".It's an Honour Author Evan Whitton suggests the premier had made the nomination himself. In 1985 Bjelke-Petersen unveiled plans for another electoral redistribution to create seven new seats in four zones: four in the state's populous south-east (with an average enrolment of 19,357 electors per seat) and three in country areas (with enrolments as low as 9386). The boundaries were to be drawn by electoral commissioners specially appointed by the government; one of them, Cairns lawyer Sir Thomas Covacevich, was a fundraiser for the National Party. The malapportionment meant that a vote in the state's west was worth two in Brisbane and the provincial cities. A University of Queensland associate professor of government described the redistribution as \\"the most criminal act ever perpetrated in politics ... the worst zonal gerrymander in the history of the world\\" and the most serious action of Bjelke-Petersen's political career. A \\"Joh for PM\\" campaign was conceived in late 1985, driven largely by a group of Gold Coast property developers, promoting Bjelke-Petersen as the most effective conservative challenger to Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and at the 1986 Queensland election he recorded his biggest electoral win ever, winning 49 of the state's 89 seats with 39.6 percent of the primary vote. The ALP's 41.3 percent share of the vote earned it 30 seats, while the Liberal Party won the remaining 10 seats. In his victory speech, Bjelke-Petersen declared the Nationals had prevailed over the \\"three forces\\" who had opposed it: \\"We had the ALP organisation with its deceits, deception and lies, we had the media encouraging and supporting them, and we had the Liberal Party ... our assault on Canberra begins right now.\\" It was the seventh and final electoral victory of the Bjelke-Petersen era. In January 1987 the premier handed control of the state to Deputy Premier Bill Gunn and announced he would seek election to the House of Representatives, formally embarking on his \\"Joh for Canberra\\" push. By early 1987 the campaign, with its promise of a 25 percent flat tax, was attracting the support of 20 per cent of voters in opinion polls. Downfall and resignation: 1987 In late 1986, two journalists, the ABC's Chris Masters and The Courier-Mail's Phil Dickie, independently began investigating the extent of police and political corruption in Queensland and its links to the National Party state government. Dickie's reports, alleging the apparent immunity from prosecution enjoyed by a group of illegal brothel operators, began appearing in early 1987; Masters' explosive Four Corners investigative report on police corruption entitled The Moonlight State aired on 11 May 1987. Within a week, Acting Premier Gunn decided to initiate a wide-ranging Commission of Inquiry into police corruption, despite opposition from Bjelke-Petersen. Gunn selected former Federal Court judge Tony Fitzgerald as its head. By late June, the terms of inquiry of what became known as the Fitzgerald Inquiry had been widened from members of the force to include \\"any other persons\\" with whom police might have been engaged in misconduct since 1977. On 27 May 1987, Prime Minister Hawke called a federal election for 11 July, catching Bjelke-Petersen unprepared. The premier had flown to the United States two days earlier and had not yet nominated for a federal seat; on 3 June he abandoned his ambitions to become prime minister and resumed his position in the Queensland government. The announcement came too late for the non-Labor forces, as Bjelke-Petersen had pressured the federal Nationals to pull out of the Coalition. Due to a number of three-cornered contests, Labor won a sweeping victory. Fitzgerald began his formal hearings on 27 July 1987, and a month later the first bombshells were dropped as Sgt Harry Burgess‚Äîaccused of accepting $221,000 in bribes since 1981‚Äîimplicated senior officers Jack Herbert, Noel Dwyer, Graeme Parker and Commissioner Terry Lewis in complex graft schemes. Other allegations quickly followed, and on 21 September Police Minister Gunn ordered Lewis‚Äîknighted in 1986 at Bjelke-Petersen's behest and now accused of having taken $663,000 in bribes‚Äîto stand down. The ground had begun to shift out from under Bjelke-Petersen's feet even before the hearings began. The first allegations of corruption prompted the Labor opposition to ask the Governor, Sir Walter Campbell, to use his reserve power to sack Bjelke-Petersen. His position deteriorated rapidly; ministers were openly opposing him in Cabinet meetings, which had been almost unthinkable for most of his tenure. Throughout 1986, Bjelke-Petersen had pushed for approval of construction of the world's tallest skyscraper in the Brisbane CBD, which had been announced in May. The project, which had not been approved by the Brisbane City Council, enraged his backbenchers. During a party meeting, MP Huan Fraser confronted Bjelke-Petersen, saying \\"I know there is a bloody big payoff to you coming as a result of this. You're a corrupt old bastard, and I'm not going to cop it.\\"Knocking off the hillbilly dictator: Joh's corruption finally comes out; Mitchell, Alex; Crikey, 24 September 2015 All Fall Down Condon, Matthew; University of Queensland Press, 2015 By this time, Sparkes had also turned against Bjelke-Petersen, and was pressuring him to retire. On 7 October, Bjelke-Petersen announced he would retire from politics on 8 August 1988, the 20th anniversary of his swearing-in. Six weeks later, on 23 November 1987, Bjelke-Petersen visited Campbell and advised him to sack the entire Cabinet and appoint a new one with redistributed portfolios. Under normal circumstances, Campbell would have been bound by convention to act on Bjelke- Petersen's advice. However, Campbell persuaded Bjelke-Petersen to limit his demand to ask for the resignations of those ministers he wanted removed.Walter Campbell \\"Letter from Governor Walter Campbell to Premier Bjelke Petersen, 25 November 1987,\\" 1 in Walter Campbell, Johannes Bjelke Petersen & Michael J. Ahern, Copies of correspondence relating to the change-over from the Bjelke- Petersen government to the Ahern government in late 1987. (Brisbane: Queensland Government, 1988). Bjelke-Petersen then demanded the resignation of five of his ministers, including Gunn and Health Minister Mike Ahern. All refused. Gunn, believing Bjelke-Petersen intended to take over the police portfolio and terminate the Fitzgerald Inquiry, announced he would challenge for the leadership. Bjelke-Petersen persisted regardless and decided to sack three ministers‚ÄîAhern, Austin and Peter McKechnie‚Äîon the grounds of displaying insufficient loyalty. The next day, Bjelke-Petersen formally advised Campbell to sack Ahern, Austin and McKechnie and call an early election. However, Ahern, Gunn and Austin told Campbell that Bjelke-Petersen no longer had enough parliamentary support to govern. While Campbell agreed to the ouster of Ahern, Gunn and Austin, he was reluctant to call fresh elections for a legislature that was only a year old. He thus concluded that the crisis was a political one in which he should not be involved. He also believed that Bjelke-Petersen was no longer acting rationally. After Bjelke-Petersen refused numerous requests for a party meeting, the party's management committee called one for 26 November. At this meeting, a spill motion was carried by a margin of 38‚Äì9. Bjelke-Petersen boycotted the meeting, and thus did not nominate for the ensuing leadership vote, which saw Ahern elected as the new leader and Gunn elected as deputy. Ahern promptly wrote to Campbell seeking to be commissioned as premier.Michael J. Ahern, \\"Letter from Parliamentary Leader of the State Parliamentary National Party Mike Ahern to His Excellency Governor Walter Campbell on 26 November 1987,\\" in Walter Campbell, Johannes Bjelke Petersen & Michael J. Ahern, Copies of correspondence relating to the change-over from the Bjelke-Petersen government to the Ahern government in late 1987. (Brisbane: Queensland Government, 1988). This normally should have been a pro forma request, given the Nationals' outright majority. However, Bjelke- Petersen insisted he was still premier, and even sought the support of his old Liberal and Labor foes in order to stay in office. However, even with the combined support of the Liberals and Labor, Bjelke-Petersen would have needed a significant number of National floor-crossings to keep his post. Despite Bjelke-Petersen's seemingly tenuous position, Campbell had received legal advice that he could sack Bjelke-Petersen only if he tried to stay in office after being defeated in the legislature.\\"Memorandum from the Solicitor General, 26 November 1987,\\" Section 7, in Walter Campbell, Johannes Bjelke Petersen & Michael J. Ahern, Copies of correspondence relating to the change- over from the Bjelke-Petersen government to the Ahern government in late 1987 (Brisbane: Queensland Government, 1988). This was per longstanding constitutional practice in Australia, which calls for a first minister (Prime Minister at the federal level, premier at the state level, chief minister at the territorial level) to stay in office unless he resigns or is defeated in the House. The result was a situation in which, as the Sydney Morning Herald put it, Queensland had a \\"Premier who is not leader\\" and the National Party a \\"Leader who is not Premier\\".Peter Bowers and Greg Roberts, 'Ahern leads, but Joh rules', Sydney Morning Herald, 27 November 1987. Cited in Barlow & Corkery (2007), p.23 The crisis continued till 1 December, when Bjelke-Petersen announced his retirement from politics.Whitton, Evan. \\"When the Sunshine State set up a scoundrel trap\\", The Australian, 12 May 2007 He declared: > The policies of the National Party are no longer those on which I went to > the people.

It > was my intention to take this matter to the floor of State Parliament. > However, I now have no further interest in leading the National Party any > further.Political Chronicle (34(2), June 1988) Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by- election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.\\"Vote for Libs, says Joh, the Nats are lost\\", The Courier-Mail, 15 March 1988, pg 2. Aftermath: 1988‚Äì2003 In February 1988, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal announced a hearing into the suitability of entrepreneur Alan Bond, the owner of the Nine TV network, to hold a broadcasting licence. The investigation centered on the network's $400,000 payout to Bjelke-Petersen in 1985 to settle a defamation action launched by the premier in 1983. Bond had made the payment (negotiated from an initial $1 million claim) soon after buying the network and a major Queensland brewery and claimed in a later television interview that Bjelke- Petersen told him he would need to make the payment if he wished to continue business in Queensland. (In April 1989 the broadcasting tribunal found that Bjelke-Petersen had placed Bond in a position of \\"commercial blackmail\\".) Bjelke-Petersen (left) with minister Russ HinzeBjelke-Petersen was called to the Fitzgerald corruption inquiry on 1 December 1988, where he said that, despite allegations raised in the media and parliament, he had held no suspicion in the previous decade of corruption in Queensland. He said a Hong Kong businessman's 1986 donation of $100,000 to an election slush fund‚Äîdelivered in cash at the premier's Brisbane office‚Äîwas not unusual, and that he did not know the identity of other donors who had left sums of $50,000 and $60,000 in cash at his office on other occasions. Questioned by barrister Michael Forde, Bjelke-Petersen‚Äîwhose citation for his 1984 knighthood noted that he was \\"a strong believer in historic tradition of parliamentary democracy\\"‚Äîwas also unable to explain the doctrine of separation of powers under the Westminster system. Under Ahern (1987‚Äì89) and Russell Cooper (1989), the Nationals were unable to overcome the damage from the revelations about the massive corruption in the Bjelke-Petersen government. At the 1989 state election, Labor swept the Nationals from power in a 24-seat swing‚Äîat the time, the worst defeat of a sitting government since responsible government was introduced in Queensland. As a result of the Fitzgerald inquiry, Lewis was tried, convicted, and jailed on corruption charges. He was later stripped of his knighthood and other honours. A number of other officials, including ministers Don Lane and Austin were also jailed. Another former minister, Russ Hinze, died while awaiting trial. In 1991 Bjelke-Petersen faced criminal trial for perjury arising out of the evidence he had given to the Fitzgerald inquiry (an earlier proposed charge of corruption was incorporated into the perjury charge). Bjelke-Petersen's former police Special Branch bodyguard Sergeant Bob Carter told the court that in 1986 he had twice been given packages of cash totalling $210,000 at the premier's office. He was told to take them to a Brisbane city law firm and then watch as the money was deposited in a company bank account. The money had been given over by developer Sng Swee Lee, and the bank account was in the name of Kaldeal, operated by Sir Edward Lyons, a trustee of the National Party.\\"Joh a great servant: jury foreman\\", Australian 27.042007 John Huey, a Fitzgerald Inquiry investigator, later told Four Corners: \\"I said to Robert Sng, 'Well what did Sir Joh say to you when you gave him this large sum of money?' And he said, \\"All he said was, 'thank you, thank you, thank you'.\\" The jury could not agree on a verdict. In 1992 it was revealed that the jury foreman, Luke Shaw, was a member of the Young Nationals and was identified with the \\"Friends of Joh\\" movement. A special prosecutor announced in 1992 there would be no retrial because Bjelke-Petersen, then aged 81, was too old. Developer Sng Swee Lee refused to return from Singapore for a retrial. Bjelke-Petersen said his defence costs sent him broke.\\"Sir Joh was loathed and loved\\", The Age, 23 April 2005 Bjelke-Petersen's memoirs, Don't You Worry About That: The Joh Bjelke-Petersen Memoirs, were published the same year. He retired to Bethany where his son John and wife Karyn set up bed and breakfast cottages on the property. He developed progressive supranuclear palsy, a condition similar to Parkinson's disease. In 2003, he lodged a $338 million compensation claim with the Queensland Labor government for loss of business opportunities resulting from the Fitzgerald inquiry. The claim was based on the assertion that the inquiry had not been lawfully commissioned by state cabinet and that it had acted outside its powers. The government rejected the claim; in his advice to the government, tabled in parliament, Crown Solicitor Conrad Lohe recommended dismissing the claim and said Bjelke- Petersen was \\"fortunate\\" not to have faced a second trial.\\"Sir Joh's compensation claim rejected\\", The Age, 10 July 2003 Death Bjelke-Petersen died in St Aubyn's Hospital in Kingaroy in April 2005, aged 94, with his wife and family members by his side. He received a State Funeral, held in Kingaroy Town Hall, at which the then Prime Minister, John Howard, and Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie were speakers.Tributes, protest mark Sir Joh's funeral ‚Äî Australian Broadcasting Corporation Beattie, who had been sued by Bjelke- Petersen for defamation and was arrested during the 1971 Springbok tour protests, said: \\"I think too often in the adversarial nature of politics we forget that behind every leader, behind every politician, is indeed a family and we shouldn't forget that.\\" As the funeral was taking place in Kingaroy, about 200 protesters gathered in Brisbane to \\"ensure that those who suffered under successive Bjelke-Petersen governments were not forgotten\\". Protest organiser Drew Hutton said \\"Queenslanders should remember what is described as a dark passage in the state's history.\\" Bjelke-Petersen was buried \\"beside his trees that he planted and he nurtured and they grew\\" at the family property \\"Bethany\\" at Kingaroy. Malapportionment Bjelke-Petersen's government was kept in power in part due to an electoral malapportionment where rural electoral districts had significantly fewer enrolled voters than those in metropolitan areas. This system was introduced by the Labor Party in 1949 as an overt electoral fix in order to concentrate its base of voters in regional towns and rural areas in as many districts as possible. Under Nicklin the bias in favour of rural constituencies was maintained, but reworked to favour the Country and Liberal parties by carving new Country-leaning seats in the hinterlands of provincial areas and Liberal-leaning seats in Brisbane. The bias worked to Bjelke-Petersen's benefit in his first election as premier, in 1969. His Country Party won only 21 percent of the primary vote, finishing third behind Labor and the Liberals. However, due to the Country Party's heavy concentration of support in the provincial and rural zones, it won 26 seats, seven more than the Liberals. Combined, the Coalition had 45 seats out of 78, enough to consign Labor to opposition even though it finished percentage points ahead of the Coalition on the two-party vote. While in opposition, Bjelke-Petersen had vehemently criticised the 1949 redistribution, claiming that Labor was effectively telling Queenslanders, \\"Whether you like it or not, we will be the government.\\" In 1972, Bjelke-Petersen strengthened the system to favour his own party. To the three existing electoral zones‚Äîmetropolitan Brisbane, provincial and rural‚Äîwas added a fourth zone, the remote zone. The seats in this area had even fewer enrolled electors than seats in the rural zone‚Äîin some cases, as few as a third of the enrolled electors in a typical Brisbane seat. This had the effect of packing Labor support into the Brisbane area and the provincial cities. On average, it took only 7,000 votes to win a Country/National seat, versus 12,000 for a Labor seat. This gross distortion led to his opponents referring to it as the \\"Bjelkemander\\", a play on the term \\"gerrymander\\". The 1985 proposal would have made the malapportionment even more severe, to the point that a vote in Brisbane would have only been worth half a country vote. The lack of a state upper house (which Queensland had abolished in 1922) allowed legislation to be passed without the need to negotiate with other political parties. Character and attitudes =Authoritarianism= Queensland political scientist Rae Wear described Bjelke-Petersen as an authoritarian who treated democratic values with contempt and was intolerant and resentful of opposition, yet who also demonstrated a down-home charm and old-fashioned courtesies as well as kindness to colleagues. Those who worked closely with him described him as stubborn with a propensity to fly into rages in which he would \\"rant and rave like Adolf Hitler\\", creating \\"fantastic performances\\" as he shook with rage, becoming increasingly incoherent. Many of his National Party colleagues were in terror of him on such occasions. Raised by migrant parents in spartan rural surroundings, he combined a strong work ethic with an ascetic lifestyle that was strongly shaped by his Lutheran upbringing. As a young man Bjelke-Petersen lived alone for 15 years in an old cow bail with a leaky bark roof and only the most basic of facilities. He had a lifelong habit of hard work and long days and while premier often slept for just four hours a night. He valued \\"the School of Life, the hard knocks of life\\" more than formal education and showed little respect for academics and universities, although he accepted an honorary doctorate of Laws from the University of Queensland in May 1985, prompting criticism from both students and staff. Wear dismissed Bjelke- Petersen's claim that he was a reluctant and accidental entrant into state politics, concluding that he \\"seized opportunity whenever it presented and held tenaciously to power\\", and was later willing to use any device to remain premier. She said that although Bjelke-Petersen denied ever knowing anything about corruption, \\"the evidence suggests this is untrue. He ignored it because to acknowledge its presence was to hand a weapon to his political enemies and because he was prepared to trade off corruption for police loyalty\\". Biographers have suggested that Bjelke-Petersen, raised under a resented patriarch, himself came to play the strong patriarch, refusing to be accountable to anyone: \\"Rather than explaining himself or answering questions, he demanded to be taken on trust.\\"J. Walter, \\"Johnannes Bjelke-Petersen\\", The Premiers of Queensland, 2nd edn, eds Denis Murphy, Roger Joyce, Margaret Cribb, University of Queensland Press, 1978, p 499. He believed God had chosen him to save Australia from socialism and also had a profound sense of Christian conscience that he said guided political decisions, explaining, \\"Your whole instinct cries out whether it's good or bad.\\" A cousin of Bjelke- Petersen said the premier \\"has an inner certainty that he knows the answers to our political and social woes\\" and as a good Christian expected to be trusted, thus needing no constitutional checks and balances. =Relations with the media= Guided by media adviser Allen Callaghan, with whom he worked from 1971 to 1979, Bjelke-Petersen was an astute manager of news media. He made himself available to reporters and held daily press conferences where he \\"fed the chooks\\". Callaghan released a steady stream of press releases, timing them to coincide with periods when news editors were most desperate for news. For most of Bjelke-Petersen's premiership, Queensland newspapers were supportive of his government, generally supporting the police and government on the street march issue, while Brisbane's Courier-Mail endorsed the return of the coalition government at every state election between 1957 and 1986. According to Rae Wear, Bjelke-Petersen demanded total loyalty of the media and was unforgiving and vindictive if reporting was not to his satisfaction. In 1984, he reacted to a series of critical articles in the Courier-Mail by switching the government's million-dollar classified advertising account to the rival Daily Sun. He banned a Courier-Mail reporter who was critical of his excessive use of the government aircraft and Wear claims other journalists who wrote critical articles became the subject of rumour-mongering, were harassed by traffic police, or found that \\"leaks\\" from the government dried up. Journalists covering industrial disputes and picketing were also afraid of arrest. In 1985, the Australian Journalists Association withdrew from the system of police passes because of police refusal to accredit certain journalists. Journalists, editors and producers were also deterred from critical stories by Bjelke-Petersen's increasing use of defamation actions in order to try to \\"stop talk about a corrupt government\\". Queensland historian Ross Fitzgerald was threatened with criminal libel in 1984 when he sought to publish a critical history of the state.Tony Koch, \\"Three-year book deal on history\\", The Australian, 17 August 2007. The premier and his ministers launched 24 defamation actions against the Opposition leader and Labor Party and trade union figures, with 14 of them publicly funded. He saw no role for the media in making government accountable, telling the Australian Financial Review in 1986: \\"The greatest thing that could happen to the state and the nation is when we get rid of the media. Then we would live in peace and tranquillity and no one would know anything.\\" Callaghan's advice to Bjelke- Petersen included the recommendation that he maintain his rambling style of communication with mangled syntax, recognising it added to his homespun appeal to ordinary people and also allowed him to avoid giving answers. His catchphrase response to unwelcome queries was, \\"Don't you worry about that\\", a phrase that was used as the title of his 1990 memoir. Wear wrote: \\"His verbal stumbling communicated decent simplicity and trustworthiness and, in order to enhance his popular appeal, Bjelke-Petersen appears to have exaggerated, or at least not tried to rid himself of, his famous speaking style.\\" =Heritage and environment= Bellevue Hotel, controversially demolished in 1979 The premier showed little concern for heritage and environmental issues, attracting widespread public fury over the 1979 demolition of Brisbane's historic Bellevue Hotel and favouring oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef and sand mining on Moreton Island. He opposed the expansion of Aboriginal land rights, barred state officials from meeting World Council of Churches delegates who were studying the treatment of Aborigines in Queensland and demonstrated a strong moralistic streak, banning Playboy magazine, opposing school sex education and condom vending machines and in 1980 proposing a ban on women flying south for abortions. In May 1985 the government conducted a series of raids on so-called abortion clinics. =Industrial relations= Bjelke- Petersen had a confrontational approach to industrial relations. As a backbencher he had made clear his opposition to unions and the 40-hour week and in 1979 he pushed for legislation that would lead to the lifetime loss of a driver's licence for union members using their own vehicles to organise strikes. For four days in 1981, Queensland power workers had been using rotating blackouts and restrictions as a means of pressure. Bjelke-Petersen responded by closing licensed clubs and hotels and publishing the names and addresses of the 260 involved workers, with the aim of inspiring members of the public to harass them. The intimidation tactic worked and the union resumed normal work schedules within 15 minutes of government ads arriving in Brisbane newspapers. \\"I believe the Government now knows how in the future to approach such disputes in essential services\\", said Bjelke-Petersen. In 1982 he ordered the dismissal of teachers who were conducting rolling stoppages on the issue of class sizes. The same year he invoked the Essential Services Act to declare a state of emergency when government blue-collar workers launched industrial action to support a 38-hour week. His biggest showdown with unions came in February 1985 when electrical workers, opposing the increasing use of contract labour in their industry, placed a ban on performing routine maintenance. Bjelke-Petersen ordered the shutdown of several of the states generators. That led to two weeks of blackouts. The government declared a state of emergency on 7 February, sacked as many as 1100 striking workers but offered their jobs back if they would sign a no-strike clause and work a 40-hour week; most accepted but 400 lost their jobs and superannuation. Labor compared the government with the Nazi regime, calling the new laws \\"police- state legislation\\". =Aboriginal people= Bjelke-Petersen believed that he and his government knew what was best for Aboriginal Australians. He excused racially discriminatory legislation as a protective measure and generally supported Aboriginal self-determination at least partly as striking a blow against the monolithic centralism of Canberra under Labor. In June 1976, Bjelke-Petersen blocked the proposed sale of a pastoral property on the Cape York Peninsula to a group of Aboriginal people, because according to cabinet policy, \\"The Queensland Government does not view favourably proposals to acquire large areas of additional freehold or leasehold land for development by Aborigines or Aboriginal groups in isolation.\\" cabinet memo dated September 1972, quoted in Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen . This dispute resulted in the case of Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen, which was decided partly in the High Court in 1982, and partly in the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1988. The courts found that Bjelke-Petersen's policy had discriminated against Aboriginal people. In 1978, the Uniting Church supported Aborigines at Aurukun and Mornington Island in their struggle with the Queensland Government after it granted a 1900 square kilometre mining lease to a mining consortium under extremely favourable conditions. The Aurukun people challenged the legislation, winning their case in the Supreme Court of Queensland but later losing when the Queensland Government appealed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Bjelke-Petersen was opposed by Sir Robert Sparkes, church groups and the federal government over a 1982 push to abolish Aboriginal and Islander community reserves and to give title to the reserve lands to local councils elected by communities‚Äîtitles that could be revoked by the government for unspecified reasons. Bjelke-Petersen claimed there were over-riding issues of defence and security because of fears of a communist plot to create a separate black nation in Australia. In 1982, Bjelke- Petersen also denied John Koowarta, an aboriginal man the sale of a large block of traditional aboriginal land, due to Aboriginal people 'not being allowed to buy large areas of land'. Koowarta appealed the decision to the High Court, arguing that the Queensland Government could not do this under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth). The High Court over ruled Bjelke- Petersen's decision, allowing the Wik nation's traditional land to be bought by Koowarta. =Anti- homosexual remarks= During his period in office Bjelke-Petersen frequently raised fears of a conspiracy of \\"southern homosexuals\\" to gain electoral advantage and to oppose the policies of the federal government or other states.Robinson, S. (2010) Homophobia as party politics: the construction of the 'homosexual deviant' in Joh Bjelke-Peterson's Queensland. Queensland Review 17: 29‚Äì46 =State development= Considerable development of the state's infrastructure took place during the Bjelke-Petersen era. He was a leading proponent of Wivenhoe and Burdekin Dams, encouraging the modernising and electrifying of the Queensland railway system, and the construction of the Gateway Bridge. Airports, coal mines, power stations, and dams were built throughout the state. James Cook University was established. In Brisbane, the Queensland Cultural Centre, Griffith University, the Southeast Freeway, and the Captain Cook, Gateway and Merivale bridges were all constructed, as well as the Parliamentary Annexe that was attached to Queensland Parliament House. Bjelke-Petersen was one of the instigators of World Expo 88 (now South Bank Parklands) and the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games. His government worked closely with property developers on the Gold Coast, who constructed resorts, hotels, a casino and a system of residential developments. In one controversial case, the Queensland government passed special legislation, the Sanctuary Cove Act 1985, to exempt a luxury development, Sanctuary Cove, from local government planning regulations. The developer, Mike Gore, was seen as a key member of the \\"white shoe brigade\\", a group of Gold Coast businessmen who became influential supporters of Bjelke-Petersen.Kelly, Paul. The End of Certainty, Allen & Unwin, 1994, pp. 291, 294 A similar piece of legislation was passed to allow the Japanese company, Iwasaki Sangyo, to develop a tourist resort near Yeppoon in Central Queensland. =Personal associations= From his youth he showed an entrepreneurial flair and a gift for invention and as premier was attracted to unorthodox and entrepreneurial medical and business figures such as inventor Stephen Horvath and cancer therapist Milan Brych, who had previously been removed from the New Zealand Medical Register.

Its body is semi-cobby, and unusually heavy for its size. It is an intelligent and playful active cat that forms strong bonds with people. Among the Korat's distinguishing characteristics are its heart-shaped head and large green eyes. The Korat is a natural breed, and one of the oldest stable cat breeds. Originating in Phimai, Thailand, it is named after its province of origin, Nakhon Ratchasima Province (typically called \\"Korat\\" by the Thai people). In Thailand, the breed is known as Si sawat, meaning \\"colour of the sawat seed\\". The Korat is known colloquially as the \\"good luck cat\\". Traditionally, they are given in pairs to newlyweds or people who are highly esteemed, for good luck. Until recently, Korats were not sold, but only given as gifts.  History  Korat cat and Siamese cat in Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems) thought to originate from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351 to 1767 AD). Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand. The probable first allusion to the breed is in the Thai Tamra Maew (The Cat-Book Poems), authored between 1350 and 1767 CE and now in the National Library of Thailand. However, the illustration of the Korat in this book is not detailed enough to be definitive as to the breed portrayed. In recent years, the Korat was pictured on a postage stamp in Thailand. An example hangs in the city of Korat's post office. Korats first appeared in Britain under the name \\"Blue Siamese\\" in 1889 and 1896, but these solid blue cats did not conform to the cat show judges' perception of a Siamese cat, and they disappeared by 1901. One early import, \\"Dwina\\", owned by Russian Blue breeder Mrs. Constance Carew-Cox and mentioned in Frances Simpson's The Book of the Cat (1903), reputedly produced a large number of \\"Siamese\\" kittens; the other, Mrs. B. Spearman's Blue Siamese male, \\"Nam Noi\\", was disqualified as a Siamese, but accepted in the Russian or Any Other Blue class in which he placed first (WR Hawkins, \\"Around the Pens\\", July 1896). Spearman tried unsuccessfully to import more of these \\"Blue Siamese\\". Korats first appeared in the US in the 1950s. In 1959, Cedar Glen cattery was the first to import a pair of Korats to the US for breeding: a male named Nara and a female named Darra. In 1966, the Korat was accepted into championship status, through the efforts of a breeder from Maryland.  Appearance  The Korat's unusual colour is actually a silver-tipped blue that appears to shimmer. The Thais refer to this colour as \\"rain-cloud grey\\", and the shimmer as \\"sea foam\\". This cat has a single coat that is short, with roots of a lighter silver blue. The hair shaft colour increases to deeper blue and the tips are silver, especially on the muzzle and toes. This is the only colour accepted for a Korat. The eyes are large and peridot green in an adult cat, but kittens have muddy, amber or golden-green coloured eyes which gradually change as they become adults, at two to four years. Although it is rare, Korats occasionally have striking or faint white markings or spots or even very faint grey stripes. Sometimes these spots increase in size with age. These are seen as flaws, and the cats are disqualified from competing in cat shows. However, such markings have no effect on personality or health. Thai Lilac, Thai Blue Point and Thai Lilac Point Thai Lilac kitten The first two Thai Lilac Points registered in the U.K.: Clairabelle Pixie Dust (2014) and Clairabelle Ninja Rococoa (2015) The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy recognizes Korat-type cats differing from the traditional solid blue appearance of the Korat on their experimental register. Such cats are registered as Thai Lilac if they are solid lilac. A Thai Blue Point exhibits the colourpoint pattern also seen in Siamese. A Thai Lilac Point also exhibits the colourpoint pattern also seen in Siamese, but in addition exhibits the Chocolate gene. These should not be confused with the Thai cat, a new name for the original (traditional or classic) Siamese cat type, with a rounder face and thicker body than modern \\"ultra-typed\\" Siamese. The policy for full registration of Korats only allows blue cats of full-registered parents or third-generation supplementary-registered parents. It also requires genetic testing for gangliosidosis to be carried out to ensure that the breed remains free of this inherited disease which once existed in some Korat and Thai breeding lines. The genes responsible for Pointeds and Lilacs were introduced into the Korat breed when new Korat breeding stock carrying the recessive genes was imported from Thailand. The first recorded Thai Lilac kitten was born to the Jenanca line in 1989, when \\"Jenanca Lilac Lillee\\" was born from two Korat parents in the U.K.. In 1990, Lillee's parents were re-mated with more lilac kittens resulting. A young male lilac was then born to another pair, also in the U.K., allowing more crossings without inbreeding too closely. The first recorded Thai Lilac Point was born to the Clairabelle line in 2014 when Clairabelle Pixie Dust was born from two Korat parents in the U.K.. A re-mating from the same parents resulted in another Thai Lilac Point, this time a boy, Clairabelle Ninja Rococoa. A third and fourth Thai Lilac Point has recently been born into the Jusarka line.  Temperament  The Korat has a very different temperament from other Thailand-derived cat breeds. They are intelligent, with a good memory. If they are brought to a place they have never been before, they can return home on their own. Male cats will not cross the line but female cats will. If they are living in a big group, they will use a hierarchy system. When fed, the sergeant of the group will eat first and then the other cats follow the hierarchy, though they will let kittens eat first. Female cats will teach their litters to survive and protect themselves by taking some small animal for the kittens to play with for practicing. Korat cats can remember their owner. If they see a stranger they might scare or make a noise, but they will run to their owner and play with them.

The neighboring municipalities of Nurmij√§rvi are Espoo, Vantaa, Tuusula, Hyvink√§√§ and Vihti, and it is part of the Greater Helsinki. The population of the municipality is inhabitants.11lj -- V√§est√∂rakenteen ennakkotiedot alueittain, 2019M01*-2019M11* (in Finnish) In recent decades, it has been one of the fastest growing municipalities in the Greater Helsinki and also in whole Finland in terms of population; even the 2020 corona pandemic hasn't shown a slowdown in growth of population.Miten k√§vi Nurmij√§rvi-ilmi√∂n korona aikaan? ‚ÄìHyvin, sanoo kunnan selvitys ‚Äì Maaseudun Tulevaisuus, 20 August 2020 (in Finnish) The close proximity to Helsinki has led to a considerable growth of the major villages such as Klaukkala, Rajam√§ki and R√∂ykk√§. Klaukkala is the biggest built-up area of Nurmij√§rvi, which nowadays is considered a dormitory town of Helsinki. The church village (Kirkonkyl√§) is the administrative centre of the municipality, although the clear emphasis on population growth is in Klaukkala. Nurmij√§rvi literally means \\"lawn lake\\" although the lake that gave the municipality its name was drained in the early 20th century and is now nothing more than some flat fields near the village centre. Nurmij√§rvi is one of three municipalities in the Uusimaa region that do not have a Swedish name; the others are Askola and M√§nts√§l√§. Matti Vanhanen, former Prime Minister of Finland and current finance minister, lives in Leps√§m√§ in Nurmij√§rvi.  History  Like many other rural communities, one of Nurmij√§rvi's most important sources of income has always been agriculture. The picture is from 1954 in Nurmij√§rvi. The area of what is now Nurmij√§rvi was inhabited in prehistoric times, which refers to archaeological finds dating back to 4500-3500 BC. At the time of the Middle Ages there was no permanent settlement in the area, but later the settlement spread from both Tavastia and the coast to 15 villages in 1540 with 115 houses. Administratively, Lake Nurmij√§rvi has been formed by combining the districts of Loppi, Vihti and Helsinki parish. The earliest documentary mention of Nurmij√§rvi dates back to 1488, when the village of Uotila was mentioned. According to the land register of 1539, Nurmij√§rvi had 15 villages with a total of 113 houses. An independent congregation had already been formed in 1605 and the administrator of Nurmij√§rvi was born in 1775, when the area had a population of 1471. The first church in Lake Nurmij√§rvi, which must have been St. Martin's Church in 1565, was built at the end of the Middle Ages. It was demolished on the way to a new church, completed in 1692, and the present church, completed in 1793 and designed by master builder Matti √Ökerblom, is the third in order.Hannu Tarmio, Pentti Papunen & Kalevi Korpela: Suomenmaa 5: maantieteellis-yhteiskunnallinen tieto- ja hakuteos, p. 405‚Äì406. Porvoo-Helsinki: WSOY, 1973. Lake Nurmij√§rvi has long been a strong farmer, and the share of fields in the total municipal area is almost one third, which is more than in many other municipalities in Finland. Horticultural crops have also been heavily cultivated and, for example, almost half of the wild cabbage harvest in Finland is produced in Nurmij√§rvi. Nevertheless, the municipality has not carried out further processing of agricultural products; for example, there has been no dairy. The first industrial plants were born in the late 19th century, including Finland's first pharmaceutical factory founded by pharmacist Albin Koponen in Nurmij√§rvi in 1899. The main products of the drug plant were filizine extracted from male fern root rhizomes, which were sold as Diphyllobothrium latum and cestoda medicines called Filisin and Filicon. The factory-produced filicin was sold encapsulated all the way to China and America. Today, trade, transport and other services account for two thirds, industry and construction for less than one third and agriculture for over 3% of the population. The largest individual employers are Altia Oyj and Teknos Oy in Rajam√§ki, Polimoon Oy in Klaukkala and Korsisaari Oy. In the early 1960s, the settlement of Nurmij√§rvi was evenly distributed in different parts of the municipality. However, migration to Nurmij√§rvi began to accelerate around the middle of the decade and the focus of settlement shifted to the southern parts of the municipality. Already in 1970 the majority (65%) of the inhabitants of Nurmij√§rvi lived in urban settlements. The largest agglomerations at that time were Klaukkala (3,500 inhabitants), Rajam√§ki (3,400 inhabitants) and church village (2,800 inhabitants). Of these, the growth of Klaukkala and church village, in particular, has been based almost exclusively on the vicinity of the Helsinki metropolitan area. The most prominent farms on Lake Nurmij√§rvi have been the manors of Numlahti and Raala. Before the departure of Hyvink√§√§ in 1917, the Kyt√§j√§ Manor as well as the whole of the Kyt√§j√§ village, were part of the Nurmij√§rvi parish.  Geography  Lake S√§√§ksi beach. Nurmij√§rvi is located in the central part of Uusimaa. Salpausselk√§ passes through the northern part of the municipality via R√∂ykk√§, Kiljava and Rajam√§ki, and the River Vantaa flows through the Nukari and Palojoki rivers in the eastern part of the municipality. Nurmij√§rvi's lowest terrain is in the Luhtajoki valley at Klaukkala and the highest in Salpausselk√§ near Herunen. There are few watercourses in the Nurmij√§rvi area. The municipality is located along the middle course of the River Vantaa and there are two large rapids, the Nukarinkoski and the Myllykoski. The River Vantaa is joined by the Palojoki River from Hyvink√§√§ and Tuusula, near the Palojoki village. The Leps√§m√§ River and the Luhtajoki River flowing in the southern part of the municipality join the Vantaa town side near the Keimola village before joining the River Vantaa. The largest lake in Nurmij√§rvi is the Lake S√§√§ksi (which is partly situated on the northwest side of Hyvink√§√§), which is known for one of the most popular beaches in Finland,Suomen 10 upeinta uimarantaa ‚Äì pulahda t√§√§ll√§ kes√§lomareissulla (in Finnish) being located in the Kiljava village.

The highway was built as a motorway in the 1990s, and the old highway next to it between Helsinki and H√§meenlinna was numbered as Regional Road 130. Highway 3 is joined by Finnish national road 45 (Kt 45) on the Hyvink√§√§ side from Hyryl√§ in Tuusula and through the eastern part of Nurmij√§rvi, and Finnish national road 25 (Vt 25) between Hanko and Porvoo passes through the northern part of the municipality near the R√∂ykk√§ village. Other important roads are the Regional road 132 to Loppi and Karkkila via Klaukkala, Perttula and R√∂ykk√§ and the connecting road 1311 to Rajam√§ki via the Nurmij√§rvi church village. The Hanko‚ÄìHyvink√§√§ railway, which currently has only freight train traffic, also passes through Rajam√§ki and R√∂ykk√§. In Nurmij√§rvi, especially from Klaukkala, there are frequent bus services via Kivist√∂ and Keimola of Vantaa to the Central Bus Terminal of Kamppi Center in Helsinki.Kamppi to Klaukkala - 4 ways to travel via train, taxi, bus, and carRome2rio With the growth of Klaukkala, traffic congestion between Regional road 132 and Highway 3 has worsened so much over the years that the construction of a bypass road on the northside of Klaukkala as a new continuation of the regional road began in 2019.YLE: Yli 30 vuotta Klaukkalan ohikulkutiet√§ on odotettu ‚Äì t√§n√§√§n hanke viimein k√§ynnistyi (in Finnish) Although it was tentatively scheduled to be completed only in fall 2021, it is likely to be completed in summer and for traffic road may open as early as the end of 2020.Klaukkalan ohikulkutie liikenteelle ehk√§ jo vuoden lopussa ‚Äì ty√∂t edenneet hyvin.

The type foundry also published Emigre magazine between 1984 and 2005. Note that unlike the word √©migr√©, Emigre is officially spelled without accents. History Emigre was founded in 1984 as an independent foundry, developing typefaces without an association to a typesetting equipment manufacturer. Coinciding with the advent of the Macintosh computer, Emigre took advantage of the new medium to design digital typefaces, as such they did not require the manufacturing infrastructure of a traditional type foundry. Licko began designing fonts that, rather than trying to imitate letterpress technology, capitalized on the idiosyncrasies of bitmap design and dot matrix printing, and later, vector-based design.Bringhurst, Robert. The Elements of Typographic Style, Hartley & Marks (2004), page 134: \\"Licko has exploited the harsh economies of digital plotting routines, slicing from control point to control point not with a knife, file or chisel but with digitized straight lines.\\" The company is credited with being the first type foundry to design original fonts made on and for a computer. Through a good part of the late 1980s and most of the 1990s, some of the most cutting-edge typefaces were developed or released by Emigre. Its magazine, in the meantime, provided an outlet showcasing the potential of its typeface designs, and was well known for its graphical experimentation, criticism and essays on contemporary design.Heller, Steven and Fili, Louise. Stylepedia: A Guide to Graphic Design Mannerisms, Quirks, and Conceits, Chronicle Books (2006), page 121: \\"What Emigre initiated was co-opted by the new mainstream -- from fashion magazines to MTV. Stylistically Emigre was not just the standard bearer, it was the bearer of standards for experimental digital typography.\\" Many Emigre fonts belonged to what would be described as the Postmodern movement, and the style of grunge typography, though others such as Licko's Mrs Eaves did not clearly fit into this style. Emigre was often criticized for rejecting standard design rules. Designer Massimo Vignelli was highly critical against Emigre and viewed their designs as a direct threat to Modernist ideals. Vignelli called Emigre a \\"typographic garbage factory,\\" and to him, their work represented \\"the degradation of culture.\\" Despite denunciation from traditionalists in the realm of design, Emigre became influential in the field. \\"People read best what they read most,\\" was a manifesto that VanderLans and Licko held to when facing critics. Citing that what is deemed readable is only so because of the prevalence of a particular font.https://books.google.com/books? id=LEuBNKx4hywC&pg;=PA10&lpg;=PA10&dq;=%22people+read+best+what+they+read+most%22&source;=bl&ots;=oiK_SQAGqx&sig;=1YgH4hLpN8zVd540l7MF7xrMAZU&hl;=en&ei;=BkzVTq6cOePr0gGctcTnAQ&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;=%22people%20read%20best%20what%20they%20read%20most%22&f;=false Eventually, Vignelli, even after strongly criticizing the work of Emigre, directly promoted Licko's font Filosofia, to which Licko responded, \\"Massimo's willingness to collaborate on our announcement reflects Emigre's ability to bridge different approaches.\\" Books Emigre has published a number of books related to graphic design and photography. * *Departures: Five Milestone Font Families by Emigre - \\"This book celebrates the acquisition of five Emigre typeface families by The Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2011.\\" *Supermarket - \\"Photographic record of six years of road trips to and through the Mojave desert.\\" *Pages From an Imaginary Book - \\"A book of desert landscapes utilizing low budget reproduction techniques.\\" *Bagdad, Californie - \\"A book of photographs about the now vanished town of Bagdad, California.\\" * Emigre (Exhibition Catalog) - \\"Catalog to commemorate an exhibition about the work of Emigre at the Jan van Eyck Academy in the Netherlands.\\" *Emigre Fonts Type Specimens Volume I - \\"Limited edition, case bound book containing 12 original Emigre Fonts type specimens.\\" *Emigre No.70: The Look Back Issue - \\"A 512-page selection of reprints that traces Emigre's development from its early bitmap design days in the mid 1980s through to the experimental layouts that defined the so-called.\\" *Palm Desert - \\"Part 1 of a trilogy of photo books about Southern California inspired by the music of Van Dyke Parks.

Written by Allen and Mickey Rose, the film chronicles the life of Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen), an inept bank robber. Filmed in San Francisco and San Quentin State Prison, Take the Money and Run received Golden Laurel nominations for Male Comedy Performance (Woody Allen) and Male New Face (Woody Allen), and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen (Woody Allen, Mickey Rose). Plot Virgil Starkwell's (Woody Allen) story is told in documentary style, using fake stock footage and 'interviews' with people who knew him. He begins a life of crime at a young age. As a child, Virgil is a frequent target of bullies, who snatch his glasses and stomp on them on the floor. As an adult, Virgil is inept and unlucky, and both police and judges ridicule him by stomping on Virgil's glasses. Virgil falls in love with a young lady, Louise (Janet Margolin), a laundry worker, they marry and later have a baby. Virgil attempts to rob a bank, but is arrested when he is embroiled in an argument about the handwriting on a demand note he hands to a cashier. He is sent to prison, but attempts an escape using a bar of soap carved to resemble a gun. Unfortunately for him, it is raining outside and his gun dissolves. He does escape, but by accident. Joining a mass breakout plan, Virgil is the only inmate not warned that the scheme had been called off. Outside but unemployed, Virgil finds no way to support himself and his family. Eventually, he is rearrested and sent to a chain gang, where he is undernourished (the single meal of the day is a bowl of steam) and brutally punished (consigned to a steam box with an insurance salesman). Virgil again escapes but is eventually captured when attempting to rob a former friend who reveals he is now a cop. He is sentenced to 800 years, but remains upbeat knowing that \\"with good behavior, I can get that cut in half\\". In the last scene, he is shown carving a bar of soap and asking the interviewer if it is raining outside. Cast Production This was the second film directed by Woody Allen, and the first with original footage (after What's Up, Tiger Lily?, which consisted of visuals taken from a Japanese James Bond knockoff). He had originally wanted Jerry Lewis to direct, but when that did not work out, Allen decided to direct it himself. Allen's decision to become his own director was partially spurred on by the chaotic and uncontrolled filming of Casino Royale (1967), in which he had appeared two years previously. This film marked the first time Allen would perform the triple duties of writing, directing, and acting in a film. The manic, almost slapstick style is similar to that of Allen's next several films, including Bananas (1971) and Sleeper (1973). Allen discussed the concept of filming a documentary in an interview with Richard Schickel: The film was shot on location in San Francisco, including one scene set in Ernie's restaurant, whose striking red interior was immortalized in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). Other scenes were filmed at San Quentin State Prison, where 100 prisoners were paid a small fee to work on the film. The regular cast and crew were stamped each day with a special ink that glowed under ultra-violet light so the guards could tell who was allowed to leave the prison grounds at the end of the day. (One of the actors in the San Quentin scenes was Micil Murphy, who knew the prison well: he had served five and a half years there, for armed robbery, before being paroled in 1966.) Allen initially filmed a downbeat ending in which he was shot to death, courtesy of special effects from A.D. Flowers. Reputedly the lighter ending is due to the influence of Allen's editor, Ralph Rosenblum, in his first collaboration with Allen. Reception =Box office= The film opened on August 18, 1969 at the 68th St. Playhouse in New York City and grossed a house record $33,478 in its first week and even more in its second week with $35,999. By 1973, the film had earned rentals of $2,590,000 in the United States and Canada and $450,000 in other countries. After all costs were deducted, it reported a loss of $610,000. =Critical response= The film received mostly positive reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times described it as \\"a movie that is, in effect, a feature-length, two-reel comedy‚Äîsomething very special and eccentric and funny\\", even though toward the end \\"a certain monotony sets in\\" with Allen's comedy rhythm. In his later review of Annie Hall, Canby revised his opinion of Take the Money and Run, stating \\"Annie Hall is not terribly far removed from Take the Money and Run, his first work as a triple-threat man, which is not to put down the new movie but to upgrade the earlier one\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times found the film to have many funny moments, but \\"in the last analysis it isn't a very funny movie\\", with the fault lying with its visual humor and editing. In October 2013, the film was voted by the Guardian readers as the sixth best film directed by Allen. On the review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 90% positive rating from top film critics based on 18 reviews, with one of the two negative reviews coming from Roger Ebert. =Awards and honors= * Golden Laurel Nomination for Male Comedy Performance (Woody Allen) * Golden Laurel Nomination for Male New Face (Woody Allen) * Writers Guild of America Award Nomination for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen (Woody Allen, Mickey Rose).

Ross Ashby (6 September 1903, in London ‚Äì 15 November 1972) was an English psychiatrist and a pioneer in cybernetics, the study of the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things. His first name was not used: he was known as Ross Ashby. His two books, Design for a Brain and An Introduction to Cybernetics, were landmark works. They introduced exact and logical thinking into the brand new discipline of cybernetics and were highly influential.  Biography  William Ross Ashby was born in 1903 in London, where his father was working at an advertising agency.Biography of W. Ross Ashby The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive, 2008. From 1921 he studied at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he received his B.A. in 1924 and his M.B. and B.Ch. in 1928. From 1924 to 1928 he worked at the St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Later on he also received a Diploma in Psychological Medicine in 1931, and an M.A. 1930 and M.D. from Cambridge in 1935. Ross Ashby started working in 1930 as a Clinical Psychiatrist in the London County Council. From 1936 until 1947 he was a Research Pathologist in the St Andrew's Hospital in Northampton in England. From 1945 to 1947 he served in India where he was a Major in the Royal Army Medical Corps. When he returned to England, he served as Director of Research of the Barnwood House Hospital in Gloucester from 1947 until 1959. For a year, he was Director of the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol. In 1960, he went to the United States and became Professor, Depts. of Biophysics and Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, until his retirement in 1970.Autobiographical summary, taken from Ashby's own notes, made about 1972. Ashby was president of the Society for General Systems Research from 1962 to 1964. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1971. On 4‚Äì6 March 2004, a W. Ross Ashby centenary conference was held at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. Presenters at the conference included Stuart Kauffman, Stephen Wolfram and George Klir.W. Ross Ashby Centenary Conference The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive, 2008 In February 2009, a special issue of the International Journal of General Systems was specifically devoted to Ashby and his work, containing papers from leading scholars such as Klaus Krippendorff, Stuart Umpleby and Kevin Warwick.  Work  Despite being widely influential within cybernetics, systems theory and, more recently, complex systems, Ashby is not as well known as many of the notable scientists his work influenced, including Herbert A. Simon, Norbert Wiener, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Stafford Beer, Stanley Milgram, and Stuart Kauffman.Cosma Shalizi, W. Ross Ashby web page, 1999. = Journal = Ashby kept a journal for over 44 years in which he recorded his ideas about new theories. He started May 1928, when he was medical student at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Over the years, he wrote down a series of 25 volumes totalling 7,189 pages. In 2003, these journals were given to The British Library, London, and in 2008, they were made available online as The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive.W. Ross Ashby Journal (1928‚Äì1972) The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive, 2008. = Cybernetics = Ross Ashby was one of the original members of the Ratio Club, a small informal dining club of young psychologists, physiologists, mathematicians and engineers who met to discuss issues in cybernetics. The club was founded in 1949 by the neurologist John Bates and continued to meet until 1958. The title of his book An Introduction to Cybernetics popularised the usage of the term 'cybernetics' to refer to self- regulating systems, originally coined by Norbert Wiener in Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. The book dealt primarily with homeostatic processes within living organisms, rather than in an engineering or electronic context. Earlier, in 1946, Alan Turing wrote a letterAlan Turing letter The W. Ross Ashby Digital Archive, 2008. to Ashby suggesting that Ashby use Turing's Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) for his experiments instead of building a special machine. In 1948, Ashby made the Homeostat. by Dr Horace Townsend = Variety = In An Introduction to Cybernetics, Ashby formulated his Law of Requisite VarietyWR Ashby, \\"An introduction to cybernetics\\", London, Chapman & Hall,1956. stating that \\"variety absorbs variety, defines the minimum number of states necessary for a controller to control a system of a given number of states.\\" This law can be applied for example to the number of bits necessary in a digital computer to produce a required description or model. In response, Conant (1970) produced his so-called \\"Good Regulator theorem\\" stating that \\"every Good Regulator of a System Must be a Model of that System\\".Roger C. Conant and W. Ross Ashby, \\"Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system\\", International Journal of Systems Science vol 1 (1970), 89‚Äì97. Stafford Beer applied variety to found management cybernetics and the Viable System Model. Working independently, Gregory Chaitin followed this with algorithmic information theory. A popular paraphrasing of the law is \\"only complexity absorbs complexity\\". However, while a web search reveals many attributions to Ashby, it appears such attribution is in error. The phrase is not listed by the Cybernetics Society.\\"What Ashby Says...\\" Retrieved 16 May 2014.

Description It is a small deciduous tree or shrub reaching a height of , usually with thorny branches. The leaves are shiny-green, ovate-acute, long and wide, with three conspicuous veins at the base, and a finely toothed margin. The flowers are small, wide, with five inconspicuous yellowish-green petals. The fruit is an edible oval drupe deep; when immature it is smooth-green, with the consistency and taste of an apple with lower acidity, maturing brown to purplish-black, and eventually wrinkled, looking like a small date. There is a single hard kernel, similar to an olive pit, containing two seeds.165x165px Distribution Its precise natural distribution is uncertain due to extensive cultivation, but is thought to be in southern Asia, between Lebanon, northern India, and southern and central China, and possibly also southeastern Europe though more likely introduced there.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins . This plant has been introduced in Madagascar and grows as an invasive species in the western part of the island. This plant is known as the \\"hinap\\" or \\"finab\\" in the eastern part of Bulgaria where it grows wild but is also a garden shrub, kept for its fruit. The fruit is picked in the autumn. The trees grow wild in the eastern Caribbean, and are reported to exist in Jamaica, The Bahamas, and Trinidad as well. In Antigua and Barbuda, the fruit is called \\"dumps\\" or \\"dums\\"; and in The Bahamas, \\"juju\\". It is also known as \\"pomme surette\\" on the French islands of the Caribbean. This fruit, more precisely known as \\"Indian jujube\\" elsewhere, is different from the \\"jujube\\" fruit that is cultivated in various parts of southern California. Altun Ha, an ancient Mayan city in Belize, located in the Belize District about 50 kilometres (31 mi) north of Belize City and the surrounding woods, also boasts some jujube tree and shrub varieties where it is referred to as plums for lack of a better word among locals. Nomenclature The species has a curious nomenclatural history, due to a combination of botanical naming regulations, and variations in spelling. It was first named in the binomial system by Carl Linnaeus as Rhamnus zizyphus, in Species Plantarum (1753). Philip Miller, in his Gardener's Dictionary, considered that the jujube and its relatives were sufficiently distinct from Rhamnus to be placed in a separate genus (as it had already been by the pre-Linnaean author Tournefort in 1700), and in the 1768 edition he gave it the name Ziziphus jujuba (using Tournefort's spelling for the genus name). For the species name, he used a different name, as tautonyms (repetition of exactly the same name in the genus and species) are not permitted in botanical naming. However, because of Miller's slightly different spelling, the combination of the earlier species name (from Linnaeus) with the new genus, Ziziphus zizyphus, is not a tautonym, and was therefore permitted as a botanical name. This combination was made by Hermann Karsten in 1882.Clarke, D. L. (1988). W. J. Bean Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles, Supplement. John Murray . In 2006, a proposal was made to suppress the name Ziziphus zizyphus in favor of Ziziphus jujuba, and this proposal was accepted in 2011. Ziziphus jujuba is thus the correct scientific name for this species. Cultural and religious references In Arabic-speaking regions the jujube and alternatively the species Z. lotus are closely related to the lote- trees (sing. \\"sidrah\\", pl. \\"sidr\\") which are mentioned in the Quran,Abdullah, Yusuf Ali (1946) The Holy Qur-an. Text, Translation and Commentary, Qatar National Printing Press. p.1139, n. 3814. while in Palestine it is rather the species Z. spina-christi that is called sidr. Varieties Varieties of jujube include Li, Lang, Sherwood, Silverhill, So, Shui Men and GA 866. Cultivation and uses 162x162pxJujube was domesticated in south Asia by 9000 BC.Gupta, Anil K. \\"Origin of agriculture and domestication of plants and animals linked to early Holocene climate amelioration\\", Current Science, Vol. 87, No. 1, 10 July 2004, 54-59. Indian Academy of Sciences. Over 400 cultivars have been selected. The tree tolerates a wide range of temperatures and rainfall, though it requires hot summers and sufficient water for acceptable fruiting. Unlike most of the other species in the genus, it tolerates fairly cold winters, surviving temperatures down to about and the tree is for instance commonly cultivated in Beijing. This enables the jujube to grow in mountain or desert habitats, provided there is access to underground water throughout the summer. The jujube, Z. jujuba grows in cooler regions of Asia. Five or more other species of Ziziphus are widely distributed in milder climates to hot deserts of Asia and Africa.S. Chaudhary. \\"Rhamnaceae\\" in: S. Chaudhary (Ed). Flora of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Vol II (Part One) 2001. In Madagascar, jujube trees grow extensively in the western half of the island, from the north all the way to the south. It is widely eaten by free- ranging zebus, and its seeds grow easily in zebu feces. It is an invasive species there, threatening mostly protected areas. Jujube seed =Culinary use= The freshly harvested, as well as the candied dried fruit, are often eaten as a snack, or with coffee. Smoked jujubes are consumed in Vietnam and are referred to as black jujubes. Both China and Korea produce a sweetened tea syrup containing jujube fruit in glass jars, and canned jujube tea or jujube tea in the form of teabags. To a lesser extent, jujube fruit is made into juice and jujube vinegar (called Êû£ ÈÜã or Á∫¢Êû£ ÈÜã in Chinese). They are used for making pickles (‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Ü‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶∞) in west Bengal and Bangladesh. In China, a wine made from jujube fruit is called hong zao jiu (Á∫¢Êû£ÈÖí). Sometimes pieces of jujube fruit are preserved by storing them in a jar filled with baijiu (Chinese liquor), which allows them to be kept fresh for a long time, especially through the winter. Such jujubes are called zui zao (ÈÜâÊû£; literally \\"drunk jujube\\"). The fruit is also a significant ingredient in a wide variety of Chinese delicacies (e.g. ÁîëÁ≥ï jing gao, a steamed rice cake). In Vietnam and Taiwan, fully mature, nearly ripe fruit is harvested and sold on the local markets and also exported to Southeast Asian countries. The dried fruit is used in desserts in China and Vietnam, such as ching bo leung, a cold beverage that includes the dried jujube, longan, fresh seaweed, barley, and lotus seeds. In Korea, jujubes are called daechu (ÎåÄÏ∂î) and are used in daechucha teas and samgyetang. In Croatia, especially Dalmatia, jujubes are used in marmalades, juices, and rakija (fruit brandy). On his visit to Medina, the 19th-century English explorer, Sir Richard Burton, observed that the local variety of jujube fruit was widely eaten. He describes its taste as \\"like a bad plum, an unrepentant cherry and an insipid apple.\\" He gives the local names for three varieties as \\"Hindi (Indian), Baladi (native), Tamri (date- like).\\"Burton, Sir Richard Francis (1855) A Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah pp.404,405 In Palestine a hundred years ago, a close variety was common in the Jordan valley and around Jerusalem.Easton, M.G., M.A., D.D.

Nelson and Sons, London, Edinburgh and New York. p.688. \\"It overruns a great part of the Jordan valley.\\" The bedouin valued the fruit, calling it nabk. It could be dried and kept for winter or made into a paste which was used as bread.Crowfoot, M. Grace with Louise Baldenserger (1932) From Cedar to Hyssop. A study in the Folklore of Plants in Palestine. The Sheldon Press, London. pp.112,113 In Persian cuisine, the dried drupes are known as annab, while in neighboring Azerbaijan, it is commonly eaten as a snack, and is known as innab. Confusion in the common name apparently is widespread. The innab is Z. jujuba: the local name ber is not used for innab. Rather, ber is used for three other cultivated or wild species, e.g., Z. spina-christi, Z. mauritiana, and Z. nummularia in parts of India and is eaten both fresh and dried. The Arabic name sidr is used for Ziziphus species other than Z. jujuba. Traditionally in India, the fruit is dried in the sun and the hard nuts are removed. Then, it is pounded with tamarind, red chillies, salt, and jaggery. In some parts of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, fresh whole ripe fruit is crushed with the above ingredients and dried under the sun to make cakes called ilanthai vadai or regi vadiyalu (Telugu). It is also commonly consumed as a snack. In Northern and Northeastern India the fruit is eaten fresh with salt and chilli flakes and also preserved as candy, jam or pickle with oil and spices. In Madagascar, jujube fruit is eaten fresh or dried. People also use it to make jam. A jujube honey is produced in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. Italy has an alcoholic syrup called brodo di giuggiole. In Senegal Jujube is called Sii dem and the fruit is used as snack. The fruit is turned into dried paste used by school kids. The commercial jujube candy popular in movie theaters originally contained jujube juice but now uses other flavorings. =Medicinal use= The fruit and its seeds are used in Chinese and Korean traditional medicine, where they are believed to alleviate stress,Goetz P. \\"Demonstration of the psychotropic effect of mother tincture of Zizyphus jujuba\\" Phytotherapie 2009 7:1 (31‚Äì36) https://doi.org/10.1007/s10298-008-0362-7 Mise en √©vidence d‚Äôun effet psychotrope de la teinture m√®re de Zizyphus jujuba Mill (original French title) and traditionally for anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-ulcer, anti- inflammatory purposes and sedation,Jiang J.-G., Huang X.-J., Chen J., Lin Q.-S.,\\"Comparison of the sedative and hypnotic effects of flavonoids, saponins, and polysaccharides extracted from Semen Ziziphus jujube\\", Natural Product Research 2007 21:4 (310‚Äì320) https://doi.org/10.1080/14786410701192827 antispastic, antifertility/contraception, hypotensive and antinephritic, cardiotonic, antioxidant, immunostimulant, and wound healing properties.Mahajan R.T., Chopda M.Z. \\"Phyto-pharmacology of Ziziphus jujuba mill ‚Äì A plant review\\" Mahajan R.T., Chopda M.Z. Pharmacognosy Reviews 2009 3:6 (320‚Äì329) It is among the fruits used in Kampo. Jujube, along with Gan Cao, is used in Chinese medicine to harmonize and moderate other herbs. Ziziphin, a compound in the leaves of the jujube, suppresses the ability to perceive sweet taste. =Other uses= In Japan, the natsume has given its name to a style of tea caddy used in the Japanese tea ceremony, due to the similar shape. Its hard, oily wood was, along with pear, used for woodcuts to print the world's first books, starting in the 8th century and continuing through the 19th in China and neighboring countries. As many as 2000 copies could be produced from one jujube woodcut.edX Course: HarvardX: HUM1.3x Print and Manuscript in Western Europe, Asia and the Middle East (1450-1650) > Comparandum: Printing in East Asia > Main Technology: Xylography In China, the leaves are sometimes picked for teas, such as by families in Laoshan Village, Shandong Province, China, where it counts as a variety of herbal tea. The timber is sometimes used for small items, such as tuning pegs for instruments. Select grade Jujube timber is often used in traditional Asian instruments for fingerboard, pegs, rests & soundposts, ribs & necks etc. It has a medium to hard density similar to luthier grade European maple and has excellent tonal qualities. You will find jujube Wood in local folk instruments from Ceylon/India thru to China/Korea and is also commonly used in China in violin & cello making for overseas export, though usually stained black to imitate the look of ebony. Luthier grade jujube wood planes and carves beautifully. =Pests and diseases= Witch's brooms, prevalent in China and Korea, is the main disease affecting jujubes, though plantings in North America currently are not affected by any pests or diseases.Fruit Facts: Jujube In Europe, the last several years have seen some 80%‚Äì90% of the jujube crop eaten by insect larvae (see picture), including those of the false codling moth, Thaumatotibia (Cryptophlebia) leucotreta. none  See also  References =Further reading= *Fruits of Warm Climates.

The ancient capital was located near modern-day Matsumoto, which became an important city of the province. The World War II‚Äìera Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano was named after this old province. Historical record In 713, the road that traverses Mino and Shinano provinces was widened to accommodate increasing numbers of travelers through the Kiso District of modern Nagano Prefecture.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). In the Sengoku period, Shinano Province was often split among fiefs and castle towns developed, including Komoro, Ina, and Ueda. Shinano was one of the major centers of Takeda Shingen's power during his wars with Uesugi Kenshin and others. Suwa taisha was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (ichinomiya) for the province.\\"Nationwide List of Ichinomiya,\\" p. 2.; retrieved 2011-08-010 In 1871, during the Meiji period, with the abolition of the han system and the establishment of prefectures (Haihan Chiken) after the Meiji Restoration, Shinano Province's ex-domains/1871 prefectures and ex- shogunate territories/1868 prefectures (mainly Ina [=merger of several shogunate demesne administrations with parts of Matsumoto], Okutono, Iwamurada, Komoro, Ueda, Matsushiro, Suzaka, Iiyama, Suwa/Takashima, Takat≈ç, Iida, Matsumoto) and Takayama/Hida which covered Hida Province were administratively merged into Nagano (initially Nakano Prefecture in 1870) and Chikuma prefectures. The seat of the prefectural government of Nakano was Nakano town from Takai District (became Nakano City in 1954), Nagano's prefectural capital was Nagano town in Minochi District (‚ÜíNagano City in 1897), and Chikuma's capital was Matsumoto town, Chikuma district (Matsumoto City from 1907). In the second wave of prefectural mergers in 1875/76, Chikuma was split again: the Western part covering Hida Province was merged into Gifu, and the Eastern part in Shinano became part of Nagano. Since that time, Nagano is essentially contiguous to Shinano.

The tort of passing off protects the goodwill of a trader from misrepresentation. The law of passing off prevents one trader from misrepresenting goods or services as being the goods and services of another, and also prevents a trader from holding out his or her goods or services as having some association or connection with another when this is not true. Passing off and trade mark law A cause of action for passing off is a form of intellectual property enforcement against the unauthorised use of a get-up (the whole external appearance or look-and-feel of a product, including any marks or other indicia used) which is considered to be similar to that of another party's product, including any registered or unregistered trademarks. Passing off is of particular significance where an action for trade mark infringement based on a registered trade mark is unlikely to be successful (due to the differences between the registered trade mark and the unregistered mark). Passing off is a common law cause of action, whereas statutory law such as the United Kingdom Trade Marks Act 1994 provides for enforcement of registered trademarks through infringement proceedings. Passing off and the law of registered trade marks deal with overlapping factual situations, but deal with them in different ways. Passing off does not confer monopoly rights to any names, marks, get-up or other indicia. It does not recognize them as property in its own right. Instead, the law of passing off is designed to prevent misrepresentation in the course of trade to the public, for example, that there is some sort of association between the businesses of two traders. One recent example of its application by the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office can be found in a Trade Mark Opposition Decision in 2001. It was held that two brands of confectionery both named \\"Refreshers\\", one made by Swizzels Matlow and one by Trebor Bassett, which had coexisted since the 1930s, would deceive a consumer as to their source for some items but not for others. Both coexist in the marketplace. Required elements When coming to Court, there are three elements, often referred to as the Classic Trinity, in the tort which must be fulfilled. In Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc,[1990] 1 All ER 873 Lord Oliver reduced the five guidelines laid out by Lord Diplock in Erven Warnink v. Townend & Sons Ltd.[1979] AC 731, 742 (HL) (the \\"Advocaat Case\\") to three elements: # Goodwill owned by a trader # Misrepresentation # Damage to goodwill The plaintiff has the burden of proving goodwill in its goods or services, get-up of goods, brand, mark or the thing standing for itself. The plaintiff also has the burden of proof to show false representation (intentional or otherwise) to the public to have them believe that goods/services of the defendant are that of the Plaintiff. There must be some connection between the plaintiff's and defendant's goods, services or trade. They must show likelihood or actual deception or confusion by the public. Deception or confusion, however, does not consider a \\"moron in a hurry\\". It is the Court's duty to decide similarity or identity of the marks, goods or services. The criteria are often: aural, visual and conceptual similarity (often applied in trademark infringement cases). For the element of damage to goodwill, there may be a loss or diversion of trade or dilution of goodwill. The plaintiff need not prove actual or special damage; real and tangible probability of damage is sufficient. This damage should however be reasonably foreseeable. It is not enough just to show likelihood or actual deception or confusion. Ultimately, the Court must use common sense in determining the case, based on evidence and judicial discretion, and not witnesses. Disclaimers may not be enough to avoid passing off or cause of action.Asprey and Garrard v. WRA (Guns) Ltd [2002] FSR 30. However, this was expressed in the dicta of the decision in that case. Extended passing off One of the instances where passing off is actionable is the extended form of passing off, where a misrepresentation as to the particular quality of a product or service causes harm to another's goodwill. An example of this is Erven Warnink v. Townend & Sons Ltd., in which the makers of advocaat sued a manufacturer of a drink similar but not identical to advocaat, but which was successfully marketed as being advocaat. The extended form of passing off is used by celebrities as a means of enforcing their personality rights in common law jurisdictions. Common law jurisdictions (with the exception of Jamaica) do not recognise personality rights as rights of property. Accordingly, celebrities whose images or names have been used can successfully sue if there is a representation that a product or service is being endorsed or sponsored by them or that the use of their likenesses was authorised when this is not true.Irvine v Talksport Ltd [2003] FSR 35, ChD) Reverse passing off Another variety, somewhat rarer is so-called 'reverse passing off'. This occurs where a trader markets another's product or service as being his own (see John Roberts Powers School v Tessensohn [1995] FSR 947). It is usually covered by the same court rulings as straight passing off.Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.

The region covers the area formerly Lango District until 1974, when it was split into the districts of Apac and Lira, and subsequently into several additional districts. The current Lango Region now includes the districts of Amolatar, Alebtong, Apac, Dokolo, Kole, Lira, Oyam, and Otuke. Their population is 2,131,495. The Lango speak ‚ÄúLebLango‚Äù, a dialect mutually intelligible with the Luo language. According to Driberg (1923), a Luo of Kisumu in Kenya would at once understand, and in two months would readily speak LebLango. Early history A Lango chief with elaborate headdress. Photo published in 1902. The Lango Oral tradition states that they were part of the \\"Lango race\\" during the migration period. This group later split into several distinct groups before entering Uganda (see Tarantino, Odwe, Crazollara, Uzoigwe). The name ‚ÄúLango‚Äù is found in Teso, Kumam, Karamojong, Jie, and Labwor vocabularies, reflecting that these groups once belong to the Lango race. Hutchinson (1902) states \\"One of the chief nations of the late kingdom of Unyoro are the Lango (Lango, Longo) people, who although often grouped with the Nilotic Negroes, are really of the Galla stock and speech. They form, in fact, an important link in the chain of Hamitic peoples who extend from Galla-land through Unyoro and Uganda southwards to Lake Tanganyika. Their territory which occupies both banks of the Somerset or Victoria Nile between Foweira and Magungo, extends eastwards beyond Unyoro proper to the valley of the Chol, one of the chief upper branches of the Sobat. They still preserved their mother tongue amid Bantu and Negroid populations, and are distinguished by their independent spirit, living in small groups, and recognising no tribal chief, except those chosen to defend the common interest in the time of war\\" (p. 360). Hutchinson (1902) adds \\"The Lango are specially noted for the care bestowed on their elaborate and highly fantastic head-dress. The prevailing fashion may be described as a kind of a helmet.... Lango women, who amongst the finest and most symmetrical of the Equatorial lake regions, wear little clothing or embellishments beyond west-bands, necklaces, armlets, and anklets\\" (p. 360). Icaya (Isaya) Ogwangguji, M.B.E. Rwot Ogwangguji was born in 1875 in Abedpiny village in Lira district.(Okino, Patrick and Odongo, Bonney). He was the son of a Rwot (chief) ‚Äì Rwot Olet Apar, the leader of the Oki clan. His first administrative chief title was the Jago (sub-chief) of Lira. In 1918, he was elected county chief (Rwot) by Erute county, Lango. He continued as Rwot of Erute county until February 28, 1951 and was later promoted to the title of Rwot Adwong (Senior Chief). Rwot Ogwangguji is known as a chief who bridged \\"old Lango\\" into \\"new Lango\\" through his extensive work history during a period of many changes in the 20th century in Uganda. He was awarded the M.B.E. in the New Year's Honors in 1956 and subsequently retired in December 1957. (Wright, M.J., Uganda Journal, Vol. 22, Issue 2, 1958). Military Driberg described Lango people as \\"brave and venturesome warriors who have won fear and respect of their neighbors...not being idle witnesses to watching of the misfortunes of their neighbors...treating facts of life with no sense of false modesty...\\". The Lango army was united under one military leader chosen from available men, and all had to agree to be led by him. These military leaders would lead the Lango army against other groups. Their authority ended when the war was over, and they all returned to their clans and resumed their daily occupation and were not entitled to any special benefits. Famous military leaders were Ongora Okubal who brought Lango to their present land, Opyene Nyakonyolo who succeeded Ongora Okubal and was followed by Arim Oroba, and Agoro Abwango. Agoro Abwango led his men to fight the Banyoro and was killed in Bunyoro, (Kihangire, p. 22). The Lango oral literature has it that as the soldiers who went to help Kabalega retreated towards the Nile, they helped Kabalega and Mwanga, the deposed King of Bunyoro and Buganda respectively cross the Nile River. They were moved along the northern corridor of Lake Kwania. At the time, a warrior called Obol Ario who had conquered much of the northern part of the lake was there at the time. It's believed he helped smuggle the two deposed kings towards Dokolo where they settled at Kangai subcounty. Obol Ario of Apac Okwero Ngec Ayita Clan eventually settled at Amac where he later died and was buried. Land Tenure Land in pre-colonial era was common land, and any untilled area belonged to the first person or family who tilled it, and it was passed on to the eldest son.Elders, Shades, and Women: Ceremonial Change in Lango, Uganda Written By Richard T. Curley https://books.google.com/books?id=pzrywnLP_6IC&pg;=PA21 According to Kigangire, \\"land which had not been cultivated in the past could be tilled by any family, and, when once it had been tilled, the community regarded it as the property of the family whose ancestor first cultivated it.\\" (Kihangire, p. 22). The traditional land tenure is still widely used in rural areas.
