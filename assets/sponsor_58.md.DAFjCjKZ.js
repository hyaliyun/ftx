Nottani. It was the third feature film (after Vigathakumaran and Marthanda Varma) and first sound film in Malayalam. Based on the short story \\"Vidhiyum Mrs. Nayarum\\" by A. Sundaram, its screenplay and dialogues are written by Muthukulam Raghavan Pillai. The film is a melodrama and was the first movie in this genre in Malayalam. It is produced by T. R. Sundaram of Modern Theatres, Salem. The film, which stars K. K. Aroor, Master Madanagopal, M. V. Shanku, K. Gopinath, Alleppey Vincent, C. O. N. Nambiar, M. K. Kamalam, K. N. Lakshmi, Baby Malathi, A. B. Pious and Subhadra, is about the struggle of two orphaned children. German cinematographer Bado Gushwalker handled the camera while Varghese and K.D. George did the editing. Its music was composed by K. K. Aroor and Ibrahim. There are overall 23 songs in the film. The film was a milestone in Malayalam film history, not only for being the second talkie, but also for being one of the first commercially successful films. Through the film, Alleppey Vincent became the first \\"speaking person\\" of Malayalam cinema, K. K. Aroor the first \\"speaking hero\\" and M. K. Kamalam the first \\"speaking heroine\\". \\"Hello Mister\\" was the first recorded sound, which was in the voice of Alleppey Vincent. The film is lost; only the songs book and a few stills survive to this day. Plot Cast * Master Madanagopal as young Balan * M. V. Shankar as Dr. Govindan Nair * K.

P Padmanabha Menon Production There were several attempts to make a talkie in Malayalam, right from the days Vigathakumaran (1928) got released. One among them, A. Sundaram Pillai, had an unpublished story entitled Vidhiyum Mrs. Nayarum (Mrs. Nair and the Fate) with him. He contacted several production houses to adapt this story into a film. Several of his attempts failed, but at last he got a letter from T. R. Sundaram, a Tamil-based producer informing him that he was ready to produce the film. T. R. Sundaram owned the production company Modern Theatres, which he established in 1936. A. Sundaram had already finished casting, which included several theatre artists from Malayalam. K. Kunjunair, credited as K. K. Aroor in the film, of the Kottakkal Nataka Samithi was selected to do the title role. M. K. Kamalam was chosen as the heroine. Director S. Nottani A. Sundaram wanted himself to direct the film, but later agreed to sign S. Nottani as the director. Nottani rejected the screenplay of A. Sundaram and wanted to rewrite it. Eventually, he signed renowned writer Muthukulam Raghavan Pillai, who wrote the screenplay and dialogues, as well as lyrics for the songs. The filming was started on 17 August 1937 from Salem. After completing a length of 2000 feat, T. R. Sundaram dropped the project following differences in opinion with A. Sundaram. T. R. Sundaram had spent 30,000 on the project. A. Sundaram himself financed the project thereafter. Most parts of the film was shot from Powerful Studios. The filming was completed within five months, on December 1937. A. Sundaram could not find a distributor for many months. Later, Shyamala Pictures, Madras bought the rights and the film was released on 19 January 1938. Songs Balan's music was composed by K. K. Aroor, who played the male lead, and Ibrahim. It had 23 songs, most of them recorded by the actors themselves. K. N. Lakshmi, K. K. Aroor, M. K. Kamalam and Master Madanagopan are the credited singers. Playback singing was not possible that time, so the producer had to sign actors those who could excel in singing also. Most of the songs followed popular Hindi and Tamil film tunes of the time. Gramaphone records of the songs were not produced. The most popular song was a solo by M. K. Kamalam \\"Jaathaka Doshathale\\", based on Chenjurutti raga. It was a direct copy of \\"Theyila Thottathle\\" by M. K. Radha from the Tamil film Sathi Leelavathi (1936). Lyrics for the songs are penned by Muthukulam Raghavan Pillai, who also wrote the screenplay and dialogues for the film.

It is located at lake Ranna which is situated at the river Danube. The Ranna Pumped Storage Power Station uses the dammed water of the river Ranna which merges into the river Danube closely behind the power station. With its commissioning in 1925 it is one of the oldest power stations in the Austrian M√ºhlviertel region. As a Pumped Storage Power Station, it is able to pump water from the river Danube into the Ranna Valley storage tanks in times of weak consumer demand. This is possible because the tanks are located than the river. In times of high consumer demand the water is released into the other direction where it produces electricity by running through turbines.  History  Between 1923 and 1925 the company Stern&Hafferl; built a power station with a weir to rim the river Ranna. The entire power capacity of the bottleneck solution then equaled 5.8 MW From 1947 to 1954 an extensive expansion followed. It was initiated by the Upper Austrian Power Stations Stock Company (today: Energie AG Ober√∂sterreich). During the expansion, the Ranna Valley Dam was built and the existing simple power station was upgraded to a pumped storage power station. The power capacity of the power station was hereby tripled. On 1 February 1962 there was a fraction of the water tunnel above the power plant. On this occasion, roundabout 10000 m¬≥ of water cascaded down the valley. The consequences were landslides as well as damages at a nearby agricultural enterprise. As the pressure tunnel had to be reconditioned, the power generation had to be put down for a longer period. At the power station building itself only minor damages followed from the incident. At the end of August 2014 the reservoir lake had to be emptied completely due to necessary works of maintenance on the technical equipment. During this phase, a planned temporary resettlement of the fish stock in the lake took place. As part of the revision a new closing cap was built into the bottom outlet. Further, the dam wall and water tunnel were checked for malfunctions. Up until the beginning of 2012 the power station served as one of four regional control centres, in which the power station of Partenstein was steered. Today the Ranna Pumped Storage Power Station is steered by the ‚ÄûLeitstelle Wasserkraft‚Äú in Gmunden, just like all hydroelectric power stations maintained by Energie AG Ober√∂sterreich.

Burns and Dave Meeker Heidegger-influenced school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects. This is in contrast to what it calls the \\"anthropocentrism\\" of Kant's Copernican Revolution, as accepted by most other current metaphysics, in which phenomenal objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition. Object-oriented ontology maintains that objects exist independently (as Kantian noumena) of human perception and are not ontologically exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects. For object-oriented ontologists, all relations, including those between nonhumans, distort their related objects in the same basic manner as human consciousness and exist on an equal footing with one another. Object- oriented ontology is often viewed as a subset of speculative realism, a contemporary school of thought that criticizes the post-Kantian reduction of philosophical enquiry to a correlation between thought and being (correlationism), such that the reality of anything outside of this correlation is unknowable. Object-oriented ontology predates speculative realism, however, and makes distinct claims about the nature and equality of object relations to which not all speculative realists agree. The term \\"object-oriented philosophy\\" was coined by Graham Harman, the movement's founder, in his 1999 doctoral dissertation \\"Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects\\".Bogost's \\"Understanding the 'Experience' of Objects,\\" in: Humanistic Perspectives in a Technological World, ed. Richard Utz, Valerie B. Johnson, and Travis Denton (Atlanta: School of Literature, Media, and Communication, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2014), pp. 69-71, provides a quick general definition. In 2009, Levi Bryant rephrased Harman's original designation as \\"object-oriented ontology\\", giving the movement its current name. Founding of the movement The term \\"object-oriented philosophy‚Äù was used by speculative philosopher Graham Harman in his 1999 doctoral dissertation \\"Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects\\" (later revised and published as Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects). For Harman, Heideggerian Zuhandenheit, or readiness-to-hand, refers to the withdrawal of objects from human perception into a reality that cannot be manifested by practical or theoretical action. Furthering this idea, Harman contends that when objects withdraw in this way, they distance themselves from other objects, as well as humans. Resisting pragmatic interpretations of Heidegger's thought, then, Harman is able to propose an object-oriented account of metaphysical substances. Following the publication of Harman's early work, several scholars from varying fields employing object-oriented principles in their own work. Levi Bryant began what he describes as \\"a very intense philosophical email exchange\\" with Harman, over the course of which Bryant became convinced of the credibility of object-oriented thought. Bryant subsequently used the term \\"object-oriented ontology\\" in 2009 to distinguish those ontologies committed to an account of being composed of discrete beings from Harman's object-oriented philosophy, in order to mark a difference between object-oriented philosophy (OOP) and object-oriented ontology (OOO).Graham Harman, \\"Series Editor's Preface\\", in Levi R. Bryant, Onto- Cartography: An Ontology of Machines and Media, IX. Basic principles While object-oriented philosophers reach different conclusions, they share common precepts, including a critique of anthropocentrism and correlationism and a rejection of \\"preservation of finitude\\", \\"withdrawal\\", and philosophies that undermine or \\"overmine\\" objects. =Rejection of anthropocentrism= Anthropocentrism is the privileging of humans as \\"subjects\\" over and against nonhuman beings as \\"objects\\". The widespread tendency frequently limits attributes such as mind, autonomy, moral agency, reason, and the like to humans, while contrasting all other beings as variations of \\"object\\", or things obeying deterministic laws, impulses, stimuli, instincts, and so on. Beginning with Kant's epistemology, modern philosophers began articulating a transcendent anthropocentrism, whereby the Kantian argument that objects are unknowable outside of the imposed, distorting categories of the human mind in turn shores up discourses wherein objects frequently become effectively reduced to mere products of human cognition. In contrast to Kant's view, object-oriented philosophers maintain that objects exist independently of human perception, and that nonhuman object relations distort their related objects in the same fundamental manner as human consciousness. Thus, all object relations, human and nonhuman, are said to exist on equal ontological footing with one another. =Critique of correlationism= Related to 'anthropocentrism', object-oriented thinkers reject speculative idealist correlationism, which the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux defines as \\"the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other\\". Because object-oriented ontology is the realist philosophy, it stands in contradistinction to the anti-realist trajectory of correlationism, which restricts philosophical understanding to the correlation of being with thought by disavowing any reality external to this correlation as inaccessible, and, in this way, fails to escape the ontological reification of human experience. =Rejection of undermining and \\"overmining\\"= Object-oriented thought holds that there are two principal strategies for devaluing the philosophical import of objects. First, one can undermine objects by claiming that they are an effect or manifestation of a deeper, underlying substance or force. Second, one can \\"overmine\\" objects by either an idealism which holds that there is nothing beneath what appears in the mind or, as in social constructionism, by positing no independent reality outside of language, discourse or power. Object-oriented philosophy rejects both undermining and \\"overmining\\". =Preservation of finitude= Unlike other speculative realisms, object- oriented ontology maintains the concept of finitude, whereby relation to an object cannot be translated into direct and complete knowledge of an object. Since all object relations distort their related objects, every relation is said to be an act of translation, with the caveat that no object can perfectly translate another object into its own nomenclature. Object-oriented ontology does not restrict finitude to humanity, however, but extends it to all objects as an inherent limitation of relationality. =Withdrawal= Object-oriented ontology holds that objects are independent not only of other objects, but also from the qualities they animate at any specific spatiotemporal location. Accordingly, objects cannot be exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects in theory or practice, meaning that the reality of objects is always present-at-hand. The retention by an object of a reality in excess of any relation is known as withdrawal. Metaphysics of Graham Harman In Tool- Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects, Graham Harman interprets the tool-analysis contained in Martin Heidegger's Being and Time as inaugurating an ontology of objects themselves, rather than the valorization of practical action or networks of signification. According to Harman, Heideggerian Zuhandenheit, or readiness-to-hand, indicates the withdrawal of objects from both practical and theoretical action, such that objectal reality cannot be exhausted by either practical usage or theoretical investigation. Harman further contends that objects withdraw not just from human interaction, but also from other objects. He maintains: From this, Harman concludes that the primary site of ontological investigation is objects and relations, instead of the post-Kantian emphasis on the human-world correlate. Moreover, this holds true for all entities, be they human, nonhuman, natural, or artificial, leading to the downplayment of dasein as an ontological priority. In its place, Harman proposes a concept of substances that are irreducible to both material particles and human perception, and \\"exceed every relation into which they might enter\\". Coupling Heidegger's tool-analysis with the phenomenological insights of Edmund Husserl, Harman introduces two types of objects: real objects and sensual objects. Real objects are objects that withdraw from all experience, whereas sensual objects are those that exist only in experience. Additionally, Harman suggests two kinds of qualities: sensual qualities, or those found in experience, and real qualities, which are accessed through intellectual probing. Pairing sensual and real objects and qualities yields the following framework: * Sensual Object/Sensual Qualities: Sensual objects are present, but enmeshed within a \\"mist of accidental features and profiles\\". * Sensual Object/Real Qualities: The structure of conscious phenomena are forged from eidetic, or experientially interpretive, qualities intuited intellectually. * Real Object/Sensual Qualities: As in the tool-analysis, a withdrawn object is translated into sensual apprehension via a \\"surface\\" accessed by thought and/or action. * Real Object/Real Qualities: This pairing grounds the capacity of real objects to differ from one another, without collapsing into indefinite substrata. To explain how withdrawn objects make contact with and relate to one another, Harman submits the theory of vicarious causation, whereby two hypothetical entities meet in the interior of a third entity, existing side-by-side until something occurs to prompt interaction. Harman compares this idea to the classical notion of formal causation, in which forms do not directly touch, but influence one another in a common space \\"from which all are partly absent\\". Causation, says Harman, is always vicarious, asymmetrical, and buffered: Thus, causation entails the connection between a real object residing within the directionality of consciousness, or a unified \\"intention,\\" with another real object residing outside of the intention, where the intention itself is also classified as a real object. From here, Harman extrapolates five types of relations between objects. Containment describes a relation in which the intention \\"contains\\" both the real object and sensual object. Contiguity connotes relations between sensual objects lying side-by-side within an intention, not affecting one another, such that a sensual object's bystanders can be rearranged without disrupting the object's identity. Sincerity characterizes the absorption of a real object by a sensual object, in a manner that \\"takes seriously\\" the sensual object without containing or being contiguous to it. Connection conveys the vicarious generation of intention by real objects indirectly encountering one another. Finally, no relation represents the typical condition of reality, since real objects are incapable of direct interaction and are limited in their causal influence upon and relation to other objects. Expansion Since its inception by Graham Harman in 1999, many authors in a variety of disciplines have adapted and expanded upon Harman's ideas. =Onticology (Bryant)= Like Harman, Levi Bryant opposes post-Kantian anthropocentrism and philosophies of access. From Bryant's perspective, the Kantian contention that reality is accessible to human knowledge because it is structured by human cognition limits philosophy to a self-reflexive analysis of the mechanisms and institutions through which cognition structures reality. He states: To counter the form of post-Kantian epistemology, Bryant articulates an object-oriented philosophy called onticology, grounded in three principles. First, the Ontic Principle states that \\"there is no difference that does not make a difference\\". Following from the premises that questions of difference precede epistemological interrogation and that to be is to create differences, this principle posits that knowledge cannot be fixed prior to engagement with difference. And so, for Bryant, the thesis that there is a thing-in-itself which we cannot know is untenable because it presupposes forms of being that make no differences. Similarly, concepts of difference predicated upon negation--that which objects are not or lack when placed in comparison with one another--are dismissed as arising only from the perspective of consciousness, rather than an ontological difference that affirms independent being. Second, the Principle of the Inhuman asserts that the concept of difference producing difference is not restricted to human, sociocultural, or epistemological domains, thereby marking the being of difference as independent of knowledge and consciousness. Humans exist as difference-making beings among other difference-making beings, therefore, without holding any special position with respect to other differences. Third, the Ontological Principle maintains that if there is no difference that does not also make a difference, then the making of difference is the minimal condition for the existence of being. In Bryant's words, \\"if a difference is made, then the being is\\". Bryant further contends that differences produced by an object can be inter-ontic (made with respect to another object) or intra- ontic (pertaining the internal constitution of the object). Onticology distinguishes between four different types of objects: bright objects, dim objects, dark objects, and rogue objects. Bright objects are objects that strongly manifest themselves and heavily impact other objects, such as the ubiquity of cell phones in high-tech cultures. Dim objects lightly manifest themselves in an assemblage of objects; for example, a neutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable effects. Dark objects are objects that are so completely withdrawn that they produce no local manifestations and do not affect any other objects. Rogue objects are not chained to any given assemblage of objects, but instead wander in and out of assemblages, modifying relations within the assemblages into which they enter. Political protestors exemplify rogue objects by breaking with the norms and relations of a dominant political assemblage in order to forge new relations that challenge, change, or cast off the prior assemblage. Additionally, Bryant has proposed the concept of 'wilderness ontology' to explain the philosophical pluralization of agency away from human privilege. =Hyperobjects (Morton)= Timothy Morton became involved with object-oriented ontology after his ecological writings were favorably compared with the movement's ideas. In The Ecological Thought, Morton introduced the concept of hyperobjects to describe objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium. He has subsequently enumerated five characteristics of hyperobjects: # Viscous: Hyperobjects adhere to any other object they touch, no matter how hard an object tries to resist. In this way, hyperobjects overrule ironic distance, meaning that the more an object tries to resist a hyperobject, the more glued to the hyperobject it becomes. # Molten: Hyperobjects are so massive that they refute the idea that spacetime is fixed, concrete, and consistent. # Nonlocal: Hyperobjects are massively distributed in time and space to the extent that their totality cannot be realized in any particular local manifestation. For example, global warming is a hyperobject that impacts meteorological conditions, such as tornado formation. According to Morton, though, objects don't feel global warming, but instead experience tornadoes as they cause damage in specific places. Thus, nonlocality describes the manner in which a hyperobject becomes more substantial than the local manifestations they produce. # Phased: Hyperobjects occupy a higher dimensional space than other entities can normally perceive. Thus, hyperobjects appear to come and go in three-dimensional space, but would appear differently to an observer with a higher multidimensional view. # Interobjective: Hyperobjects are formed by relations between more than one object. Consequently, objects are only able to perceive the imprint, or \\"footprint,\\" of a hyperobject upon other objects, revealed as information. For example, global warming is formed by interactions between the Sun, fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide, among other objects. Yet, global warming is made apparent through emissions levels, temperature changes, and ocean levels, making it seem as if global warming is a product of scientific models, rather than an object that predated its own measurement. According to Morton, hyperobjects not only become visible during an age of ecological crisis, but alert humans to the ecological dilemmas defining the age in which they live. Additionally, the existential capacity of hyperobjects to outlast a turn toward less materialistic cultural values, coupled with the threat many such objects pose toward organic matter, gives them a potential spiritual quality, in which their treatment by future societies may become indistinguishable from reverential care. =Alien phenomenology (Bogost)= Ian Bogost, a video game researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founding partner of Persuasive Games, has articulated an \\"applied\\" object-oriented ontology, concerned more with the being of specific objects than the exploration of foundational principles. Bogost calls his approach alien phenomenology, with the term \\"alien\\" designating the manner in which withdrawal accounts for the inviolability of objectal experience. From this perspective, an object may not recognize the experience of other objects because objects relate to one another using metaphors of selfhood. Alien phenomenology is grounded in three \\"modes\\" of practice. First, ontography entails the production of works that reveal the existence and relation of objects. Second, metaphorism denotes the production of works that speculate about the \\"inner lives\\" of objects, including how objects translate the experience of other objects into their own terms. Third, carpentry indicates the creation of artifacts that illustrate the perspective of objects, or how objects construct their own worlds. Bogost sometimes refers to his version of object-oriented thought as a tiny ontology to emphasize his rejection of rigid ontological categorization of forms of being, including distinctions between \\"real\\" and \\"fictional\\" objects. Criticism Some commentators contend that object-oriented ontology degrades meaning by placing humans and objects on equal footing. Matthew David Segall has argued that object-oriented philosophers should explore the theological and anthropological implications of their ideas in order to avoid \\"slipping into the nihilism of some speculative realists, where human values are a fluke in an uncaring and fundamentally entropic universe\\". Other critical commentators such as David Berry and Alexander Galloway have commented on the historical situatedness of an ontology that mirrors computational processes and even the metaphors and language of computation. Pancomputationalism and digital philosophy explore these ideas further. Joshua Simon contextualized the rise of popularity of the theory in contemporary art circles as a variation on commodity fetishism - a return to the primacy of the object, in a post-2008 art market. Cultural critic Steven Shaviro has criticized object- oriented ontology as too dismissive of process philosophy. According to Shaviro, the process philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead, Gilbert Simondon, and Gilles Deleuze account for how objects come into existence and endure over time, in contrast to the view that objects \\"are already there\\" taken by object-oriented approaches. Shaviro also finds fault with Harman's assertion that Whitehead, Simondon, and Iain Hamilton Grant undermine objects by positing objects as manifestations of a deeper, underlying substance, saying that the antecedence of these thinkers, particularly Grant and Simondon, includes the \\"plurality of actually existing objects\\", rather than a single substance of which objects are mere epiphenomena.

It has a Neolithic stilt settlement, discovered by Ferdinand von Hochstetter in 1864.  Geography  The lake is located in an eponymous basin, formed by a tributary of the Draugletscher that is itself tracing out a tectonic fault. The lake was much larger in the past than it is today, as evidenced by the extensive marshland to the east and north of the lake. The lake has an oblong-oval shape. To the west lies a bay, into which the tributaries flow. To the east is a narrow peninsula, which extends about into the lake.

The peninsula and the shoals are part of rock ridges that sweep under the lake bottom in a southwest-northeast direction. The western shore of the lake has extensive silt deposits, part of a sandy moor covered with sedge and reeds that extends to the Hafnersee. There is also a small pond, the \\"Moorteich.\\" The catchment area of the lake covers . Of these, around 54% is forested, 30% agricultural land, 6% waters, and the remainder is developed into settlements or recreational areas.Carinthian Lake Research Institute: K√§rntner Seenbericht 1992. 60 Jahre Seenforschung, 30 Jahre Seensanierung. (a.k.a. Ver√∂ffentlichungen des K√§rntner Instituts f√ºr Seenforschung 7) Klagenfurt 1992, pp. 119‚Äì134.  Usage  With the exception of the northern shore, most parts of the lake and its catchment area are located in the Keutschacher Lake Valley nature reserve. However, the lake itself and the associated fishery are privately managed, and the lake is a popular site for bathing and fishing. On the south bank there are two nudist campsites with capacity for up to 3,000 guests.  Stilt dwellings  The shallows of the lake contain a pile dwelling from about 6000 years ago that appears to have been occupied for about 300 years. It is one of the oldest of four pole periods in Central Europe. At that time, the water level of the lake may have been around 1.5 m lower than it is today, so that village would have been located on an island. The settlement includes two types of houses: log cabins with mud walls and half-timbered houses made of wickerwork. The woods used to construct the structures vary widely. Dendrochronology suggests that two oak trunks used in the construction date to 3947 and 3871 BC. Radiometric data from other finds gives values ranging between 4340 and 3780 BC. The clay pottery found in the settlement is of Lasinja-Kanzianiberg type, common to Danubian Copper Age settlements. There is evidence of copper smelting, but the evidence has yet to be satisfactorily dated. Animal bones found among the food remains suggest that the inhabitants' meat came primarily from game hunting; 59% are from the red deer. Cattle bones also comprise a significant extent of the findings (13%).

Bader was known for his contributions to the construction, athletics and aviation of Atlantic City. Early life Bader grew up on an 80-acre farm in West Philadelphia, born to German immigrants Daniel and Sarah Bader in 1874. He had a brother, Harry Bader. Until he turned 13, he attended Boon's Dam School, though he recalled skipping a good deal of class. He worked a number of chores on the family farm, and he credited this rural labor with building his athletic physique. His family could not afford his further education which led him to champion educational growth in Atlantic City as an adult. Bader sold newspapers, after leaving school, then worked for his father's new contracting business where he drove a six-horse team. He was married in 1899 to Katherine Holvick and enrolled in college. First he attended dental school, then the veterinary school, and finally the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Originally Bader intended to earn money by playing football while attending college, but when he learned that he would have to be a student for a year before being allowed to play, he left and joined the Latrobe Athletic Association, the first professional football team in the United States. At a height of and a weight of , Bader helped Latrobe win an unofficial \\"United States Championship\\". Early career Steel Pier between 1910 and 1920After a year with Latrobe, Bader returned to work full-time. He also played a year for a professional football team operated by Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack. He became a superintendent for his father's contracting company. In 1902, he set up a garbage-collecting operation for his father in Atlantic City. After two years, he started his own contracting business. In 1904, a storm washed away part of Steel Pier and many engineers stated that it could not be rebuilt but Bader and his company accepted the challenge to rebuild it. His success with that job led to more work in Atlantic City. His next major project was the paving of the five miles of Albany Avenue in Atlantic City to Pleasantville which is now part of the Black Horse Pike that passes by a field that bears his name. Bader's contracting business was successful for the next few years working several projects in Atlantic City and along the East Coast of the United States. An active Republican, politically, he was involved with local charities, and he was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Moose International, Fraternal Order of Eagles and the Knights of Columbus. His wife and he had four children, including a son, Daniel, who would later become an Atlantic City city commissioner. Bader was an avid sports booster. He fielded basketball teams, organized Atlantic City's first professional football team - the Blue Tornadoes - and owned a boxing gym on North New Hampshire Avenue. Before world-title Boxing bouts sponsored by casinos he would regularly bring world-class boxers to Atlantic City to fight. He developed a friendship with Boxing champion Jack Dempsey and was rumoured to be a potential manager for him in 1921. He formed Atlantic City High School's band and encouraged high school athletics. Politics Convention Hall Bader's Republican friends convinced him to run for city commission in 1920. Winning his seat he was chosen by his fellow commissioners to serve as mayor. In 1924, he was re-elected. Bader spoke out against a Ku Klux Klan meeting in Atlantic City in 1923. He also pushed the idea of the city residents organizing a beauty pageant that became known as Miss America. Despite the opposition of many others, he purchased land that became the city's municipal airport and high school football stadium; both of which were later named Bader Field in his honor. He led the initiative, in 1923, to construct the high school at Albany and Atlantic Avenues. Bader, in November 1923, initiated a public referendum, during the general election, at which time residents approved the construction of a Convention Center. The city passed an ordinance approving a bond issue for $1.5 million to be used for the purchase of land for Convention Hall, now Boardwalk Hall, finalized September 30, 1924. Construction of it was underway at the time of his death. Bader ordered decency laws for bathers on the beaches of Atlantic City, July 14, 1924. Women were permitted to wear one-piece suits provided they also wore a skirt with it. The New York Times edition for March 27, 1924, read: \\"The official regulation provides that the bottom of the tights shall be no shorter than four inches above the knee and the bottom of the skirt no higher than seven inches above the knee.\\" Prohibited in previous years, bare legs were allowed. Additionally, Atlantic City passed a \\"macintosh law\\" which required that anyone in beach attire had to wear a coat reaching at least to the knees. The Times reported that police turned back hundreds of would-be bathers: \\"Mayor Edward L. Bader ordered this action on complaints that bathers were sometimes unclad to the point of indecency, while with others their wet suits were a nuisance.\\" Death Bader was stricken by a stomach ailment in mid-January 1927. Doctors, originally, did not properly diagnose it as appendicitis because his appendix was on the left, rather than the right side of his torso. Initially asked to rest at home, he was later moved to the City Hospital and underwent surgery. In an effort to speed his recovery, city policemen fanned out along the street in front of the hospital to prevent any unnecessary noise. Originally given a good chance to recover because of his strong physique, Bader's condition worsened, and on the evening of January 29, 1927 he was given last rites by a priest. For a bedside vigil his family was joined by a few local dignitaries, including Commissioner Anthony Ruffu (who would succeed Bader as mayor), Assemblyman Anthony Siracusa and political power- broker Nucky Johnson. Just before midnight Bader died. His body lay in state at St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church, of which he was a member, and it was then carried out in a five-mile-long procession down the White Horse Pike to Holy Cross Cemetery. Mourners of diverse racial background mourned his death and all businesses in the city closed for two hours during the funeral as a mark of respect. In popular culture Bader was played by actor Kevin O'Rourke in the HBO television series Boardwalk Empire. See also * Diedrich Bader * William B.

King Louis XII recognized Monaco in 1512 with the signing of a document that also declared a perpetual alliance with the king of France. Following rule by Spain, in the early 1600s Monaco prospered again under Honor√© II who strengthened ties with France, a relationship that lasted in this capacity for the next two hundred years. In the Treaty of 2 February (1861) Prince Charles III ceded Monegasque sovereignty over the towns of Menton and Roquebrune (now Roquebrune-Cap- Martin) in exchange for full independence from France. Following World War I, a treaty signed on 27 July 1919, as well as Article 436 of the Treaty of Versailles, put Monaco under limited French protection once again and affirmed the special relationship. This relationship continues to the present day with the French government taking responsibility for Monaco's defence, while the latter has only a small police force and palace guard. A mutual legal agreement and a common regime was also set between the two countries; they also signed the Treaty of 1945 and the Agreement of 1963 on furthering their relationship.Monaco In 2002, the laws deriving from the Treaty of Versailles that governed relations between Monaco and France were renegotiated. It was finally ratified in 2005 with new terms that: upgraded France's representation from a consulate to that of an embassy; permitted other countries to accredit ambassadors to Monaco; and, formally recognised Monaco's ruling Grimaldi dynasty's succession scheme that was initially set out in the 1962 constitution, and which also extended eligibility to the ruling prince's daughters and other family members. Economic ties The European External Action Service has worked with Monaco in its initiatives through the relationship with France. Monaco has thus been integrated into the Schengen zone. The EU Council of Ministers authorised France to negotiate a Monetary Agreement that allows Monaco to inter alia use the euro as its official currency, grant legal status to the euro and to issue a limited quantity of euro coins with its own national sides. It also signed an agreement with Monaco in regards to the application of EEAS legislation on pharmaceuticals, cosmetic products and medical devices that was enacted on 1 May 2004. However, goods produced in Monaco would not assimilated into products of EEAS' origin. An agreement on savings taxation was brought into force on 1 July 2005. Monaco is fully integrated into a customs union with France, which also enables participation in the EU market system. The latter collects and rebates trade duties with Monaco. The euro was adopted as the official currency on January 1, 2002. Monegasque politics In 1962, Monaco's refusal to impose a tax on both its residents and international businesses caused problems in relations. However, it was resolved with an agreement that French citizens with less than five years of residence in Monaco and companies doing more than 25 percent of their business outside the country would be taxed at French rates. The crisis also led a new constitution and the restoration of the National Council. Amongst the edicts of the new constitution are the prince's nomination of a Council of Government that consists of a Minister of State who is a French citizen and selected for a three-year term from a group of senior French civil servants selected by the French government.JURIST - Monaco: Monacan Law, Legal Research, Human RightsMonaco Politics, government, and taxation, Information about Politics, government, and taxation in Monaco They are the prince's representative and are in charge of foreign relations, directs executive services, the police and the Council of Government. They also choose three council members: one to take care of the economy and finances; one for Home Affairs; and, one for social affairs. All ministers are accountable to Monaco's prince. Monaco‚Äôs legal system is also modeled on the Napoleonic Code and is similar to that of France. Monaco has also agreed to exercise its sovereign rights in conformity with French interests. Cultural relations Embassy of Monaco in Paris The two countries share French as their official language, although the historic language of Monaco is Mon√©gasque, a variety of Ligurian, one of the Gallo-Italic languages. French and Italian nationals comprise more than half the country's population. French cuisine is also prevalent in Monaco.

The abundant painted turtle species is captured from the wild, primarily for pet use. Commercial harvesting is a small-scale industry that faces growing restrictions, but still occurs, in some cases unconstrained. Recreational harvesting, is generally allowed in much of the species range. However, it is prohibited in areas where the species is threatened and in a few non-threatened locations. Generally, turtles are captured by live trapping. Floating basking-style traps work better than staked, baited hoop-style traps, but both are employed. Because the turtles are long-lived, with lower replacement rates than typical game, concerns exist for over-harvesting. In this, they are similar to species such as snapping turtles, with late-aged sexual maturity, albeit not to the same extent. Commercial harvesting Oregon conservation video: 0:30‚Äì0:60 conservation factors; 1:50‚Äì2:00 hoop trap.(If video play problematic, see or for alternative video streams.) Commercial harvesting of painted turtle from the wild is controversial and, increasingly, restricted. cited in Worldwide, many turtle species are endangered and turtle trapping has been implicated as a cause. Since turtles are slow to sexually mature and are long-lived, they generally have poor replacement rates when hunted. cited in cited in Wisconsin formerly had virtually unrestricted trapping of painted turtles, but in 1997, based on qualitative observations, forbid all commercial harvesting. \\"Based on what I have seen over the years, I believe that turtle densities are way down,\\" said Wisconsin state herpetologist Robert Hay. In 1999, Minnesota, prompted by the Wisconsin decision and the growth of painted turtle capture in the 1990s, commissioned quantitative study of the state's painted turtles. After a two-year study, Gamble and Simon found a clear pattern of harvested lakes having half the painted turtle density of off-limits lakes. They also modeled the painted turtles' replacement rate and suggested that unrestricted harvest put the populations in danger of dropping strongly. In 2002, Minnesota forbid new harvesters and limited trap numbers, although harvest did continue by old harvesters. From 2002 to 2005, the most recent recorded, the yearly Minnesota painted turtles harvests were half the average size of that in the 1990s. As of 2009, painted turtles faced virtually unlimited harvesting in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma. Since then, Missouri disallowed the harvest. Pet usage is the primary market for trapped painted turtles although a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1‚Äì2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, \\"We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s.\\" Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, \\"I can go out and catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last thing I want to see is the end of the resource we've all depended on for a long time. I'm not against regulating the industry, but we want to go out and harvest and still make a living at it.\\" Recreational harvesting Many US state fish and game departments allow recreational taking of painted turtles with differing restrictions. Alabama allows a creel limit of ten, of each of the three subspecies (southern, midland, and eastern) found there, for personal use, but also has a special license for commercial turtle catchers, dealers and farmers. Virginia allows a creel limit of five with a fishing license. Michigan allows open-season taking of one per day, for non- commercial use. Pennsylvania allows one capture per day, from water, with a fishing license of each of the subspecies present there: eastern and midland. New Hampshire confines taking to the summer. Arizona allows taking four per year with a hunting license. Some localities completely protect the painted turtles. Oregon, where its western painted turtle populations are under pressure, forbids taking of any kind. Missouri forbids the taking of either subspecies (western or southern) present there. Also, in Canada, Ontario and British Columbia restrict any taking of painted turtles. Methods For commercial harvesting, collectors use either basking traps or hoop traps. The basking trap is a floating enclosures with sloping sides and a basking surface. Turtles are able to climb up the sloping sides onto the basking surface, but then when they jump off into the center, they can't get back out. Hoop traps are cylindrical mesh traps with a funnel opening. Hoop traps are submerged and turtles are attracted by bait. In Minnesota, trappers say that they prefer basking traps to target painted turtles and hoop traps for \\"meat\\" turtles (snapping turtles and softshell turtles). Minnesota harvest records also show a clear pattern of most painted turtles coming from basking traps and most softshell and snapping turtles from hoop traps. Three quantitative studies of basking traps also show they are more efficient than baited hoop traps for trapping painted turtles. cited in cited in Despite the many hours of night and cloudiness when the basking traps do not lure turtles, the painted turtle's drive to bask is so powerful, that on a per-day basis, these traps are twice as effective. Or, possibly, the basking traps are more effective since painted turtles frequently escape back out the funnel of hoop traps. Recreational (and commercial) capturing methods are regulated by locality. In addition to traps, set lines are used, as are nets and hand capture. Traps must generally be floating or partially submerged so captured turtles can breathe; trap size, number, construction, and labeling may also be regulated. Several states describe a practice of wanton shooting of turtles \\"for fun\\" (two studies of this have been done) and prohibit it, or prohibit even deliberate taking with firearms. Use of chemicals or explosives is also generally disallowed. Because other, less numerous, turtle species may be more heavily protected, methods of collection are restricted to allow the release of protected species.

Asquith, Sir Edward Grey and Lord Rosebery.H. C. G. Matthew, The Liberal Imperialists. The Ideas and Politics of a Post-Gladstonian √âlite (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973), p. viii. The Liberal Imperialists believed that under the leadership of William Ewart Gladstone the Liberal Party had succumbed to \\"faddists\\", sectional interests, and the \\"Celtic fringe\\" which prevented it from being a truly national party.Matthew, p. 127. Furthermore, the Liberal Party should include people of all classes, along with promoting working-class MPs in the Liberal Party.Matthew, pp. 128-129. They also argued that the Liberals had lost the centre vote because the party had distanced itself from \\"the new Imperial spirit\\".Matthew, p. 134. Instead, they argued for a \\"clean slate\\", that the Liberal Party must change if it is to succeed. The old, classical Liberalism must give way to the new ideas of \\"National Efficiency\\" and imperialism.Matthew, pp. 136-137. The grouping came to prominence shortly after the failed Jameson Raid in 1895 and prior to the outbreak of the Boer war four years later, as tensions between Britain‚Äôs South African colonies and its neighbours increased. Its leaders were members of the parliamentary Liberal Party ‚Äì then in opposition ‚Äì who supported the imperialist aspects of Lord Salisbury's Conservative government‚Äôs foreign policy. This stood in contrast to the radical wing of the parliamentary Liberal Party, whose prominent members included former leader William Harcourt, John Morley and David Lloyd George. Party leader Sir Henry Campbell- Bannerman, himself sceptical of Government foreign policy and particularly critical of the Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, tried to bridge the gap between the two Liberal Party factions. In the 1900 General Election Liberal Imperialist affiliated candidates were opposed by the Unionist Coalition. In particular, Joseph Chamberlain labelled the entire Liberal party as 'pro-Boer' and unpatriotic in the Second Boer War. In 1902 the group changed its name to the Liberal League with more or less the same people involved. After the Liberal victory in 1906 they played major roles in the new Liberal government: Asquith, Grey and Haldane went to the Exchequer, the Foreign Office and the War Office respectively.

The family belonged to the High Nobility, the Hochadel. The Nikolsburg (Mikulov) branch was elevated to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in 1624, while a member of the Hollenburg branch was elevated to the same dignity in 1684. History Dietrichstein Castle Dietrichstein Castle near Feldkirchen in the Duchy of Carinthia was first mentioned in an 1103 deed. It was probably named after one knight Dietrich in the service of the Carinthian dukes. In 1166 the Dietrichstein estates were acquired by the Prince-Bishops of Bamberg and enfeoffed to a family of ministeriales officials, who began to call themselves after the castle. When the line became extinct in the early 14th century, the fief was inherited by Nikolaus I, another Carinthian ministerialis from nearby Nussberg Castle, whose descendants also called themselves von Dietrichstein. In the late 15th century, the strategically important fortress overlooking the trade route along the Glan valley down to Sankt Veit was occupied by the Hungarian forces of King Matthias Corvinus and finally destroyed by Ottoman invaders in 1483. A new castle was erected below the ruins about 1500 and rebuilt in a Neoclassical style in 1840. Hollenburg, Carinthia, Austria Mikulov Castle, Moravia, Czech Republic In 1514, Siegmund von Dietrichstein (1484‚Äì1533) purchased Hollenburg Castle from the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I, who also elevated him to the noble rank of a Freiherr. In 1572 Siegmund's son Adam von Dietrichstein (1527‚Äì1590) was vested with the extended estates of Nikolsburg (Mikulov) in Moravia by Emperor Maximilian II. Adam's grandson Maximilian II von Dietrichstein was created Graf (Count) on 18 September 1612 and his uncle, the Olomouc bishop Franz von Dietrichstein (1570‚Äì1636), was elevated as F√ºrst (Prince) von Dietrichstein zu Nikolsburg in 1624. The Nikolsburg branch also acquired the titles of Princely Count of Tarasp (immediate state of the Empire) in 1684, Count of Proskau in 1769, and Count Leslie of Balquhain in 1802. The line became extinct upon the death of Prince Moritz of Dietrichstein in 1864.

The project consists of approximately six acres of demonstration gardens and waterwise landscape exhibits and the new Education Center (under construction) which was completed and opened to the public in summer 2011. The Center is designed to LEED Platinum standards, showcases the best available environmental building technologies, and broadens the theme of the gardens to include conservation of energy and natural resources. History Layers of waterwise plants can create lush landscapes A stated objective of the Central Utah Project Completion Act of 1992 was to ensure \\"prudent and efficient use of currently available water prior to importation of Bear River water into Salt Lake County\\".Five Decades: A History of Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District The Act provided substantial funding for the planning and implementation of water conservation measures. As a large stakeholder in CUP projects, Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District qualified for funding and, along with a number of other measures, began planning a waterwise demonstration garden. The original Demonstration Garden consisted of approximately two acres and opened to the public in 2001. A minor expansion was completed in 2003 which brought the total to 2.5 acres. That same year, a master plan was created that would ultimately expand the gardens to cover ten acres and include a public education center. In 2006 the Jordan Valley Conservation Gardens Foundation was formed with the goal of completing the remaining portions of the master plan. With assistance from the Foundation and its Advisory Council, an additional 2.4 acres of educational exhibits was completed in May 2009. In Summer of 2010, a groundbreaking was held for the Education Center and construction was completed in summer 2011.http://www.conservationgardenpark.org High Mountain Desert Garden The purpose of the Conservation Garden Park is to promote sustainable landscape practices in Utah consistent with the goals of the State as outlined in the Water Conservancy District Act. Utah is the second-driest state in the United States.http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/the_land/physicalgeographyofutah.html It is also the fastest growing state in terms of population. At some point, water usage requirements of the growing population will be unsupportable with current and planned new sources. Adding to the concern is the fact that, generally, Utahns use more water per capita than residents of other states with the exception of Nevada. There are a limited number of potential new sources of water which can be tapped but doing so will be expensive both financially and environmentally.http://utahweather.org/on_the_water_front.html 65 percent of potable water in Utah is used for watering landscapes; therefore, reducing the amount of water required for landscapes will yield the greatest potential water savings.http://www.joe.org/joe/2009april/rb5.php This reduction in landscape water use is consistent with the goal of the State of Utah and Jordan Valley Water Conservancy District to reduce per capita water consumption 25 percent.http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700241433/Conservation-programs- target-water-use.html Attractions Conservation Garden Park teaches homeowners, landscape professionals, and students how to conserve water in the landscape through efficient irrigation, use of waterwise plant materials, and water-efficient maintenance.http://www.conservationgardenpark.org/ A host of free classes, public events, tours and garden fairs take place within the gardens each season.

Life Aurora Wilhelmina Koskull was the daughter of the courtier Baron Otto Anders Koskull and Amalia Beata Silfversparre. =Court service= In 1797, Koskull became one of the first hovfr√∂ken (maid-of-honor) appointed to the new queen, Frederica of Baden. In 1800, the queen's maids-of-honor were dismissed by the king because of many scandals involving their love affairs, and replaced with statsfru (married ladies-in-waiting).Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlottas dagbok. 7, 1800-1806, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1936 Impoverished, Koskull moved in with her aunt, Ulrika Katarina Koskull, and her aunt's wealthy husband, Count Magnus Fredrik Brahe (1756-1826). The queen's former maids-of-honor were all compensated with the formal position as maids-of-honor to the household of the infant crown prince, while he was still small enough to have female courtiers, and as such she still had the right to attend court, and often participated in high society life. In 1802, Koskull is noted as an accomplished singer in the performances staged by the amateur theatre society of Princess Charlotte at Rosersberg Palace. During the visit of Prince William Frederick in Stockholm during the winter of 1802‚Äì03, there were rumours of an affair between them, which was mentioned in the diary of Princess Charlotte: :\\"Aurora Koskull, maid-of-honor to the queen and in service to the royal children, had made a great impression upon the prince and made him loose his head entirely. She is truly very beautiful, and while not particularly intelligent she has accomplishments which could well replace wit and a good head. He confided this tender affection to me. He has a heart of gold and a mild temperament, which is why it would never occur to him to spoil the reputation of a young girl or harm her future prospects. I talked some sense to him, made him the most earnest objections, but to no avail, his love was too great, he only replied 'Oh, if she was your daughter! I would ask for nothing better than to ask you for her hand. You are of course perfectly correct in everything you say, but what am I to do? I love her to distraction!' Personally I am convinced that the young couple acted correctly, but all of Stockholm gossipped that the prince did not sigh in vain.\\" Being without a dowry, it was difficult for Koskull to marry. In 1806, half a year after the death of her aunt, she married her aunt's rich widower, Count Brahe. She had two children, Ulrika Vilhelmina Brahe (1808‚Äì1836) and Magnus Brahe (1810‚Äì). =Reign of Charles XIII= In 1811, her spouse was appointed Swedish minister to France, and she accompanied him to Paris. In France, she attracted the attention of Napoleon, who called her la belle su√©doise (\\"the beautiful Swede\\").Personhistorisk tidskrift 1898-1899, s. 174-175 (link) During the reign of Charles XIII and Charles XIV John she had a powerful position, being related to the influential royal mistress Mariana Koskull as well as being the stepmother of the royal favorite and politician Magnus Brahe, who felt great affection for her, and reportedly asked her for advice in matters of state. In 1810, she attracted the attention of the elected Crown Prince Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, the future Charles XIV John of Sweden who was reportedly in love with her and courted her. There were rumours of an affair between them, but these are not regarded to be true, and instead Charles John was reportedly rejected by her and instead entered in to a relationship with her relative, Mariana Koskull. In June 1815, the matter was mentioned in the famous journal of queen Charlotte: :\\"Still another thing would add to the reasons as to why the crown prince does not wish the crown princess to return. It is gossiped about that he entertain an affair with one of my ladies-in-waiting, miss Koskull, a commitment which he attempted to conceal with the utmost discretion but which has been exposed by the behaviour of the young lady herself. She asks for nothing better than for everyone to believe that the rumour is true. It is possible that the crown prince is amused by her and finds her pleasant, but he is really an admirer of Koskull's cousin countess Brahe. In that case not even the most ill willed tongue could find something poisonous to say, for in that matter everything is conducted in the most suitable and blameless manner.\\"Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlottas dagbok. 9, 1812-1817, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1942 Not soon after, there was a rumour that Brahe had supplanted her cousin Koskull as the lover of the crown prince: :\\"To distract himself from his troubles, caused by the situation in France, the crown prince, now when we have been having such lovely weather, has arranged intimate outdoor suppers with a selected company of young ladies and some gentlemen of his own age. It has been noted by the public how the crown prince gives his attention to countess Brahe before anyone else and that miss Koskull has not participated in those picnics, and it was erroneously believed, that he had changed his preference. But the always sensible, dignified and correct behaviour of the countess should spare her from such suspicions. I am convinced, that he only has a friendship for her inspired by the warm affection he holds for her husband. It would however be quite natural if he is enchanted by her beauty and therefore gives her his tribute. For my part I am sure, that the cousin of the countess miss Koskull is his mistress and that his feelings for the countess are entirely platonic.\\"Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlottas dagbok. 9, 1812-1817, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1942 In June 1817, queen Charlotte summarized the difference of the crown prince's relationship toward the two cousins, while also giving Brahe a personal description: :\\"The crown prince are in no way indifferent for the fair sex in general but has particular affection for two ladies of society, two cousins. For the first, countess Brahe, he has the warmest friendship and affection, and he is also wieved by the countess as a dear friend. As a true gentleman in every sense of the word he gives the countess the tribute worthy of her beauty and noble character. She is not a wit, has barely been given an accomplished or cultivated education but has acquired some learning, are particularly noted for her tact and refined manner and are commonly loved.\\"Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta, Hedvig Elisabeth Charlottas dagbok. 9, 1812-1817, Norstedt, Stockholm, 1942 =Reign of Charles XIV John= In 1823, she was offered the position of head lady-in-waiting to the new crown princess, Josephine of Leuchtenberg, upon her arrival to Sweden, being at that time one of the leading women of court life and high society; she refused and the office was instead given to Elisabet Charlotta Piper, but she did accept to have the position temporary, by meeting Josephine in Germany and escorting her the last part of the journey to Sweden: :\\"There had been eager hopes that countess Brahe would accept the office as senior lady-in-waiting at the new court, but she could not be enticed to. She did agree to accept the task to depart for Lubeck and receive the crown princess, whose German ladies were both to depart from her there. To the post of senior lady-in-waiting was instead appointed countess Erik Piper, a lady in every aspect worthy of her office, which neither she accepted without difficulty. As she by birth and wealth had came to be in an independent as well as pleasurable position, it may have been a sacrifice which was not entirely compensated by the award the titles and honors could offer vanity.\\"J.

Brahe was a leading figure of the aristocratic life of Stockholm, a position she kept after having been a widowed in 1826. She had a very good relationship to her stepson Magnus Brahe, who discussed state affairs with her and asked her for political advice. It was said that she \\"took the lead in the most notable salon of the Swedish aristocracy with noble dignity\\" and her salon was described as \\"a school, where youth took their knowledge in the art of good mannered socializing\\"; also in her old age, she was said to keep a \\"beautiful and majestic appearance\\".Personhistorisk tidskrift 1898-1899, s. 174-175 (link) References 1778 births 1852 deaths Swedish ladies-in-waiting Swedish salon-holders Swedish countesses ","title":"Aurora Wilhelmina Brahe"},{"id":"30211211","text":"Bakir (, meaning \\"coming early\\") or Bakƒ±r (Turkish, meaning \\"copper\\") may refer to: Given name * Bakir Be≈°ireviƒá (born 1965), Bosnian footballer * Bakƒ±r √áaƒülar (1941‚Äì2011), Turkish jurist and professor of constitutional law * Bakir Izetbegoviƒá (born 1956), Bosnian politician * Mohamed Bakir El-Nakib (born 1974), Egyptian handball player Surname * Aziz Osman Bakir * Feride Bakƒ±r (born 1992), Turkish-German women's footballer * Pelin G√ºnde≈ü Bakƒ±r (born 1972), Turkish academic and politician * Remziye Bakƒ±r (born 1997), Turkish women's footballer * Ron Bakir (born 1977), Lebanese-Australian entrepreneur * Tursunbai Bakir Uulu (born 1958), Kyrgyz politician Places * Bakƒ±r, Manisa, a village in the Manisa Province of Turkey Arabic- language surnames Arabic masculine given names ","title":"Bakir"},{"id":"30211222","text":"Agragami Adivasi Samiti (\\"Forward Tribal Association\\"; ) is an organisation for Adivasi people in West Bengal, India.

It featured a lifting body of thick airfoil section between the inner engines. It was later modified for the attack role; a second aircraft, the AB-21, had different engines and cleaner aerodynamics but no more were built. Design The SAB AB-20 was a four-engine night bomber development of the three-engine Dyle et Bacalan DB-70 airliner. The change of manufacturer's name was the result of the financial failure of Dyle et Bacalan in 1929, followed by its immediate reappearance as SAB, who took over DB-70 development. The latter was built around a thick, wide chord airfoil centre section which provided generous internal space for passengers. The engines were mounted on this structure as were twin fuselages to carry the tail. The outer wings were of normal thickness and chord, and the cockpit and undercarriage were also attached to the centre section. The generous intra-wing volume equally offered crew, fuel and bomb-room for military purposes. Initially the AB-20 was intended to have three engines like its predecessor, but during the design phase there was a military request for a bombardier's position and a gunner's cockpit in the nose, which required the removal of the centre engine and its replacement by two extra engines wing-mounted outboard of the centre section. Apart from the extra engines and the very different crew compartment, together with the removal of passenger accommodation, the AB-20 and DB-70 had much in common: the thick centre section and high-mounted outer wings, twin fuselages carrying a long horizontal stabilizer, and twin fins and rudders. Both aircraft had conventional undercarriages with pairs of mainwheels widely separated on V-struts attached to the lower longerons of the centre section. The new central crew pod was flat-sided and tapered forwards to a complicated cylindrical nose, formed by a simple lower part with an overhanging, windowed cabin for the navigator/bombardier and an open gunner's cockpit, fitted with a machine gun ring, directly above. The nose also carried a long, conical probe with fine extensions, possibly pressure sensors. Further aft there was an enclosed pilot's cabin. A second gunner was stationed rearwards, on top of the centre section and a third fired from a ventral turret. Development The first flight of the AB-20 was on 15 January 1932. The following year it was reported that it had been structurally modified for the attack role and was returning to Villacoublay for tests. AB-20 in 1932 By early 1934 a much developed version, the AB-21 had appeared. It had the newer V-12 Lorraine Petrel water-cooled engines and a tapered, filleted cantilever wing without the struts used on the AB-20 and DB-70. The undercarriage had also been cleaned up with streamlined legs and wheels in long cowlings. The nose was further complicated, retaining the upper, open gunner's position but now with double underhanging windowed positions, though the conical probe had gone. Trials of an airborne sideways-firing 75 mm gun were carried out with the AB-20 prototype modified as the AB-22. Firing trials were halted after damage was caused to the lower wing skin by blast from the gun muzzle. Variants ;SAB AB-20 :A four-engined bomber derived from the three-engined Dyle et Bacalan DB-70, powered by four Lorraine 12Fb Courlis engines. ;SAB AB-21 :Similar to the AB-20 and DB-70 but with cantilevered wings and powered by four Lorraine 12Ha P√©trel engines. ;SAB AB-22 :The sole prototype AB-20, with a crew of five, modified with a 75 mm gun firing sideways.

Akinmurele (16 March 1978 ‚Äì 28 August 1999) was a British suspected serial killer who was charged with murdering five elderly people between 1995 and 1998. Initially, he was charged with the murder of an elderly couple, Eric Boardman, 77 and his wife Joan Boardman, 74. His third suspected crime was the murder of Jemmimah Cargill. Following Mr. Cargill, he was also charged with the murders of Dorothy Harris and Marjorie AshtonJuan Ignacio Blanco, \\"Stephen Akinmurele,\\" Murderpedia, the Encyclopedia of Murderers.. Akinmurele, who was of Nigerian descent, had a history of mental illness and had committed crimes against the elderly from the age of 11. He was drawn to situations in which he would encounter the elderly with the police asserting he got a \\"kick\\" out of killing old people. Akinmurele confessed to a number of the murders but died by suicide before his trial. Police believe he may have also been responsible for two further killings. The case is notable due to Akinmurele's long-standing hatred of elderly people. He was arrested on the 1st of November 1998 for the murders of Eric and Joan Boardman after they were found strangled following post-mortem examinations. On the 6th of November he was also charged with the murder of Ms. Cargill, who was murdered in a fire at her home. After the arrest of Stephen Akinmurele, the police starting looking into unsolved murders and one in particular, Marjorie Ashton. She was strangled in her home in May 1995. The authorities also appealed for more information about Stephen Akinmurele when he lived in the area of Castletown and Douglas Victims All of the victims in the case were senior citizens; the lead investigator in the case noted that Akinmurele had a \\"pathological hatred\\" of old people. He was dubbed \\"cul-de-sac killer\\" due to his choice of elderly victims living in quiet suburban streets. His first two known victims were Eric Boardman, 77, and his wife Joan Boardman, 74. One of their daughters discovered their bodies. Eric was found under a wardrobe in the hallway of their home and Joan was left on the living room floor. Stephen Akinmurele used batteries bound together to make a cosh or bludgeon. They found this bloody cosh beneath Eric's body. Even after examination of the bodies, they found only signs of strangulation. Eric Boardman posthumously received an award for his bravery in defending himself and his wife from Akinmurele. Boardman's actions caused vital evidence to be left at the scene by Akinmurle, enabling the police to trace him through his fingerprints. His third murder was Jemmimah Cargill, 75. She was killed in her flat about five days after Akinmurele murdered his first two victims. Four days after the murder of Ms. Cargill, Akinmurele is suspected of murdering the elderly Dorothy Harris in February 1996 by arson. Once the Lancashire police caught on, they re-opened other files of unsolved arson cases resulting in death in north-west England over the previous two years. Death Akinmurele killed himself in Manchester Prison in August 1999. He hanged himself by a window with a ligature, just weeks before his trial. In his suicide note, Akinmurele admitted to the crimes, saying that he regretted them and feared he would kill againSerial Killer Is Found Hanged in Prison Cell; Bisexual had a 'pathological hatred' of old folk Daily Mail, 30th August 1999. He wrote to his mother that he \\"couldn‚Äôt take anymore of the feeling like how [he] do[es] now, always wanting to kill\\". He had also earlier admitted to three other killings of younger victims, though police believe the confession to be false and an attempt to mask the ageist motivation behind his crimes.

After graduation at age 14 from the storied Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York) in 1931, he entered Brooklyn College where he majored in Chemistry and received the degree of Bachelor of Science in June 1935 at the age of 19. In 1934 while a junior in Brooklyn College, he tied for first place in a citywide contest in handling difficult problems of calculus. He completed the degree of Master of Science in June 1937 at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute (now part of New York University), New York. His thesis, \\"Equimolecular Condensation of Aldehydes with Phenols\\" was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) in 1937. During the period 1936 - 41, Shapiro was employed in the Railway Mail Service and as a quantitative organic microanalyst at Van Ameringen-Haebler in Elizabeth, NJ (later part of International Flavors & Fragrances). In July, 1941 he entered the United States Army. His initial tour within the United States included an assignment covered by Time magazine. During this period he was assigned the task of making injectable poison ivy extract for use in treatment of poison ivy infections. While it proved quite successful on the troops, Shapiro himself developed an extreme sensitivity to the extract and the ivy plant itself. He was then assigned as Toxicologist in the 15th Medical General Laboratory and then as Chemist of the Board for the Study of the Severely Wounded, Mediterranean Theater of Operations. The findings of this group were published in the book entitled, \\"The Physiologic Effects of Wounds.\\"US Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1952 http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/PhysiologicEffetsofWounds/default.htm As an additional outgrowth of this work, Shapiro published \\"A Suggested Simplification of Blood Volume Analysis Using the Dye T 1824,\\" Science, 114, 73 (1951). For his work on this Board, Shapiro was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. He was discharged from the army in 1946 with the rank of Major. Following his military service, Shapiro became Director of the Biological Laboratory, Arlington Chemical Co., Yonkers, New York, and, in January 1952, was assigned as Assistant Director, Organic Research, US Vitamin Corp., Yonkers, New York. His work there drew attention from \\"The Talk of the Town\\" section of The New Yorker. The work for Shapiro's doctoral thesis, \\"Reaction of Phenyl Biguanide with Esters and Related Compounds\\", published in JACS in 1954, was performed at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and in the laboratories of the Arlington Chemical Co. and US Vitamin Corp. under the direction of Prof. Charles G. Overberger. His work there led to the development of DBI. :\\"Developments in triazine chemistry continued in our laboratories under the direction of Shapiro...We selected betaphenyl ethyl triazine as the product to be studied for its diuretic properties. Pharmacological and toxicological studies having been completed, we were about to start clinical trials - when Lederle's Diamox broke into the market. It was obvious to us that Diamox was superior to our triazine compound and we wisely shelved the product. This left us with a fairly large stock of betaphenetheylbiguanide. We had for some time considered investigating the hypoglycemic properties of our biguanide compounds... Of the more than 260 biguanide compounds derivatized on the 1 and 1,5 nitrogens, it is unusual that of the 6 to 8 compounds found to be safe and pharmacologically active as oral hypoglycemic agents we found the very first, the betaphenethyl derivative, proved to be the most effective. The compound, with the generic name Phenformin was, after exhaustive clinical evaluation, finally chosen. After approval by the FDA, it was introduced in 1958 to the medical profession under the trade name DBI, about one year after the introduction of tolbutamide, the first sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic drug marketed in the US. DBI, after a modest start, has in ten years since its introduction become the second best selling oral antidiabetic drug in the United States and abroad.\\"Comments by Dr. Louis Freedman published in \\"The Chemist,\\" November 1968, Vol XLV, No. 11, p. 350 Shapiro was the author or co-author of 70 articles in scientific journals specializing in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. The subject range included blood chemistry, anesthetics, androgens, biguanides, diuretics, indanols, indandiones, triazines and others. A total of 76 patents bear his name as inventor or co-inventor, all on subjects related to organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. In an ironic turn, after a successful career in the field of hypoglycemic and blood chemistry, he fell victim to diabetes (Type 1, against which DBI was not effective) and leukemia. After a protracted illness he died on December 9, 1961, at 45 years of age. In 1962, the Seymour L. Shapiro Award in Organic Chemistry was established at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. The award is given as merited to an outstanding graduate in Organic Chemistry. Shapiro was posthumously awarded the Freedman Patent Award from the American Institute of Chemists in 1968.\\"The Chemist,\\" November 1968, Vol XLV, No. 11, p. 347 Shapiro married Florence Susan Mintz in 1951, and had two sons, Mitchell and Saul Shapiro.http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2018/Hastings%20NY%20Hastings%20on%20the%20Hudson%20News/Hastings%20NY%20Hastings%20on%20the%20Hudson%20News%201961/Hastings%20NY%20Hastings%20on%20the%20Hudson%20News%201961%20-%200756.pdf References Organic chemists 1916 births 1961 deaths People from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute of New York University alumni Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn) alumni Brooklyn College alumni ","title":"Seymour Shapiro"},{"id":"30211430","title":"Szandra Szalay"},{"id":"30211477","text":"Ray Wehba (16 August 1916 ‚Äì 2 June 2003) was a player in the National Football League.

View from the Steiner Hochalm The , lake was created during the last ice age and is at a height of 883 m AA. Underground springs fill the lake with crystal-clear water. Hintersteiner See is privately owned by the Tiroler Wasserkraft AG and is cautiously used to generate electricity. It drains into the Wei√üache river. There is a public bathing beach on the lake.  The legend of Hintersteiner See  In Hinterstein, there lived some high-spirited, wealthy farmers, who used to play bowls with lumps of butter on their luscious meadow, which was where the Hintersteiner See is today. It was a brightly moonlit night as they played once more. Then suddenly, the earth heaved beneath their feet and they sank with their farm and everything on it into the depths. For their wanton behaviour however, the farmers were banished onto the Scheffauer peaks and, to atone for their sins, they were condemned to play bowls as long as the Kaiser mountain exists. Their bowling alley can be found just below the peak of the Scheffauer in a small corrie which is covered with a fine carpet of moss. According to the legend, the wealthy Hintersteiner farmers had a huge argument about a spring. Even on the solemn festival of Corpus Christi they argued the entire day, which then ended in an unseemly scuffle. Bright and early the very next day, the dairymaid for the farmers, a very proper, sober woman who had long found the argument quite absurd, set off across the meadow to milk the cows and saw a small puddle of water in front of the house, which had never been there before. She shook her head as she saw it, but went on her way. It took her a long time to find the cows and she was surprised to find them huddling together in a dip in the landscape. She milked them quickly so as to get back to the farm and get on with her work, but when she walked up out of the dip, she was confronted with a lake where only the tip of just one house peeked out of the water.

Don Alvaro de Sande participated in numerous campaigns in the Spanish Army, including the Conquest of Tunis (1535), the conquest of D√ºren and Roermond in 1543, and the grand Battle of M√ºhlberg in 1549, in which Sande distinguished himself. When the German Campaign ended, Sande fought in the Italian War of 1551‚Äì1559 against France in the Tercios of Milan. Despite his advanced age, he participated in 1560 in the Battle of Djerba against the Turks, which ended in disaster. After the sea battle, the surviving soldiers took refuge in the fort they had completed just days earlier. When Giovanni Andrea Doria managed to escape in a small vessel, de Sande became commander of the force in the fort, which was soon attacked by the combined forces of Piyale Pasha and Turgut Reis. After a siege of three months, the garrison surrendered and 5,000 prisoners, including Alvaro de Sande, were carried back to Istanbul. After 2 years, de Sande was ransomed for 60,000 escudos and returned to Spain.

Background After the final Carthaginian naval defeat at the Aegates Islands,Walbank 1979, p. 187 the Carthaginians surrendered and accepted defeat in the First Punic War. Hamilcar Barca (Barca meaning lightning),Dodge 1994, p. 131 a leading member of the patriotic Barcine party in Carthage and a general who operated with ability in the course of the First Punic War, sought to remedy the losses that Carthage had suffered in Sicily to the Romans. In addition to this, the Carthaginians (and Hamilcar personally)Walbank 1979, p. 189 were embittered by the loss of Sardinia. After the Carthaginians' loss of the war, the Romans imposed terms upon them that were designed to reduce Carthage to a tribute-paying city to Rome and simultaneously strip it of its fleet.Delbr√ºck 1990, p. 303 While the terms of the peace treaty were harsh, the Romans did not strip Carthage of her strength; Carthage was the most prosperous maritime trading port of its day, and the tribute that was imposed upon them by the Romans was easily paid off on a yearly basis while Carthage was simultaneously engaged by Carthaginian mercenaries who were in revolt. The Carthaginian Barcine party was interested in conquering Iberia, a land whose variety of natural resources would fill its coffers with sorely needed revenueDelbr√ºck 1990, p. 312 and replace the riches of Sicily that, following the end of the First Punic War, were now flowing into Roman coffers. In addition, it was the ambition of the Barcas, one of the leading noble families of the patriotic party, to some day employ the Iberian peninsula as a base of operations for waging a war of revenge against the Roman military alliance. Those two things went hand in hand, and in spite of conservative opposition to his expedition, Hamilcar set out in 238 BCDodge 1994, p. 146Paton 1922, p. 243 to begin his conquest of the Iberian peninsula with these objectives in mind. Marching west from Carthage towards the Pillars of Hercules,Walbank 1979, p. 111 where his army crossed the strait and proceeded to subdue the peninsula, in the course of nine years Hamilcar conquered the south-eastern portion of the peninsula. His administration of the freshly conquered provinces led Cato the Elder to remark that \\"there was no king equal to Hamilcar Barca.\\" In 228 BC, Hamilcar was killed, witnessed by Hannibal,Mommsen 1862, p. 94 during a campaign against the Celtic natives of the peninsula. The commanding naval officer, who was both Hamilcar's son in law and a member of the Patriotic party ‚Äì Hasdrubal \\"The Handsome\\" ‚Äì was awarded the chief command by the officers of the Carthaginian Iberian army.Dodge 1994, p. 147 There were a number of Grecian colonies along the eastern coast of the Iberian peninsula, the most notable being the trade emporium of Saguntum. These colonies expressed concern about the consolidation of Carthaginian power on the peninsula, which Hasdrubal's deft military leadership and diplomatic skill procured. For protection, Saguntum turned to Rome; Rome sent a garrison to the city and a diplomatic mission to Hasdrubal's camp in Cartagena, informing him that the Iberus river must be the limit of the Carthaginian advance in Spain.Paton 1922, p. 273 The conclusion of the treaty and the embassy were sent to Hasdrubal's camp in 226 BC.Mommsen 1862, p. 92 In 221 BC, Hasdrubal was killed by an assassin.Walbank 1979, p. 190Dodge 1994, p. 148Paton 1922, p. 331 It was in that year that the officers of the Carthaginian army in Iberia expressed their high opinion of Hamilcar's 26-year-old son, Hannibal, by electing him to the chief command of the army. Having assumed the command (retroactively confirmed by the Carthaginian Senate) of the army that his father had wielded through nine years of hard mountain fighting, Hannibal declared that he was going to finish his father's project of conquering the Iberian peninsula, which had been the first objective in his father's plan to bring a war to Rome in Italy and defeat it there. Hannibal spent the first two years of his command seeking to complete his father's ambition while simultaneously putting down several potential revolts that resulted in part from the death of Hasdrubal, which menaced the Carthaginian possessions already conquered thus far. He attacked the tribe known as the Olcades and captured their chief town of Althaea. A number of the neighbouring tribes were astonished at the vigour and rapacity of this attack, as a result of which they submitted to the Carthaginians. He received tribute from all of these recently subjugated tribes, and marched his army back to Cartagena, where he rewarded his troops with gifts and promised more gifts in the future. During the next two years, Hannibal successfully reduced all of Iberia south of the Ebro to subjection, excepting the city of Saguntum, which, under the aegis of Rome, was outside of his immediate plans. Catalonia and Saguntum were now the only areas of the peninsula not in Hannibal's possession.Dodge 1994, p. 157 Roman foreign relations Hannibal was informed of Roman politics, and saw that this was the opportune time to attack. He had Gallic spies in every corner of the Roman Republic, even within the inner circles of the Senate itself.Mommsen 1862, p. 95 The Romans had spent the years since the end of the First Punic War (264-241 BC)Mommsen 1862, p. 62 tightening their grip on the peninsula by taking important geographical positions in the peninsula in addition to extending Rome's grip on Sicily, Corsica and Sardinia. In addition to this, the Romans had been at war with the Padane Gauls off and on for more than a century.Paton 1922, p. 287 The Boii had waged war upon the Romans in 238 BC, a war that lasted until 236 BC.Mommsen 1862, p. 77 In 225 BC, the natives of northern Italy, seeing that Rome was again moving aggressively to colonize their territory, progressed to the attack,Mommsen 1862, p. 78 but were defeated.Paton 1922, p. 317 The Romans were determined to drive their borders right up to the Alps.Paton 1922, p. 319 In 224 BC, the Boii submitted to Roman hegemony, and the next year the Anari also submitted to the Romans.Mommsen 1862, p. 81 In 223 BC, the Romans engaged in another battle with the Gauls, this time the Insubres.Mommsen 1862, p. 82 The Romans at first sustained significant losses against the Insubres while they were attempting to cross a ford near the junction of the Po and the Adda. After encamping in this country for some days without taking any decisive action, the Roman consul on the spot decided to negotiate a settlement with the Insubres. Under the terms of this freshly negotiated truce, the Romans marched out with full honours into the territory of their allies, the Cenomani. However, once they were safe within the territory of the Cenomani, the Romans again marched their army into the territory of the Insubres and were victorious.Paton 1922, p. 321 In 222 BC, the Celts sent an embassy to the Roman Senate, pleading for peace. Seeing an opportunity for a triumph for themselves, the consuls (Marcus Claudius and Gnaeus Cornelius) vigorously rejected the embassy, and the Gauls prepared for war with the Romans. They hired 30,000 mercenaries from beyond the Alps and awaited the arrival of the Romans.Paton 1922, p. 325 When the campaigning season began, the consular legions were marched into the Insubres territory again. A vigorous combat took place near Mediolanum, which resulted in the leaders of the Gallic revolt turning themselves over to the Romans. With this victory, the Padane Gauls were unhappily subdued, and ripe for revolt. Preparations Hannibal, aware of the situation, sent a number of embassies to the Gallic tribes in the Po valley. In 220 BC, he had begun to communicate intimately with the Padane Gauls (called the \\"Padane Gauls\\" because the Po in this era was called the \\"Padus\\" by the Romans), and these embassies brought with them offers of money, food and guides to the Carthaginian.Dodge 1994, p. 164 This mission had the specific aim of establishing a safe place for Hannibal to debouch from the Alps into the Po valley. Hannibal did not know a great deal about the Alps, but he knew enough to know that it was going to be a difficult march. He had some scouts give him reports concerning this mountain chain, and he received reports of the difficulties to be encountered there from the Gauls themselves. He did not desire to cross this rugged mountain chain and to descend into the Po valley with exhausted troops only to have to fight a battle. Hannibal knew enough about the Alps to know in particular that the descent was steeper than the ascent into the Alps. This was one of the reasons he wanted to have allies into whose territory he could march.The Alps rose as a result of the pressure of the African plate as it moved north against the stable Eurasian landmass; the northward direction of this movement made the Italian side of the Alps considerably steeper. The Romans had poorly treated those Gauls whom they had recently conquered, distributing their land to Roman colonists and taking other unscrupulous measures to ensure their own security, against the freshly- conquered tribes. The Insubres, whose tribal territory immediately abutted the Alps, and the Boii, farther down the Po, were particularly pleased with Hannibal's proposed invasion. In addition, much of the Iberian peninsula was populated by related Gallic tribes,Dodge 1994, p. 165 and those same Gauls were serving in Hannibal's army. It would be easy indeed to establish intimate relations with these disaffected tribes, especially once he had debouched from the Alps and was amongst them and the Insubres and Boii and other tribes could see and speak with this army for themselves. Polybius had this to say about Hannibal's plans: > Conducted his enterprise with consummate judgement; for he had accurately > ascertained the excellent nature of the country in which he was to arrive, > and the hostile disposition of its inhabitants towards the Romans; and he > had for guides and conductors through the difficult passes which lay in the > way of natives of the country, men who were to partake of the same hopes > with himselfDodge 1994, p. 166-167 Siege of Saguntum These preparations being completed, Hannibal sought to induce the Saguntines to come to arms with him and thereby declare war on Rome through her proxy. He did not desire to break the peace himself,Mommsen 1862, p. 96Walbank 1979, p. 191 and resorted to a variety of stratagems in order to induce the Saguntines to attack. However, the Saguntines did nothing except send a diplomatic mission to the Romans to complain about the belligerence of the Carthaginians.Walbank 1979, p. 192 The Senate, in its turn, sent a committee to Iberia to attempt to settle the issue diplomatically. Hannibal openly scorned the Roman offer in the hopes that it would drive the commission to declare war. However, the commission was not fooled and knew that war was in the air. The commission kept its peace, but brought news to Rome that Hannibal was prepared and was going to strike soon. The Senate took a number of measures in order to free up its hands for the coming conflict with the Carthaginian. An Illyrian revolt was put down with energy, and the Romans sped up the construction of a number of fortresses in Cisalpine Gaul. Demetrius of Pharos had abandoned his previous alliance with Rome and was now attacking Illyrian cities that had been incorporated into the Roman State.Walbank 1979, p. 193 Hannibal could not achieve the ends that he had hoped for, and in the end he sent news to Carthage (where the peace party, his political enemies, were in power)Mommsen 1862, p. 91 to the effect that the Saguntines were aggressively handling one of their subject tribes, the Torboletes, and encamped in front of Saguntum to besiege it without awaiting any reply from Carthage. Words were exchanged in the Carthaginian Senate to the effect that Hannibal should be handed over to the Romans and his actions disavowed. However, the multitude in Carthage was too much in support of the conflict to order a stop to the war. The siege took place over the course of eight months, and it is notable that the Romans did not send any aid to the Saguntines in spite of this being a part of the terms of their alliance. The Romans allowed themselves to be tied up in a war against the Illyrians, and did not treat the Carthaginian threat from Iberia with the attention that it deserved. After the siege, Hannibal sold all the inhabitants as slaves, and distributed the proceeds from those sales to his soldiers. In addition, all the booty from the sacking of the city was taken back to Carthage and distributed to the populace, in order to rally their support to his cause. The rest of the city's treasures were put into his war chest for his planned expedition.Walbank 1979, p. 194 March through the Pyrenees Iberian warrior from bas-relief . The warrior is armed with a falcata and an oval shield. Iberian tribes fought for both sides in the Second Punic War, but in reality most wanted to be rid of all foreign domination. National Archaeological Museum of Spain, Madrid Hannibal had spent the winter after the siege of Saguntum in Cartagena, during which time he dismissed his troops to their own localities. He did this with the hope of cultivating the best possible morale in his army for the upcoming campaign, which he knew was going to be difficult. He left his brother, Hasdrubal in charge of the administration of Carthaginian Iberia, as well as its defence against the Romans. In addition to this, he swapped the native troops of Iberia to Africa, and the native troops of Africa to Iberia.Walbank 1979, p. 209 This was done in order to minimize desertion and assure the loyalty of the troops while he was himself busy with the destruction of Rome. He also left his brother a number of ships.Walbank 1979, p. 210 Hannibal foresaw problems if he left Catalonia as a bridgehead for the Romans. They had a number of allies in this country, and he could not allow the Romans a place to land in his base unopposed. As he was relying upon contingents of forces coming to him in Italy via the land route on which he was about to head out, he must take and conquer this country. He had no intention of leaving Iberia to its fate once he was in Italy. Hannibal opted to take the region in a swift campaign, and to that effect he divided his army into three columns, in order to subdue the entirety of the region at the same time. After receiving route information from his scouts and messages from the Celtic tribes that resided around the Alps, Hannibal set out with 90,000 heavy infantry from various African and Iberian nations, and 12,000 cavalry. From the Ebro to the Pyrenees, the Carthaginians confronted four tribes: the Illergetes, the Bargusii, the Aeronosii, and the Andosini. There were a number of cities here that Hannibal took, which Polybius does not specify. This campaign was conducted with speed in order to take as little time as possible in the reduction of this region. Polybius reports severe losses on Hannibal's part. Having reduced this area, he left his general Hanno in command of this area, specifically over the Bargusii, whom he had reason to distrust due to their affiliation with the Romans. He left his brother in control of this country with 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.Walbank 1979, p. 211 At this early juncture in the campaign, he opted to send home another 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. This was done to serve two purposes: he wanted to leave a force of men behind who would retain positive sentiments towards Hannibal himself; and he wanted the rest of the Iberians (in his army, as well as out) to believe that the chances of success in the expedition were good, and as a result of which they would be more inclined to join the contingents of reinforcements that he anticipated calling up during the course of his expedition. The remaining force consisted of 50,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalry.Walbank 1979, p. 212 The principal column was the right column, and with it was the treasure chest, the cavalry, the baggage, all the other necessities of war, and Hannibal himself.Dodge 1994, p. 173 This was the critical column, and it was no coincidence that Hannibal was with it. As long as Hannibal had no ships to keep himself abreast of the exact movements of the Romans, he wanted to be present in person in case the Romans should make a landing in an attempt to attack his army on its ascent or descent through the Pyrenees. This column crossed the Ebro at the town of Edeba,Dodge 1994, p. 172 and proceeded directly along the coast through Tarraco, Barcino, Gerunda, Emporiae and Illiberis. Each of those oppidums was taken and garrisoned in turn. The second, or central, column crossed the Ebro at the oppidum of Mora and from there information is fairly sparse. It proceeded through a number of valleys in this country, and had orders to subdue any tribes that resisted its advance. It eventually rejoined the principal column when it had completed its task. The third, or left, column crossed the Ebro where it touches with the Sicoris River and proceeded along the river valley and into the mountain countries. It performed the same task as the second and the first columns did. When planning each of these marches, Hannibal ensured that the Rubrucatus river was athwart each of the columns' paths, so if any of the columns should be placed in a disadvantageous situation the other columns could march up and down the river in support of each other should one be placed in a perilous position by the Barbarians. The campaign was conducted over the course of two months, and was incredibly costly. Over the course of the two-month campaign, Hannibal lost 13,000 men. March to the Rh√¥ne The march to the Rh√¥ne after the descent through the Pyrenees was mostly uneventful for the Carthaginians, who had just spent the previous July and August subduing numerous fierce peoples living in the Pyrenees.Dodge 1994, p. 171 The countries through which they passed were of different opinions concerning the Carthaginians, the Romans, and the passage of Hannibal's army through their land. Some of these tribes were friendly to Hannibal's cause, while others were opposed to him.Dodge 1994, p. 176 That no reports exist of any fighting taking place in this country, in spite of the lack of homogeneity in political leadership amongst the peoples of this area, reflects Hannibal's skill at negotiation. He dealt with each tribe as he marched through their territory, employing his charisma and considerable war chest. Massilia (modern Marseille), a successful Greek trade emporium had for some time been under the influence of the Romans, and the Romans had even settled colonists there. Massilia feared the arriving Carthaginian army, and to this effect had sought to influence the native tribes on the left bank of the Rh√¥ne (The Eastern Bank) to take up the cause of the Romans.Dodge 1994, p. 177 This they were able to do, as the barbarians in this country were to make his crossing of the Rh√¥ne problematical. Publius Scipio, one of the consuls for 218 BC, received orders from the Senate to confront Hannibal in the theatre of the Ebro or the Pyrenees.Walbank 1979, p. 213 The Senate delegated to him 60 ships for this purpose.Walbank 1979, p. 214 However, he did not move with the speed that the issue required of him. When he arrived in the Po area, there was an uprising amongst the freshly conquered Gauls.Mommsen 1862, p. 102 More colonies were being established in the Po region, and this caused the Boii and Insubres to arise afresh who were now aware that Hannibal was heading to them. Instead of employing the legions that were on hand for their intended Iberian expedition, the Senate ordered that they should be sent to the Po under the command of a Praetor and new legions should be levied by the consul. The formation of a new army was a fairly easy matter for the Romans. There were so many citizens who were qualified for service in the army that all the government had to do was inform the citizenry that more soldiers were needed and they would be required to serve. Many Romans, being required to serve at some point, spent portions of their youth training to serve in the legions. Finally, having got these new legions together ‚Äì in a much more leisurely fashion than the urgency of the situation demanded of him ‚Äì he set sail from Ostia. In this day there were no compasses, and it was the habit of navigators to sail their ships along the coast and to stop at night for victuals.Dodge 1994, p. 127 So, after sailing north along the peninsula's coast (Italian) and then turning west towards the Iberian peninsula, the consul ordered the fleet to stop in Massilia.Dodge 1994, p. 178 The time from Ostia to Massilia was 5 days. When he arrived there, to his surprise he learned from the Massiliots that instead of Hannibal still being in Catalonia, as he had anticipated, Hannibal was about 4 days marchWalbank 1979, p. 215 north of their city on the far side of the Rh√¥ne. Crossing the Rh√¥ne War elephants depicted in Hannibal Barca crossing the Rh√¥ne, by Henri Motte, 1878 Much of Hannibal's marches are shrouded in debate, especially the debate concerning the path he opted to employ over the Alps. However, modern historians agree on where Hannibal encamped his army on the western bank on the Rh√¥ne and see the river crossing as clearly conceived and crisply executed. While Rome had been idle and leaving her allies in Catalonia to their fate at the hands of the Carthaginians, the Massiliots, allies of the Romans, were busy rousing the tribes on the left (eastern) bank of the Rh√¥ne against the Carthaginians. Upon the arrival of the intelligence of the Carthaginians in the neighbourhood of Massilia, the consul threw up his proposed Iberian expedition and in its stead thought to do the next logical thing, to prevent Hannibal's crossing of the Rh√¥ne as best he could. To this effect he sent a column of 300 horse up the left (east) bank of the Rh√¥ne with orders to ascertain the exact location of Hannibal's army. Hannibal received similar news to the effect that the Romans had just arrived with one of their consular armies (22,000 foot and 2,000 horse).Mommsen 1862, p. 103 Hannibal took advantage of the pre-existing hatred the Celts on the right (west) bank had for the Romans, and persuaded them to aid him in his crossing of this formidable obstacle. He secured from them a number of boats that were capable of making trips at sea, and a numerous collection of canoes of all sorts that must have been employed by the natives of that country. In addition to purchasing these, he was able to acquire their aid in building still other boats.Dodge 1994, p. 179 This process of preparing to cross the Rhone took two days. Awaiting the Carthaginian army on the left bank of the Rh√¥ne was a tribe of Gauls called the Cavares. This tribe had fortified a camp on the far side of the river,Dodge 1994, p. 180 and was awaiting Hannibal's army to cross, so as to attack them as they crossed. There can be no doubt that Hannibal knew of Alexander the Great's crossing of the Hydaspes river in India as from a tactical and strategic standpoint, it is almost exactly the same. Hannibal formulated his plan according to this model (as indeed it is held up as a cookie cutter way to cross rivers, even to cadets at military institutions to this day) ordered one of his lieutenants; Hanno, son of Bomilcar to make a northern circuit, to cross the Rh√¥ne at a location that he deemed to be suitable for the purpose, and then by forced marches, march south and to take the Barbarian army in flank while he was crossing the river. The day and the night after all of the boats had been built and gathered, Hanno was ordered up the bank and guided by native Gauls, approximately upriver at Pont St. Esprit there was an island that divided the Rh√¥ne into two small streams. It was here that Hanno decided to cross, and ordered that boats and rafts should be constructed from materials that were at hand.Walbank 1979, p. 216Dodge 1994, p. 181 The Carthaginian detachment chopped down trees, lashing the logs together with reliable ropes they had brought with them from the army's stores. By this means, Hanno's corps crossed the river and immediately proceeded south to the barbarian location. During this time, Hannibal had been completing his preparations to cross the Rh√¥ne. At this, the Carthaginian preparations had been particularly obvious and loud ‚Äì Hannibal had ordered the preparations to be made without concern for secrecy, knowing full well that Hanno's corps was marching down the left (eastern) bank of the Rh√¥ne to attack the Cavares. His preparations were designed to draw their attention away from their northern flank and focus their attention on his own preparations. Three days after setting out, Hanno arrived behind a tributary of the Rhone and gave the previously agreed upon signal to let Hannibal know that his force had arrived. Hannibal immediately ordered the boats to cross. The small corps was observing the principal army closely, and on seeing it start its crossing, prepared to descend on the Cavares while the army was crossing. The crossing itself was carefully designed to be as smooth as possible. Every detail was well thought out. The heavy horsemen were put across furthest upstream, and in the largest boats, so that the boats that Hannibal had less confidence in could be rowed to the left (western) bank in the lee of the larger and more sturdy craft. As for the horses themselves, most of them were swum across the river at the side and stern of each boat. However, some were put on boats fully saddled and ready for immediate use, so that, once they debouched from the river, they could cover the infantry and the rest of the army while it formed up to attack the barbarians. Seeing that the Carthaginians were finally crossing, the Cavares rose from their entrenchments and prepared their army on the shore near the Carthaginian landing point.Dodge 1994, p. 184 The armies started to shout and jeer at each other while the Carthaginian army was in the midst of crossing.Dodge 1994, p. 182 These sort of exchanges consisted primarily of encouraging their own men and challenging the other army to battle. Often in antiquity, to intimidate their enemy, armies would be ordered to pound their shields with their weapons and raise loud cries at exactly the same moment to create the greatest amount of noise. Carthaginian Army and the corp which made the circuit. Barbarian army compromised as the result of circuit It was at precisely this moment, while the Carthaginian army was in the middle of the stream jeering at the enemy from the boats and the Cavares were challenging them to come on from the left bank, that Hanno's corp revealed itself and charged down on the rear and flanks of the Cavares.Walbank 1979, p. 217 A small detachment of Hanno's force was assigned to set the Cavares camp on fire, but the majority of this force reeled in on the stunned Cavares. Some of the Cavares rushed to the defence of their camp,Mommsen 1862, p. 104 but the majority remained at the location where they had been awaiting the arrival of what they had thought was all of Hannibal's army. They were divided; and Hannibal, who was on one of the first boats, landed his men on the left bank of the Rh√¥ne amidst the dazed and confused Cavares and with a will led his men in upon them. There was barely even a semblance of resistance; surrounded as they were, pandemonium took control of their ranks, and each man looked to his own safety as they retreated pell-mell away from the carefully arrayed Carthaginian phalanx. While the actual conflict only took a matter of minutes, Hannibal had spent five days preparing this dangerous and risky operation from every angle, ensuring that it was ready at all points and as little as possible was left to chance. From the Rh√¥ne to the Alps 156x156px Hannibal needed to reach the Alps quickly in order to beat the onset of winter. He knew that if he waited until springtime on the far side of the mountains, the Romans would have time to raise another army. He had intelligence that the consular army was camped at the mouth of the Rh√¥ne. He sent 500 Numidian cavalry down the eastern bank of the river to acquire better information concerning the forces massed to oppose him. This force encountered 300 mounted Romans who had been sent up the river for the same purpose. The Numidians were defeated with 240 of their number killed in this exchange between scouting parties; in addition to 140 Roman losses. The Numidians were followed back to the Carthaginian camp, which was almost assembled excepting the elephants, which required more time getting across. Upon seeing Hannibal had not crossed with the whole of his force, the scouts raced back to the coast to alert the consul. Upon receiving this information, the consul dispatched his army up the river in boats, but arrived too late. Rhone Region to the Alps In the face of winter and hostile tribes, the consul decided to return to Italy and await the arrival of Hannibal as he descended from the Alps. However, in accordance with the Senate's orders, the consul ordered his brother, Gnaeus Scipio to take a majority of the army to Spain. The consul proposed attacking Hannibal's overextended and vulnerable lines of communications and supply. Despite their established tactical system (formations and troop evolutions, etc.), the Romans were used to fighting by marching their troops to their enemies' army, forming their army up and attacking. They did not know how to force an enemy to battle by cutting off their communications, they were not aware of which flank was the strategic flank of an enemy in a battle. In addition, they were negligent about their order of march,Dodge 1994, p. 63 and early Roman history is littered with massacres of consular armies by other nations because of their lack of proper precaution against these evils.Dodge 1994, p. 64 On getting the whole of his army on the left bank of the Rhone, Hannibal introduced his army to Magilus, and some other less notable Gallic chiefs of the Po valley.Mommsen 1862, p. 105 Hannibal's purpose was to inspire his men with confidence in the planned expedition by showing them Padane Gallic chieftains who offered them their aid. Speaking through an interpreter, Magilus spoke of the support that the recently conquered Padane Gauls had for the Carthaginians and their mission of destroying Rome. Hannibal then addressed the officers himself. The troops' enthusiasm was uplifted by Hannibal's inspiring address. Upon crossing the river, Hannibal ordered his infantry to start their march the day after the assembly, followed by the supply train.Dodge 1994, p. 187 Not knowing that the Romans were eventually going to set out for Italy, when his cavalry had crossed the river he ordered them to curtain his march on his southern flank, towards the sea. His cavalry would have formed a screen which would have been employed to protect him from the Romans were they to advance upon him from that direction. The cavalry would skirmish with the Roman scouts, while giving the rest of the army time to form up. This contingency did not occur. Hannibal was in the rearguard with the elephants. This was the direction that he assumed that the Romans would be most likely to advance from (that is from the west) as he had some idea that they were behind him. The rearguard was well manned to ensure that it could skirmish with the Roman army while the main body of his infantry and cavalry could form up for battle against the Romans if they should attack from that quarter. This contingency, however, also did not occur. While assuming this order of march, Hannibal marched towards the Insula. He had ordered his infantry to get a head start, and it marched to the Is√®re in six days, marching per day. The cavalry and rear guard only took four days, a march of per day. In this period, the body as a whole had marched .Dodge 1994, p. 199 When Hannibal's army made contact with the Insula, he arrived in a Gallic chiefdom that was in the midst of a civil conflict.Dodge 1994, p. 200 For whatever reason, Hannibal chose the cause of the elder of the two combatants, Brancus. After putting away the cause of the younger and less popularly supported one, he formed an alliance with Brancus. From this tribe he received supplies that were required for the expedition across the Alps. In addition, he received Brancus' diplomatic protection. Up until the Alps proper, he did not have to fend off any tribes. Ascent of the Alps Possible routes Hannibal took through the Alps, with Polybius' account shown in green. Hannibal crossing the Alps into Italy Little certainty exists on the route of Hannibal's march through the mountains, and precisely which valleys and passes he used remains contested by historians. The events recorded in ancient accounts and their relationship to the Alpine geography has been a matter of historiographical dispute since the decades following the Second Punic War. Identification of the pass - the highest point of Hannibal's route and the beginning of his descent - that Hannibal took through the Alpine range determines which route his army followed. Proposals have been made for the following passes: How (and Where) Did Hannibal Cross the Alps? By Franz Lidz, Smithsonian Magazine July 2017 https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how- hannibal-crossed-the-alps-180963671/ * Little St Bernard Pass * Col de Clapier * Col de la Traversette * Col de Montgen√®vre * The pass near Mont Cenis Theodore Ayrault Dodge, writing in the late nineteenth century, argued that Hannibal used the Little St Bernard Pass, but modern historian John Francis Lazenby concluded that Col de Clapier was the pass used by Hannibal.Hannibal's War: A Military History of the Second Punic War, p. 46, John Francis Lazenby University of Oklahoma Press, 1998 More recently, W. C. Mahaney has argued Col de la Traversette closest fits the records of ancient authors.Mahaney, W. C., Allen, C. C. R., Pentlavalli, P., Dirszowsky, O., Tricart, P., Keiser, L., Somelar, P., Kelleher, B., Murphy, B., Costa, P. J. M., and Julig, P., 2014, \\"Polybius's ‚Äòprevious landslide‚Äô: proof that Hannibal's invasion route crossed the Col de la Traversette\\", Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry, 14(2), 1‚Äì20. Biostratigraphic archaeological data has reinforced the case for Col de la Traversette; analysis of peat bogs near watercourses on both sides of the pass's summit showed that the ground was heavily disturbed \\"by thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of animals and humans\\" and that the soil bore traces of unique levels of Clostridia bacteria associated with the digestive tract of horses and mules.Mahaney, W. C., Allen, C. C. R., Pentlavalli, P., Kulakova, A., Young, J. M., Dirszowsky, R. W., West, A., Kelleher, B., Jordan, S., Pulleyblank, C., O‚ÄôReilly, S., Murphy, B. T., Lasberg, K., Somelar, P., Garneau, M., Finkelstein, S. A., Sobol, M. K., Kalm, V., Costa, P. J. M., Hancock, R. G. V., Hart, K. M., Tricart, P., Barendregt, R. W., Bunch, T. E., and Milner, M. W., 2017, \\"Biostratigraphic evidence relating to the age‚Äêold question of Hannibal's invasion of Italy\\", Archaeometry, vol, 59, 164‚Äì190. Radiocarbon dating secured dates of 2168BP or c.218BC, the year of Hannibal's march. Mahaney et al. have concluded that this and other evidence strongly supports the Col de la Traversette as being the 'Hannibalic Route' as had been argued by Gavin de Beer in 1974. De Beer was one of only three interpreters - the others being John Lazenby and Jakob Seibert de. - to have visited all the Alpine high passes and presented a view on which was most plausible. Both De Beer and Siebert had selected the Col de la Traversette as the one most closely matching the ancient descriptions.de Beer, S. G., 1974, Hannibal: The struggle for power in the Mediterranean, Book Club Associates, London. Polybius wrote that Hannibal had crossed the highest of the Alpine passes: Col de la Traversette, between the upper Guil valley and the upper Po river is the highest pass. It is moreover the most southerly, as Varro in his De re rustica relates, agreeing that Hannibal's Pass was the highest in Western Alps and the most southerly. Mahaney et al. argue that factors used by De Beer to support Col de la Traversette including \\"gauging ancient place names against modern, close scrutiny of times of flood in major rivers and distant viewing of the Po plains\\" taken together with \\"massive radiocarbon and microbiological and parasitical evidence\\" from the alluvial sediments either side of the pass furnish \\"supporting evidence, proof if you will\\" that Hannibal's invasion went that way.W. C. Mahaney, P. Somelar, A. West, R. W. Dirszowsky, C. C. R. Allen, T. K. Remmel, P. Tricart \\"Reconnaissance of the Hannibalic Route in the Upper Po Valley, Italy: Correlation with Biostratigraphic Historical Archaeological Evidence in the Upper Guil Valley, France\\", Archaeometry, 2018. According to historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Hannibal marched in the direction of Mt. Du Chat towards the village of AqusteDodge 1994, p. 202 and from there to Chevelu,Dodge 1994, p. 203 to the pass by Mt. Du Chat. There he found that the passes were fortified by the Allobroges. He sent out spies to ascertain if there was any weakness in their disposition. These spies found that the barbarians only maintained their position at the camp during the day, and left their fortified position at night. In order to make the Allobroges believe that he did not deem a night assault prudent, he ordered that as many camp- fires be lit as possible, in order to induce them into believing that he was settling down before their encampment along the mountains. However, once they left their fortifications, he led his best troops up to their fortifications and seized control of the pass.Dodge 1994, p. 205 Hiding his men in the mountain brush on a cliff that arose immediately above and to the right off Hannibal's route of march, about 100 feet or so above the path, Hannibal stationed his slingers and archers there. This overhang was an excellent place from which to attack an enemy while it was marching in column through the pass.Dodge 1994, p. 206 The descent from this pass was steep, and the Carthaginians were having a hard time marching down this side of the pass, especially the baggage animals. The Barbarians, seeing this, attacked anyway, in spite of their disadvantageous position. More baggage animals were lost in the confusion of the Barbarian attack, and they rolled off of the precipices to their deaths. This put Hannibal in a difficult situation. However, Hannibal, at the head of the same elite corps that he led to take the overhang, led them against these determined barbarians. Virtually all of these barbarians died in the ensuing combat, as they were fighting with their backs to a steep precipice, trying to throw their arrows and darts uphill at the advancing Carthaginians. After this contest of arms, the baggage was held together in good order and the Carthaginian army followed the road down to the plain that begins roughly at modern Bourget.Dodge 1994, p. 208 Historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge states that this plain was 4‚Äì6 miles wide at most places, and was almost entirely stripped of defenders since they were all stationed at the Mt. Du Chat pass. Hannibal marched his army to modern Chambery and took their city easily, stripping it of all its horses, captives, beasts of burden and corn. In addition, there were enough supplies for three days' rations for the army. This must have been welcome considering that no small portion of their supplies had been lost when the pack animals had fallen over the precipice in the course of the previous action. He then ordered this town to be destroyed, in order to demonstrate to the Barbarians of this country what would happen if they opposed him in the same fashion as this tribe had. He encamped there to give his men time to rest after their exhausting work, and to collect further rations. Hannibal then addressed his army, and we are informed that they were made to appreciate the extent of the effort they were about to undergo and were raised to good spirits in spite of the difficult nature of their undertaking.Dodge 1994, p. 210 The Carthaginians continued their march and at modern Albertville they encountered the Centrones, who brought gifts and cattle for the troops. In addition, they brought hostages in order to convince Hannibal of their commitment to his cause. Hannibal was concerned and suspicious of the Centrones, though he hid this from them and the Centrones guided his army for two days.http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D52 According to historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge, they marched through the Little St Bernard Pass near the village of S√©ez, and as they did, the pass narrowed and the Centrones turned against the Carthaginians. Some military critics, notably Napoleon,Dodge 1994, p. 212 challenge that this was actually the place where the ambush took place, but the valley through which the Carthaginians were marching was the only one that could sustain a population that was capable of attacking the Carthaginian army and simultaneously sustaining the Carthaginians on their march. Little St. Bernard Pass, one of the possible routes The Centrones waited to attack, first allowing half of the army to move through the pass.Dodge 1994, p. 216 This was meant to divide Hannibal's troops and supplies and make it difficult for his army to organize a counter-attack, but Hannibal, having anticipated deceit by the Centrones, had arranged his army with elephants, cavalry and baggage in front, while his hoplites followed in the rear. Centrones forces had positioned themselves on the slopes parallel to Hannibal's army and used this higher ground to roll boulders and rain rocks down at the Carthaginian army, killing many more pack animals. Confusion reigned in the ranks caught in the pass. However, Hannibal's heavily armed rearguard held back from entering the pass, forcing the Barbarians to descend to fight. The rearguard was thus able to hold off the attackers, before Hannibal and the half of his army not separated from him were forced to spend the night near a large white rock, which Polybius writes \\"afforded them protection\\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D53 and is described by William Brockedon, who investigated Hannibal's route through the Alps, as being a \\"vast mass of gypsum...as a military position, its occupation secures the defence of the pass.\\"Brockedon, William. Illustrations of the passes of the Alps, by which Italy Communicates, Volume 1. Page 5. https://books.google.com/books?id=4YIBAAAAQAAJ&lpg;=PA5&ots;=rVGH8guFkX&pg;=PA5#v=onepage&q;&f;=false By morning, the Centrones were no longer in the area. The army rested here for two days. It was the end of October and snowy weather, the length of the campaign, ferocity of the fighting, and the loss of animals sapped morale in the army's ranks;Dodge 1994, p. 222 From their outset in Iberia, Hannibal's troops had been marching for over five months and the army had greatly reduced in size. The majority of Hannibal's fighters were unaccustomed to extreme cold of the high Alps, being mostly from Africa and Iberia.Dodge 1994, p. 223 According to Polybius,Polybius, History III:54http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D54 Hannibal assembled his men, declared to them that the end of their campaign was drawing near; and pointed to the view of Italy, showing his soldiers the Po Valley and the plains near it, and reminded them they had been assured of Gallic friendship and aid. The Po Valley is not visible from Little St Bernard PassBrockedon, William. Illustrations of the passes of the Alps, by which Italy Communicates, Volume 1. Page 9. https://books.google.com/books?id=4YIBAAAAQAAJ&lpg;=PA9&ots;=rVGH8guFkX&pg;=PA9#v=onepage&q;&f;=false and if Hannibal took that path it is likely that he pointed in the direction of the Po Valley but it was not in sight. If, however, Hannibal had ascended the Col de la Traversette, the Po Valley would indeed have been visible from the pass's summit, vindicating Polybius's account.de Beer, S. G., 1969, Hannibal: Challenging Rome's supremacy, Viking, New York, NY. pp. 163-180 After three days of rest, Hannibal ordered the descent from the Alps to begin.Livy, Histories XXI:37; Polybius, History III:54 Descent to Italy The snow on the southern side of the Alps melts and thaws to a greater or lesser extent during the course of the day, and then refreezes at night. In addition, the Italian side of the Alps is much steeper; many men lost their footing down this side of the Alps and died. At an early point in their descent, the army came upon a section of the path that had been blocked by a landslide. This section of the path was broken for about 300 yards.Dodge 1994, p. 224 Hannibal attempted to detour, by marching through a place where there was a great deal of snow ‚Äì the Alps' altitude at this point retains snowpack year around. They made some headway, at the cost of no small portion of the pack animals that were left, before Hannibal came to appreciate that this route was impossible for an army to traverse. Hannibal marched his men back to the point in their path prior to their detour, near the broken stretch of the path and set up camp.Dodge 1994, p. 225 From here, Hannibal ordered his men to set about fixing the mule path. Working in relays, the army set about this labour-intensive task under the eyes of Hannibal, who was constantly encouraging them. Both the sick and the healthy were put to this. The next day the road was in sufficient condition to permit the cavalry and pack animals to cross the broken stretch of road; Hannibal ordered that these should instantly race down below the foliage line (2 miles below the summit of the Alps)Dodge 1994, p. 228 and should be allowed access to the pastures there. However, Hannibal's remaining elephants, which were completely famished, were still unable to proceed along the path. Hannibal's Numidian cavalry carried on working on the road, taking three more days to fix it sufficiently to allow the elephants to cross. Getting the animals across this stretch of road, Hannibal raced ahead of the rearguard to the part of the army that was below the pasture line.Dodge 1994, p. 229 It took the army three days to march from this place into \\"the plains which are near the Po\\" according to Polybius. Hannibal then focused on, according to Polybius, \\"[the] best means of reviving the spirits of his troops and restoring the men and horses to their former vigour and condition.\\" Hannibal ordered his men to encamp, at a point which is near modern Ivrea.Dodge 1994, p. 230  In popular culture  In part III of Jonathan Swift's 1726 prose satire, Gulliver's Travels, the eponymous main protagonist, Gulliver, visits \\"Glubbdubdrib\\", a fictional island populated by sorcerers. Invited by the governor of the island who is capable of summoning the dead, Gulliver summons Hannibal and learns that he supposedly did not actually utilize fire and vinegar to melt boulders obstructing his path, and that it was probably a conjured up myth. In The Simpsons episode \\"Cape Feare\\", the words 'Terror Lake salutes Hannibal crossing the Alps' can be read on the sides of several elephants as they trample Sideshow Bob. In the Doctor Who episode \\"World War Three (Doctor Who)\\", The Doctor and Harriet Jones reference Hannibal‚Äôs use of vinegar to melt boulders while crossing the Alps. In the 9th episode of the 3rd season of the motorsport television entertainment series, The Grand Tour, co-host Jeremy Clarkson references Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, comparing the steep terrain-traversing capabilities war elephants of Hannibal's army to that of a Citro√´n C3 Aircross.

She was the first woman to hold the position of Permanent Secretary, the most senior civil servant in a Ministry, at the Ministry of Housing and Local Government from 1955 to her retirement in 1966.Kevin Theakston, ‚ÄòSharp, Evelyn Adelaide, Baroness Sharp (1903‚Äì1985)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 19 June 2015 Early life Sharp was born in Hornsey, Middlesex (now part of Haringey in north London). She was third of five children, with three sisters and a younger brother. Her parents were the Reverend Charles James Sharp, the Vicar of Ealing, and his wife, Mary Frances Musgrave Harvey. Her uncles included Richard Harvey, Archdeacon of Halifax; Sir John Harvey, Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales; and Sir Ernest Harvey Bt., Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. She was educated at Dana House in Crouch Hill, and the North London Collegiate School. At St Paul's Girls' School, she captained the school at both cricket and netball. In 1922 she moved to Somerville College, Oxford, graduating with a second in Modern History in 1925. Civil and public service In 1926, she joined the Civil Service as an administrator, at first in the Board of Trade then after 18 months the Ministry of Health. Although the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act had been enacted in 1919, the examinations to enter the administrative grades at the civil service had only been opened to women in 1925. The first three in 1925 were Alix Kilroy (a college friend), Enid Russell-Smith and Mary Smieton; all three would later be named Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The Ministry of Health at the time was concerned with housing and local government, and this soon became her specialty. During the Second World War she was seconded to the Treasury. At the end of the war she returned to the Ministry of Health as an under-secretary in 1945, before becoming Deputy Secretary in the Ministry of Town and Country Planning in 1946. As no other woman had been as senior, there were no established women's pay scales, so she received the same pay as men on the same grade, a decade before equal pay became official policy. She played an important role in the development of post-war planning policy, including the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 and the development of new towns. When the Ministry of Housing and Local Government was formed in 1951, she became the Deputy Secretary. She worked with Harold Macmillan, who later described her as \\"without exception the ablest woman I have ever known\\". In October 1955, she was promoted to be the Permanent Secretary. Sharp had become the first woman to be in the highest executive position with a Ministry and she worked for five different Ministers during her time, Duncan Sandys, Henry Brooke, Charles Hill, Keith Joseph and Richard Crossman. She held the post to her retirement in 1966. She developed a reputation for her depth of specialist knowledge and experience, direct approach and strength of character (to the extent that she is often described as \\"formidable\\"), and an ability to identify solutions. From 1964, her Minister was Labour's Richard Crossman, who described his battles with her in the first of his three-volume Diaries of a Cabinet Minister. Sharp succeeded in keeping planning within her ministry's remit, after the government formed a new Ministry of Land and Natural Resources. She was a member of the Plowden committee, which examined the control of public expenditure, from 1959 to 1961. After her retirement, she served on the Royal Commission on local government in England from 1966 to 1969 (see Redcliffe-Maud Report), and she was a member of the Independent Broadcasting Authority from 1966 to 1973. She also served as a director of the construction company Bovis, and as president of the London and Quadrant Housing Trust. She was the author of a 1970 report to the Minister of Transport called Transport Planning: The Men For The Job. The intention of this report was to make transport planning in local government more efficient; the report discussed how to organise transport planning and what university courses would be needed to supply sufficient engineers and technicians to perform the work. However, the report is remembered because it clearly stated that transport planning and land-use planning could not be separated and should be performed by a single department as an ongoing activity. Another viewpoint Because of her enthusiasm for modernist architecture and urban rebuilding it has been said that she \\"truly did come close to doing as much damage to Britain as the Luftwaffe\\". \\"She went along with the conventional wisdom of the time in backing high-rise flats ‚Äî something she later regretted\\".Kevin Theakston, \\"Sharp, Evelyn Adelaide, Baroness Sharp (1903‚Äì1985)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 19 September 2018 Honours and styles =Honours= In 1948, she was appointed to the Order of the British Empire as a Dame Commander (DBE).

US Naval Station 1937-1999 Construction of the naval station began in 1932 and completed in 1937. The station was named for Admiral Hugh Rodman who served as Marine Superintendent and Superintendent of Transportation of the Canal Zone in 1914. Naval Station Rodman played an important role during World War II in support of the Pacific War and during the Cold War. Built in 1943, the U.S. Naval Station Panama Canal (Rodman Naval Station) provided fuel, provisions and other support to military ships passing through the Panama Canal. Until its March 11, 1999 handover to Panama, Rodman was staffed by over 200 military and civilian personnel. The naval station included a port facility with three docks, 87 housing units, warehouses, industrial areas, an office building, and other facilities.http://www.ciponline.org/facts/rns.htm Rodman hosted the location of Commander-in-Chief Atlantic Fleet Detachment South (CINCLANTFLT Detachment South), for some time the naval component of the United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). CINCLANTFLT took the lead in SOUTHCOM naval exercises, such as UNITAS. With the closure of Rodman Naval Station, naval activities in the hemisphere are now coordinated from United States Fourth Fleet headquarters at Naval Station Mayport in Florida. Rodman also hosted the Naval Small Craft Instruction and Technical Training School (NAVSCIATTS), which offered Spanish-language training to Naval and Coast Guard personnel from throughout the region. Closure The base's role waned after the 1960s but was retained until 1999 as the US transferred control of the Canal Zone to Panama. It was renamed as the Vasco Nu√±ez de Balboa Naval Base. Redevelopment In March 2007, PSA announced plans to build a port in Panama; its first in the Americas, which would be sited at the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal. The port concession was approved by the National Assembly of Panama in April 2008. The port opened in December 2010; the first ship to use the port was Beluga Festival.

It is a Moderne-style concrete building erected during the 1930s. In 1991 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was planned to be one of a number of experimental dwellings along Farragut Parkway, and, ultimately, a larger-scale development in Florida; neither of which was ever built. It incorporated many innovations, including a patented method of precasting the concrete panels used in its walls and floors and the first gas-fired heating system in Westchester County. These led to it being featured in an exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair. The architect, developer and contractor were all local, none of them involved with any of the contemporary movements that led to the Moderne style. Charles Horn, the architect, never built another building in that style. Unoccupied, it fell into disrepair in later years and was threatened with demolition after it became an eyesore. It was preserved in the 1980s when a man who had grown up in the neighborhood bought it, researched its history and restored it. Buildings and grounds The house is located on the northwest corner of the intersection, approximately one-quarter mile (500 m) along Farragut from its intersection with the Saw Mill River Parkway. The surrounding neighborhood is exclusively residential, with some minimal commercial development a block to the north at the intersection of Farragut and Green Street. The houses to the west are in a variety of early 20th- century styles, on smaller lots. To the east are larger lots with more trees, most of them the rear yards of larger houses along Farragut Avenue. See also: The half-acre () lot slopes up slightly toward the west. In addition to the house, on the eastern end, a garage is built into the landscape to the north. It is considered a contributing resource to the National Register listing. A driveway curves around from High Street to it. =Exterior= The house itself is a cubical steel frame structure on a cinder block foundation faced in prefabricated concrete panels with stucco parging topped by a bowl-shaped roof centered on a drain. At the main entrance on the curved eastern corner, there is an entrance portico. Fenestration consists primarily of paired steel eight- pane casement windows on both stories at either side of the corners. There is one small four-pane window in the second story above the main entrance and an additional window on the north of it in the first story to provide additional light to the kitchen. Just north of it is a second entrance, meant to allow easier access to the garage. A plain wide belt course runs around the building above the second story windows. Above it is a parapet at the roofline. The front portico consists of a wooden hood with a denticulated cornice supported by four square wooden pillars topped with molded capitals. =Interior= The main entrance is a recessed paneled wooden door. It opens into a small foyer with closet. Three steps lead down from the south side to the living area, which occupies the bulk of the first-floor space and the greatest portion of the house's interior. The stairs to the second story begin on the opposite corner. Flooring consists of the same prefabricated concrete panels the walls are made of covered in asphalt tile; the walls are plaster and lath. A partition sets off the kitchen, in the northwest corner. Underneath the stairway is storage space and the original location of the heating and air conditioning controls. Upstairs, there have been extensive renovations since the house was built. The floors are covered in ceramic tile and the walls are gypsum. The original six-panel wooden doors have been replaced with hollow- core flush doors as well. Its layout follows the first floor, with most of the southern space given over to a large bedroom and a smaller bedroom above the kitchen. Corresponding to the foyer is a bathroom. There is no basement, just crawl space. =Garage and landscaping= The driveway ends at the garage just north of, and uphill from, the house. It is made of the same prefabricated concrete panels and has a flat roof, sloped to one side. Inside there is space for a single car. A storage bin is suspended over where the hood would be parked. A window has been cut on the south side, facing the house, from one of the concrete panels. It has glazed doors and side panels and is now used as a studio. Stone retaining walls on the west side of the driveway and parallel to the rear of the garage create a small courtyard between the house's kitchen door and the garage. This is part of the overall landscaping of the property. The west (rear) yard has a terraced feel to it with the stone wall and garage providing an abrupt break in elevation, and is sheltered and insulated from the neighborhood by several mature trees. A drop similar to that in the rear follows the natural slope of the terrain at the east (front), heavily worked and planted with an assortment of shrubs and small trees. To the south, facing High Street, more thick planting and mature trees further shelter the house and buffer it from its neighbors. History The house was the first of what its developers hoped would be many they could replicate in two states with an innovative construction method and material. However, it proved more difficult to build than expected, and would be the only one of its kind. After falling into neglect a few decades after it was built, it has been restored by an early admirer. =1929‚Äì1934: Suburbanization and opportunity= In the late 1920s Westchester County began the system of parkways that would make it possible for residents to commute by car to New York City. The first section of one, the Saw Mill, passed through the eastern section of the village of Hastings-on-Hudson. To complement the existing intersection between the parkway and Farragut Avenue, a new street, Farragut Parkway, was built to the southeast. Its completion in 1934 opened up the neighborhood around it, an area known as Uniontown, to subdivision and development. Residents of newer houses would find downtown Hastings and the parkway equally accessible, and Hastings began transitioning from a small river town built around the large sugar refinery then located along its waterfront into a commuter suburb. Investors were already speculating heavily on Uniontown property. One of them was Hamlin Andrus of the nearby city of Yonkers. The son of John Emory Andrus, a wealthy industrialist who had served as that city's mayor and representative in Congress earlier in the century, he invested his inherited share of the family fortune in various local opportunities, primarily but not exclusively in real estate. Instead of building in more common contemporary styles such as Tudor or Colonial Revival on the land he owned at Farragut Parkway and High Street, Andrus decided to experiment with modernist styles. While European architects like Albert Frey, Richard Neutra and William Lescaze had introduced the smooth-surfaced, unornamented Bauhaus-influenced forms of modernism to the U.S. in the preceding decade, their work had primarily been in Southern California or the downtowns of larger cities. Modernism had not received wide exposure to the American architectural community until a 1932 exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. Andrus's plan was to build a group of houses in the style on the Hastings property; and then, if they proved profitable, to build a larger development in Florida. He may have felt the use of prefabricated building materials and the sparseness of the style would make the houses more economical to build on the scale he planned, and thus more affordable in the Depression economy where traditional homes were too expensive for more than half the population. Concrete was not a common choice for houses in Westchester at the time, but it had history behind it. Six decades earlier, Highland Cottage, made entirely of precast concrete, had gone up in Ossining. Shortly afterward, the first reinforced concrete house in the country, Ward's Castle, had been built on the Connecticut state line in Rye Brook. Many of the European proponents of modernism had been emigrating to the U.S. in the face of rising totalitarianism in their home countries that was often animated by a hostility to the social movements that underlay their architectural movement. Instead of working with them, Andrus commissioned local architect Charles Horn to design the first house. With no relevant experience or prior work in the style, he managed to produce a house that had the hallmarks of the Moderne style, the American interpretation of modernist principles‚Äîthe use of synthetic industrial materials, smooth surface, curving corner, and extremely restrained decoration. Inside, the house gave over most of its efficiently- used space to living and sleeping, the primary activities of a house, in keeping with the movement's philosophy that buildings should be honest about themselves and reflect the way people were actually living after industrialization. =1934‚Äì1936: Construction= Andrus worked with another local businessman, Louis Gelbman of Yonkers, an innovator who held 16 patents, to develop the concrete panels and their manufacturing process, which were also patented. Concrete and cinder were poured into a mold of steel bars that resembled a waffle iron. When they dried, the inch-thick (2.5 cm) panels looked like exaggerated C's, with six-inch (18 cm) returns as the arms. They were light enough that two men could carry each one, yet solid enough that none had begun to deteriorate when the house was renovated half a century later. Gelbman's workers assembled them on the site by bolting the arms to a partial steel frame on the interior so the exterior would remain flush and smooth after being sealed with a mortar parge and surfaced with stucco. The arms left a space inside for insulation, usually vermiculite, another new material at the time, that would go behind the plywood panels used for the walls. To build floors, the panels were just laid horizontally on the summer beams, with the floor's surface material (asphalt on the first story, cork originally upstairs) then laid on top, and the space between the arms available for infrastructure piping. Once the exterior was done, the openings for the doors and windows were cut and then they were installed. The steel casement windows were also a relatively new building technology; however, their use and popularity was not limited to modernist buildings. Inside the building were more new products, such as fluorescent lighting and one of the first forced-air gas heating and cooling systems installed in Westchester. The heating was efficient enough that the fireplace hearth in the first floor living space could be reduced in size. Air conditioning was a very new feature for private homes at the time; it is possible that this reflected Andrus's hope to build similar homes in Florida. Construction was longer and more complicated than Andrus and Gelbman had expected. Surviving photographs from it suggest that it was not easy to assemble the panels, as workers were not used to it. Measures to protect the patent on the concrete panels also slowed it down. =1937‚Äìpresent: Decline and restoration= Despite all the house's innovative technologies being included in an exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair, other builders did not adopt prefabricated concrete construction, except for occasional ranch houses, not because of its newness as much as their familiarity with existing construction materials and methods. The house was controversial with its neighbors, as well. Many felt it clashed too strongly with their own more traditionally-styled houses, and were outspoken in their criticism. Some likened it to an appliance. Andrus may well have decided it was not worth it to build more either in Hastings or Florida, and found other investment opportunities. Horn never designed another modernist building. After its completion, it was sold and occupied at least through the middle of the century. Eventually it grew vacant, and began to show signs of neglect. The neighbors, including those who had never liked the house, called for its demolition as an eyesore. That was prevented in 1978, when Peter Muckenhaupt, a retired journalist and publicist who had watched the house being built as a boy when he lived nearby, bought the house. He began restoring it in earnest. It was necessary to remove the original walls. The broken window panes and HVAC systems had to be replaced, and the once- groundbreaking gas-fired system was now obsolete. \\"We wound up having to replace everything,\\" he recalled. \\"It had to be treated like a brand-new house.\\" The original cork flooring and plywood paneled walls on the second story were beyond repair and were replaced with the ceramic tile and gypsum walls now in place. After the work was done in the early 1980s, Muckenhaupt rented it out since his family was too large for him to move them in. He researched the history of the house, finding little material but enough to support its successful nomination to the National Register. Once that had been achieved, he planned to move into the house.

The town's early growth was slow, because the terrain was not very suitable for agriculture. After American independence, the town began to grow more substantially, buoyed by construction of the Middlesex Turnpike along what are now CT 154 and Walkley Hill Road. The town center grew as a stop on the turnpike, and also benefited from traffic along the Connecticut River, which formed its eastern boundary. The introduction of steamship and railroad traffic beginning around 1850 led to a decline in the town's fortunes. The district is basically linear in nature, extending about along CT 154 and Walkley Hill Road.

It is located in the hamlet of Les Allymes, in the Amb√©rieu-en-Bugey commune in the Ain department of France, in the Rh√¥ne-Alpes region. The castle was built by the Dauphin of Viennois to protect the people from attacks that were ravaging the country. It is approached by the hamlet of Brey-de-Vent, and is the only example of a medieval fortress in Bugey. On the 20th of July 1960 the Ch√¢teau des Allymes was classed a . Location The location of the castle gives it an exceptional view of the plain of Bresse and the Dombes. The castle overlooks the plain of Ain from a height of some 800 m, and is to the south-west of Mount Luisandre. It commands a view of the Amb√©rieu-en-Bugey commune, to which it has belonged since 1984. History The Ch√¢teau des Allymes The Ch√¢teau des Allymes became French by the Treaty of Lyon in 1601 when Henri IV succeeded in reuniting Bugey to the Kingdom of France. At the time it was in a strategic military position as it was near the border with Savoy, which was then an independent state. First conquered by the counts of Savoy, the castle passed to Ren√© de Lucinge, the Savoyard ambassador to the French king. Lucinge, a man of letters and historian, left records about his life and his work on the surrounding wall of the castle. The Ch√¢teau des Allymes The castle was built around 1310 to fight the Savoyard influence. It was initially built principally of earth and wood. A few years later, a truce between the two parties forbade the building of new structures. The truce was little respected, however, and each side hurried to build stone castles. The masters of this work in Allymes were the master-masons \\"Peronner\\" and \\"Guillemet d'Hi√®res\\". The Delphino-Savoyard war was finished in 1335 by the transfer of the Ch√¢teau des Allymes, commanded by the ch√¢telain \\"Guy de Lutin\\", to the count of Savoy. The king of France John the Good; his son Charles, dauphin of Viennois; and the count Amadeus VI of Savoy ratified the definitive peace treaty of the 5th of January 1335, signed in Paris. The frontier was thenceforward moved to the banks of the Rh√¥ne which relegated the Ch√¢teau des Allymes to the interior of the kingdom, losing it its strategic value. The count of Savoy, Amadeus VI split the seigneury of Saint-Germain and restored the stronghold to Fran√ßois Nicod in 1354, who thus became the owner of the castle. On the 16th of September 1477, Claudine Fran√ßois married d'Humbert de Lucinge, and the Lucinge family took possession of the fortress. When the castle again became French in 1601, Ren√© de Lucinge swore allegiance to the French king Henri IV. The castle passed successively to the Suduyraud, and Etienne families, and finally the Dujat family, the last proprietors before the Revolution. The castle fell into disrepair until a descendant of the Dujats, Adolphe de Tricaud d'Amb√©rieu, undertook its restoration in 1847. The curtain walls were rebuilt and re-equipped with a covered way, and the round tower was recovered. In 1959, the De Tricaud family sold the castle to Mr Peyre before its classification as a historical monument in 1960. In 1964, a first phase of work restored the keep and the Gothic quarters. The roof and frame of the round tower were restored in 1977, the four curtain walls in 1984 and finally the barbican at the main entrance in 1991. The castle has been the object of many excavation and restoration programs. The castle has been the property of the village of Amb√©rieu-en-Bugey since 1984, and is managed and maintained by an association of friends of the castle. Description The Ch√¢teau des Allymes is representative of the medieval stone castle‚Äîa large ancient stronghold, firmly built on the side of a hill and commanding the plain below. It also has two towers, connected by curtain walls. The exterior consists of a large wall long terminating in a lookout tower that once protected an adjoining town. The quadrangular enclosure of the castle is flanked by a large cylindrical donjon of the Roman type and by a round tower connected by four curtain walls. This section dates from 1351. The inside is also not without interest, including Gothic living quarters, the donjon, beautiful halls with well-preserved woodwork, and a restored barbican defending the entrance.

The scale was frequently used in tolerance education about anti-discriminatory attitudes regarding sexual orientation. It is named after its creator, psychologist Dorothy Riddle. Overview The Riddle homophobia scale was developed by Dorothy Riddle in 1973‚Äì74 while she was overseeing research for the American Psychological Association Task Force on Gays and Lesbians.Staten Island LGBT history Staten Island LGBT Community Center, Accessed Dec. 19, 2010. The scale was distributed at talks and workshops but was not formally published for a long time; it is cited in the literature either as an (unpublished) conference presentation from 1985Riddle, D. I. (1985). Homophobia scale. Opening doors to understanding and acceptance: A facilitator‚Äôs guide for presenting workshops on lesbian and gay issues, Workshop organized by Kathy Obear and Amy Reynolds, Boston. Unpublished essay. or as an article from 1994.Riddle, D., (1994). The Riddle scale. Alone no more: Developing a school support system for gay, lesbian and bisexual youth. St Paul: Minnesota State Department. At the time it was developed, Riddle's analysis was one of the first modern classifications of attitudes towards homosexuality. In that respect, the scale has served the purpose that Riddle originally had in mind: she devised the scale to explicate the continuum of attitudes toward gays and lesbians and to assess the current and desired institutional culture of an organization or a work place.Peterkin, A. Risdon, C., (2003). Caring for lesbian and gay people: A clinical guide. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, Inc. Level of measurement The Riddle scale is an eight-term uni-dimensional Likert-type interval scale with nominal labels and no explicit zero point. Each term is associated with a set of attributes and beliefs; individuals are assigned a position on the scale based on the attributes they exhibit and beliefs they hold. The scale is frequently divided into two parts, the 'homophobic levels of attitude' (first four terms) and the 'positive levels of attitude' (last four terms).Clauss-Ehlers, C. S. (ed), (2010). Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology. New York: Springer. The scale *Repulsion: Homosexuality is seen as a crime against nature. Gays/lesbians are considered sick, crazy, immoral, sinful, wicked, etc. Anything is justified to change them: incarceration, hospitalization, behavior therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, etc. *Pity: Represents heterosexual chauvinism. Heterosexuality is considered more mature and certainly to be preferred. It is believed that any possibility of becoming straight should be reinforced, and those who seem to be born that way should be pitied as less fortunate (\\"the poor dears\\"). *Tolerance: Homosexuality is viewed as a phase of adolescent development that many people go through and most people grow out of. Thus, lesbians/gays are less mature than straights and should be treated with the protectiveness and indulgence one uses with children who are still maturing. It is believed that lesbians/gays should not be given positions of authority because they are still working through their adolescent behavior. *Acceptance: Still implies that there is something to accept; the existing climate of discrimination is ignored. Characterized by such statements as \\"You're not lesbian to me, you're a person!\\" or \\"What you do in bed is your own business.\\" or \\"That's fine with me as long as you don't flaunt it!\\" *Support: People at this level may be uncomfortable themselves, but they are aware of the homophobic climate and the irrational unfairness, and work to safeguard the rights of lesbians and gays. *Admiration: It is acknowledged that being lesbian/gay in our society takes strength. People at this level are willing to truly examine their homophobic attitudes, values, and behaviors. *Appreciation: The diversity of people is considered valuable and lesbians/gays are seen as a valid part of that diversity. People on this level are willing to combat homophobia in themselves and others. *Nurturance: Assumes that gay/lesbian people are indispensable in our society. People on this level view lesbians/gays with genuine affection and delight, and are willing to be their allies and advocates. Discussion Riddle's analysis has been credited for pointing out that although 'tolerance' and 'acceptance' can be seen as positive attitudes, they should actually be treated as negative because they can mask underlying fear or hatred (somebody can tolerate a baby crying on an airplane while at the same time wishing that it would stop) or indicate that there is indeed something that we need to accept, and that we are the ones with the power to reject or to accept.Blumenfeld W.

Does discipline background impact on teachers‚Äô ability to affirm and include gender and sexual diversity in secondary school health education programs? AARE Conference, Melbourne 2004 This observation generalizes to attitude evaluations in other areas besides sexual orientation and is one of the strengths of Riddle's study. Although it deals mostly with adult attitudes towards difference, the model has been positioned in the cognitive developmental tradition of Piaget and Kohlberg's stages of moral development.Hirscheld, S., (2001). Moving beyond the safety zone: A staff development approach to anti-heterosexist education. Fordham Urban Law Journal, 29, 611‚Äì641.

It has been in ruins since 1939, when it was destroyed when Cartagena was shelled in the Spanish Civil War by Nationalist forces.  History  Cartagena had a see before the Muslim conquest of Spain, but no trace of the pre-conquest cathedral has been found yet. In 1243 Alfonso X of Castile launched a campaign to reconquer the Kingdom of Murcia, and petitioned Pope Innocent IV to restore the Diocese of Cartagena. In 1250 the Pope issued the bull \\"Spiritus exultante\\" restoring the diocese. The first bishop of the new phase of the Diocese was the Franciscan friar Pedro Gallego, Alfonso's confessor. There is inconclusive evidence whether there was a cathedral in Cartagena at that time. In medieval and Renaissance documents the church is described as \\"Iglesia Mayor\\", and is only called \\"Old Cathedral\\" from the eighteenth century. Garc√≠a Mart√≠nez, the second bishop of the diocese, decided with the consent of King Sancho IV to transfer the see to Murcia, although retaining the name of Diocese of Cartagena. The church therefore lost its status of a cathedral, and became a parish church. Throughout the centuries, there were continuing demands to the Vatican for the restitution of the bishopric to Cartagena. The church of Santa Mar√≠a de Gracia, with the shape and dimensions of a cathedral, was built in the 18th century on a different site, with the aim of becoming the seat of the diocese in place of the original church. In the late nineteenth century the foundations of the medieval church collapsed. The church was restored by the architect Victor Beltr√≠, in Romanesque style with modernist elements. During the Spanish Civil War the church was attacked and the contents damaged on 25 July 1936. In 1939 it was bombed and has remained abandoned since then.  Roman theatre  In 1988 a Roman theatre was discovered during building works near the old cathedral.

These films focus on the characters of Ryu Terui (Minehiro Kinomoto) as Kamen Rider Accel and Katsumi Daido (Mitsuru Matsuoka of SOPHIA) as Kamen Rider Eternal. The series' main protagonists Shotaro Hidari (Renn Kiriyama), Philip (Masaki Suda), and Akiko Narumi (Hikaru Yamamoto) also are featured in each film. Koichi Sakamoto directs both films, with Keiichi Hasegawa writing the Accel portion and Riku Sanjo writing the Eternal portion. Kamen Rider Accel was dedicated to the memory of Minoru Tanaka, who portrayed Hiroshi Sagami within the film. Kamen Rider Accel , released on April 21, 2011 (with rentals out on April 8), is a story set after the events of Kamen Rider √ó Kamen Rider OOO & W Featuring Skull: Movie War Core.Uchusen, Vol. 131Hyper Hobby, March 2011 While settling into married life with Akiko, Ryu Terui is brought onto a case with Captain Hiroshi Sagami and Inspector Yukihiro Ohno involving a woman named Aoi Katsuragi, a member of a pickpocketing ring with most of her teammates murdered. Though she escapes from the police, Ryu captures her before they are ambushed by Kamen Soldiers with Jinno covering their escape. However, Ryu and Aoi are confronted by the Commander Dopant, who is a police officer who murdered Aoi's father. Placing a bomb on Aoi and shooting Jinno with Ryu's gun, the Commander Dopant forces Ryu to help the girl obtain an item she stole some time ago. By then, while with Shotaro and Philip at the Shirogane restaurant as she frets about her relationship to Ryu, Akiko freaks out upon hearing the news of her husband on the run for attempted murder and under the idea that he is having an affair. Tracking down the last surviving pickpocket, Masaru, Ryu and Aoi learn the item in now held by the pickpocketing ring's leader. Arriving at the den of thieves, while defending Aoi's honor, Ryu takes down the boss's thugs before the item is revealed as the Gaia Memory Enhancing Adapter as Ryu stops the crime boss from using it on his Unicorn Memory. With forty-eight minutes left, telling her that she can change if she has a pillar of support to call her own, Ryu and Aoi arrive to the meeting place. However, Ohno arrives and attempts to arrest Ryu before Sagami arrives and spirits Aoi off as she tells Ryu that he's the Commander Dopant and not Ohno as he suspected. With Akiko muscling her way in for the ride, arguing with her husband along the way, Ryu uses a bus to catch up to the Commander Dopant before Akiko causes a car crash and runs out on Ryu. Ryu confronts Commander Dopant, only to learn that Sagami is in the same mind-set he was when driven by revenge on Isaka. As the Commander Dopant offers Ryu to work for him, thanks to Lily covering their escape from Ohno's men, Shotaro and Philip arrive and become Kamen Rider Double to hold off the Kamen Soldiers while Ryu becomes Kamen Rider Accel. Chasing after the Commander Dopant, Accel uses the Trial Memory to destroy the Dopant's command gauntlet and disarm the bomb on Aoi. However, the Commander Dopant uses the Gaia Memory Enhancing Adapter to enhance his power and overwhelm Accel Trial, canceling his transformation. Deciding to remind Ryu of the pain he felt when he lost his family, the Commander Dopant goes after Akiko. Leaving Aoi to save Akiko and confront the psychopath, Ryu refuses to follow Sagami's path while saying it was Akiko who taught him to break free from the cycle of hate. Assuming his Upgraded Commander Dopant form, Sagami sends Akiko falling to her death with Accel unable to reach her. However Aoi is able to sneak up behind him unaware and snatches the Gaia Memory Enhancing Adapter from the Upgraded Commander Dopant, throwing it to Accel. The Gaia Memory Enhancing Adapter allows him to transform into Kamen Rider Accel Booster and save Akiko before defeating the Commander Dopant. As Aoi turns herself in, with Ohno wanting to help her start a new life for herself, Ryu and Akiko begin their relationship anew. Kamen Rider Eternal , released on July 21, 2011 (with rentals out on July 8), is primarily a flashback story set after the events of Kamen Rider W Forever: A to Z/The Gaia Memories of Fate.Tokusatsu Newtype, April 2011Uchusen, vol. 132 This film had featured several actors who had previously worked for Super Sentai. After taking out a Sweets Dopant, Kamen Rider Double encounters a strange woman who tries to kill the two-as-one Kamen Rider with her psychic powers to avenge Katsumi Daido, the man who almost destroyed Futo. Assuming LunaMetal to restrain her, Shotaro and Philip demand answers on why she would avenge the death of a terrorist. However, upon revealing a harmonica that was his, the psychic reveals that Daido was actually a hero before his attack on the city. She then proceeds to tell the story of Katsumi Daido. The scene flashes back to Daido's death and conversion by his mother Maria Daido into the first undead Necro-Over, or NEVER. However, after passing every inhumane experimentation, Daido learns that NEVER Project was rejected by Foundation X in favor of the Museum's Gaia Memories, due to the Memories' ease of production and diversity in abilities. He responds to the Foundation's messengers by telling them that NEVER has only just begun. Sometime later, Daido and his fellow NEVER mercenaries - expert marksman Ken Ashihara, former Yakuza subordinate Kyosui Izumi and strongman Gozo Domoto - revive Reika Hanehara, a serial criminal who was gunned down escaping from prison, as the newest member of NEVER. Daido leads his group of six to a Southeast Asian country only known as \\"S\\" to take out the leader of a terrorist cell located there. However, NEVER finds the terrorist leader murdered by the psychic as she overwhelms the undead supersoldiers with her powers. Daido takes the psychic down after the use of her powers wears her down, but spares her life as he realized she was forced to fight. She introduces herself as Mina before a pair of psychic soldiers, Lloyd and Shion, revealing them and Mina to be Quarks: The product of research by Doctor Prospect, a Foundation X scientist. Taking Mina with them, Daido and Reika are confronted by Foundation X's Jun Kazu, who assumes the form of Kamen Rider Eternal Red Flare. When Daido touches the Lost Driver out of an inexplicable attraction to the Gaia Memory, Kazu is forced to eject the incompatible Eternal Memory and uses his psychic power on Daido and Reika before Mina turns herself as Kazu decides to bring the two Necro-Overs with them for Prospect to study. Coming to, Daido finds himself among Quarks who intend to kill him to prove their worth. After seeing the Quarks are forced into doing what Prospect orders them to do, Daido fights them off before Mina stops them as she sees Daido to have something Prospect lacks. By then, Prospect arrives and reveals his Eyes Memory allows him to use Quarks, under his control. When Daido asks if his ability can be negated should he die, becomes the Eyes Dopant to eliminate Daido as his body begins to fail him. However, after breaking free from her confinement in the complex, Reika arrives to spirit Daido away. Mina finds Daido's harmonica and tracks Daido down to return it, but accidentally accesses his memories when he states his intent to kill Prospect. She reveals that the Heaven's Fall barrier around the Quarks' camp would eventually eliminate those with barely psychic ability and less. Taking Reika's emergency bio-stabilizer at her request, Daido revitalizes himself as he and Reika free the Quarks despite their refusal to listen. After using his harmonica to calm them down, Daido gives the Quarks the drive to rebel before giving Mina the harmonica and going off towards the complex. As Reika and the Quarks fight off the Foundation X Quarks, Daido makes his way to Prospect's manor where he is confronted by Kazu as he reveals Museum's location in Futo before becoming the Utopia Dopant, stating that the Eternal Memory is malfunctioning. Though no match for the Utopia Dopant, Daido manages to get the Eternal Memory and his perfect synchronization with it allows him to transform into Kamen Rider Eternal Blue Flare. With his new- found power, Eternal kills Kazu and destroys Prospect's controls of Heaven's Fall. As the rest of NEVER arrives to take out his soldiers and get the Quarks out, the Eyes Dopant attacks Eternal before revealing that all he did was ensure they die a painful death. Despite making his way to them, Daido arrives too late to save the Quarks as Prospect reveals his power over the Quarks is to kill them should they leave the complex. Mina is the only one left standing until she collapses in Daido's arms. The Eyes Dopant's intent to break Daido only drives him utterly insane as he thanks Prospect for reminding him that all people are devils before he transforms into Kamen Rider Eternal to fight the Eyes Dopant with the support from his group before he finishes the job with the Eternal Requiem Maximum Drive. As Prospect dies from his own Gaia Memory effect, Daido realizes that the Eternal Memory finally broke down, ejecting and commenting that he \\"shall see it again\\" before discarding it. Refusing to revive Mina as a Necro-Over at Reika's request, the maddened Daido decides to stick it to the Museum by going to Futo. However, as Kazu is taken by his fellow Foundation X members to be converted into a Necro-Over, it is revealed that Mina survived the Eyes Dopant's attack. With her story finished, Shotaro and Philip try to comfort Mina as she knew he was evil yet wanted the two to know what Daido was really like. As she is taken to the hospital, Shotaro and Philip arrive to the site of their fight with Kamen Rider Eternal to pay their final respects to Daido, stating that although he wronged the city, he was at least once a hero.

The building was completed in 1765. The castle was enlisted as a French Monument Historique on 22 September 1948. On 30 April 1999 its gardens were included in the listing.  History  The castle's origins can be traced back to 1217. The chapel forming part of the current castle is of that date. The first of the current buildings were the work of Philibert Verch√®re senior between 1711 and 1720, consisting of two wings. The main house was completed by his grandson, Philibert junior, a servant to the Parlement de Bourgogne. It was built to a design by the architect Thomas Dumorey between 1761 and 1765, and was the first ch√¢teau in Burgundy to be built in the neoclassical style. The castle remained in the same family until 1870, when the last of the line, Guillaume Verch√®re, died childless. He bequeathed the castle to his nephew, Ernest de Carrelet de Loisy. Today, the castle remains in the family of Carrelet de Loisy d'Arcelot.  Architecture  The new building is wedged between two older buildings of 1711 (the former hunting house and chapel); the original plan was to demolish them, but in the end they were retained. The ch√¢teau's Great Hall (1765) has an unusual coloured stucco style, and is listed with one star in the Michelin Guide, as is its park.  Park and gardens  At the rear of the castle is a park, with a lake, laid out by the landscape gardener Jean-Marie Morel around 1805 (with a folly: a Chinese pavilion). It is one of the few of his designs still in existence.

Ch√¢teau d'Artigny or Ch√¢teau Le Puy d'Artigny is a French castle located in the commune of Montbazon, in the department of Indre-et- Loire in the Centre-Val de Loire region of France. The current structure was built between 1912 and 1928 to serve as residence to perfumer Fran√ßois Coty. Since the late 1950s, the castle has been converted into a hotel.  The first castles  Having originally been constructed as a fortress around the keep of Montbazon, an advanced bastion, during the Hundred Years' War, the Ch√¢teau d'Artigny was incorporated into the line of defences established along the Indre River. Jean d‚ÄôArtannes captain governor of Montbazon, after whom a nearby village is named, owned it in the fifteen century. The name d‚ÄôArtannes became over the centuries d‚ÄôArtigny. It was subsequently altered in the Renaissance style during the 18th century. In the following century it passed in the hands of Joseph Testard de Bouranis, the king's treasurer, who replaced it with a new construction which survived the Revolution and was later modified into a Neo Renaissance style in the 19th Century.  Fran√ßois Coty  On 30 July 1912 perfumer Fran√ßois Coty, bought the ch√¢teau. Fran√ßois Coty (Circa 1930). On a journey around Touraine he was captivated by the location but, feeling the building to be unbalanced and badly placed on the cliff overlooking the Indre, he had the ch√¢teau pulled down and rebuilt 12 metres further away on new foundations. Measuring 60 metres by 18 metres and 27 tall. On the outside, it was almost a mirror image of the ch√¢teau at √âpinay- Champl√¢treux which was constructed by the architect Jean-Michel Chevotet between 1751 and 1757. The interior plan of the ch√¢teau, however, was inspired by the Ch√¢teau de Voisins, near Rambouillet, where a long gallery gives on to a series of huge rooms all linked to each other. There was a grand reception room, a library, a small salon, a dining room and the main stairwell. A chapel, a copy of the one at the Palace of Versailles, albeit a quarter of the size, was connected to the main building by an underground passage. The main construction work was completed between 1913 and 1928, and the fittings and interior decoration followed. Apart from his perfumes, Coty‚Äôs finest creation was the Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôArtigny. Coty, employed architects, Emmanuel Pontremoli, was just one of the architects who along with many draftsmen, was subjected to Coty‚Äôs active participation in every aspects of the plans and execution. Over one hundred workers labored for twelve years, and still the ch√¢teau was not finished. Master builders, sculptors, carvers, tile setters, painters, craftsmen and labourers. Denys Puech, the official sculptor (a receiver of the Prix de Rome) constructed an 18th-century style allegory on the tympanum of the pediment of the central front section overlooking the Indre valley. Nothing was too fine or too luxurious: the polished stone stairway from Lens, the dining room with its marble floor from Carrare, inlaid with a variety of bronze motifs, the Regency woodwork and the carved columns gilded with gold leaf. From 1929 up until Coty's death in 1934 at his residence at Louveciennes, he lived for half of the year at Artigny with his family. During this time, About 40 employees and bodyguards were employed on the estate, which encompassed seven kilometres of river, French gardens, orchard greenhouses, several farms, three mills, a hunting lodge, a rectory and some abandoned school buildings. The most important room, the most original and most beautiful room of the ch√¢teau is the rotunda on the first floor. This reception room with its high windows overlooking the Indre valley and opening on to Fran√ßois Coty's study is crowned at a height of 9.2 metres by a cupola decorated with a trompe l'oeil by Charles Hoffbauer, a receiver of the Grand Prix de Rome 1924, and depicted a costume ball with friends and family; among them Coty's son-in-law, Paul Dubonnet, actresses Mary Marquet, Edwige Feuill√®re and C√©cile Sorel, the ballet masters Serge Lifar and Serge Diaghilev, the painter Foujita, and the Aga Khan.  After Coty  Following the Crash of 1929, and due to a costly lifestyle, a disastrous divorce, and the expense of his press empire, Coty's fortune in liquid assets was much diminished. After his death, the ch√¢teau is temporarily escrowed as security for his creditors and his art collections were sold at auction in 124 lots at the Galerie Charpentier in Paris on 30 November and 1 December 1936. In 1940, at the time when the French capital was relocated to Tours, the ch√¢teau had been identified as a potential shelter by a local aide-de-camp of Admiral Darlan and was subsequently occupied by the Department of the Navy. In 1941 it lay empty for a few months before being occupied by German troops until 1942, who in the meantime had painted the ch√¢teau brown to act as camouflage. Finally, it served as an annexe of Tours hospital, catering for the seriously wounded. Coty's family once again took possession of the ch√¢teau in 1947 and were made several offers. The projects to convert it into the head office of Indre-et-Loire‚Äôs general council or into a holiday park were not followed. After two years, in the course of which the library was converted into a lounge bar offering a unique collection of cognac, armagnac, port and whisky, it was opened at the end of 1961, under the name of the \\"Relais d'Artigny\\", becoming the first hotel company in Centre-Val de Loire. The wine cellar holds around 45,000 bottles of French wine, the finest collection in the world of Touraine wines. Since opening, Artigny has welcomed a number of personalities such as the Queen Mother and in 1963 Haile Selassie I, the last emperor of Ethiopia. On 24‚Äì25 November 1973, under the guise of the establishment's annual closing, the finance ministers of the G5 countries met in the ch√¢teau for the International Monetary Conference, with Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing presiding for France. In April 1976, an inconspicuous meeting took place between the French President and his future successor, Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Artigny still belongs to the family hotel group, ‚ÄúGrandes √âtapes Fran√ßaises‚Äù, whose president is Pierre Traversac. The ch√¢teau-hotel has 65 bedrooms, two dining rooms and a spa.

Etymology The name of the castle is derived from Slavic zem (soil or earth). Zemnen in the meaning zemn√Ω hrad (literally \\"the earth castle\\", earthwork) was still recorded in the early 14th century. The original Slavic form has been preserved in the local Slovak and Ruthenian dialects as Zemno, Zemn√© resp. ≈Ωemno, ≈Ωem≈àe along with the official name until the 19th, rarely until the 20th century. The official Slovak name Zempl√≠n has been influenced by the Hungarian language and medieval transcription into Latin. History The location was first occupied by farmers of the B√ºkk culture (5000 BC). After settlements of the Baden culture, the Ny√≠rs√©g-Zat√≠n culture and the G√°va culture, Zempl√≠n become the local center of mixed Celtic-Dacian population in the Medzibodro≈æie region with the largest boom in the 1st century BC. A small hill fort stood at the place of the later castle. In the 1st century CE, the hill fort lost its function until the arrival of the Slavs. Probably in the last third of the 9th century, the Slavs built the hill fort at the same place. The Slavs reused older walls, extended them and strengthened with a wooden construction. The Great Moravian hill fort was surrounded by additional settlements. The presence of the Hungarians is documented already in the turnover of the 9th and 10th century. The grave of a Hungarian chieftain in the oak coffin, dressed in luxury clothing with exclusive gifts and weapons was attributed to √Ålmos by Hungarian archeologist N√°ndor Fettich. The Slavic hill fort is mentioned in Gesta Hungarorum, describing how legendary chieftain of the Hung (Uzhhorod) castle fled \\"ad castrum Zemlun\\". The continuity of the population has been preserved also after the fall of Great Moravia and the Slavic settlement of the hill fort is documented between the 9th and the 12th century. Neighbouring Slavic settlements were preserved as well and later become a market village and then a small medieval town Zempl√≠n. The castle was incorporated into the early administrative structure of the Kingdom of Hungary. Between the 11th and the 13th century, the hill fort (the castle) was owned by Hungarian kings and later by several noble families. As an important strategic point, it became the center of the comitatus and the seat of isp√°n. A romanesque church dedicated to St. George was built probably between the 2nd half of the 11th and the 1st half of the 12th century. In the 13th century, the hill fort was rebuilt to the feudal seat. Around the same time, it was made the administrative center for the Church in the region. The original Slavic inhabitants were slowly assimilated and in the 13th century the population became mostly Hungarian. By the early 14th century the castle was owned by the Drugeth family, followed 250 years later by the Per√©nyi family. During the anti-Habsburg revolts of later centuries the castle was burned and today nothing remains. Nowadays, the area is a part of the village and is occupied by two churches (Greek-Catholic built 1804 and Evangelical rebuilt in 1628) and the modern cemetery.

It represents the historic core of the village of Hadlyme, which straddles the town line, and consists primarily of two north- south roads, Town Street (Route 82 and Old Town Street). The village arose around a church society founded in 1743, and grew with the development of small industries along area waterways. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The name Hadlyme was formed of a combination of the names of the two townships in which it is located: Haddam and Lyme. East Haddam was incorporated as a separate town from Haddam in 1734. There were three churches established in East Haddam in the following years, including the Hadlyme Ecclesiastical Society, which was founded in 1742. That congregation met in buildings in the village center until 1890, and was one of its main civic focuses. Industry in the village center was limited, because Hungerford Brook, which runs between Town Street and Old Town Street, did not provide very much power. Traces of a tannery remain, as does a mill pond associated with an otherwise undocumented endeavour. and The historic district includes 39 contributing buildings and 12 non-contributing buildings. There are 16 houses, in styles ranging from Georgian (built c. 1750) to the early 20th century Colonial Revival; while most are well preserved, they are not of great architectural significance. Three churches stand in the district, of which only the Hadlyme Congregational Church building (an 1840 Greek Revival edifice) is still in active use. The village cemetery, founded in 1750, is just north of the church. The larger Hadlyme area is bordered to the west by the Connecticut River where a ferry to Chester still runs (Route 148). The ferry and dock were where shipments along the river would be received, primarily by not exclusively for Gillette Castle (Formerly Seventh Sister) during the late 1800s. The intersection of Route 82 and Route 148 is known as Hadlyme \\"Four Corners\\".

Swedish-Brandenburg forces were coming to provide relief to the besieged town of Kalisz, invested by Polish army under voivode of Malbork Jakub Wejher, brother of Ludwik Weyher. A small Polish force (between 200 and 500 men) surprised a weakly guarded Swedish-Brandenburg cavalry camp at Lubrze in Greater Poland, near ≈örem and ≈öroda Wielkopolska, and 47 km south-east of the voivodeship capital of Pozna≈Ñ. According to Pierre des Noyers, who was a secretary to Her Majesty Polish Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, in his letter dated September 17, 1656, Andrzej Karol Grudzi≈Ñski, commanding a host of 300 noblemen, was told by the local peasants about small Swedish command of 200 men in the village of Lubrze. He decided to attack them at night, in a surprise nocturnal action. First Poles annihilated the 60 horses strong night guard and then attacked the remainder of the enemy's command, the swiftness and confusion of the night attack disallowed Swedes and Brandenburgers to mount their horses. Throughout the night fighting Polish soldiers decimated the Swedish-Brandenburg division (source vary from 800 to 2000 strong),both in the village and on the banks of a small stream where defenders took flight, killing between 500 and 800 officers and men (entire command of 800 officers and men according to des Noyers), taking many prisoners including a Prussian colonel and his trumpeter, while the Swedish commander, Jan Wejhard von Wrzesowicz, was killed by the peasants while in flight from the battlefield. Since he was particularly hated by the local populace his body was left unburied for many days. According to Wawrzyniec Jan Rudawski, Polish period chronicler, the battle took place on the night of August 28, 1656. Rudawski states that the Swedes suffered following losses in officers: Majors Peter, Jan Otto de Walh, Hejder from the Saxon regiment. Majors Moritz, Frydryk Gros (or Gross), Teyeh from the General Walch's regiment, Rotameister Weinland of the Nachtigall regiment; important Swedish administrative Pozna≈Ñ official Kasper Fruchtland. Rudawski gives the following officer losses suffered by the Elector of Brandenburg/Prussia army: Major of Pfuhl's regiment Andreas Pauli, Rotameister of general Dorfling's regiment Peter Saks, Rotameister of count de Wilgenstein's regiment Baron Schwende, Rotameister Bretlar, Colonel acting as general major de Kanneberg, Commissar Godfryd Weiter. This Polish victory caused serious disruption for the Swedish hold on Central Poland. It forced the nominal possessor of Greater Poland, the Prussian-Brandenburg Elector, to reroute a sizable Prussian division under Derflinger, also marching towards Kalisz, to withdraw north to Toru≈Ñ, after leaving commands at Pozna≈Ñ and Miedzyrzecz. Devoid of any hope of the relief forces the besieged Swedish garrison of Kalisz surrendered to the Polish army on November 8, 1656.

It is a wooden building whose oldest part dates to the 1720s, with latter additions during the 19th century. In 1980 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the oldest houses in Westchester County, and one of only two remaining tenant houses from the Philipsburg Manor. It also has a rich Revolutionary War history. Col. James Hammond, son of the original owner, commanded the Patriot Westchester Militia. Some historical evidence supports a legend that George Washington visited the house for a brief conference with Hammond in 1780, leaving just before the house was surrounded by Loyalists. During the war the Hammond family bought the land; they held on to it until the 1920s, when New York City acquired the property to protect its watershed. It was planning to demolish the structure, when the county historical society bought the deteriorating house and restored it for use as a historic house museum. It remained open in that capacity for another half-century. When the society shifted its focus to primarily serving as an archive, it sold it to New York Medical College, which used as a medical research laboratory for a decade. It was again saved from potential demolition by two brothers who bought it in the 1990s. They have been restoring it. Building The house occupies a lot on the east corner of a short, unnamed dead-end street that runs off Grasslands from the north roughly midway between Saw Mill River Road (New York State Route 9A) and the Sprain Brook Parkway in the Eastview section of the town of Mount Pleasant.The National Park Service, the agency charged with keeping the National Register, used \\"Hawthorne vicinity\\" when it announced the property's listing in 1980 (). Why it chose to do so, when the NRHP application had explicitly used Eastview, is not known. Had the agency based its description of the house's location on its mailing address, as it has for several other properties in the county where postal ZIP Codes and municipalities do not have exactly coterminous boundaries, the house would be described as being in the vicinity of Valhalla to the east, whose 10595 ZIP Code it lies within, like the John Hartford House, a National Historic Landmark on the campus of nearby Westchester Community College, which was listed as being in Valhalla (). The house's current owner also gives its address as Valhalla. Consensus among editors was for this article to use the more historically accurate Eastview as the property's location rather than the NPS's continued use of Hawthorne. The terrain is gently rolling, with the land across the road sloping to the south towards Mine Brook, a tributary of the Saw Mill River to the west. While the area is open and clear, there are no other residences nearby, with most development taking the form of large building complexes. New York Medical College and Westchester Medical Center are to the north, across open space where new construction has gone up recent years. Across the road to the south is a large wooded area, with office parks beyond. Big-box retailers and associated strip malls are located along Saw Mill. A line of trees along the road and a wooden fence on the other bounds set off the lot, with the street serving as a driveway. The house itself is in three sections. The main block is a five-bay one-and-a-half-story structure with a shingled gabled roof pierced by a single brick chimney in the center. It is sided in clapboard. Running the full length of the south (front) facade is a porch. The overhanging roof eave is supported by six square wooden pillars. The main entrance, a paneled and glazed wooden door, is located the center. It has wrought iron hardware and a glazed transom above. All the windows on the first story front and sides are 12-over-8 double-hung sash flanked by wooden shutters; those on the west facade are original to the house. The attic windows are six-over-six double-hung sash without shutters. On the north side, where fenestration is less regular, two shed-roofed dormer windows pierce the roof on the west side. The two-bay west wing was built separately elsewhere, moved and later attached to the main block. Its roof is similarly gabled, but in a saltbox style, lower in the north than the south. Like the main block, the roof and sides are clapboard and shingled respectively. However, a large section of the west wall is bricked in where the fireplace was, and the chimney is at the end, reflecting that alteration as well. A small shed-roofed porch supported by a single square wooden pillar shelters the house's secondary entrance, protected also by a modern screen door. The other front bay has a 12-over-8 double-hung sash window like those on the main block. On the west elevation is one six-over-six double-hung sash north of the bricking, and two six-light casement windows at the attic level, which does not rise as high as the main block. The east wing is a two-story, two-bay addition. It has the same exterior treatment and gabled roof as the main block and west wing. The roof's slope is slightly gentler than the main block, and like the west wing its chimney is on the end. The first-story windows are six-over-six; the upper story has the same six-light casement seen on the west wing. Inside, the main front entrance opens into a small front hall. On the west is the original parlor, with its original fireplace; opposite is the original kitchen. A large bedroom, with a fireplace, and several smaller rooms adjoin the kitchen. From the parlor is the western addition, now the kitchen wing, with two antechambers on its kitchen. It, too, has a fireplace. The rooms all have their original wideboard flooring. All rooms have plaster walls, except for two in the parlor, which are wood. Some of the original wooden doors remain as well. A main staircase in the rear and a secondary one in the kitchen lead up to the unfinished attics. There is no basement. History After two relatively stable centuries, the house's more recent history has seen more periods of uncertainty. =1719‚Äì1860: Construction and expansion= Bermuda-born William Hammond came to the colonial Province of New York in the early years of the 18th century. He eventually earned enough to lease of farmland on the Philipsburg Manor, the colonial land grant that took up what is today most of eastern Westchester County. He began building a house there in 1719, now the main block of the existing building, and finished it the following year. The house is architecturally noteworthy for several reasons. First, its full-length front porch under the overhanging roof is similar to that on the Elijah Miller House, also listed on the National Register, in nearby North White Plains, built a few years later. Second, Hammond built the house without a basement and with its structural beams dovetailing with each other, so that the house could easily be dismantled, moved and reassembled in another location if he lost his lease (it has been described as an early version of a mobile home). Third, of the approximately 200 homes known to have been built by tenant farmers on the manor, it is one of only two that have survived. Hammond would never need to move. He became a fixture of the community, serving as captain of the local militia from 1755 on. He also became an elder of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, the oldest church in New York and today a National Historic Landmark. Upon William's death in 1762, his eldest son, James, inherited the house and leasehold. James Hammond followed his father into the local militia, serving as its captain as well when it fought on the Patriot side during the Revolutionary War shortly after he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In August 1776, he was promoted to full colonel shortly before leading his troops into the Battle of White Plains. Some recently discovered evidence supports a long-retold legend that, minutes after George Washington left a brief meeting with Hammond at the house in 1780, it was surrounded by opposing Loyalists. Seeking to capture Washington, they instead settled for Hammond, and he was held prisoner on a ship on the Hudson River for a year and a half, then released at the end of the war. With the end of the war and the beginning of American independence came the end of the manor system. Hammond was able to buy not only the land the house stood on but the surrounding , where he continued growing wheat and flax. He further followed his father's footsteps to the leadership of the Old Dutch Church in Sleepy Hollow, where he was elected a trustee in 1786. James Hammond died in 1810. His family inherited the house; it stayed in their ownership for several generations over the course of the 19th century. Several of his descendants distinguished themselves in the military as well. Twice during their ownership, the house was expanded. In 1835 a small detached cottage on the property was moved and attached to the house, becoming the west wing. A quarter-century later, in 1860, the east wing was built. =1861‚Äìpresent: Ownership changes and preservation= The Hammonds eventually departed, and the house was left unoccupied. By the early 20th century it came into the ownership of the New York City Bureau of Water Supply. It was the only improvement on a parcel surrounding the important junction of the Catskill and Delaware aqueducts. To better protect the city's water supply, the bureau planned to demolish the neglected and deteriorated structure. In 1926, however, the Westchester County Historical Society persuaded the city to sell them just the house for $50 ($ in modern dollars). As part of the transaction, the city retained the right to demolish the structure and the society retained the right to move it, as well as use the acre around the house for its purposes. The society restored the house and reopened it three years later, operating it as a historic house museum, with a \\"hodge-podge\\" of displays that inaccurately represented early 19th century farm life as being authentic to the period of the house's construction. During the next half-century, the house would become known around the county for its museum use. The society did some minor repairs, replacing some floorboards and replastering some walls. After the 1960s, however, it limited its work to routine maintenance, neglecting the building's structural system. The house's 1976 listing coincided with a change in the society's mission from historic preservation to historical research, to the detriment of the house and its contents. Potentially valuable artifacts and records languished in unorganized, insufficiently protected conditions within the house. By the early 1980s it was obvious that some more work needed to be done. With a grant from the Norcross Wildlife Foundation, the society commissioned a historic structure report. It turned out that repairs would cost $500,000. Since they could not justify that level of spending without assurances that the city would not invoke its right to tear down the house, the society's board tried to persuade the city to donate the underlying acre or sell it to the society at a token price. Those discussions were unsuccessful, and in 1984 the board turned to another Westchester-based historic preservation organization, Historic Hudson Valley (HHV), which operates and maintains several historic homes, including some National Historic Landmarks, as far north as Annandale-on-Hudson in Dutchess County. The board hoped that HHV would help them with moving the house, the city's preferred option, to the main Philipsburg Manor house in Sleepy Hollow, a site managed by that organization. HHV was interested, but only found the main block worth preserving, as it was the original house. The society's board was unwilling to sacrifice the wings. So, in 1989, it went public with its predicament and put the house up for sale. It hoped to be able to keep it on the original site, but said it would talk with anyone who had a viable plan for adaptive reuse. The poorly stored artifacts and records were moved to the county's newly built Records Center in Elmsford. At the end of that year it announced that it had found a buyer‚Äînearby New York Medical College, which was starting to expand in the area to the north of the house, along with Westchester Medical Center, the former Grasslands Hospital. The sale price was undisclosed at the time, but it was reported that the college would pay $50,000 to update the house's electrical and heating systems, as well as repaint both the interior and exterior. The house became its center for field research on Lyme disease, then a growing public health problem during Westchester's summer months. By 1995, however, the house was again facing the threat of demolition or relocation. Antiques dealer Frederick Rock and his younger brother Michael were able to put together the money to buy it, and spent several years fixing it up so he could live there. A folk music enthusiast, he began hosting regular hootenannies in 1999. These grew into a series of backyard performances featuring artists like The Kennedys, Jack Hardy and Terre and Maggie Roche.

Voices from Symphony Way is an anthology published in 2011 of 45 factual tales written and edited by the Symphony Way Pavement Dwellers. The foreword to the book is written by activist and author Raj Patel and the introduction is penned by Miloon Kothari, former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing. Summary The book follows hundreds of shackdwellers in the township of Delft in Cape Town. The stories are real- life accounts of the struggle of the Symphony Way Pavement Dwellers. In early 2007, they were moved into houses they had been waiting for since the end of Apartheid but soon were told that the move had been illegal and they were removed from their new homes. In protest, they occupied Symphony Way, a main road opposite the housing project. It soon blossomed into a settlement of hundreds of shacks inhabited by organised protesting families. It became known as Symphony Way and was the home ground of the Symphony Way Anti-Eviction Campaign, whose membership vowed to stay on the road until the government gave them permanent housing. The community was eventually evicted after almost two years occupying Symphony Way. They were moved to the Blikkiesdorp temporary relocation area where they are still struggling for land and housing.CT to evict pavement dwellers News24Symphony Way is not dead. We are still Symphony Way. We will always be Symphony Way. Anti-Eviction Campaign In his forward, Raj Patel says that the book is \\"both testimony and poetry\\" and contributor Conway Payn \\"opens the door to a world of compassion, of fellow-suffering, that holds you firm.\\" The introduction is contributed by Miloon Kothari, who was United Nations Special Rapporteur on adequate housing between 2000 and 2008. Themes The overall theme in the book is the shackdwellers' struggle for land, housing and dignity as human beings. However, the stories also cover many general issues within poor communities including relationships and physical abuse. The authors' concerns range from safety on \\"their\\" road to the impending eviction because of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Another recurring theme throughout the anthology is how the struggle enabled the pavement dwellers to build a strong community on the road.  Reception  Journalist and author Naomi Klein said that the book is \\"A beauty, extraordinary in every way.\\" Critical geographer Michael Watts, called the book \\"a clarion call for basic human rights and for human dignity\\".

Ludonarrative, a compound of ludology and narrative, refers to the intersection in a video game of ludic elements (gameplay) and narrative elements. The term was coined by game designer Clint Hocking in 2007 in a blog post. History Clint Hocking, a former creative director at LucasArts (then at Ubisoft), coined the term on his blog in October 2007, in response to the game BioShock. He claimed that it promotes the theme of self-interest through its gameplay while promoting the opposing theme of selflessness through its narrative, creating a violation of aesthetic distance that often pulls the player out of the game. Jonathan Blow also used BioShock as an example in his 2008 talk. Writer Tom Bissell, in his book Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter (2010), notes the example of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, where a player can all but kill their digital partner during gameplay without upsetting the built-in narrative of the game. Jeffrey Matulef of Eurogamer used the term when referencing the Uncharted series, saying \\"Uncharted has often been mocked for being about a supposedly likable rogue who just so happens to recklessly slaughter hundreds of people\\". Uncharted 4: A Thief's End acknowledged the criticism with a trophy called \\"Ludonarrative Dissonance\\" that is awarded to the player for killing 1,000 enemies. The game's co-director Neil Druckmann said that in Uncharted 4 the studio was \\"conscious to have fewer fights, but it came more from a desire to have a different kind of pacing than to answer the 'ludonarrative dissonance' argument. Because we don't buy into it.\\" Despite this statement, the issue was also referenced in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves when the main antagonist questions Nate on the number of men he has killed. Nate thus leaves him to be killed by other creatures. In 2016, Fr√©d√©ric Seraphine, semiotician and researcher specialized in game design at the University of Tokyo wrote a literature review about the notion of ludonarrative dissonance. In this article, developing on debates sparked by Hocking's blog post, Seraphine identifies the reason of ludonarrative dissonance as an opposition between \\"Incentives\\" and \\"directives\\" within the \\"ludic structure [the gameplay]\\" and the \\"narrative structure [the story]\\". = Debates on the potential positive use of the notion = Some game scholars and writers are challenging the supposedly negative nature of ludonarrative dissonance. Nick Ballantyne, managing editor at GameCloud Australia, in an article from 2015, argues: > \\"What if it could be used to a dev‚Äôs advantage? Video games can force > players into uncomfortable situations, and ludonarrative dissonance can help > foster that uncomfortableness. Faux glitches have been used as > ludo/narrative tools before [in games such as Eternal Darkness: Sanity's > Requiem and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty], so why is ludonarrative > dissonance avoided so much? If your intent is to unsettle or confuse a > player, then ludonarrative dissonance seems perfect, but this relies heavily > on the player.\\" While acknowledging the potential of ludonarrative dissonance to create what he calls \\"emersion\\", defined as opposed to \\"immersion\\" as the \\"sensation of being pulled out of the play experience\\", Seraphine agrees with Ballantyne on the possibility to purposefully use ludonarrative dissonance as a storytelling device. Seraphine concludes his article with: \\"It seems that more games in the near future might use ludonarrative dissonance as a way to tell more compelling stories. In essence, stories are about characters and the most interesting stories are often told with dissonant characters; as it is the surprise, the disturbance, the accident, the sacrosanct disruptive element, that justifies the very act of telling a story.\\" In a 2013 Game Developers Conference talk, Spec Ops: The Line writer Walt Williams argued that embracing ludonarrative dissonance allows the developer to portray the character as a hypocrite and force the character to rationalize their actions. The Grand Theft Auto series of games are designed such that the enjoyment of them mainly comes from committing various crimes, and getting in trouble with the police - although these activities are often not mandatory to progress the story. In Grand Theft Auto V, one of the player characters is Trevor, who is depicted as an unhinged, violent psychopath. It has been speculated that Trevor was created this way, to reflect what kind of person would actually commit the crimes on the scale that players often do in the previous entries in the series. In a highly controversial scene, the player is made to direct Trevor to torture a seemingly innocent man for information. The scene is explicitly commentary on torture as applied by the US government, but it has been speculated that the implied purpose of the scene is to force the player to see their other behavior in-game as similar to Trevor's in this scene, and so by extension, the player is forced to see themselves in Trevor. Ludonarrative consistency The Dead Space series is noted for having a consistent ludonarrative. Brett Makedonski of Destructoid states of the series, \\"The gameplay aptly conveys the sense of sheer terror and loneliness that the narrative expertly strives to establish.\\" References Further reading The \\"Gameplay And Story Segregation\\" TVTropes page, which goes into a taxonomy of some frequent sources of \\"ludonarrative dissonance\\". * \\"The Last of Us 2 epitomizes one of gaming‚Äôs longest debates\\" Polygon article on the archetypes of Ludonarrative dissonance.

The family is known to have existed from the Late Oligocene to the Early Pleistocene before going extinct. Although some phylogenetic studies conducted by recovered the living pygmy right whale as a member of Cetotheriidae, making the pygmy right whale the only living cetotheriid, other authors either dispute this placement or recover Neobalaenidae as a sister group to Cetotheriidae. Taxonomy After its description by Brant in 1872, Cetotheriidae was used as a wastebasket taxon for baleen whales which were not assignable to extant whale families. Comparing the cranial and mandibular morphology of 23 taxa (including late archaeocetes and both fossil and extant mysticetes), found Cetotheriidae in this traditional sense to be polyphyletic. Based on ten cranial characters, they also concluded that of the twelve included fossil baleen-bearing mysticetes, six formed a monophyletic group, Cetotheriidae sensu stricto. Several phylogenetic studies since Bouetel & Muizon 2006 support the monophyly of a small group of core Cetotheriidae sensu stricto, archaic mysticetes with a cranium that have \\"a long ascending process of the maxilla with anteriorly diverging lateral border that interdigitates with the frontal\\" and some other characters. This group is limited to Cetotherium rathkii, Metopocetus durinasus, Mixocetus elysius, Herpetocetus scaldiensis, H. transatlanticus, H. bramblei, Nannocetus eremus, and Piscobalaena nana. The remaining genera placed in the family are considered Cetotheriidae sensu lato and are often referred to as the 'cetotheres'. considered the primitive 'cetothere' Joumocetus the most basal named taxon of their new superfamily Thalassotherii (Cetotheriidae s.l., Cetotheriidae s.s., Eschrichtiidae (gray whales) and Balaenopteridae (rorquals)) and suggested that the term \\"Cetotheriidae s.l.\\" should be renamed \\"basal\\" or \\"stem thalassotherians\\". found that the pygmy right whale formed a well-supported clade with Eschrichtiidae and Balaenopteridae based on molecular data, and that, within 'cetotheres', it was most closely related to the herpetocetines (Herpetocetus and Nannocetus) Bisconti et al. 2013, however, found, based on morphological data, it to be more closely related to Balaenidae (the bowhead and right whales), but added that additional specimens are expected to resolve these conflicting results within a few years.

Though the site has probably been fortified since the 9th century, the present castle was built at the start of the 11th century, by the Counts of Eguisheim-Dabo, then advocatus. Around 1005, Hugues d‚ÄôEguisheim sided with the Holy Roman Emperor against the Bishop of Metz. His castle was ruined by the latter's troops. The castle was later rebuilt. Under the episcopate of Philippe de Florange (1261-1263), it was again ravaged, this time by Henri II de Lichtenberg and the Bishop of Strasbourg. From the end of the 13th century, the castle was ceded by the Bishop of Metz, to Lichtenberg. Guillaume de Diest captured the castle around 1396.Dagobert Fischer, \\"Notice historique sur l'ancien bailliage de Herrenstein\\" Revue d'Alsace, vol 2, July- Sept 1873, pages 399-415 The castle's domains were bought bit by bit by the free town of Strasbourg, which became dominant in 1480. The castle housed a garrison of six to twelve men. In the 16th century, it was modernised by Daniel Specklin, architect of the town of Strasbourg, to make it a fortress capable of resisting early artillery. Herrenstein protected the seigneurie where Protestants sought refuge, Strasbourg having adopted the Protestant Reformation.Dagobert Fischer, \\"Notice historique sur l'ancien bailliage de Herrenstein\\" Revue d'Alsace, vol 2, Oct-Dec 1873, pages 532-575 During the French occupation of Alsace by the troops of Louis XIV, as part of his politique des r√©unions, Herrenstein was bought by Reinhold de Rosen (1604-1667), the king's lieutenant general, who modernised it and lived there. In 1673, the castle was destroyed by the French troops of Joseph de Montclar and it was used as a quarry for the fortification of Lichtenberg. A document dated 1778 describes Herrenstein as a \\"vieux ch√¢teau partiellement en ruines avec une habitation pour le garde-chasse et le garde-forestier\\" (\\"old castle partially in ruins with a house for the gamekeeper and forest keeper\\"). The castle is not classified as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture, but does appear on the Ministry's database.

He holds a BSc (London), M.A. (Cantab.) and PhD (Ibadan), FAS, NNOM, IOMIOM means International Order of Merit (Cambridge). A pioneer of solar energy in Nigeria, Animalu is a physicist of international repute, member of the highest advisory body on Science and Technology to the Nigerian government, Honorary Presidential Advisory Council on Science and Technology (2001‚Äì03) and former Director National Mathematical Centre, Abuja. The only African member to date of the Advisory Board of the Euro-Journal Physica(B) and the only African member of the Editorial Board of the Hadronic Journal, he is also the founding editor of the Nigerian Journal of Solar Energy and one of the pioneering editors of the Bulletin of the Nigerian Institute of Physics. Foundation President of the Solar Energy Society of Nigeria, foundation editor, Nigerian Journal of Solar Energy, foundation member, United States Energy Research and Development Administration and Foundation member and former President of the Nigerian Academy of Science, Animalu is author of 28 books in both the sciences and the humanities, including the famous Intermediate Quantum Theory of Crystalline Solids and biographies of Rt. Hon. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Professor Chike Obi, Professor Kenneth Dike, Professor Samuel Okoye, Professor James Ezeilo, Professor Chukwuedu Nwokolo, Professor Cyril Onwumechili among others. Biography He was born on 28 August 1938, the fifth child to Michael Animalu Nwakudu and Josephine Nkenwa in Okuzu, Oba of Idemili South L.G.A. of Anambra State of Nigeria, and attended St. Paul's CMS Church School, Isu-Oba (1943‚Äì44); St. Thomas's CMS Church School, Okuzu (1944‚Äì45), CMS Central School, Isu-Oba (1945‚Äì51), Dennis Memorial Grammar School (1952‚Äì56) for secondary education and (1957‚Äì58) for Higher School Certificate. He then attended University College, Ibadan (1959‚Äì62), where he was taught by Professor Chike Obi and Professor James Ezeilo. Animalu graduated with BSc (Maths) and won the Faculty of Science Prize for the best performance for two consecutive years. He also won the Crowe's Prize on Abstract Algebra and Number Theory; as well as the University College Postgraduate Scholarship. It was this College Scholarship that saw him through the University of Cambridge in the UK between October 1962 and December 1965, when he obtained the M.A. (Cantab) and PhD (Maths) in Theoretical Solid State Physics. The high quality of his PhD thesis was attested to, when the main results were published in Philosophical Magazine in 1965 and included in W. A. Harrison's book Pseudopotentials in the Theory of Metals. The book contained the model potential tables that were in such high demand by researchers in the field of metal physics and semiconductor electronics that the PhD thesis work as published in Philosophical Magazine became by 1983 a citation classic, having been cited more than 729 times between 1965 and 2001.ISI Citation Classics 1983. He is the only African in Physics to have earned such a record of citations, his paper being the best among the best twelve cited papers from the University of Cambridge in fifty years (1930‚Äì80). It is of interest to note that four of these twelve most cited works from Cambridge have subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Early career Between January 1966 and December 1967, Animalu was Research Associate in Division of Applied Physics, Stanford University and between January 1968 and August 1968, he was a visiting scientist at the Department of Physics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. In September 1968, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Missouri, Rolla. His research work was in solid state and elementary particle physics. In 1970, he moved to Drexel University in Pennsylvania, as Associate Professor of Physics. A major breakthrough in his career came in April 1972 when he was appointed a research physicist, at the Lincoln Laboratory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) working under H. J. Zeiger and J. B. Goodenough on research projects related to development of computer core memory and primarily on the development of the transition-metal model potential, thus extending his PhD thesis area to now include all elements of the periodic table. It was within this period that he completed his principal book, Intermediate Quantum Theory of Crystalline Solids, published by Prentice-Hall in 1977. It became a world- wide classic with an Indian edition published by Prentice-Hall of India in 1978. It was also translated into Russian by the Russian Academy of Science in 1981, reprinted in US in 1994 and is currently on the World Wide Web. After a period of teaching and research in the UK and US between 1962 and 1976, he returned to Nigeria in 1976. Within a year of going back, he began to make contributions to the development of Nigeria. Later career in Nigeria He was invited to become a Professor of Physics in 1976 in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nigeria, Nsukka by his former lecturer and the then Vice-Chancellor of the University, Professor Emeritus James Ezeilo. The former Nigerian President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, presented him with the Nigerian National Order of Merit (NNOM) award for Basic Science in 2000. He rose in academic positions becoming Head of Department of Physics, UNN in 1981 and 1994 and Dean, Faculty of the Physical Sciences, UNN. His proposal to the Federal Government of Nigeria led to the establishment of a Centre for Energy Research and Development in the UNN in 1980. He became the first substantive Chairman of its Governing Board in 1989. The idea for a National Mathematical Center in Nigeria was hatched by Professor Emeritus Ezeilo and Animalu. He was the 1990 Ahiajoku lecturer, the highest Igbo academic privilege given to such scholars as Professor Chinua Achebe and Professor Onwumechili. His theory of high-temperature superconductivity based on the novelty of the pairing mechanism for electrons was published in Hadronic Journal in 1991. He has trained many Nigerians in the field of theoretical physics and solar energy and established two youth organisations, Society for Promotion of Indigenous Inventions and Creativity (SPIIC) and Century-21 Club. With Willy Umezinwa he co-authored the 1968 book Asp, From African Symbols to Physics'. Animalu has more than 100 scholarly articles to his credit. He was honoured with the position of Emeritus Professor of the University of Nigeria in 2006. He is also chairman/CEO, Institute for Basic Research (Nigeria Division) and a Knight of St. Christopher (KSC).

It sold under the name \\"interact Model One home computer\\". The original Ineract Model One computer was designed by Rick Barnich and Tim Anderson at 204 E. Washington in Ann Arbor, then moving to an office in Georgetown Mall on Packard St in Ann Arbor. Interact Electronics Inc was a privately held company that was funded by Hongiman, Miller, Swartz and Cohn...a lawyer firm out of Detroit. The President/Founder of Interact Electronics Inc was Ken Lochner, who was one of the original developers of the BASIC language based out of Dartmouth college. Ken had started Interact Electronics Inc after a successful startup known as ADP Cyphernetics, the original computer time share company in Ann Arbor, now known as ADP Network Services. Only a few thousand Interacts were sold before the company went bankrupt. Most were sold by the liquidator Protecto Enterprizes of Barrington, Illinois through mail order sale. The Interact Model One Home Computer debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1978 at a price of $499. The majority of sales were thru Mail Order houses and you could buy it off the shelf at Highland Appliance in the Detroit, MI area and Newman Computer Exchange in Ann Arbor also Montgomery Wards in Houston, TX area Probably the most successful application available for the Interace was a program called \\"Message Center\\". With it, a store could type in whatever message they wanted to appear scrolling on a TV screen...like Advertisements, or welcoming messages to guests in an office. Although it was mostly a Game machine at the time with games such as Showdown, BlackJack and Chess, there was also BASIC programming where users could create their own programs in the BASIC computer language.

The album's three singles are \\"The Chevalier,\\" \\"Serenade of Flames,\\" and \\"When Canvas Starts To Burn.\\" Death & Legacy continues the development of the band into a symphonic metal or melodic metal group. More orchestrations were used in the album and a perfection of balance between melody and power was created. Oliver Philipps produced the album along with writing the orchestrations. The band again called on some guest musicians, including Ailyn of Sirenia, Charlotte Wessels of Delain, Amanda Somerville of Epica and Lanvall of Edenbridge, to help in making the album what many fans consider a Serenity masterpiece. All photos & artworks were done by Stefan Heilemann, based on a concept by Thomas Buchberger & Georg Neuhauser. History Death & Legacy was released on February 25, 2011 through Napalm Records. It is the last album featuring keyboardist Mario Hirzinger, who later quit the band for personal reasons. Death & Legacy features 14 tracks including 2 interludes and 2 instrumental tracks. The Limited Edition album contains two additional tracks while the Asian/Japanese release has these additional bonus track as well as an additional seventeenth track, a re-recording version of \\"Guiding Light.\\" The album is somewhat of a concept album, featuring figures from history including Mary, Queen of Scots, Joan of Arc, and Galileo.

A music video was shot for \\"The Chevalier\\", the album's lead single. The video was shot in Schloss Matzen castle, which is located in the west part of Austria. The video was shot during winter in the castle rooms, in the style and fashion of the second half of 18th century, during the Rococo and early Romanticism periods. Georg, who plays Casanova, is seen riding on a black horse and carrying a falcon, mixed with scenes where women with masks attempt to seduce him. Ailyn, Casanova's lover, is then seen in a room with Georg; both looking at the mirror. She then walks between trees and a lake in the park, and then sings alone. Clips of a horse and a falcon in a slow motion are also shown, along with scenes in which Georg and Ailyn are sitting with other band members around the dining table. The video ends with two of them singing together outside, as the sun illuminates them. The song and video was dedicated to Giacomo Casanova and was released on January 24, 2011. Lead vocalist Georg Neuhauser stated this about making the music video, \\"It was an awesome experience for everybody! This time, we worked together with Salvatore Perrone, an Italian director. We knew what we wanted and even tho it was not easy, we all worked as a big team, and this was the surplus. It took us nearly 3 days, shooting under the snow and rigid temperatures of our land, Tyrol in Austria. We also used some animals, as horses and falcons and those elements gave the storyboard a realistic flavor.\\" The video was released on January 24, 2011. The second single was \\"When Canvas Starts To Burn\\", and it also has an accompanying music video. It was shot in a studio in Tyrol, Austria, with band members playing and singing the song during a storm. It's mixed with scenes of girls playing the violin and posing on a red velvet bed. The song and video were dedicated to Albrecht D√ºrer, a northern renaissance painter on whom the lyrics are based. The video took one day to shoot and was released on November 14, 2011. A teaser for the single \\"Serenade of Flames\\" was also shot by the band. Reception The Dutch review website Kwadratuur rated the album 3.5 stars out of 5, concluding that 'Death & Legacy' is a very entertaining album with undeniable craftsmanship. The album has a common thread in that each song is hung on a historical figure, performed with conviction, holding the listener's attention by their variety. The Golden Bird rates the album an A-, stating \\"Overall, 'Death & Legacy' is a fine album. It is everything that symphonic power metal represents taken to its outermost limits.\\" A Metal Crypt review states, \\"The songwriting is outstanding and there are no weak tracks. The band members' individual performances are top notch and the playing is tight, without strangling the emotion of the songs. Even the subject matter, Templars, Age of Discovery explorers, kings, queens and scientists, is larger than life,\\" and, \\"Any serious discussion about Symphonic Power Metal should now include Serenity. That is, if you can stop singing songs from Death & Legacy long enough to have a conversation,\\" giving the band a 4.52 out of 5. Overall, Metal Crypt gives the album a 4.75 out 5. Metal Blog reviewed Death & Legacy and states, \\"Death & Legacy is highly entertaining all the way through, with its well crafted music, lyrics and all around theme to the record..... There's also a lot of awesome with 16 tracks on the disc complied of quality, catchy tunes and atmospheric interludes.\\" All Music and Sputnik Music both gave Death & Legacy 3.5 stars out of 5.

The device allows the pinion gear of the starter motor to engage or disengage the ring gear (which is attached to the flywheel or flexplate of the engine) automatically when the starter is powered or when the engine fires, respectively. It is named after its inventor, Vincent Hugo Bendix. Operation The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to wind the spring forcing the length of the spring to change, and allowing the pinion to engage with the ring gear. When the engine starts, backdrive from the ring gear causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the ring gear. The main drawback to the Bendix drive is that it relies on a certain amount of \\"clash\\" between the teeth of the pinion and the ring gears before they slip into place and mate completely; the teeth of the pinion are already spinning when they come into contact with the static ring gear, and unless they happen to align perfectly at the moment they engage, the pinion teeth will strike the teeth of the ring gear side-to-side rather than face-to-face, and continue to rotate until both align. This increases wear on both sets of teeth. For this reason the Bendix drive has been largely superseded in starter motor design by the pre-engagement system using a starter solenoid.

The duration of the conflict is generally dated from the start of the Reformasi era in early 1999 to the signing of the Malino II Accord on 13 February 2002. The principal causes of the conflict are attributed to general political and economic instability in Indonesia following the fall of Suharto and the devaluation of the rupiah during and after a wider economic crisis in Southeast Asia. The forthcoming division of the then Maluku province into the current Maluku province and North Maluku province exacerbated existing district political disputes further and, as the political dispute had been characterized along religious lines, inter-communal fighting broke out between Christian and Muslim communities in January 1999, cascading into what could be described as all out warfare and atrocities against the civilian population committed by both sides. The main belligerents were therefore religious militia from both faiths, including the well organised Islamist Laskar Jihad, and Indonesian government military forces. Overview Though all violence during the four-year period cannot be linked directly to political or sectarian issues, as a significant majority could be attributed to opportunistic crimes, the violence was categorized by the armed campaigns of local militia groups targeted almost exclusively against the civilian populations of the islands. This also included the Laskar Jihad militia group, composed of trained fighters from other predominantly Muslim areas of Indonesia, who ran a campaign in the later stages of the conflict to drive out Christian residents of Maluku. The nature of the violence was intended to displace members of the rival community, as it assumed the form of mass-evictions through the use of intimidation and harassment, followed by vicious attacks on large groups of locals and arson attacks on their residences or even whole neighbourhoods that could be termed as pogroms in some cases. In one instance in April 1999 all Christian residents were expelled from the Banda Islands. Despite firing some 80% of all ammunition spent in the fighting, the Police and Armed forces of the Republic of Indonesia claimed to be neutral throughout the conflict. However, the authorities were criticized for not preventing attacks and allegations of ethnic and religious bias were alleged by both communities, in particular that a number of troops handed over state-owned weapons, mostly to Muslim militia members, and said weapons were used in later attacks and atrocities. In some cases individual personnel of both the military and police are reported to have joined the militias of their respective religion, with up to 350 military personnel alleged to have assisted and fought alongside Muslim fighters. Initially the local militia groups had organised themselves as 'defenders' and 'protectors' of their respective community against rival attacks, establishing posko or command posts in light of the Police inaction, however, these rapidly evolved into mobilization points for local gangs to launch attacks from. The conflict had a significant effect upon the 2.1 million people of greater Maluku. Leading up to the Malino agreement, the International Crisis Group estimated that 700,000 people had been displaced by the four years of fighting in the Moluccas which is thought to have claimed a minimum of 5,000 lives. This constituted the largest movement of refugees since the federation of the Indonesian state and the majority of the 1.4 million internal refugees reported in February 2002 by the World Food Programme. Background =Political and economic factors= Indonesian military forces evacuate refugees from Ambon during the conflict in 1999. Decentralisation stimulated a renewed effort in 1998 for the northern islands of Maluku to secede from Maluku province. The secession was supported on all sides of the religious and political spectrum as residents shared the same concerns of relative logistical difficulties associated with distances in the region, the expropriation of economic wealth by outside individuals and a distant and disengaged government in Ambon. The movement was crucially backed by then governor of Maluku province, Saleh Latuconsina, and following lobbying by prominent North Maluku parliamentarians and student activists, in February 1999, then president Jusuf Habibie promised to create a new North Maluku province. The authoritarian rule of Suharto, to which the Christian and Muslim religious hierarchies of Al-Khaira'at and Gereja Protestan Maluku had been subordinate, had granted the groups niches of coercive power over their respective communities and guaranteed a relatively stable structure of local assemblies and distribution of power for the previous few decades. Identifying oneself with the religious establishment that held the political power allowed one to access a network that provided favours, protection from crime and other practical benefits for its members and, it has been suggested by political scientist Gerry van Klinken, this network allowed small disagreements on the street level to spread across much of Maluku society. However, the fall of the nationwide New Order structure and decentralisation allowed open and competitive electoral competition for district positions of authority, which held both prestige and economic advantages, cast doubt on the number of voters each group could claim to command and it was within the best interests of all significant groups to mobilize support for their respective cause. In the soon to be established North Maluku province competition for the newly created administrative positions was largely between gubernatorial candidates the sultan of Ternate, Mudaffar Sjah, who relied upon the support of the influential Evangelical Church of Halmahera (GMIH), and the Makianese Muslim regent of Central Halmahera, Bahar Andili. The redrawing of administrative districts and contention between Tidore and Ternate over the location of the soon-to-be capital cast into doubt the viability of numerous existing power- structures and those employed by the groups that formed these structures. Economic power in Ambon from the mid-1980s onwards was held by civil servants, observed P. M. Laksono, and their salaries and monetary provisions from Jakarta contributed the overwhelming majority of wealth entering the Maluku region, as local agricultural and marine production was largely subsistence and commercial fishing operations were mostly foreign owned. Some estimates placed direct employment in the civil service at a quarter of total employment in Ambon and figures from 1990 stated 38% of Ternate workers were employed by the government. The dependence on a generally static number of public service positions meant that youth unemployment in Ambon was unusually high; in Benteng on Ambon 73.2% of the population was listed as not yet employed in 1994, and it was these disaffected youth that mostly composed the foot- soldiers of the conflict. The violence cannot, however, be entirely attributed to political or religious institutions; during a communal dispute before the outbreak of widespread violence, among others, at the Ambon villages of Wakal and Hative Besar, their representatives acted to mitigate conflict but were widely ignored in that case. =Customary factors= Damage to Ambon City in 2001. Apartments fortified with sandbags can be seen in foreground. Demographic change has also been cited as a factor in creating tension. Particular issues related to the disturbance of the customary land rights, or adat, that were common to both indigenous Moluccan religious communities but were of little concern to newer migrants who had no interest in a traditional alliance system. The residents of Ambon had been particularly adherent to a theory of pela gandung, whereby villages, often of differing religious persuasion, were 'bound by blood' to assist one another and marriages between the members of the villages were forbidden, as they were between blood relatives. Any transgression against these rules would be severely punished by curses from the ancestors who founded the institution. The alliances facilitated a relationship to allow peace between villages that were rigidly structured as either wholly Christian or Islamic and had formed the largest political units of Moluccan society prior to the Indonesian state. However, this system could not accommodate land-title of nonlocal, nonvillage-based transmigrant landowners. These local customs that maintained respect had also been undermined by reform Islam, which was popular in Ternate during the 1980s, and the 1981 fatwa from the Indonesian Association of Ulama that banned Christians from participation in Islamic holidays aided the segregation of the religious communities. =Ethnic factors= Ambon and surrounding islands had a roughly equal number of Christian and Muslim citizens in the years prior to the crisis. However, in the three-decade period after 1969 some 98,000 people were resettled in Maluku as part of the official government transmigration programme, the majority Bugis, Makassarese or other Muslims from South Sulawesi. Further independent migrants also settled in Maluku and in February 1999 the national newspaper, Kompas, estimated 225,000 migrants from South Sulawesi had settled in the Maluku Islands with 30,000 living in Ambon. Bugis and Butonese owners had rapidly increased their share of merchant and retail trade in Ambon to the extent that markets were specifically targeted by Christian gangs during the earlier stages of fighting in Ambon City as a way of harming the Muslim community. The shift contributed to greater bureaucratic and political representation of Muslims in Maluku district affairs, with two successive Muslim governors selected in 1992 and 1997 who began to fill vacancies in the civil service with Muslim appointees, and has been cited as creating anxiety within the Christian community about a potential Islamisation of Maluku, contributing to sectarian tensions. During the early stages of the conflict the large-scale internal displacement of Ambonese to Northern Maluku, Ternate in particular, and the rumors and crimes the internally displaced people described to local residents are cited as a factor in the increased sectarian tension and initial violence in North Maluku during August 1999. =North Halmahera land disputes= In North Maluku the population was 85% Muslim prior to the start of conflict. There had been a steady exodus of Makianese from the island of Makian to Ternate and the northern regions of Halmahera. Dozens of villages had been established and populated by Makianese transmigrants who had moved there from the neighbouring island during the 1970s, following fears of a volcanic eruption. Some of the migrant Makianese had been shifted to live and cultivate on or near land traditionally claimed by the Jailolo and Kao ethno-linguistic groups, and claims to the land became more forceful with the discovery of gold deposits in the 1990s and the announcement of an Australian owned mine to open in mid-1999. Resentment of the increasing influence of Makianese was not restricted to the Christian minorities, with mistrust aired in Ternate and Tidore following their attainment of important regional positions outside the traditional Makianese homeland. The dispute over land rights acquired a religious edge as the migrant Makianese were mostly Muslim while the 'indigenous' Jailolo and Kao were predominantly Protestant, however, there had also been a steady transmigration of Muslim Javanese to the Kao lands (even though the indigenous Christian population had been cooperative with the new residents). In 1999 the Kao and Jailolo claims received backing from the Sultan of Ternate and Protestant ethno-political groups, while the Makianese were supported by Muslim candidates, in their respective attempts to assume governorship of the newly established North Maluku province. During 1999, the national government agreed with Makian lobbyists to create a new Muslim majority Malifut sub- district, or kecamatan, which incorporated 16 Makianese settlements, several villages of Christian Pagu and Kao and the strategic gold deposits on the disputed lands. The Pagu did not wish to be ruled by a Makian majority local government and viewed the ruling as an attempt to damage the traditional unity of the Kao tribes. The first communal violence in Halmahera coincided with 18 August formal inauguration of the Malifut sub-district. =Criminal factors= The crisis was also allegedly permeated by the rivalry of two large semi- criminal gangs that operated in Ambon and, allegedly, Jakarta. The gangs possessed a quasi-religious identity; the 'Reds' identifying as Christian and 'Whites' as Muslim, and had prepared contingency plans for an attack from the other prior to the start of conflict in 1999. The Human Rights Watch report concerning Ambon hostilities cites a major communal confrontation of Ambonese migrants in the Ketapang area of Jakarta on 22 November 1998, which saw up to 14 killed and numerous church burnings following rumors that Christian Ambonese guards of a significant gambling house had destroyed a Mosque. Most of the 180 arrested in the immediate aftermath of the violence were of Ambonese origin. In the several months prior to the start of hostilities a few hundred Ambonese returned from Jakarta and it has been asserted that some were loyal to the leaders of criminal gangs, however, it cannot be independently confirmed whether these were agents provocateurs or workers returning to avoid retaliation. Soon-to-be president Abdurrahman Wahid indicated that the individual personally responsible for the Ambon unrest was Yorrys Raweyai, the leader of mercenary group Pancasila Youth that had been known to act as hired \\"muscle\\" for the Suharto administration activities. While the agent provocateur theory remains popular as an explanation for the start of the crisis, of the 100 or so people arrested for crimes committed during the Ambon unrest, only two have been charged for incitement and neither is believed to be an external agent. Timeline of conflict in Southern Maluku =First Ambon riots= On 14 January 1999, there had been a riot between rival villages in Dobo, of the Aru Islands Regency, that killed up to 12 people, however, the broad scale violence of the Maluku conflict began on Idul Fitri, an Islamic holiday that was on 19 January 1999. Fighting in Ambon City during the first 3 or so days claimed anywhere from 43 to 65 lives, with bodies discovered weeks after in the ruins of Ambon. Over 100 were seriously injured at least 10 houses of worship had been destroyed, with the loss of homes and significant retail services forcing the displacement of up to 20,000 residents. Ambon airport was closed and a curfew applied in the town for the week after. The weapons used in this early period of rioting were mainly machetes, flaming arrows, spears, and other traditional weapons, and arson was as widespread as it would be throughout the conflict. Initial 19 January confrontation It is widely recorded that the initial confrontation that sparked the conflict was between a Christian minibus driver and either some Bugis youths, a drunk or a Muslim conductor, nearby a bus terminal in Batu Merah village. Despite the differing accounts, it is agreed that a mob, Church reports state some 600 people, of Muslim residents gathered and marched upon the Christian areas of Batu Merah at approximately 16:00 (UTC+6), where they torched numerous houses and several businesses by Mardika market. The group had been driven on by incorrect rumors that the local mosque had been torched and faced little opposition from the police force, which only fielded ten lightly armed intelligence members due to the holiday. More Christian houses were burnt in Silale and Waihaong kampungs later in the afternoon and the first church was torched also. Throughout this initial confrontation it was widely observed that the violence was directed by people from outside the area. After hearing of the destruction of homes, Christian residents gathered outside Kudamati church to launch a counter-offensive and defend those at Mardika, but were blocked by a Muslim crowd at Waringin in the first direct clash of the two sects with the largest confrontation at Mardika plaza. A truck carrying 50 unidentified youths is alleged to have arrived in Waringin around 17:00 (UTC+6) and the occupants were seen damaging homes and other property with metal bars and rocks, but residents of Waringin claim they fended off the attacks. There had not yet been any casualties and police assured Waringin residents they could return home safely. At 20:00 (UTC+6) in the evening, around 30 Christians fought back a crowd of Muslims attempting to enter the Silo church, while others were observed gathering to destroy kiosks and pedicabs owned by muslim Bugis and Butonese. All witnesses describe that by this time violent parties were identifying themselves with either red scarfs or headbands, to signify Christians, or white cloths on their wrists to signify Muslims as they had been instructed by the head of an information post at the al-Fatah mosque. Commencement of civil disobedience in Ambon On the night of 19 January, witnesses report that large, and allegedly well organised, groups of Christian rioters entered Kampung Paradeys in several waves, smashing and looting from Muslim homes on the orders of an unknown leader. The targets of the attackers were Buton, Bugis and Javanese migrants, however, the mob was indiscriminate in the burning of Muslim houses in the neighbourhood. In Waringin, Christian rioters are alleged to have attacked the property of Muslim locals multiple times during the night, injuring 6, and some Christians identified as from the Nusaniwe subdistrict attacked again with Molotov cocktails around 10:00 (UTC+6) on 20 January, igniting fires that are claimed to have caused the destruction by arson of 120 houses. This destruction heralded the first large-scale displacement of people, as 240 households took refuge in other Muslim kampung, contributing to the estimated 3,000 that fled in the initial 3 days of fighting. During the early morning of 20 January, Christian mobs burned the overwhelmingly Bugis-owned stalls of the Pelita, Gambus and Mardika markets while a large settlement of Butonese people around the Gambus market was also looted and destroyed. An Islamic elementary school and kindergarten were also burned, and there was selective burning of Muslim-owned property, such as Padang restaurants, along Ambon's main streets. At least one Butonese school-girl was among several reported killed during the rioting at Gunung Nona, struck by a machete and placed in a sack, and other bodies were found during the following days in the ashes of destroyed buildings, trapped by the rapidly moving flames. 20 January attack on Benteng Karang and other villages Muslim residents of Hitu, Wakal and Mamala were told a rumor early on 20 January that the al-Fatah mosque in Ambon had been desecrated and demolished, and many worshipers massacred; hearsay for which a candidate for village head in Hitu was later arrested on charges of incitement. The irate Muslims of Hitu were to march to Ambon in protest, passing several Christian villages in the hinterland region. In assaults that claimed around 20 lives many villages were partially or wholly destroyed by the 3,000 strong mob. One of the first villages the mob had to pass on the Ambon road was Benteng Karang, an entirely Christian village where they launched an unprovoked attack. Police warned the residents of Benteng Karang on two occasions they were likely to be attacked, and a group had gathered around the main church shortly before the arrival of the marchers. The marchers allegedly bombed the Catholic Church with a fishing bomb and set fire to three other churches, before attacking the sheltering families of the 40 who sought to defend the village. The village was entirely destroyed and 16 died in the massacre, all from Benteng Karang, including one pregnant mother and child. The large movement of Hitu Muslims continued to advance upon Ambon through the mixed-faith hillside villages of Hunuth, Waiheru, Nania and Negeri Lama who were warned of the advance by survivors of Benteng Karang. Women and children of Hunuth took refuge on boats while the men attempted to defend their property, but soon fled after the death of one defender. A teenage boy and a military veteran were killed and least 40 Christian owned houses, two churches and a health service post were burned in the other villages. The movement was confronted by residents at Posso, who had mobilized after hearing of the destruction of Benteng Karang. At the point of contact a group of 10 soldiers attempted to restrain each side from advancing, however the units were forced to withdraw after coming under attack with missiles. The number of armed Posso residents steadily grew to over 100 as the defenders repelled several advances and, eventually, an agreement was negotiated whereby the Hitu Muslims were to return to Hitu in army trucks. Most, however, returned on foot and are known to have murdered a local Protestant minister in the village of Nania also. 20 January attack on Hila Bible camp Some 120 people, which some sources describe as mostly children and teens, had been taking part in a 3-day Bible camp on the grounds of a University of Pattimura research station near Hila, when six were killed in an apparent attack by people from the nearby Muslim village of Wakal. Two men from the group were murdered, and their van torched, while travelling through Wakal town after seeking assistance from the military in Hila village to transport the campers. Soon after, a truckload of militants arrived at the camp ground and ordered the campers out of the rooms where they had taken shelter, 4 of those who emerged were murdered with machetes, 3 adults and an adolescent boy according to some sources. The boy is often referred to as Roy Pontoh, a 15-year-old Ambonese Christian who is described as having stood up to the militants when asked to renounce his faith and was subsequently murdered with a machete and his body placed in a ditch.Workers of Open Doors, a Christian organisation, claim to have interviewed a friend of Roy Pontoh who described the murder of the boy. This account has been reprinted in Cox's 2006 book and on Christian blogs, a photo purported to be of Roy exists online. Other campers were abused, ordered into the main hall and robbed of their valuables. Despite the efforts by residents of both faiths to prevent an assault, the following day Hila village proper was allegedly attacked by a Wakal mob, who murdered one person and looted and torched numerous, mostly Christian, houses. The Dutch-built 18th century Immanuel Church in Hila was also destroyed by arson. 23 January murder of a Kostrad soldier in Benteng In the first recorded confrontation of security forces and the rioting public several, reportedly Christian, rioters were shot and at least one killed following the stabbing murder of a Balinese member of the Kostrad Strategic Reserve Command in the coastal neighbourhoods of Benteng, though the order of events is disputed. Eleven youths, all Christian, were later charged with murder. Allegedly the soldiers had been intervening in a confrontation of Bugis and Ambonese Christian youths, however people on the Christian side felt the authorities were being overly forceful with the Christian fighters and lashed out at the Kostrad troops, killing Gusti Ngurah Hartawan. In defence, the soldiers opened fire on the crowd, killing one or possibly two. Media reports describe a gathering of 200 people marching on the Police headquarters in Ambon in protest. The same day, after the carnage in Ambon, security forces were given orders to shoot on sight any potential troublemakers, though their use of these powers in several instances called into question whether the new police powers were being abused, or if officers were acting impartially in the conflict. Accusations of police collusion with Muslim fighters were common, and five Muslim residents hiding in a military transport vehicle the day before had been killed after they were allegedly found to be concealing weapons. Media publication, Tempo, suggested the murders were motivated by revenge for the death of a Protestant minister in Nania. At least 13 were also killed at the Christian village of Waai, Ambon Island, on 23 January after an attack by Muslim residents from Tulehu in a raid that mirrored traditional Ambonese inter-communal fighting. The Muslims are alleged to have declared jihad against the rival Christian village after the displacement of Muslim Butonese to Tulehu, and raided the Waai township with fishing bombs among other weapons. Waai authorities counted the deaths of 2 locals and a visitor and killed a further 10 Muslim aggressors in the defense of the town, a number supported by Muslim sources, who claim more Christians were killed. Significant tourist infrastructure was also destroyed. Respite and resumption of fighting in Ambon After the initial rioting there were several weeks or so of respite from wide scale violence, attributed in part to the deployment of 3,000 more troops, most of whom were from outside Maluku province. Road blocks had been established by their respective factions around villages in Ambon, preventing several possible clashes but also causing transport limitations and food shortages. Large numbers of displaced people had taken refuge at military installations and there were even reports of Muslims praying at an Ambon mosque guarded by Christians. Fighting again resumed in Ambon City on the morning of 23 February following a minor confrontation, the nature of which is disputed. It is generally agreed that a Muslim mob formed after the confrontation and was countered by the rapid formation of a rival Christian mob, with each causing damage to property and houses owned by those of the opposing faith. In these early stages of fighting one person is reported to have been killed by security forces and several bombs detonated. The fighting became more virulent with the reported murder of 5 Butonese passengers of a van near the state Islamic institute by a Christian mob, and a further 8 people were killed in Karang Panjang and Kramat Jaya as homes and a mosque were set alight. Some sources reported up to 23 killed during the day of fighting, mostly Butonese migrants, and several deaths were caused by the actions of security forces. March confrontations On 1 March mobs from the rival faiths confronted each other again and a mob of Ahuru Christians attacked the mostly Bugis and Butonese Rinjani neighborhood, killing a family of 5. The clashes had restarted as people reacted to incorrect reports that 4 others had been shot inside a mosque by police; 3 Muslims had in fact been killed by security forces in surrounding neighborhoods and brought to the mosque, draped in white sheets. Two more incidents of security force intervention with live ammunition occurred on 6 and 10 February respectively. In the first instance police opened fire on a crowd of Christian youths manning a checkpoint by Silo church, killing one. The plain-clothes police officers had refused to show identification when their vehicles were stopped, and shot at the crowd around the barricade when attacked with home-made weapons. The second intervention happened during another round of clashes by youths armed with petrol bombs and machetes around Batu Merah and Mardika. Ten were killed and 30 seriously injured, and almost all the casualties were caused by the police firing into the unruly crowds. =Start of violence on surrounding islands= Violence had been restrained on surrounding islands despite the fiery deaths of two in Sanana Island riots on the same day as the Ambon rioting. A clash did take place on Ceram after a misunderstanding during a peace initiative by Christians, which saw at least 7 injured and several Muslim houses and market stalls destroyed on 3 February. The next day several dozen houses were burnt in a Christian village in Kairatu, while on 5 February, Christian residents of Kamariang attacked another Muslim village, prompting the police to open fire and kill one youth. 14 February Haruku Island shootings The largest loss of life at the hands of security forces at that stage in the conflict occurred in Kariu on the island of Haruku, when military units used live ammunition to quell a clash between a groups of Christian residents and Muslims from surrounding villages, reportedly killing 23. Accounts differ as to how many died on either side and the total number of dead from the shooting and confrontation may have been around 30, including 4 elderly residents who attempted to flee to the forest to escape the complete destruction of Kariu and the town's main church by the Muslim mob. The failure of the military to prevent the destruction of Kariu and the arrest of four Christian police officers falsely accused of firing into the crowd of Muslim aggressors, furthered the belief that the military were biased towards the Muslim militias. The island was subsequently blockaded by the Navy to prevent movement of possible provocateurs. 23 February Saparua Island clashes Two large clashes during the night claimed the lives of around 10 fighters, with several deaths attributed to the actions of security forces. In the first case Christian youths were alleged to have provoked Muslim residents of Sirisori to retaliate, claiming 9 lives. The second clash was between two Saparua villages of rival faith and it is disputed as to whether 3 were killed by security forces or the traditional weapons of the civilian fighters, though it was recorded by Republika newspaper that a few automatic weapons were recovered from fighters and one mosque destroyed. Another confrontation over the damaging of clove plants happened in Sirisori in July that year, also, killing 6. April Kei Island clashes Another altercation between youths concerning an 'insult to Islam' on 27 March is alleged to have started wide scale violence on the Kei Islands, south east of Ambon, that claimed up to 80 lives during the first weeks of April, with particularly fierce fighting happening in the capital Tual. In this case groups of Catholics faced Muslim Ambonese, but the use of red and white to signify allegiance and wholesale destruction by fire of 30 or so mainly Muslim villages mirrored the riots in Ambon. Fierce reprisal attacks were perpetrated by Muslim mobs against the Protestant town of Elaar Lamagorang on 3 April, claiming at least 36 lives in Kei Kecil. Soldiers recovered 20 bodies from burnt out buildings in Kei Besar and Christian sources reported several instances of alleged kidnapping, the massacre of a priest and children and the deaths of 37 Christians; the Muslim death toll was expected to be much higher with at least 24 killed in the Muslim coastal suburbs of Tual and significant attacks against Muslim villages in Kei Kecil. Approximately 200 Kei Island residents are estimated to have died in three months of fighting and the damaging and destruction of at least 4,000 houses and businesses displaced about 30,000 civilians. The undermanned security forces of the Keis faced logistical difficulties caring for the estimated 13,000 residents that sought refuge at military offices, and another 200 soldiers were deployed from Ambon. The tripling of troop numbers is cited as helping bring the conflict on the Kei Islands to an early end, alongside the actions of elders to promote local adat custom. The violence on the Kei islands was later attributed, in part, to youths and others disregarding the adat teachings of local elders. =Second Ambon riots= On 16 May a gathering of locals from both faiths to celebrate the Moluccan hero, Pattimura, had quickly progressed into a dispute over who was to carry a ceremonial torch, an honor normally reserved for residents from a majority Muslim village that had been offered to Christian villagers as a sign of good-will. A clash between the groups soon followed, and the security forces opened fire on the crowds when they began damaging property again. At least 7 were killed. The torch ceremony was also being used that year to inaugurate a new security force, the Pattimura military command, which would oversee the Maluku province; the event only served to humiliate the military, who were attacked with missiles by both sides after the intervention with live ammunition. The dispute happened days after a peace deal was agreed upon by local leaders of the two faiths, and it was therefore clear that the resentment and violence could not be contained by the formalities of an authority distrusted on both sides after the role of security forces in so many deaths. July and August chaos After a clash of drunken youths in the middle-class Poka suburb of Ambon on 23 July and subsequent heavy handed military intervention, fighting intensified to a war- like scale and lead to the deaths of at least a further 34 in the first four days alone, with Ambon hospitals reporting a shortage of blood for transfusion. The mostly Chinese-owned business district, which had largely been spared up until that point, was targeted and destroyed by arson and the largest shopping complex in Ambon left entirely gutted. In addition, many hundreds of homes and thousands of vehicles were destroyed by arson. On 27 July, three members of a rioting Muslim crowd were killed by police directly outside the Al-Fatah mosque, however few instances of intervention with live fire by security forces were recorded with concrete details. Most agree troops fired directly into the warring crowds, and the Catholic diocese of Ambon officially announced a lack of confidence in the military forces, who it said were supporting the Muslim gangs. The first large-scale massacre of civilians in a house of worship, as would become common in the conflict, was perpetrated by uniformed gunmen on 12 August against local residents taking refuge in a Galala church. The residents were allegedly locked in the Yabok church and fired on by people wearing uniforms of an elite special forces unit, killing around 25 unarmed civilians, including a priest and children, and the bodies were later burned by a Muslim mob. Fighting in Galala had been particularly fierce, claiming another 14 lives in addition to those massacred, however the majority of fighting had been in Ambon City around the Al-Fatah mosque and nearby Maranatha Church, where the city had split into Christian and Muslim enclaves. At least a further 98 had died during early and mid August, including all civilians murdered in Galala and 15 killed in Batu Merah on 10 August, however the deployment of one Marine and two Army battalions to Maluku allowed for some calm to return by 16 August. Small war-like battles between well organised gangs of the rival faiths took place on a daily basis during late August and September, claiming more lives, including one soldier and at least 8 gang members who had been attacking a church on 10 September. In the period between the first riots in Ambon and September 1999, humanitarian organisation Kontras estimated 1,349 had died in communal fighting and that tens of thousands had been displaced to ad hoc refugee centres or other provinces. =Third Ambon riots= During the final quarter of 1999 there had been several large confrontations in the suburbs of Ambon City, the largest claiming 38 lives on 26 November, again around the districts of Mardika. Most of the casualties the result of bullet wounds caused by firearms that only the security forces had access to and, in response, three battalions of military forces were to be withdrawn from Maluku that December and replaced with others that were believed to be not as potentially biased. On 7 December, the governor of Maluku announced aloud the Declaration of Refraining from Violence and Ending the Conflict, signed by senior leaders of all faiths, however no Moluccan religious leaders signed or were party to the drafting of the document. Massive riots again ignited in Ambon City and surrounding districts on 26 December, and lasted many days, following reports that a 14-year-old Muslim pedestrian was struck by a Christian driver. The intense fighting heralded the widespread use of firearms and home-made bombs by civilian gangs, and claimed at least 68 lives and caused the destruction of the symbolic Silo Church in Ambon City on 26 December. Unverified Christian sources state the Silo Church was attacked during a night prayer session by Muslim militants and the security forces were complicit with the attackers; 39 Christians defending the building suffered bullet wounds, mostly from military weapons, and a local fire engine that had arrived to save the structure was fired upon also. The December confrontations saw the first specific targeting of security forces personnel, claiming the lives of at least 3 members. Sustained sniper fire was recorded originating from buildings nearby the demarcation line separating the two communities in Ambon City and buildings in the commercial district were shelled by Saladin-class armored vehicles of the Indonesian Army to suppress the sniper fire. Further sniper fire targeting ships ferrying displaced people across Ambon Bay to Pattimura Airport was also reported, while other witnesses described security forces both launching mortar attacks and sustained fire with automatic weapons against specific suburbs in Ambon City, mostly by individual troops acting in a partisan manner. Some of the sniper fire has been attributed to Christian Brimob personnel, angered by the destruction of the Silo church, attacking Muslim targets. Responsibility for security in Maluku province was officially given to the Indonesian military on 29 December 1999, allowing for the army to conduct broader searches and apprehend suspects. Violence on Seram and Buru Islands Up to 42 people were killed on neighbouring Seram Island over three days during a raid by Muslim militias on the predominantly Christian town of Alang Asaudi on 3 December, and government forces were criticized for not preventing such a high number of casualties. On 4 January 2000, at least 17 were killed by live ammunition as police opened fire on clashing mobs in Masohi, a port town on Ceram Island, where several hundred houses were also destroyed by arson. A significant number of units were transferred from Ambon the weeks prior to contain the violence, but were largely ineffective in preventing further attacks on property. Buru Island saw a period of extreme violence between rival groups around Christmas and Ramadan, claiming at least 43 lives on 23 December alone. A total of 165 are believed to have been killed over several weeks, including 117 Christians, and around 250 houses were destroyed by arson during island- wide fighting started by a scuffle outside a plywood factory. Intervention by security forces during the violence on the island was initially minimal and significant number of Buru residents were reported missing in the weeks after the December violence, most taking refuge in the densely forested interior of the island, and the Indonesian military distributed leaflets urging them to return to their villages. Incidents of forced conversion and atrocities such as forced circumcision and the murder of entire families who resisted conversion caused the almost complete displacement of the Christian population of Buru by mid-2000, following the destruction of 17 Catholic and an unknown number of Protestant churches. Following the Malino agreement, bombing attacks with more powerful explosives became more common in Maluku province. Two of the more significant attacks included the detonation of an improvised explosive device at a stadium in Ambon City that claimed the lives of 4 young women on 4 September 2002, and the detonation of a bomb that had been thrown into a crowd gathered outside an Ambon City hotel and karaoke bar, which killed 4 and wounded 58, on 3 April 2002. Timeline of conflict in North Maluku =Initial confrontations= North Maluku had been largely peaceful until 18 August 1999, inauguration of the new Malifut sub-district provoked the destruction of two Pagu mixed-faith villages on the same day. Several people were killed as Kao residents of both faiths and Makianese Muslim migrants fought for three days, and the majority of sources state that the violence had started with the invasion of Sosol, one of the two villages destroyed by the Makianese gang. A team of leaders was tasked with securing peace by the regional government, however no modifications were made to the redistricting decision and tension remained. Further attacks in Malifut On 24 October, the Makianese allegedly attacked again deeper into Kao lands, though this is disputed by some Makianese, and in counter-attack a 5,000-strong movement of Kao burnt down all 16 of the Makianese villages in the contested Malifut subdistrict. The mixed-faith Kao stressed the non- religious nature of the two battles and took liberties to avoid desecrating any mosques or schools; only 3 people were killed in the fighting, however there was massive destruction to Makianese property and anywhere up to 16,000 Makianese, almost all of those in the subdistrict, fled to Ternate and other areas. November riots in Tidore and Ternate A large number of displaced Makianese had also fled to Tidore, an island with a significant Muslim majority. In the following weeks a fake letter detailing plans for the forced removal of Makianese from Halmahera with alleged input from the local Protestant institutions was distributed in the Muslim communities of Ternate and Tidore, inflaming tensions and pressuring local officials to seek an explanation from Christian leaders. In hindsight the document was an act of blatant provocation likely forged by Makianese bureaucrats, however on 3 November the Reverend Riskotta was viciously murdered by a Muslim mob in Tidore while attending a meeting to discuss concerns with the officials, having been escorted there by police. No other Christian leaders had attended out of fear for their safety, and immediately after the Reverend's murder the gathered crowd turned on local Christian people and property, killing 8 more people, and burning 3 churches and some 260 houses in an island wide riot. On 6 November, a several-hundred strong Muslim gang, led by local Makianese political elite and thought to be mostly Makianese refugees, raged through Ternate attacking the Christian minority there also. The police forces of Ternate were only able to guard their own institutions from attack, yet the traditional guards of the Sultan of Ternate, mostly composed of local Ternate Muslims, were particularly effective at protecting the local Christian population from attack. The Sultan's guard had both established secure perimeters around areas of the city, including the mostly Chinese-owned business district, and physically stood between the mobs and possible victims in some cases and were later commended for preventing a potential massacre. At least 4 people died, however, and the Indonesian Navy later evacuated the several thousand Christian residents of both islands to Bintung and Manado in North Sulawesi. Tension in central Halmahera In the days following the Ternate riots, Muslim provocateurs are alleged to have directed attacks against Christian civilians in the sub-districts of Payahe and West Gane, both home to significant populations of Makianese. There were Christian casualties in Lola village, including the death of a pastor. Several thousand residents were displaced to Tobelo in northern Halmahera. The targeting of churches for destruction and rumors that a number of children were killed by the Makianese fighters, along with descriptions of the security forces' inability to protect local Christians in Tidore and Ternate, prompted Halmahera residents to construct homemade weapons to defend themselves. Distrust by Christians was mostly directed at Makianese and Ternate migrants in Tobelo, as was aired to a political delegation including the Sultan of Ternate and the interim governor sent to Tobelo on 7 December, however rumors of a \\"bloody Christmas\\" or \\"bloody Ramadan\\" to purge the opposing faith from Halmahera were spread through both communities and intensified the feeling that further violence was inevitable. =Post-Christmas violence in Halmahera= Impact of the conflict =Child soldiers= During the conflict several thousand child soldiers fought, unofficially, in the civilian militia of both sides; a significant number of the children that fought were either orphaned or displaced by earlier fighting, and felt an obligation to take up arms willingly to protect or avenge their family and religion. Referred colloquially to as \\"pasukan agas\\" after a sandfly, around two to four thousand children aged as young as seven are believed to have taken part in the violence, mostly boys armed with petrol bombs and directed to burn down property of the opposite side or given homemade bombs that were thrown at rival militia members and security forces. Older minors perpetrated armed assaults against rival forces or civilian targets, while both elementary and secondary school children helped construct the homemade weapons that were predominant in the first year of the conflict. =Genital mutilation= A significant number of Christian Moluccans, both female and male, were subjected to forced conversion entailing circumcision, allegedly by Muslim agitants. The majority of the 3,928 reported forced genital mutilation cases in Maluku occurred in the years 2000 and 2001, with several mass forced circumcisions alleged to have been perpetrated on the islands of Kesui and Teor, and many of the victims suffered complications from the wounds, requiring later emergency treatment. Accounts describe that several militia fighters were also subjected to brutal, non-religious penis removal. A specific incident of mass mutilation was recorded as taking place in the east Seram village of Tanah Baru, when several hundred Catholic villagers of both sexes were taken as prisoners to a local mosque. The captives, ranging in age from 6 to the elderly and including pregnant women, were crudely circumcised with shared razors and left with open wounds. An investigation following the incident surveyed 405 residents and confirmed the circumcisions were done under duress, and 648 Christians were later evacuated from the island. Witnesses from other villages described to Christian researchers several instances of the village Christian population, aged 6 and upwards, being forcibly circumcised with unclean implements. Ritual female circumcision is not traditionally practised in Maluku or wider Indonesia.

Founded in 1954, the BHC supports ongoing research among its members and holds conferences to bring together business and economic historians. It also publishes a quarterly academic journal, Enterprise & Society, along with selected papers from its annual meetings via BEH On-Line. History The BHC was founded in 1954 as a series of meetings held at Northwestern University. Richard C. Overton, an American railroad historian, was the first president of the BHC. As cliometricians began dominating economic historian with quantitative methods, other scholars sought to retain the atheoretical, qualitative take on scholarship. The group of economic and business historians met again in 1956, 1958, and 1971, transforming itself into a full professional organization. According to Naomi Lamoreaux of Yale University, the BHC today is composed mainly of historians, while the Economic History Association of economists. Today, approximately 30 percent of its membership resides outside North America. This reflects the increasingly global nature of the work of business history.

Switzer, 562 U.S. 521 (2011), is a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the route through which a prisoner may obtain biological DNA material for testing to challenge his conviction; whether through a civil rights suit or a habeas corpus petition. A majority of the Court held that the civil rights path was the appropriate path.  Background  Henry Skinner was convicted of murdering his girlfriend in 1995, and sentenced to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) affirmed.http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/09-10/09-9000_Respondent.pdf On March 26, 1998, Skinner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Texas courts. It was subsequently dismissed as untimely and the CCA affirmed. In 1999, he filed a federal habeas petition. At the same time, he began pushing for DNA testing of materials in the original case by the District Attorney's office. The testing was conducted by a private office and resulted in mixed results; however Skinner wanted what he called 'independent' testing.http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/09-10/09-9000_Petitioner.pdf He filed claims in Texas court for his own DNA testing but his attempts did not succeed. He also filed a second successive federal habeas petition demanding DNA testing of all evidence; this was an independent claim as well as a basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel (his attorney did not request DNA testing of certain evidence at trial). A federal magistrate held a hearing, rejected the petition, which a district judge eventually confirmed. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court entered a stay of execution and granted a writ of certiorari to hear the case.https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/052410zor.pdf Oral Arguments The Court heard oral arguments on October 13, 2010. The Court focused the questioning on the boundary between habeas claims and ¬ß1983 claims (violations of civil rights). Robert C. Owen, attorney for Skinner, started by narrowing the scope of their appeal to seeking \\"only access to evidence for DNA testing\\". Justice Alito was skeptical of the path Skinner was using in order to get the DNA testing. He stated that it was just a backdoor attempt \\"in overturning [a prisoner's] conviction\\".https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-9000.pdf Owen then turned to practical considerations of the case, emphasizing that there would be no flood of ¬ß1983 cases. He relied on evidence from multiple Courts of Appeal to demonstrate that no such rush would occur. As Owen concluded his argument, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer attacked Skinner's original complaint. After Owen concluded, Gregory S. Coleman, arguing for District Attorney Lynn Switzer, opened by stating that Skinner's case was just a Brady claim about access to material. Justice Breyer then moved the focus to the question of a substantive civil right: \\"what Skinner wants is the DNA. He thinks it's going to be exculpatory. He doesn't know until he gets it.\\" Coleman still challenged whether this is the proper subject of a habeas corpus claim. Justices further questioned where the distinction between the two types of claims (civil rights violations and habeas) lay. Hypotheticals to test this distinction drew criticism from Justice Kennedy. Coleman then concluded by arguing that the only way Skinner could make a claim is to argue the DNA testing law of Texas is \\"unconstitutional\\" not a habeas claim.  Opinion of the Court  In a 6 to 3 decision delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction existed over Skinner‚Äôs complaint, and that his claim was cognizable under ¬ß1983. Justices Thomas, Kennedy and Alito dissented.Text of Decision  See also  * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 561  References  External links SCOTUSBlog Case Page for Skinner v.

It lasted from 11 July 1967 until 18 March 1969, when British control was re-established. Background On 27 February 1967, Britain granted the territory of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla the status of \\"associated state\\", with its own constitution and a considerable degree of self-government. Many Anguillans strenuously objected to the continuing political subservience to Saint Kitts, and on 30 May (known as Anguilla Day), the Saint Kitts police were evicted from the island.David X. Noack: Die abtr√ºnnige Republik Anguilla, amerika21.de 2016-09-27. Retrieved on 2017-04-23. The provisional government requested United States administration, which was declined. On 11 July 1967, a referendum on Anguilla's secession from the fledgling state was held. The results were 1,813 votes for secession and 5 against. A declaration of independence (written mainly by Harvard Law professor Roger Fisher) was read publicly by Walter Hodge. A separate legislative council was immediately established. Peter Adams served as the first Chairman of the Anguilla Island Council, but when he agreed to take Anguilla back to St. Kitts, he was deposed and replaced by Ronald Webster. In December 1967, two members of Britain's Parliament worked out an interim agreement by which for one year a British official would exercise basic administrative authority along with the Anguilla Council. Tony Lee took the position on 8 January 1968, but by the end of the term, no agreement had been reached on the long-term future of the island's governance. Declaration of republic On 6 February 1969, Anguilla held a second referendum resulting in a vote of 1,739 to 4 against returning to association with Saint Kitts. The next day Anguilla declared itself an independent republic. Webster once again served as Chairman. A new British envoy, William Whitlock, arrived on 11 March 1969 with a proposal for a new interim British administration. He was quickly expelled at gunpoint. Restoration of British control On 18 March 1969, a contingent of 300 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, plus 22 London Metropolitan Police peacefully landed by helicopter on the island from 2 frigates, ostensibly to \\"restore order\\". Webster fled the island, eventually addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, arguing that Anguilla should have the right to self-determination. Tony Lee was dismissed, while Lord Caradon and Webster drew up a Seven Point Declaration. Effectively, Anguilla was allowed to secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis, although it was not until 19 December 1980 that Anguilla formally disassociated itself from Saint Kitts and became a separate British dependency. While Saint Kitts and Nevis went on to gain full independence from the UK in 1983, Anguilla remains a British overseas territory.

He likes helping his friends and solving problems. * Herman (voiced by Richard Ian Cox) is a blue hermit crab with an immense infatuation with \\"alien\\" artifacts and \\"paranormal\\" events. He has a crush on a classmate Hurly. * Connie is a seasnail who comes from a wealthy family, but decided to work at the Charming Clam Inn, so she could do more than rely on her parents' money. =Recurring characters= *Dr. Shell (voiced by Lee Tockar) is a brilliant yet scatter-brained riversnail inventor and a guest in the Charming Clam ever since it was set up and has become something of a permanent resident there. He has traveled widely across the seas in search of inspiration but not interested in making money, only the social benefits his inventions bring to others. *Mama Clam (voiced by Ellen Kenndy) is a magnolia mollusk clam who lives and runs the Charming Clam Inn with her husband and three children. She is a cool-headed wife and mother who is not easily daunted by hardship or challenges. Raised in the cut-throat, fast-paced Shell City, Mama Clam is savvy, a careful planner who always seems to know the perfect solution to a problem. At home, Mama prefers to take a back seat and to let her husband run the household. However, being a shrewd housewife, she knows exactly how to manipulate Papa into doing her bidding. Mama is a total failure when it comes to cooking, yet she remains oblivious to the dire effects of her cooking, made worse by the fact that everyone in the family tries to hide it for fear of hurting her feelings.

He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the New York Jets in 2010. He played college football at Hawaii. College career Upon completing his high school career, Satele decided to attend his family's alma mater, the University of Hawaii, instead of Oregon State, Utah and Notre Dame. During his first year at Hawaii, in 2005, Satele sat out for the season. The following year, Satele played in nine games for the Warriors as a linebacker and as a special teamer.

Satele submitted a medical exemption application to the NCAA in order to attempt a comeback with the Warriors in 2010 however, the application was denied as the NCAA determined that Satele did not have the proper documentation to prove he redshirted the 2005 season due to injury.

Ethnomusicology, Vol. 30, No. 2 His research and life's work included the collection, transcription and analysis of the melodies, texts and culture of Yiddish folk song, wordless melodies (nigunim), East European Jewish instrumental music for both dancing and listening (klezmer music), Purim plays (Yiddish: ◊§◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù-◊©◊§◊ô◊ú / purim- shpil), and exploration of the relationship between East European Jewish and Ukrainian traditional music. Life Beregovsky was born into the family of a Jewish parochial primary school (kheyder) teacher in the village of Termakhovka, then in the Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire. As a child he participated as a boy-chorister in a local synagogue. He studied in the conservatories of Kiev (composition and cello in 1915‚Äì1920) and Petrograd (1922‚Äì1924). He also worked as a vocal coach in Jewish orphanages in Petrograd and Moscow under Joel Engel. From 1928‚Äì1936 he was the head of Musical Folklore section of the Institute for Jewish Proletarian Arts of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. From 1936‚Äì1949 he was a researcher in the Institute for Language and Literature, head of the Office of Folklore of the Jewish Arts Section of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, and head of the Office for Musical Ethnography. He was a teacher in the Kiev Conservatory from 1947, in the sections of music theory and folklore). From roughly 1929 to 1947, Beregovsky made ethnographic trips collecting secular Jewish music in various parts of Soviet Ukraine. His works make up the largest and most carefully notated collection of its kind in pre-WWII and early postwar Europe. Mark Slobin, who arranged and republished much of Beregovsky's collection in the United States, has said in an interview that Beregovsky \\"was the only person to do this for Yiddish music, and he was an excellent ethnomusicologist.\\"http://www.klezmershack.com/articles/robinson/010830.slobin.html He made roughly 2,000 field recordings on 700 phonograph cylinders.http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Beregovskii_Moisei_Iakovlevich In 1944, Beregovsky received his Ph.D. from the Moscow Conservatory, writing his dissertation on the topic of Jewish instrumental folk music. He worked to meticulously expand the work of previous Eastern European Jewish musicologists and ethnographers such as A.Z. Idelsohn, Yoel Engel, S. An-Sky, and Y.L. Cahan.p.253-4 \\"A Fresh Look at Beregovsky's Folk Music Research\\" by Mark Slobin.

He continued his research during the period of Stalinist repression of the 1930s-50s, under what must have been great ideological pressure, as state- funded musical research in the Soviet Union necessarily followed Marxist- Leninist lines.http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Music/Study_of_Jewish_Music The institute itself was later closed down and many of its members exiled and disgraced. In 1949, Beregovsky's department was closed and he was arrested in 1950 at the height of Joseph Stalin‚Äôs anti-Semitic campaign and sent to Tayshet, in the Irkutsk region, where he remained from 1951 to 1955. He was released and 'rehabilitated' in 1956. He returned to Kiev, where he lived the rest of his life. Beregovsky's archive of wax cylinders, many from the pre-WWI Jewish Ethnographic Expeditions directed by Sh. Ansky, was thought by many to have been destroyed during World War II, but was found to be in the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine in Kyiv/Kiev in the 1990s. Some of Beregovsky's most significant work and collections have been published in English by American ethnomusicologist Mark Slobin, beginning in 1982 with Old Jewish Folk Music (University of Pennsylvania Press), followed by a more expansive volume in 2001 devoted to Beregovsky's study of the klezmer instrumental tradition, Jewish Instrumental Folk Music (Syracuse Univ Press), translated by Michael Alpert and Slobin, annotated by Alpert, and edited by Slobin, Robert Rothstein and Alpert. The latter has been reissued in a 2015 second edition, extensively revised by Kurt Bjorling with annotations by Bjorling and Alpert, including the restoration of an entire chapter of text missing in the 2001 edition.

Early life von Gu√©rard was born on 29 December 1863 at Koblenz, as the son of Bernhard von Gu√©rard (1825‚Äì1882), Obergerichtsprokurator and his wife Eleonore (1829‚Äì1905) n√©e Kehrmann. The family of his father had emigrated from Lorraine in the 18th century, thus the French name. He studied jurisprudence and political sciences and then joined the Prussian civil service. From 1898 to 1905 he was Landrat at Mondschau, and then worked at the Oberpr√§sidium Koblenz, the administrative center of the Prussian Rhine Province. He married Hedwig Mooren (1871‚Äì1950) at D√ºsseldorf in 1891. They had two sons and two daughters. Political career He was a member of the Reichstag from 1920 to 1930 for the Zentrum. Initially considered part of the conservative wing of the party, he was active on subjects such as the occupied territories as well as judicial and transport issues. Following the 1924 elections, he argued in favour of a coalition with the right-wing German National People's Party (DNVP). However, when he took up the position of executive vice-chair of his party's Reichstag group in May 1926, he became more left-wing oriented. In December 1927, he became chairman of the Zentrum group and in this function helped bring about the demise of the third government of Wilhelm Marx. He then became Minister of Transport and for the Occupied Territories in the cabinet of Hermann M√ºller in 1928. During a reshuffle he became Minister of Justice. Although he was considered an opponent of Heinrich Br√ºning, Theodor von Gu√©rard was again appointed Minister of Transport in 1930 under Br√ºning's chancellorship. On the behest of president Paul von Hindenburg, Theodor von Gu√©rard left the government in autumn of 1931. This ended his political career. He died in Ahaus (Westphalia) on 21 July 1943.

Its species name (\\"bad-smelling\\") refers to its unpleasant smell. It was previously named M. morkorra (A. Rich) and M. cordata (Cogn.) The plant grows in forest edges and similar habitats (including disturbed and cultivated land), woodland, and wooded grassland. Its leaves are wrinkled, heart-shaped with irregular edges, up to 18 cm wide. The flowers are yellow to yellow- orange. The fruit is a prolate spheroid, 3.5‚Äì7.5 cm long and 2.5‚Äì5 cm wide, bright orange and covered with soft spines. When fully ripe it splits from the bottom into three valves, exposing a cluster of black seeds, individually covered by a bright red, sticky, sweet pulp. The plant has perennial tuberous roots. Local names for the plant include concombre sauvage (French for \\"wild cucumber\\"), nyanya-nua, sœÉprœÉpœÉ, kakle, awoduan (\\"snake food\\"), aoasongo, gaayama, nan√Øa, n-gessannia, boobo, bobonowron, vovol√©, vovon√© vono, hepa, √¨s√∫g≈´, alu-osi, akb‚Äôan‚Äôudene, ej√¨nr√¨n, tsekiri, and a-bos-a-wir. Uses =Food= Remains of a ripe fruit, where the pericarp splits into three valves The leaves have a bitter taste, but are eaten in Gabon and Malawi. The fruit are edible and are consumed in various countries, including Ghana, Gabon, Sudan, and Tanganyika. The root is considered edible in Sudan. =Folk medicine= Like its relative M. charantia, the plant contains a number of bioactive compounds, including sitosteryl glucoside, 5,25-stigmastadien-3Œ≤-yl glucoside, and 1Œ≤-hydroxyfriedel-6-en-3-one, and several cucurbitane-type triterpenoid derivatives. Digestive disorders In Tanganika, young leaves are taken for stomachache and the root is considered a purgative. The Edo of Nigeria drink leaf sap for intestinal disorders. The Igbo take it for iba ozi. In Gabon, the leaves are used as emetic and for enemas. The leaf is also as used against roundworm. Pain relief The leaf sap is used to treat severe headache and earache. In Malawi, headache is treated by binding the head with the plant stem. Reproduction In the Ivory Coast a preparation of the leaves is used as an aphrodisiac and is taken by women as an emmenagogue and as childbirth helper. In Uganda, tea from leaves or roots is used as an abortifacient and an ecbolic. Skin conditions In the Ivory Coast, a leaf-decoction is used to treat smallpox. The root is used in Tanganyika to wash small children and mothers' breasts. In South Africa, a root decoction with other plants is taken for boils. Snake bites The inflammation caused by the venom of the spitting cobra, (Naja nigrocollis) can be prevented by promptly rubbing the skin with crushed leaves and chewing them. The leaf sap is drunk to treat snakebite. Other conditions The leaf sap is used to stop nose bleeding. In Tanganyika, the young leaves are used to treat dropsy and malaria. =Other uses= Longitudinal section through unripe fruit In Malawi, the fruit is used as bait to trap birds. In Gabon, leaves are soaked, dried in the sun, and used to stuff cushions. In Tanganyika, the fruit pulp is believed to be poisonous to weevils, moths, and ants and is used as an insect repellent. The plant's presence is believed to be an indicator that the soil is appropriate for planting cocoa tree.

On its northeasternmost point is the Tabon Cave complex also dubbed as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization. There is no reason not to believe that the Tabon Man and the early humans whose remains were found in the cave also roamed Panitian 20,000 to 60,000 years ago. Panitian is a barangay in the municipality of Quezon of the province of Palawan, established through Republic Act (R.A.) No. 2593 enacted on June 21, 1959.Republic Act No. 2593 - An Act Creating Certain Barrios in the Province of Palawan, http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno2593.html Panitian was originally a sitio in Quezon, Palawan established by Zambal migrants coming from the northern municipalities of Zambales in 1956 through the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) or Republic Act 1160 of President Ramon Magsaysay in 1954. The enactment of R.A. 2593 made Panitian the largest barangay of Quezon, Palawan with the inclusion of other sitios under its jurisdiction such as Odiong, Malatgao, Tagpisa, Candis and Napwaran. Due to its enormous size, Panitian allowed Sitio Malatgao to separate and form another barangay before the Philippine barangay elections of 1982. Panitian is bordered on the west by Bgy. Malatgao, on the east by the town proper of Quezon, on the south by the municipality of Sofronio Espa√±ola, and on the north by the South China Sea. Located on Panitian's northeasternmost point is the Tabon Cave complex, which is known as the Cradle of Philippine Civilization. Through NARRA or R.A. 1160, agricultural land distribution and resettlement was carried out by encouraging migration of settlers to open new lands for farming. In Southern Palawan, there was a total of 27 public land subdivisions consisting 20,855 lots of eight hectares per lot that was made available for new settlers (James 1979, p. 29).James, W. E. 1979. An Economic Analysis of Public Land Settlement Alternatives in the Philippines. University of Hawaii. London: University Microfilms International These homestead lands now comprised the municipality of Narra, Palawan, some barangays of Aborlan and the barangays of Panitian and Malatgao of the municipality of Quezon. Those who migrated to these resettlement areas were Ilocanos from Cagayan Valley (especially in Isabela), the Ilonggos from Panay and Guimaras, Negros, Sultan Kudarat, South Cotabato and North Cotabato and the Sambals from the northern municipalities of Zambales, particularly Masinloc, Candelaria and Santa Cruz. Pioneering stage It is common for big bats like these in Panitian to hang from one's backyard fruit tree like a caimito or a santol tree. On April 5, 1956, the Zambal migrants, led by an enthusiastic snake hunter and a fiercely built man by the name of Patok, reached Panitian as a jungle, located nine kilometers south of the town of Quezon. The jungle was a habitat of Palawan fruit bats, also known as megabats or \\"paniki\\", from which the new inhabitants derived its name. It was first called \\"Panikian\\", or land of megabats or \\"paniki\\", and later renamed as Panitian. Until the early 1990s, the population of Panitian are treated with a great spectacle starting fifteen to thirty minutes before dusk of thousands of flying megabats blackening the skies migrating towards Puting Bato (towards the direction of Sitio Nali). The Sunda pangolin, also called malintong in Palawan, or balentong among the Panitian Zambals, is one of the interesting animals seen in Panitian.The Zambals were given homestead land south of the Municipality of Quezon to be developed for agriculture or into rice farmlands. Eighty to ninety percent of the new settlers received assistance from the government in the form of housing, moving and transportation, food rations for about fifteen months, work animal, farm implements, land clearing and planting materials (James, p. 97). Initially, the Zambals occupied the flat lands in Sitios Sarangsang, Tapsan, Nali and the barangay proper alongside the Panitian River. The Zambals later on came in contact with the friendly Palawans (natives of Palawan) in Sitio Gugnan in 1960s headed by its village chieftain by the name of Ablo. Some of the Zambals purchased lands from the Palawans who had informal claims on some of the arable properties in Gugnan. Others however directly filed land ownership application at the Bureau of Lands District Office in Puerto Princesa City. With the news of land ownership reaching home in Zambales, new waves of Zambal migrants followed. Many of them were able to become landowners, a title that had eluded them in Zambales, acquiring their own farm lands in Sitios Tagpisa, Nali, Tagbanaba and Gugnan despite the absence of the government subsidies the original homesteaders received. More than thirty percent however returned to Zambales after finding Palawan a difficult place to live due to the absence of basic infrastructure, presence of malaria, and the lack of community services that they were accustomed to in the home province. Many Ilonggo-speaking migrants joined the Zambals in Panitian starting in the 1970s through Sitio Odiong, an area accessible by boats. The Ilonggo migrants were usually fisherfolk coming from other parts of Quezon, Palawan. Many Ilonggos also migrated through Malatgao who then were able to acquire properties in outlying sitios of Panitian. Sitios Palawans catch them by simply hanging a stick covered with a sticky sap of pakak tree on their night time roosting place located high on treetops. They usually roost by the thousands in just one place. Excluding the barrio-proper of Panitian, the barangay is subdivided into the following sitios: #Aluluway #Candis #Gugnan #Kalatabog #Kambing #Marirong #Nabugsuan #Nali #Odiong #Sarangsang #Sidanao #Tabud #Tagbanaba #Tagpisa #Tapsan #Tugpa Economic growth A blue-naped parrot (Tanygnathus lucionensis), locally known as pikoy, is a rare species of birds found in Panitian sitios like Gugnan, Kambing, Tugpa and Kalatabog.The barangay flourished under the leadership of Barangay Captain Pablo Elefane who served as its barrio captain from the 1960s until 1982. He was ably assisted by Councilor David E. Rombaua who handled most of the daily affairs of Panitian, on behalf of the barangay captain whose residence was in Sitio Sarangsang. By 1980, notwithstanding the shortage of government support infrastructure such as farm to market roads, irrigation system and credit facilities, Panitian was on its way to the maturity stage of development with sustained growth characterized by the growing urbanization of the barrio proper, increased trade activities and availability of basic community services such as school buildings, a rural health unit, a public market, and barangay recreational facilities. This growth is attributed primarily to four important factors. First, the optimism and pride of settlers on their land ownership and the bayanihan system, or a sense of community that exists among the local population. Second, there are alternative livelihood opportunities like open-ocean fishing in South China Sea, backyard animal raising and vegetable production, and small cottage industries such as fish drying and nipa weaving. A pump boat, used to be the main transport utility in Panitian passing the route Panitian River - bucana - Tabon Cave - Poblacion Quezon pier. Third, Panitian was endowed with a clean flowing river, the Panitian River, which aside from its invaluable recreational importance served as Panitian's gateway to the poblacion and the South China Sea providing an essential navigational channel for small motorized fishing boats and pumpboats carrying passengers and cargo to and from the municipality of Quezon. Lastly, the presence of the Philippine Marines starting around 1976 contributed significantly to the local economy as their salaries ensure a trickle effect on the local commerce. The barrio proper was an effective center of economic activities for the local population and residents of outlying sitios. At its peak, there were at least six ricemills operating simultaneously in Panitian. It was common then to see Palawan natives, who customarily walk in a single line one after another, in G-strings or patadyong coming to Panitian to sell their crafts and to manglan or purchase sardines, SSS (tobacco), and candy treats for their kids. Panitian continued to be a vibrant community until the mid-1980s. This economic vibrancy is best showcased by its celebration of the barangay fiesta or festival held over a period of three days, from April 3 to 5 of each year. The fiesta is filled with sports competitions and betting games, non-stop plaza fair activities, and evening barrio dance and coronation events. Ambulant vendors from other municipalities build temporary nipa stalls around the barangay plaza to sell clothing and household amenities or as halo- halo and food stalls starting as early as the last week of March. The fiesta also attracted traveling circus acts and magicians from Luzon who build their flying trapeze days in advance. Economic stagnation Entrance to Tabon Caves as seen from a pumpboat on the way to Quezon from Panitian.The Palawan Integrated Area Development Project or Program (PIADP) of 1979 which had evolved into a legislated government agency, the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD) is now on its fifth decade.Republic Act No. 7611, Section 20, Conversion of PIADPO to PCSD After all these years, Panitian's economy appeared to have taken a different course, it receded rather than develop or advance and its flora and fauna are deteriorating rapidly. The promise of sustainable development had instead broken the momentum of growth sustained during the first 25 years of Panitian's existence. All the gains during its pioneering and consolidation stages (community development stages, Nelson 1973)Nelson, M. 1973. The Development of Tropical Lands: Policy Issues in Latin America. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins. were ignored when PIADP prescribed the generic pills of integrated development in this strategic section of southern Palawan whose side-effect was worse than the initial diagnosis. Unconcerned with the impact on the local economy of Panitian, the government through PIADP developed a road connecting the Municipality of Rizal to Quezon by-passing Panitian - a development faux pas whose adverse impact killed the thriving commerce in the barrio resulting to extreme poverty and economic dislocation of its population. Jeepneys which had morning and afternoon trips to the poblacion had effectively stopped serving the barrio proper. Tricycles would only agree to bring local commuters to the barrio at a special rate. Lakad-system returned and the carusa or the carabao- pulled carriage had made a comeback. Local passengers had to walk to the road junction, about four kilometers from the Panitian public market, to get a ride going to the poblacion, that is if they are lucky enough to catch a jeepney with highly irregular two-trip daily schedules. Otherwise, it would be better to walk five more kilometers to reach the town center, since one had already walked the initial four kilometers anyway. Local agricultural produce had to be brought to the junction using the carusa before reaching the town market, adding a layer of transport cost which further reduced farm incomes as a result. Land values in the barrio proper suddenly nosedived. Commercial activities had slowly dwindled and one after another sari-sari stores closed shops. Even backyard raised vegetables that used to be traded in the public market had slowly disappeared. Fishermen who usually bring their catch into the Panitian public market were forced to go to the poblacion leaving the local residents with fewer food choices on their daily diet. The same happened with agricultural products coming from Tagbanaba, Tapsan, Sarangsang, Nali and Gugnan. Ironically, the road project which was intended to bring about economic development had caused instead the very opposite putting the already working local market structures in disarray. It altered the marketing flow and so as the socio-economic growth patterns, the pre-requisites for an agrarian resettlement community to advance from the consolidation stage to maturity stage (Nelson 1973). In effect, the so-called planners of PIADP denied Panitian - a government-assisted resettlement community, from achieving its ultimate resettlement goal, negating the more than twenty years of hardship and perseverance of its community-conscious residents. Arguably, the PIADP people, intentionally or unintentionally, blindsided the donors of this negative impact to secure their continued funding under Phase II while working on their tenure and mandates to become a law by R.A. 7611 (SEP Law , Sec. 20). There were delays and problems on project benefit monitoring and evaluation system according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Project Completion Report.Asian Development Bank, PCR:PHI 21049. 2001. Project Completion Report on the Second Palawan Integrated Area Development Project (Loans 1033(SF)/1034-PHI) in the Philippines, p. 8 Apparent reasons why the program's ramification and the adverse socio-economic impact on Panitian were not given attention. The advocacy to the creation of PCSD through legislation was self-serving. PCSD was primarily a way to guarantee continued employment of personnel working at PIADP - a foreign assisted project that was about to end. The need for its functional roles can be argued as simply rhetorical, as they were just a duplication of already existing government agencies. PCSD's \\"integrated area development\\" or \\"sustainable development\\" doomed the local economy of the then thriving barrio - the largest rural economy south of Quezon. Apparently, social and economic development concerns had taken the backseat - a large contrast to the direct government intervention and concern given to the original homesteaders during the pioneering stage of Panitian. Environmental protection, cultural preservation and ancestral domains of tribes, and more government controls are the current priorities under R.A. 7611. This Act is a powerful tool that could be easily abused as a vehicle for political patronage as can be gleaned from the current structure and the \\"proclamations\\" that PCSD decrees affecting many aspects of life of the unwary rural Palaweno.Administrative Orders/PCSD Proclamations/Memorandum Circulars, http://www.pcsd.ph/resolutions/resolutions/admin/index.htm The principles of sustainable development are clear, however, the current hands-on policies and actions or the manner by which \\"development\\" is approached appears to be a new model, the theoretical foundations thus require more studies. The Panitian River of the old days used to be a playground and an important navigational channel, but has been damaged under PCSD's management. Local issues on environment, biodiversity, and gender Under PCSD's management, quarrying which provides the needed sands and gravel for the so-called sustainable development initiatives has been destroying the natural beauty of Panitian River. Exacerbated by the dam built upstream for PIADP's communal irrigation system, the river's recreational and aesthetic value appeared unimportant now, notwithstanding Panitian River's significance in bio-diversity. The river is the habitat of the Panitian ulang ilog (Caridina palawanensis), a species of freshwater shrimp found only in Panitian.Cai, Y. and S. Shokita. 2006. Report on a Collection of Freshwater Shrimps (Crustacea: Decapoda: Caridea) from the Philippines, with Descriptions of Four New Species. The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology. National University of Singapore. Human rights of local residents were often violated by the \\"sustainable development\\" police from out-of-towns as they confiscated chain saws of residents which are important in cutting lumber for many of its village crafts. In a civilized society, such confiscations are given due process at the very least, which is clearly absent on how this powerful agency operates. Instead the local residents felt harassed and intimidated. Nipa weaving which is a home-based craft has been banned by PCSD preventing the rural folks from harvesting the nature's bounty that they had learned how to harvest sustainably for years. This industry is dominated by home-based mothers who have small children to nurture as their way to earn income for their families. The environmental and economic decline of Panitian had caused many residents to search for better opportunities away from the barangay they helped established and developed. Many Panitian residents have relocated to Puerto Princesa City, in search of employment opportunities and new livelihood in the urban center - a cyclic pattern in resettlement programs that James (1979) was weary about (p. 134). Inhabitants Panitian has a total population of about 7,500 subdivided into five ethno-linguistic subgroupings such as the Zambals, Ilonggo, Ilocano, Muslims in Sitio Odiong, and the Palawan minority found in Sitios Gugnan and Kambing. The Zambals consist about half of the population. The Ilongos comprised 35 percent of the residents, the Ilocanos around 10 percent and the Muslims (5%). The Palawan natives are clustered in small villages with a total population of not exceeding than 300 residents.Nipa-weaving, one of the important village crafts in Panitian benefiting not only the nipa-weavers but also the Palawan tribe whose main source of income is the gathering of yantok - an important raw material in this cottage industry. Sources of income and livelihood The main sources of income of the local population are rice farming and fishing. Some of the residents are considered farmers during daytime and fishermen during night time. Many residents are also engaged in crafts including production of \\"pawid\\" and \\"sawali\\" (pandan/nipa and bamboo weaving). Majority of the population are subsistence earners due to the relatively low prices of commodities they produce, inadequate marketing facilities, and unavailability of credits for livelihood projects. Panitian has the largest Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) share among all barangays south of Quezon, even including the Municipality of Rizal with P2.93 million for the calendar year 2010. Community infrastructure Panitian is accessible from the Municipality of Quezon via a dirt road passable to most vehicles and tricycles during the dry months. Most households in the barrio proper are with electricity. The barangay is served by Level I and II water supply system. On September 28, 2009, the government released its largest ever budget for public works in Panitian in the amount of P2.0 million.Department of Public Works and Highway Lump Sum Allocation (Regular Releases), As of December 30, 2010, http://www.dbm.gov.ph/pdafreport2.php?legislator=EJERCITO- ESTRADA%2C+JINGGOY+P..=2009&fund;_type=DPWH&type;=senate&spc;=no This allocation was intended for the construction of flood control system in Panitian. In March 2008, the provincial government had awarded a contract for the construction of waiting sheds in Sitio Tabud and Panitian Proper with a budget of P162,000 per waiting shed. In December 2009, Executive Order No 683 issued by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo authorized the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to issue a Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) containing P2.6 billion Malampaya fund for Palawan. Under this fund is an allotment of P10.7 million for the municipality of Quezon for the improvement of highway junction-Tabud-Panitian Road.

The AN/FPS-6 radar was introduced into service in the late 1950s and served as the principal height-finder radar for the United States for several decades thereafter. It was also used by the Royal Air Force alongside their AMES Type 80s. Built by General Electric, the S-band radar operated on a frequency of 2700 to 2900 MHz. Between 1953 and 1960, about 450 units of the AN/FPS-6 and the mobile AN/MPS-14 version were produced. The AN/FPS-90 and AN/FPS-116 radars were identical to the AN/FPS-6 except for receiver modifications. Operation The radar consisted of an antenna group, a transmitter group, a receiver group, and an ancillary group. Most fixed sites had a remote group, which allowed the control of the radar from inside the operations center. Also located in operations, was the anti- jam receivers. These receivers were fed with raw video from the tower receiver, and output several types of processed video to enable operators to see through jamming. The ancillary group originally consisted of an AN/OA-270 Range Height Indicator (RHI), and then later upgraded to an AN/OA-929 RHI, which displayed the raw or anti-jam video, and allowed the operator to position the azimuth of the antenna. At SAGE sites, the antenna azimuth was selected by command from the Air Division, and the operator could slew the antenna plus or minus ten degrees for fine adjustment. The AN/FPS-90 radar was designated a high-power model, using a QK-338A magnetron and rated at 4.5 MW peak power, versus the QK-327A magnetron at 3.5 MW peak power. The receiver mixer was also modified to handle the larger signal dynamic range. Due to maintenance costs and high failure rates, these radars were all retrofitted to the same magnetron as the AN/FPS-6 by the late 1960s, and were no longer high power. The radar maintained its AN/FPS-90 designation due to the receiver modifications. Everything else was identical.

In the mid-1950s General Electric developed a radar with a search altitude of 100,000 feet and a range of 270 miles. This radar was significant in that it was the first stacked-beam radar to enter into production in the United States. The antenna was fed signals from several feed horns arranged in a vertical stack, producing a series of horizontal beams separated vertically in space. By comparing the returns from the different feeds, altitude information could be determined without the need for a separate height-finder radar. Designed to operate in the L-band at 1250 to 1350 MHz, the radar deployed in late 1959 and the early 1960s. The AN/FPS-7 was used for both air defense and air traffic control in New York, Kansas City, Houston, Spokane, San Antonio, and elsewhere. In the early 1960s a modification called AN/ECP-91 was installed to improve its electronic countermeasure (ECM) capability. About thirty units were produced. Another modification was the AN/FPS-107 which also operated in the L-Band which was manufactured by Westinghouse.

The AN/FPS-20 was a widely used L band early warning and ground- controlled interception radar system employed by the United States Air Force Air Defense Command, the NORAD Pinetree Line in Canada, the U.S. Air force CONAD] in the continental United States, and a variety of other users. The design started life as the Bendix AN/FPS-3 in 1950, was upgraded to the FPS-20, then spawned over a dozen different variants as additional upgrades were applied. The FPS-20 formed the backbone of the US air defense network through the early Cold War with over 200 units deployed. Most FPS-20 sites were replaced by modern equipment in the late 1960s, although a number were turned over to the FAA, modified for air traffic control use, and became ARSR-60s. The first AN/FPS-3 arrived in December 1950, slated for installation at Eniwetok Atoll to control aircraft involved in the atomic bomb tests of early 1951. Over the next few years, 48 FPS-3s were installed to replace older systems in the Lashup Radar Network. The FPS-3 and was also produced as the AN/MPS-7, a mobile version. According to Winkler, the FPS-3 design was developed from the earlier CPS-5CPS-5 at FortWiki.com design by Bell Labs and General Electric.radomes.org disputes the link with the CPS-5, which had a somewhat different antenna as can be seen in the photographs in Winkler's work. This confusion may be due to the language in Bacque, which refers to \\"newly developed AN/FPS-3 long-range radar set\\". The system used two 5J26 magnetrons at 750 kW peak power, operating at 1300 MHz a 400 Hz pulse repetition frequency (prf) and 2 microsecond pulse width.Radar Types The antenna was driven at three fixed speeds of 3.3, 5 or 10 RPM, normally operating at 5. Many of the operating modules were mounted on the rotating platform, with the output signals fed via slip rings to amplifiers and displays at the base of the unit. The FPS-3 was limited to about altitude, which was seen as a limitation in light of new jet-powered bombers known to be in development in the USSR. This led to the development of the AN/GPA-27 add- on unit, increasing the altitude to .The GPA-27 may be the slotted waveguide mounted on the top of the main antenna seen in images of the FPS-20. However, some images show this on radars labeled FPS-3, although this may be before they were renamed. Installations began in 1956.Winkler refers to upgraded units as FPS-3B on page 76, but other sources agree with his own page 33 that these were actually called FPS-3A. New-build units from Bendix with this equipment pre-installed became the AN/FPS-20 in 1957.Winkler does not mention this directly, but notes on page 77 that -3A units were also renamed FPS-20 when receiving updates. Otherwise similar units with an antenna from General Electric were known as the AN/FPS-20B. The slotted-waveguide antenna pictured above the AN/FPS-20 is for the associated IFF system.A high-resolution Slotted-waveguide IFF antenna for the AN/FPS-3 radar by J.Y. Wong 1957 NRC Canada. The FPS-20s were simple pulse-radar systems and subject to jamming using basic techniques. This led to a second series of upgrades to provide anti-jamming capabilities starting in 1959. Among these were the GPA-102 (MK-448) which turned an FPS-20 into an FPS-64 and a FPS-20A to an FPS-66, and the GPA-103 (MK-447) which turned a FPS-20 into an FPS-65 and the FPS-20A into an FPS-67. Similar upgrades using a Canadian OA-4831 system produced the AN/FPS-87 and AN/FPS-87A. The BADGE 412-L upgrade of the FPS-20A created the AN/FPS-82. A more major update was the MK-747, which added a new antenna from Raytheon, the Diplex Gating Unit (DGU), a bandpass filter and other modifications, to produce the AN/FPS-91 and 91A. The similar MK-748 applied to the -60 series resulted in the AN/FPS-64A, -65A, -66A and -67A. Canadian AN/FPS-87s were also converted, becoming AN/FPS-93 and 93A. These units were used with the SAGE system. The FPS-20 was widely used in Japan. They produced their own series of modifications, including a tunnel diode based amplifier and a separate receiver for the Airborne Instruments Laboratories system, producing the AN/FPS-20/20A JAPAN, or -J. The Indian Air Force used the FPS-20 with a new digital moving target indicator (MTI) system from Bendix to create the AN/FPS-100 and 100A. These systems were known as the \\"Blue Pearl\\", or Bendix Radar Processor BRP-150. These were remanufactured units with a new antenna, and included a new low-noise front-end amplifier. General Dynamics later produced a similar digital MTI system, the AN/FPS-113.

It used a two-frequency signal in order to avoid fluctuation loss, which causes signals on single-frequency radars to fade in and out as the target moves. Reducing this effect results in a much steadier signal. General Electric was the primare contractor for the design, which operated in the very high frequency (VHF) at 214 to 236 MHz. There were problems with this radar at the test site at Eufaula AFS (Eufaula, Alabama) in 1960. These problems required many modifications. Additional problems occurred when deployment was attempted in 1961 with the first production model at Point Arena Air Force Station in California. When the radar finally deployed, bearing problems often occurred due to the antenna weight. Failures of the hydrostatic bearing often caused the early closure of some sites due to catastrophic damage to the support tower, sail, and feed horn. Twelve systems were built between 1958 and 1962. Depending on the location it was to be deployed in operational production, the radar antenna (reflector) itself was perched atop one of two different towers: a cast-in-place concrete tower or a metal-sided steel-framed tower both with equal dimensions of in height and side dimensions of square ( square when including the thickness of corner buttresses). This tower design was also used for the AN/FPS-35 frequency diverse SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) search radar built by Sperry Corporation. The prototype at Eufaula, Alabama, was perched atop a steel lattice structure tower of shorter (but unconfirmed) height. Acme Missiles & Construction Corp., Rockville Centre, N.Y. built the radar tower facilities at Missile Master, Pittsburgh Defense Area, Oakdale, Pa.Missiles and Rockets, April 17, 1961, p. 50. The AN/FPS-24 radar antenna reflector rotated 5 revolutions per minute (a SAGE specification) and was often the cause of interference reported by nearby residents who could hear the radar signal in television and radio broadcasts. At some locations, the radar signal was \\"blanked\\" as it passed over television broadcast antenna sites such as Mt. Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California. However, at DEFCON 3 or higher, the signal was ordered \\"unblanked\\" in all directions. The 7.5 megawatt (maximum power) transmitter ran in normal operation at 5 MW output pulse (nearly 20 microseconds in duration) and was conveyed from the transmitter to the antenna feed horn via a diameter rigid coaxial connector. The feed horn consisted of a cross dipole antenna design for both A and B channels. In operation Two of the AN/FPS-24 radar installations were covered by a fiberglass dome, protecting the components from the elements. One such installation was at Cottonwood Air Force Station, Idaho. The other was at Mt Hebo Air Force Station, Oregon. Post-operation Subsequent to USAF site closures, some AN/FPS-24 radar units were upgraded to Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) units for USAF-FAA joint surveillance duty.

He was a follower of the preacher William Miller, who prophesied that the end of the world was imminent.Schwartz, Sanford (May 9, 2013). \\"Making a Long-Gone World Alive\\". The New York Review of Books 60 (8): 53. Prior wrote two books about Miller's teachings, The King's Vesture (1862) and The Empyrean Canopy (1868). Prior died on January 21, 1873 and was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Everett, Massachusetts. About 1,500 portraits are attributed to Prior. His works are in many museums and institutions around the United States including the Harvard Art Museums, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the National Gallery of Art. Prior is the subject of an exhibition, Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed, shown at the Fenimore Art Museum, Cooperstown, New York (May 26 ‚Äì December 31, 2012) and subsequently at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City (January 24 ‚Äì May 26, 2013).

Accepted by the Rome Air Development Center on 20 January 1960 for use at SAGE radar stations, the AN/FPS-26 processed height-finder requests (e.g., from Air Defense Direction Centers) by positioning to the azimuth of a target aircraft using a high-pressure hydraulic drive, then \\"nodding\\" in either a default automatic mode or by operator command. The inflatable radome required a minimum pressure to prevent contact with the antenna which would result in damage to both (technicians accessed the antenna deck via an air lock.) To maintain high dielectric strength, the waveguide was pressurized with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which technicians were warned would produce deadly fluorine if waveguide arcing occurred.

The 3-D functionality of the AN/FPS-27 was not available to the AN/FYQ-47 Common Digitizer for use in the Semi-Automated Ground Environment (SAGE) system. The 3-D functionality was possible through the use of a \\"vertically stacked beam\\" radiating feedhorn into the parabolic reflector. The received radar return was detected in a single or adjacent feedhorn which the radar receiver calculated a relative position in elevation.

Singh became known as \\"The Curry Killer\\" due to the food to which the poison was added. The case is of note due to the cruel method of killing and the degree of premeditation, with Singh travelling to India to procure bikh poison, prepared from Aconitum ferox. Singh received a life sentence with a 23-year minimum term. Background Singh had engaged in a 16-year affair with Lakhvinder Cheema after his first marriage had failed. She had three children and her husband Aunkar was being treated for cancer. The main event leading up to the murder of Cheema was his breaking off the affair to enter in an engagement with a younger woman in November 2008. Prior to this Singh had threatened that she would burn down his house if she found him in bed with the woman. Murder After the break-up, Cheema was hospitalized for a week in December 2008 with suspected poisoning after consuming a meal prepared by Singh. A month later, Singh returned from a trip to India with the aconite that would later be used in the murder. On 27 January 2009 Singh went to the victim's home and laced a leftover curry in his refrigerator with the poison, knowing that he and his fianc√©e were planning to eat the dish that evening. Cheema had second helpings of the curry. After the dinner he began to vomit, his face became numb; he soon lost vision and the use of his limbs. Though his sister was able to get the couple to a hospital, Cheema died within an hour of arrival. Choough suffered the same symptoms, but was placed into a medically induced coma and made a full recovery. During a 999 call, Cheema stated he had been poisoned by his ex-girlfriend. Trial The case gained attention due to the particularly cruel nature of Cheema's killing. Victims of aconitine poisoning suffer severe vomiting, and often become paralysed. Their organs stop working and they die from asphyxiation, yet they remain conscious throughout. The case was also unusual, as the last prosecution for murder using aconitine was that of George Henry Lamson in 1882. The trial took place at the Old Bailey in 2010 . Singh attempted to blame her brother-in-law Varinda for the crime but a lodger had witnessed her taking the curry out of the fridge on the day of the murder. It was also revealed that a plastic bag containing brown powder was found in Singh's coat. She had claimed this was medication for a rash on her neck, whereas it was in fact Indian aconite, matching the poison found in the curry. Sentence Singh was convicted on 10 February 2010 of the murder of Lakhvinder Cheema and grievous bodily harm against his new fianc√©e who survived the attack (Singh was acquitted of attempted murder). Singh was also acquitted of administering poison to her ex- lover's food on a previous occasion. The Crown had sought life imprisonment for Singh with a minimum term of 30 years, due to the gravity of the case and the level of premeditation involved in addition to the fact there had been two victims. Singh received a life sentence with a 23-year minimum term.

It was bred in the seventeenth century in K≈çchi Prefecture, on Shikoku island in southern Japan, and was designated a Japanese National Natural Treasure in 1952. It is one of the ancestors of the German Phoenix breed.  History  The Onagadori was bred in the seventeenth century in Tosa Province, the area that is now K≈çchi Prefecture, on Shikoku island in the south-eastern part of the country. It is reared only in that area, mainly in Nankoku. It is believed to have derived from other long-tailed Japanese breeds including the Shokoku, the Totenko and perhaps the Minohiki. The Onagadori was designated a Special Natural Treasure in 1952. Of the seventeen chicken breeds considered Japanese national treasures, it is the only one to have \\"special\\" status. In 2007 the conservation status of the breed, as reported to the FAO, was \\"endangered\\". In Japan, approximately 250 of the birds are kept by about a dozen breeders.  Characteristics  The principal characteristic of the Onagadori is its exceptionally long tail, which exceeds , and has been known to reach . The tail consists of about 16‚Äì18 feathers, which under the right conditions never moult, and grow rapidly, gaining some per year. The saddle hackles also grow to a considerable length. Three colour varieties are recognised: black- breasted white, black-breasted red, and white. Genetic study suggests that the black-breasted white was the original type, and that the others were created by cross-breeding with birds of other breeds. The comb is single, the eyes are a reddish brown, and the ear-lobes are white.  Use  The Onagadori is kept for ornamental purposes only. Japanese breeders through the centuries have gone to great pains in the creation and perpetuation of the breed, and provide special hutches with perches well above the ground, where the tails are kept clean and in good condition.American Poultry Association, Standard of Perfection 2001 References Birds of Japan Chicken breeds originating in Japan ","title":"Onagadori"},{"id":"30215976","text":"Pellona ditchela, called the Indian pellona, ditchelee and the toothed shad, is a species of longfin herring native to the coasts, mangrove swamps, and estuaries of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific, generally in tropical waters.

Biography Dolores Paterno y Ignacio (anglicized as Dolores Ignacio Paterno or Dolores Paterno-Ignacio) was born on March 10, 1854 in Santa Cruz, Manila, Philippines. She was one of the thirteen children of Maximo Molo Agustin Paterno and Carmina de Vera Ignacio. Dolores Paterno came from the wealthy interrelated mestizo de sangley families of Paterno, Molo, and Agustin. She was the sister of Dr. Pedro Alejandro Paterno, a Filipino politician, poet, and novelist. Her sisters and stepsisters, Agueda, Jacoba, Paz, Concepcion, and Adelaida, were celebrated painters and jewelers whose works were exhibited at the Exposici√≥n Regional de Filipinas in Manila in 1895 and at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. She was also related to the Asuncion brothers, among them Justiniano Asuncion who painted her portrait in 1870.[ Brains of the nation: Pedro Paterno, T.H. Pardo de Tavera, Isabelo de los Reyes, and the production of modern knowledge, by Resil B. Mojares] Musically inclined at a young age, she was sent by her parents to the Santa Isabel College, Manila, an all-girls Catholic school managed by the Daughters of Charity. She devoted much of her time to learning the piano. In 1879, at the age of 25 she composed her only known work, \\"La Flor de Manila\\" ('The Flower of Manila'), inspired by the sampaguita flower. The lyrics were by her brother Pedro Paterno, based on a poem of the same title written by their mother. She died at the age of 27 on July 3, 1881. La Flor de Manila \\"La Flor de Manila\\" is of the Habanera genre (also known as Contradanza or Danza). It was popular during the end of the 19th century and the early period of the American Commonwealth. It has since been considered a Philippine romantic classic. The lyrics were translated from Spanish into Tagalog by the Filipino National Artist Levi Celerio. An arrangement of the song by Rosendo E. Santos, Jr. was also included in the repertoire of the Harvard Glee Club, during their tour of the Philippines in 1961. It was sung by the Graduating Students of Centro Escolar University during their Annual Sampaguita Interlude as their closing number. =Original lyrics= { cellpadding=\\"1\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\" ---- ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"300px\\" La Flor de Manila ! scope=\\"col\\" width=\\"300px\\"  ----  I Sampaguita gentil que halagas con tu aroma mi filipina, sampaguita flor peregrina ¬°ay!, que en tus trenzas bordando est√°s.

The so-called Combe-Ivanov affair developed out of a trip Combe and his wife made to the USSR in 1982, in the course of preparations for which they met and developed a relationship with Valery Ivanov, then the First Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra. Soon after the formation of the Hawke government in March 1983, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) raised concerns that Combe, still closely aligned to the ALP, might be being compromised by a Soviet citizen with KGB links. Ivanov was expelled from Australia on 22 April 1983 by Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Ministers were also directed not to use Combe's lobbying services, although the reason for this was not made known to them at the time. On 17 May Justice Robert Hope was commissioned to investigate the affair but also to review the general progress of the intelligence agencies he had inquired into in 1974-77 at the behest of Gough Whitlam (his first reports were handed down in 1975, during Malcolm Fraser's premiership). Mick Young, the Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council (and himself a former ALP National Secretary 1969-72), was forced to stand down from the Ministry on 14 July when it was revealed he had breached Cabinet security, having talked to a journalist immediately after the 21 April Cabinet decision to expel Ivanov.

He received a large sum of money for the house as a result of a high interest rate. After buying himself a new farm, which he renamed \\"Whiteley's Farm\\", Bill invited his grandson Pete and his wife Lynn to live with him. Bill was very morbid and obsessed with death, so much so that Ernie Shuttleworth, owner of the Malt Shovel barred him for depressing customers. Bill had the same effect on customers at the Woolpack. He believed that his family wouldn't be able to afford a decent coffin so he got himself one for Christmas. Bill was devastated when Pete was killed in a hit-and-run accident by Kate Sugden. At Pete's funeral, Bill angrily berated Kate's husband Joe after he offered to help the family. Following the birth of his great-grandson Peter, Bill let Lynn and Peter carry on living with him. Bill was last seen when Kate visited him to apologize for causing Pete's death but he tells that no apology could bring his grandson back. Bill died off-screen in July 1991 of natural causes. David Hughes David Hughes, played by Martyn Whitby, made his first appearance on 29 March 1989 and departed on 22 November 1990. David is the ex-husband of Kate Hughes (Sally Knyvette) and the father of their children Mark (Craig McKay) and Rachel (Glenda McKay). David appears in the village prior to Kate's wedding to Joe Sugden (Frazer Hines) and his presence causes friction. In spite of this, Kate and Joe marry and David leaves. However, he returns several months later and intends to settle in Hotten near the village to become closer to his children, which angers Joe. During this time, David learns of Rachel's affair with Pete Whiteley (Jim Millea) and agrees to keep quiet but when he sees Rachel and Pete kissing, he attacks Pete. David then tells Kate of the affair and schemes to be closer to her by inviting her and the children to spend Christmas with him, then by buying Kate a new dress as a present. Joe, incensed, attempts to attack David but is overpowered. David then becomes obsessed with winning Kate back, which culminates in him menacing her and Joe with Alan Turner's (Richard Thorp) shotgun. However, Kate calls David's bluff and he backs down and flees the village. David returns in November and hides out at the Mill, and is aided by Mark and Rachel. After a failed attempt to visit Kate who is now incarcerated for running over Pete, David returns and apologises to Joe for attempting to shoot him and thanks him for not calling the police. Mark then urges David to give himself up, which he agrees to but when Mark returns with Rachel to drive him to the police station, David is gone and has left a note.

Born in England and educated in law, Biles brought his family to America in 1679 and settled in what would become Falls Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, before the charter of William Penn. The Biles family had been persecuted for their religious dissension in England, and William became a prominent Quaker minister. \\"After the withdrawal of the Declaration of Indulgence dissenters were more often punished for being absent from their parish churches... Quakers were always fair game and in the following spring (1674) two of them, William Biles and Thomas Strong, were presented at the Assizes.\\" Presumably punishment for being absent from their parish church and attending Quaker ceremonies. Biles was a Justice of the first Provincial (Supreme) Court which was convened as early as 1681, a member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Council from 1683 to 1700 and of the Legislature from 1686 to 1708. He owned large tracts of land in Pennsylvania and New Jersey (including more than 50,000 acres in what is now Salem County, New Jersey) and was qualified as a proprietor of West New Jersey. He traveled back to England for Quaker interests in 1701 and 1702, and returned to Pennsylvania where he died in 1710. Early life and education William Biles was born in 1644 at Dorchester, Dorsetshire, England, the son of Alexander and Dorothy (Strong) Biles. His maternal grandfather, the Rev. William Strong, was a respected preacher at Westminster Abbey who wrote a number of religious tracts and was a supporter of the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War. The Biles (Byles) family had lived at All Saints Parish, Dorchester, for generations. When Biles was seven, in 1651, his paternal grandfather, Alexander Biles, was summoned for criticizing Parson Benn and subsequently stripped of property and title and imprisoned; this undoubtedly influenced William's religious conviction and political attitude. Biles was educated in law: he entered Exeter College, Oxford on 26 October 1660 when he was 16, received his B.A. in 1664, and his M.A. in 1669. (Listed as \\"William Byle\\") First marriage Biles married Joanna Hellard on 6 May 1669. They were Anglican until about 1672, after which time they joined the Society of Friends. They are not found in the minutes of Dorchester monthly meeting (MM) prior to that, but their first five children, three sons and two daughters, were recorded there. Emigration to and settlement in America An old history book of Burlington, New Jersey (located at the Burlington Township Public Library) claimed that William Biles arrived there in 1677, inferring that he arrived on the ship Kent. However, no ship list for the Kent is known. While it is possible that Biles made an initial trip to America, he would have had to travel back to England, as he is known to have arrived with his family in 1679. It seems likely that their ship, the Elizabeth and Sarah, weighed anchor at New Castle, Delaware, and from there the Biles family made their way to Burlington. From Phineas Pemberton's List of Arrivals: \\"William Biles, vile monger, and Johannah, his wife, arrived in Delaware River in the Elizabeth and Sarah of Weymouth, the 4th month [June], 4th day, 1679. Besides his wife and five children, he brought with him two young servants: Edward Hancock to serve eight years and Elizabeth Petty to serve seven years, afterward each to receive 40 acres. They came to America from All Saints Parish, Dorchester, Dorset Co., England.\\" Charles Biles, brother of William, also accompanied the family. Charles was a partner in some real estate purchased in Pennsylvania. A 'vile monger' was a seller of glass products. Small glass containers or viles were used as containers and drinking vessels, to hold and preserve perfumes, oils, medicines and a myriad of other products. Glassmaking became important in England during the 1500s. By 1575, English glassmakers were producing Venetian-style glass. In 1674, an English glassmaker named George Ravenscroft patented a new type of glass in which he had changed the usual ingredients. This glass, called lead glass, contains a large amount of lead oxide. Lead glass, which is especially suitable for optical instruments, caused English glassmaking to prosper. Biles and his family perhaps resided at Burlington for a few months before they removed to what would become Bucks County and the colony of Pennsylvania. As the west bank of the Delaware grew more and more into favor and notice, and immigrants came to it, there were several grants of land by Sir Edmund Andros in 1679, among which were two hundred acres to Thomas Fairman in Bensalem, below Neshaminy, and three hundred and nine to William Clark on the same stream. Several English settlers took up land on the west river bank just below the falls by 1679, including Biles. Two years before William Penn was granted a charter for his colony, Biles purchased land in present-day Falls Township (at that time called \\"Crewcorne\\", \\"Crookhorn\\", or \\"Creekhorne\\") from Sir Edmund Andros, representing the Duke of York. This land consisted of a 300-acre island in the Delaware River (thereafter known as \\"Biles Island\\") from Indians named Orecton, Mannacus, Menemblahoking and Patelana. The island appears early on the 1652 Lindstrom map (charted for the King of Sweden) as \\"Menahanonck\\", a Lenape Indian name meaning \\"the island formed by a creek\\" ‚Äînow known as \\"Biles Creek\\". The island was named \\"Orecton\\" on the William Penn Deed a couple years after Biles took possession. Chief Orecton, Chief Lapowinso and other Indian chiefs confirmed the early purchase of Biles Island in a 1727 deed to William Biles, Jr. A 1690 map by Thomas Holme (depicting land owners on the Delaware prior to Penn's Charter of 1681) shows William Biles with two tracts of land that fronted the river and another that he and his brother, Charles, owned jointly.All maps mentioned are located at the Pennsylvania Historical Society on Locust Street, Philadelphia. That same year (1679), Jasper Danckaerts (who met Biles at that time) charted a map of the Delaware River Valley from Burlington Township to Trenton, New Jersey; the map shows William Biles with 309 acres on the west side of the river. The fact that Biles had established his plantation and built a house on the west side of the Delaware River by late 1679 is corroborated by Dankaerts' journal, extracted and transcribed as follows: Danckaerts and Peter Sluyter, leading members of the Labadist sect of the Netherlands, visited the Delaware in late 1679, going down the river in a boat to New Castle, Delaware. At the falls they stayed overnight with Mahlon Stacy who had erected a mill there. They described the houses of the English along the river as being built mainly of clapboards nailed on the outside of a frame, but \\"not usually laid so close together as to prevent you from sticking a finger between then.\\" The best people, Danckaerts wrote, plastered them with clay. He called the houses built by the Swedes \\"block houses,\\" but from the way they were constructed, actually closely resembled the log cabin found on the western frontier at a later date. Some of the more careful people planked the ceilings, and even had glass windows. The chimney was typically in the corner, and the doors were low and wide. Our travelers breakfasted with the Friends at Burlington, whom they denominated as being \\"the most worldly of men in all their deportment and conversation.\\" Although, elsewhere his descriptions and the relations of the Indians' impressions of the Quakers are not so flattering. They went hence in a shallop to Upland, stopping at Takany (Tacony), a village of Swedes and Finns, where they drank good beer. On Tinicum island they saw a \\"Quaker prophetess who traveled the country over in order to quake.\\" On their return up the river they stopped overnight on \\"Alricks' Island\\" (where the plantation of Peter Aldrichs was situated, on the west side of the river, opposite Matinnaconk Island and Burlington), then in charge of Barent, a Dutchman, who had for housekeeper the Indian wife of an Englishman of Virginia. One of her children was sick with the smallpox, prevalent on the river this year, and mentioned for the first time. Barent consented to pilot them up the river as far as the falls the next day for thirty guilders in zeewant. This was on Friday, 29 December 1679. Landing the canoe on the west side of the Delaware (at or near where Bristol, Pennsylvania, stands), he conducted them by a footpath through the woods in a north-northeast direction until they \\"came to a plantation, newly begun by a Quaker, where we rested and refreshed ourselves. We agreed with this man, who came into the house while we were there, that he should put us over the river for three guilders in zeewant.\\" They crossed the river about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and commenced north on a footpath which led to a cart road and took them to the falls where Mahlon Stacy's mill stood. From there they crossed eastward to the Hudson and on to Manhattan. Although not named by Danckaerts, knowing the few settlers in the area, and from the course they took and the map Danckaerts drew, the Quaker that they met on December 29 at the \\"plantation just begun\\" would have been William Biles, and he was the same who ferried Danckaerts and Sluyter across the river for three guilders. William and Joanna's daughter, Rebeckah, was born on 29 December 1680 in present-day Falls Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the first of the Biles family born in America. Biles began his correspondence with the Society of Friends in England in 1680. Shortly after William Penn opened his grant for settlement in 1681, other Friends began joined the Biles family, settling west of the Delaware River. His house stood for more than two centuries. On Biles' plantation, near Penn's Manor, a large brick dwelling had been represented by tradition and from the initials inscribed upon it as the homestead of William Biles, who is said to have built it of bricks he brought from England. Public life William Biles would play a large part in the political, legal, and religious affairs of early Pennsylvania. He held office before Penn's arrival as a member of the \\"Creekhorne Court\\" by 1680. The first session of the Pennsylvania Provincial Court (essentially the Supreme Court of the Province) was held at \\"Upland\\", where, no doubt, Governor Markham had fixed his residence. The record for the Province of Pennsylvania, at the Court at Upland, September 13, 1681, indicates that \\"Mr. William Byles\\" was one of the nine Justices, along with William Clayton and seven others. Biles was also noted as one of the Justices of the Provincial (Supreme) Court, along with Edward Shippen and Cornelius Empsom, held at Chester on the 18th day, 2nd month (April), 1699. The first known meeting of the Religious Society of Friends west of the Delaware River was held at the home of William Biles below the Falls of Neshaminy. The first entry in Falls MM minutes reads: \\"At a meeting at William Biles's house, the second day of the third month [May], 1683, then held to wait upon the Lord for his wisdom, to hear what should be offered, in order to inspect into the affairs of the Church, helpful in the work of God; and we, whose names are as follows, being then present, thought it fit and necessary that a Monthly Meeting should be set up, both men and women, for that purpose; and that this meeting to be the first of the men's meetings after our arrival into these parts. The Friends present, ‚ÄîWilliam Yardley, James Harrison, Phineas Pemberton, William Biles, William Dark, Lyonell Brittanie, William Beakes.\\" The home of William Biles was the meeting place for Falls MM until 1690 when Falls Meeting House was built at Fallsington. On 20 February 1682, an election was ordered for members of the Provincial Council and Assembly. William Biles, Christopher Taylor and James Harrison were elected on 10 March 1682 to the Council from Bucks Co. Biles was present at the first session of the first Council held in Philadelphia on 10 January 1683 where William Penn presided. Biles took part in the framing of Pennsylvania's initial laws and was present at the initial reading of Penn's Charter of Privileges in the council chambers, on 2 February 1683, and was among those who voted for it in 1693, when it was finally approved. William Biles, his son William (Jr.), and brother Charles owned cattle in 1684, having recorded earmarks and brands with Bucks County. Biles was appointed Interior Receiver for Bucks County on 22 May 1684, under the Deputy Treasurer, by the Provincial Council, for which he received ¬£20 annual salary. On 6 February 1685, he and others were commissioned as constables for the county. On 11 February, he and others were appointed to lay out a road for the county. He was appointed on 1 October 1685 as Special Commissioner to determine all heinous and enormous crimes in Bucks County. He was elected to the Provincial Assembly in 1686 and was fined twelve pence for being absent the first day, 10 March 1686. He was a member of the Assembly and Council for most of his life in Pennsylvania. In 1687, all taxes levied in Bucks County were collected by William Biles. Also in 1687, he was called to account by the Society of Friends for selling rum to the Indians.The Men's Minutes of Falls MM: 6th day, 2nd month, 1686 -- \\"Great disorders from the sale of rum to the Indians. Friends to keep clear of selling rum to Indians or to any that are Indian Traders. Wm. Biles to be cautioned thereof.\\" Thomas Janney spoke to Biles regarding the matter. The act was not against any law, but was not favored by his associates and Biles bowed to the wishes of other Quakers. Joanna (Hellard) Biles died in 1687‚Äîpossibly as a result of prevalent sickness that spread after severe floods in the Delaware Valley. Joanna was buried on 4 September 1687, according to Falls MM records. William lived as a widower with his children for 15 months. He made his intention to marry Jane Atkinson known to the Men's Meeting of Falls MM on the 3rd day, 8th month, 1688 and he was liberated to marry by Falls MM on the 7th day, 9th month, 1688. Falls MM marriage records read: \\"William Biles of Bucks Co., merchant, and Jane Atkinson, of same co., (married) 11th of 10th month 1688.\\" And Middletown MM marriage records read: \\"William Biles, of Bucks Co., married 11th day of 10th month, 1688, Jane Atkinson, of said co., at the house of William Biles.\\" Jane (Boyd) Atkinson was the widow of Thomas Atkinson. Thomas Atkinson had been a Quaker minister and farmer whom Biles had aided some years earlier. Jane and Thomas had little material means, and it has been written that the marriage between William and Jane was unusual for the fact that William was a wealthy man and Jane had no dowry to offer; even so, William's land holdings were increased by his second marriage. Jane was a noble woman and a very active Quaker minister; she often traveled in Gospel work. She moved with her children to the Biles plantation within the compass of Falls MM where she continued her ministry.The Men's Minutes of Falls MM: 8th day, 9th month, 1693 ‚Äî \\"Jane, wife of Willm. Biles, proposes the sale of the plantation she formerly lived upon and her said husband also declared his willingness, and desire the advice of this meeting. It was thought by this meeting most profitable for the children of Thomas Atkinson if it be sold and the money and interest on it be paid to the children of Thomas Atkinson when they came of age.\\" William and Jane made many trips to New England colonies in the interest of Friends. Biles served his second term in the Assembly in 1689 and was appointed to the Commission of Peace in Bucks County. Biles and twelve others met in 1692 at the Friends meeting house at Neshaminy and divided the county into Townships. Biles continued to purchase real estate in the area. He bought 300 acres in Burlington County, West New Jersey for ¬£55 on 10 April 1696 from Thomas Green, Yeoman of Maidenhead, Burlington Co. Between 1699 and 1701, Biles was a Puisne judge and a Justice of the Supreme Court of the Province of Pennsylvania. He sat on the Supreme Court held on 18 April 1699 at Chester and was appointed to the Court of Inquiry for Bucks County in 1700. He and his wife traveled to England and Ireland in 1701 in the interest of the Society of Friends.The Men's Minutes of Falls MM: 5th day, 11th month (January), 1700 (O.S). ‚Äî \\"Jane Biles gives her intentions of visiting Friends in Europe. Wm Biles, her husband, proposes to go with her.\\" A record of their certificate has not been located, but it is believed they were gone for perhaps as long as two years. Upon their return (if the trip was indeed made), they supposedly reported to the Meeting of the trip, although a record of that is not known. They returned to Pennsylvania sometime before December 1702 when the Court of Inquiry was adjourned to Biles' house. Controversy with William Penn and Governor Evans William Biles was an influential man in early America and had many political allies and powerful enemies. He apparently was a supporter of the popular party led by David Lloyd (a fellow attorney, judge and Assemblyman) who was an outspoken opponent of a number of schemes proposed by Penn and his colonial officers, as undermining the liberties of the residents of Pennsylvania. As a member of the Assembly of Pennsylvania, on an occasion in 1705, Biles was recognized to address the body and spoke out against then Lieutenant Governor John Evans, saying: \\"He is not a man. He is but a boy! He is not fit to be our Governor! We'll kick him out! We'll kick him out!\\" Needless to say, Evans was greatly offended by the speech; he asked the Assembly to purge itself of \\"the contagion of the said pernicious member by expelling him [William Biles].\\" But, after receiving the request, the Assembly rose up and supported Biles with great vigor. Evans was outraged and wrote to William Penn on 5 July 1705 regarding the matter. The following reply by Penn, dated \\"7th mo. 30th -1705\\", was sent to Evans: : \\"Much is said of the lewdness of Pennsylvania. I beg of thee to have regard to my character and give not that advantage against me, either with God or good or bad men, whose ill use of it I most fear on a public account. I have just now received thine of 5th, 5th month and am very sorry that wicked man, D. L. could blow up any of his mermidons to such a pitch as thy account of William Biles relates that is a meer vox et praetara nihil, a cox comb and a pragmatic ingraine. That fellow's plantation is a robbery on Pennsbury and if there be a grant, was not a purchase from me nor toward land write for me was surveyed long before and done in my absence, formerly and Judge Monpresson can tell if I may not be deceived in my grant as well as the Crown, be it King or Queen Since if confirmed it was on. Surprize and rattle an Inquisition about his [William Biles'] ears if not a prosecution. And know when the time is expired of session, as he may be taken to task. Since the service he may pretend he was to attend is over. And do first complain to the Friends and if they won't or can't bow him to make satisfaction, take it by law, thyself. Pray mind what I say be secret, which is discreet and fall on him or any other such unruly people at once and make someone such an example to terrify the rest. Thou hast not only my leave but my liking and encouragement whether called Quakers or not. ‚Äî [signed] William Penn.\\" This unflattering description of William Biles and relatively malicious instruction demonstrates the political schemes of the colonial authority to control citizens and squelch the influence of independent men, even by that noble Friend, William Penn. Acting on Penn's directives, Governor Evans sued Biles for ¬£2000 on 23 March 1706 for \\"defamy\\". In a shrewd but very bold move, Biles‚Äîan attorney and Supreme Court judge‚Äîrefused to acknowledge the suit and did not even appear to answer the civil charge. Continuing to act on the advice of William Penn, Evans ordered his officers to detain Biles as he returned home from his duty in the Colonial Assembly. Biles was thrown in jail and imprisoned for four weeks. Feelings in the province ran so high that Biles was released and the suit was dropped. Evans, tainted by numerous instances of poor judgment and bad leadership, fell out of favor with Penn and was removed from office in February 1709. He later said of Biles, \\"He very much influences that debauched county of Bucks, in which there is now scarce any one man of worth left.\\" During the course of this controversy, Penn's personal secretary, James Logan, made a public assertion that Biles' \\"numerous family\\" had filled Bucks County \\"with whores and rogues; of his 5 daughters four that are married having acquitted themselves before marriage & the last 'tis expected will not be so unmannerly as deviate from the Example all her elder Sisters have Sett before her.\\" Logan also claimed that the youngest daughter, Ann, had given birth to an illegitimate child, and that William, Jr., had fathered a child whose arrival shortly after his marriage had \\"aroused suspicions.\\" While it cannot be determined with any certainty if all these allegations are true of false, some of them likely have some kernel of fact at their core. The context of the accusations is very important, however, because Logan, Evans, and other political adversaries of William Biles spread all manner of slanderous rumors in an attempt to pressure the solemn Quakers to disown Biles and to persuade the Colonial Assembly to expel him from their ranks. The situation between Penn and Biles also was further agitated due to the fact that William Biles's home plantation was on land adjacent to Pennsbury, the personal estate of William Penn. Biles's land was the same tract purchased several years prior to Penn's Charter, which accounted for Penn's characterization of Biles's plantation as a \\"robbery upon Pennsbury.\\" There were other problems among these neighbors. Quaker records show, as early as 1686, disagreements arose: \\"A difference exists between James Harrison and Wm. Biles concerning a letter that was written by Harrison to Biles about a servant of the governour's.\\"The Men's Minutes of Falls MM: 1st day, 10th month, 1686. Apparently a member of Biles's household and one of Penn's servants were involved in an altercation. Later life Biles continued his business ventures and land speculation. On 20 July 1705, William Biles (sometime mistranscribed \\"Bills\\" in records) of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and William Couch of London, England, sold to Jonathan Stout (formerly of Monmouth County, who founded Hopewell, New Jersey) one-sixteenth of one-hundredth part of the Province of West New Jersey (that is, Biles and Couch had owned a 0.0625% interest in the colony of West New Jersey, entitled them both to membership on the Council of Proprietors of West New Jersey). Biles continued to serve in public office, as a judge, and also maintained a private law practice. He was appointed attorney to Joseph Wass of London in September 1707. Shortly thereafter, Wass sold all of his real estate holdings in America to William Biles, including 45,000 acres in Quohakin County and 10,000 acres in Salem County, West New Jersey, bordering the Morris River and Delaware Bay. By his death in 1710, Biles' estate contained about 20,000 acres in New Jersey, 300 acres in Delaware, and 1,000 acres in Bucks County. Biles was elected to his final service in the Assembly in 1709. His wife, Jane, died and was buried on the 21st day, 10th month (December), 1709 at Falls Meeting House. On 4 January 1709/10 (O.S.), the Pennsylvania Assembly received word that Biles was unable to care for the meeting's accounts due to illness. From Falls MM, Men's Minutes: 5th day, 11th month (January), 1703 (O.S.) ‚Äî \\"Reported that William Biles is in necessity of assistance.\\" 3rd day, 3rd month, 1710 ‚Äî \\"William Biles being very weak and not likely to continue long it's agreed that George Clough take care of the meeting's collections in his stead.\\" On 2nd day, 5th month, 1710 the accounts continue: \\"William Biles being deceased ...\\" Falls MM Births and Deaths records show: \\"William Biles died the 19th day of 3rd month (May), 1710.\\" He was aged 66 years. Final estate The will of William Biles was signed 5th day, 11th month (January) 1709/10 (O.S.). William Biles, Jr. received the bulk of his father's estate, including the large land tracts in West New Jersey. Abstract of the Will of William Biles: : To my son John Biles, 300 acres of land.

It operated a main line between West Philadelphia and Octoraro Junction, Maryland (near Port Deposit), plus several branch lines. History The P&BC; was chartered in Pennsylvania in 1854 and quickly absorbed the Baltimore & Philadelphia Railroad and its Maryland charter. Starting from a connection with the West Chester & Philadelphia Railroad (WC&P;) at Wawa, Pennsylvania (formerly called Grubb's Bridge), the initial plan was to build southwest for to a junction with the Northern Central Railway, north of Baltimore. As built, however, the line would reach only from Wawa (where the WC&P; line arrived from Philadelphia in 1856) to the northern bank of the Susquehanna River, in Cecil County, Maryland, near Port Deposit. P&BC; construction began in 1855 at Concordville, Pennsylvania. The first section of the line, between Wawa Junction and Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, opened in 1859.

By December 1868, it reached and its southernmost point at Rowlandsville ( north of Port Deposit, along Octoraro Creek), where it connected with the Columbia & Port Deposit Railroad (C&PD;). Instead of building its own bridge over the Susquehanna to continue service toward Baltimore, the P&BC; simply leased the C&PD; line for a few miles to Perryville, where trains could proceed south over the new bridge built by the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad (PW&B;). In 1881, P&BC; absorbed the West Chester & Philadelphia Railroad ‚Äî both lines were controlled by the PW&B;, which was itself controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) ‚Äî extending its main line to West Philadelphia. In 1916, P&BC; was formally purchased by PW&B;'s successor company, the Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington. Subsequently, the line from Wawa south to Rowlandsville was called the Octoraro Branch. Passenger train service from Octoraro to Perryville over the C&PD; line ended in 1935, and during or shortly after World War II, passenger service was cut back to Oxford before being ended entirely in April 1948.Dixon, Mike. \\"All‚Äôs Quiet on the Octoraro Branch Line.\\" Window on Cecil County's Past. 2008-10-20.

The PRR merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form the Penn Central (PC), which was bankrupt by 1970. Hurricane Agnes caused several washouts in 1972 and rendered the line unusable north of Brandywine Creek. Following the PC bankruptcy, ownership of the line went to Conrail, and then to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which leased the operable section to short-line freight railroad companies. The Octoraro Railway provided service between Oxford and Chadds Ford Junction from 1977 to 1994, while also operating the ex-Reading Wilmington & Northern branch through a connection at the latter place.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 14th century. Gregory catalogued it twice as 812 and 2278.  Description  The codex contains the text of the four Gospels, on 254 parchment leaves (size ). The text is written in one column per page, 24 lines per page. The large initial letters are written in gold. The first page of every Gospel is written in gold. The text is divided according to the (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, with their (titles) at the top of the pages. There is also another division according to the Ammonian Sections (with divergences), whose numbers are given at the margin, without references to the Eusebian Canons. It contains Epistula ad Carpianum, tables of the (tables of contents) before each Gospel, and pictures. Lectionary markings at the margin (for church reading), Synaxarion, and Menologion were added by later hand.  Text  The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Aland did not place it in any Category. It was not examined by Hermann von Soden. According to the Claremont Profile Method it has mixed Byzantine text and represents textual family Œ†b in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20. It contains the Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) without any mark.  History  Gregory dated the manuscript to the 12th century. The manuscript is currently dated by the INTF to the 14th century. According to Frederick Wisse the manuscript was written in 1314. There is a note at the end of the Gospel of Matthew, made by different hand with date 1322, about an attack of the Turks. Before Matthew there is another note with date 1746. It was held in Corfu and belonged to Archbishop Eustathius, then it came to \\"Dawes Collection\\" (as the second volume; the first volume belonged to 2277, the third to 2279). On 15 October 1904 it was bought for the British Museum. It was added to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Gregory (812e). Gregory saw it in 1886 during his visit in Greece. On 17 October 1904 Gregory saw this manuscript in British Museum and catalogued again under the siglum 2278. This time he assigned age of the manuscript for the 11th or 12th century. Second description is more detailed though he did not enumerated pages of the codex. One page of the codex was edited in facsimile.Facsimiles of Ancient Manuscripts, ed. E. M. Thompson and others, I (London, 1903), p. 52.

Delbr√ºck was head of the Institute of Fermentation Technology within the research institute. In 1887 he was appointed instructor at the Agricultural College, and in 1899 was given a full professorship. He was founder of the Department of Machine-Aided Technologies of the VLB (1888) and partook in the conception of the degree course Brewmaster. The researches, carried out in part by Delbr√ºck himself, in part under his guidance, resulted in technical contributions of the highest value to the fermentation industries.

The decline in painted turtle populations is not a simple story of dramatic range reduction, such as the American bison. Instead, the turtle remains numerous and occupies its original range‚Äîit is classified as G5 (demonstrably widespread) in its Natural Heritage Global Rank‚Äîhowever, the settlement of North America has undoubtedly reduced its population density. Since at least 1952, scientists have noted human impact on the painted turtle. Ernst and Lovich, in their 2009 turtle almanac, acknowledge that estimates of species-specific population changes are lacking, but say that it is useful to discuss general factors affecting all turtles. However, these pressures are generally more pressing on turtles of the sea, estuary or land, or already rare turtles. The painted turtle's high reproduction rates and its ability to survive in habitats affected by humans, such as polluted wetlands and artificially made ponds, have allowed it to maintain its range. In New England, the Turtle Conservation Project notes: \\"Ironically, prime habitat has been created by fertilizer runoff, creating vegetation-clogged lakes; just what Painted Turtles like.\\" Only at the extremities of the Pacific Northwest is the turtle's actual range eroding. Even there, in Washington, the painted turtle is common: it is designated S5 (demonstrably widespread). However, further south, in Oregon (the north third of the state is painted turtle range), the painted turtle is designated S2 (imperiled). There, federal, state and Portland city governments are working to better understand and arrest the decline of the painted turtle. North of Washington, in British Columbia, the turtle is also in peril. There coastal populations are designated as endangered and Interior populations are designated as \\"of special concern\\". The iconic painted turtle is popular in British Columbia and the province is further motivated to stop the loss of the painted turtle because it has already lost all populations of its other native turtle species, the western pond turtle. However, despite conservation efforts, only a few thousand turtles remain in the entire province. Much has been written about the different factors that harm the painted turtle. Essentially all factors are unquantified and at most only some inferences of which factors are more relatively severe are described. Habitat loss An obvious threat to painted turtles comes from habitat loss by drying of wetlands. Even when water remains, the turtles may be impacted by the clearing of logs or rocks that provide basking sites. Also, clearing of shorelines' vegetation may make allow more predator access, or increased human foot traffic, which make onshore basking untenable. Away from the water, urbanization or vegetation-planting, even for stream restoration, can remove the open sunny soils needed for nesting. Roadkill Another visible and probably numerically significant human impact is roadkill. Dead turtles are commonly seen on summer roads: in 1974, Ernst measured 14 deaths in a single day on one short stretch of Pennsylvania road. Increased traffic as well as increased road penetration of habitat have worsened the problem over the years. A study of turtles near Highway 92 in Montana showed that turtle populations near the road were an order of magnitude smaller than those a few miles away. The near-road populations were also skewed to being much younger. Both findings suggested the road was killing substantial numbers of near roaf turtles and that those populations depended on replacements coming from hatchlings from the far from road populations. Turtle surveys near busy roads showed that males strongly outnumbered females. This suggests most road casualties were nesting females. Males roaming for mates or changing waters from drought could usually find water routes to move along, but the females had to come on land to lay eggs. In addition to direct killing, roads impact some painted turtles indirectly by isolating populations genetically. Various roadkill reduction efforts are being tried. Portland, Oregon built an undercrossing, for $160,000, which the turtles have learned to use. In 2012, Montana will build highway barriers on US Route 93 near Ninepipe National Wildlife Refuge. Less dramatic interventions have included road signs (\\"turtle crossing\\") as well as public education. States counsel drivers to avoid turtles by safely swerving, when possible, or by assisting turtles in crossing. Oregon's Regional Conservation Biologist, Susan Barnes, writes, \\"Stopping to help a turtle cross a road is always a question of human safety. If you can safely get off the road and carry the turtle to the side of the road in the direction it is headed, it's O.K.\\" Introduced species Oregon conservation video: 0:30‚Äì0:60 conservation factors; 1:50‚Äì2:00 hoop trap.(If video play problematic, see or for alternative video streams.) The introduction of non-native species is another threat to the painted turtle. Red-eared sliders are the most common pet turtle and are native to the US Southeast only. They have been widely released (or escaped) and have established breeding populations in many parts of the painted turtle range, including Canada. They are a similar species in size and habits to the painted turtle, so they may be added competition, but the impact is uncertain. In the eastern United States, the painted turtle already shares territory with yellow-bellied and Cumberland sliders (which mix readily with red-eared sliders), so there, the pet-released invasions are less likely to be a significant new threat. In the West, several predators of youngling painted turtles have been introduced into waters where they never roamed before: bass, snapping turtles, and bullfrogs. Examination of bullfrogs and bass in Montana shows they are consuming few painted turtles. Snapping turtles may have more impact and, in Oregon, aggressive trapping has been done to remove them. In urban areas, increased egg-eating raccoons, foxes, and coyotes, as well as feral dogs or cats, may impact painted turtles. Some cities have experimented with nest enclosures to screen out predators. Other concerns Taking painted turtles from and releasing them into wetlands can both be harmful. Initially, local populations may be decimated by over-collection as most adults for sale are from the wild. Ernst recounts an example of a pet collector in Pennsylvania removing an entire water body's turtles. Later, pet releases may introduce salmonella or poor genes to wild populations. Pollution may be a danger in a few different ways: pesticides for mosquitos killing off aquatic prey in turtle ponds, herbicides hurting aquatic vegetation, or just generalized water pollution impacting turtles. However, no definite impacts have been quantified. Outdoor recreation also affects turtles. Boating traffic near basking sites can disturb painted turtles. Some turtles die inadvertently on fisherman's hooks‚Äîthe turtles are noteworthy for stealing bait. Oregon is considering stream access modifications to reduce wanton shooting. Gervais notes that turtle research itself impacts the populations. Many turtle surveys have been done, which did not result in publication. She advocates developing computer-based population models instead, to better understand evolution of painted turtle numbers, and reserving catch and release studies to test specific hypotheses. Similar to road deaths, agricultural machinery kill females and destroy nests. Some states describe death from lawnmowers (particularly on golf courses). Others warn against indiscrimante all-terrain vehicle riding affecting the turtles. Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Stefan Zweig. A paraplegic young baroness mistakes compassion for love. The film's costumes were designed by Cecil Beaton. It was made by Two Cities Films at Islington Studios. The film was not a great popular success outside the Soviet Union.Harper p.156 Plot The film opens with a framing device set in post-Second World War Britain. When a young man comes to aged Anton Marek (Albert Lieven) for romantic advice, Marek tells him a story from his own past, which leads to a flashback. In the days leading up to the First World War, Lieutenant Marek is assigned to an Austro- Hungarian cavalry regiment stationed in a small town. There he meets Baroness Edith de Kekesfalva (Lilli Palmer), a young woman who is a paraplegic as the result of a horse riding accident. Noticing how the young man has cheered up his depressed daughter, Baron Emil de Kekesfalva (Ernest Thesiger) asks him to spend time with her. Marek finds her company pleasant enough and agrees. The baron has consulted many renowned doctors in vain; none hold out any hope for his daughter's recovery. Finally, in desperation, he has turned to hardworking, dedicated Dr. Albert Condor (Cedric Hardwicke), who at least refuses to give up. Condor notices a great improvement in Edith's attitude, which he accurately ascribes to her falling in love with Marek. Marek remains unaware of Edith's feelings for him. One day, Marek tells the family about a promising treatment in Switzerland, despite Condor's warning to wait until he has had a chance to investigate. Condor later informs him that it cannot help Edith, but by then the damage is done. With the hope of being able to walk again unassisted, Edith reveals her love for Marek. Guilt-ridden, the young man pretends to love her and agrees to marry her after she is cured. However, when rumors of the engagement leak out, Marek angrily denies them to his questioning, disapproving fellow officers. When he is confronted by his commanding officer, Marek admits the truth. To minimize the scandal, his commander immediately arranges his transfer to another unit far away. Marek goes to see Condor before he leaves, but the doctor is away. Instead, Condor's blind wife Klara (Gladys Cooper) speaks with him. She gets him to recognize that he may love Edith after all. He tries to telephone Edith, but the lines are barred from civilian use because of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand that same day. Marek must take the train to report for duty with his new unit, but Klara assures him she will see Edith and clear things up. When Klara visits Edith, she finds her alone on the rooftop terrace of her family's mountainside mansion. Edith has heard about Marek's public denial of their engagement and no longer trusts anyone. With Klara powerless to stop her, she wheels herself to the edge and flings herself over to her death. Cast *Lilli Palmer as Baroness Edith de Kekesfalva *Albert Lieven as Lt.

It is native to the Puget Sound region in southwestern British Columbia and northwestern Washington, where it is an endemic species and is abundant on coast bluffs as well as on dry mountain ridges on the Olympic Peninsula. It was previously included in the description of the Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum) but was separated in 2007. Genetic analysis revealed that what appeared to be Rocky Mountain junipers in the Puget Sound were not of the same species as those elsewhere. The Puget Sound species also differs in morphology, with faster-maturing cones that have protruding seeds, and other differences. It is especially unique in habitat. The seaside juniper occurs at the edge of the water, next to the sound or the nearby lakes, in a milder, wetter climate on sandy, granite soils, even sand dunes in one location. J. scopulorum grows in drier, rockier substrates in colder locations higher in the mountains. It is also noted that seaside juniper reproduces itself and does not interbreed with other junipers, further evidence that it should be called a separate species. In general the seaside juniper is common to abundant in its native range; however, it is impacted by development at some sites and it can face competition from Douglas-fir.The Nature Conservancy References maritima Flora of British Columbia Endemic flora of Washington (state) Plants described in 2007 ","title":"Juniperus maritima"},{"id":"30217135","text":"Giuseppe Paladino may refer to: *Joe Paladino - Goalkeeper *Giuseppe Paladino (1721-1794) - Baroque painter of Messina ","title":"Giuseppe Paladino"},{"id":"30217140","text":"Galitz is a Jewish surname indicating the origin of the family, of Galitzianer Jews.

After sharing the minute quantities that he had been able to isolate with researchers at the biotechnology firm Amgen, that company was able to use genetic engineering technology to produce useful amounts of EPO as a drug to treat anemia that has achieved substantial financial success, but that has also been used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug. Early life and education Goldwasser was born on October 14, 1922, in Brooklyn, New York, and moved with his family to Kansas City, Missouri following the collapse of his father's clothing company.Pollack, Andrew. \\"Eugene Goldwasser, Biochemist Behind an Anemia Drug, Dies at 88\\", The New York Times, December 20, 2010. Accessed December 27, 2010. He received a scholarship to attend the University of Chicago and worked at the school's defense-oriented toxicity laboratory during World War II before earning his undergraduate degree in biochemistry in 1943.Ramirez, Margaret. \\"Dr. Eugene Goldwasser, 1922-2010: Biochemist behind lifesaving drug, father of EPO\\", Chicago Tribune, December 21, 2010. Accessed December 27, 2010. Goldwasser served for two years at Fort Detrick, home of the United States biological weapons program, studying anthrax after being drafted by the United States Army in 1944. He earned his doctorate in biochemistry in 1950 after returning to the University of Chicago. Career in biochemistry Hypotheses had been made in the early 20th century that there was a substance that triggered the body to produce more red blood cells, but no one had been able to identify a material that matched the description. In 1955, hematologist Leon O. Jacobson challenged Goldwasser to begin a search for the red blood cell-promoting substance, a task that Goldwasser assumed could be accomplished in a few months. His initial approach involved the step-by-step removal of different organs from laboratory rats, leading to the conclusion that anemia resulted from a substance produced in the kidneys. Though the discovery of where the material was produced was made in 1957, it took Goldwasser and his team another 15 years before they were able to isolate eight milligrams of EPO from material that had been precipitated from of urine from anemia patients by Japanese researcher Takaji Miyake. Results of Goldwasser's research, which had been funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, were first published in 1977 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. University of Chicago biochemist Donald F. Steiner called the discovery \\"one of the great contributions to science or medicine of the 20th century, comparable to the discovery of insulin\\". Goldwasser had submitted a patent disclosure form, though the University of Chicago never pursued a patent. After providing a sample of the purified EPO to researchers at Amgen, a team there led by Fu-Kuen Lin was able to identify and patent the gene that produced EPO and was able to generate useful quantities of human EPO by using genetic engineering techniques to insert the gene into hamster cells. After successful tests on patients undergoing dialysis, Epoetin alfa, marketed by Amgen under the trade name Epogen starting in 1989, became a financial success, generating a billion-dollar market for Amgen and other companies that had developed their own versions of EPO, though Goldwasser would say that \\"the enormous clinical success of Epo still astonishes me\\". Goldwasser didn't receive any royalties from Amgen and noted that having received \\"one percent of one percent of the drug's annual revenues would have funded my lab quite handsomely\\" before his retirement from the university in 2002. Goldwasser faced criticism for turning over his government-funded research results to Amgen, though he wrote in 1996 that he had received permission from the NIH. In subsequent years EPO has faced controversy for its use as a performance- enhancing drug, particularly in long-distance bicycle racing, where participants have been found to have used EPO as a means to increase endurance. Floyd Landis admitted to using EPO and other performance-enhancing substances during his professional career, and was stripped of his title as winner of the 2006 Tour de France.Macur, Juliet; and Schmidt, Michael S. \\"Landis Admits Doping, Accuses Top U.S. Cyclists\\", The New York Times, May 20, 2010.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The area that is now Portland belonged to the Wangunk people prior to the arrival of European colonists. The land in the Indian Hill area was among the last to be sold off by the Wangunks (in 1748 and 1765), who ended up merging with other regional tribes and eventually settled in Wisconsin. The Indian Hill area was documented into the 19th century as a Native American burying ground, and continues to be visited by Wangunk descendants. Various building projects in the area have on a number of occasions included reports of the exposed burials, and numerous surface-level Native artifacts have been found in the area. The waterfront area on the Connecticut River was developed from an early date as a shipyard, a use that continues with the presence of a marina and boat service yard with more modern structures. The district's built infrastructure includes Greek Revival and Late Victorian architecture, and has Portland's largest concentration of 18th and early 19th-century architecture.

Description  Grouped events can fall into categories depending upon whether the events are causal or acausal (noncausal), and are with or without meaning (significance). Causaldefinition of causality at Dictionary.com events are related as the subsequent event(s) are understood to be a consequence of the prior event(s). Meaning definition of meaning at Dictionary.com represents the purpose or significance of something. Four categories are causality, coincidence, serendipity, and synchronicity. CausalityCausation, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy represents causal events grouped without meaning. These are common events. CoincidenceCoincidence, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy represents acausal events grouped without meaning. These are less common events. SerendipitySerendipity: Anatomy of the Unsought Finding, Oxford Journals represents causal events grouped by meaning. These are rare events. SynchronicityWhat is Sychronicity?, Carl Jung Resources represents acausal events grouped by meaning. These events are unlikely to occur by chance and may represent an outlier effect.  Examples  A causality example is to strike a cue ball with a pool stick to make it move. The result is expected and has no meaning. A coincidence example is two friends from the same town finding each other at the same time in the town's library without any planning. The result is unexpected, yet has no meaning (significance). A serendipity example is finding something useful while looking for something else, such as finding the cue ball while looking for the pool stick. The find was caused by the search, and because the find was useful, the event has meaning. A sychronicity example is two friends who rarely visit libraries, without any planning, finding each other in a library on one day; and again without any planning, finding each other in a distant library on a later date. Not only is the result unexpected, the friends find the event to have meaning (significance), because of the remote chance of the event.  Criticisms and interpretations  Determinism theoryCausal Determinism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy argues against acausal events. However, the idea of causal determinism can neither be argued for nor against based on the scientific knoweldge at this point in time . Causality appears to us to be reasonably objective to determine on the macroscopic scale. (But not on the quantum scale, where random chance prevails.) However, even large-scale physical causality is a somewhat mysterious notion; there is no general theory of causality in physics, and most events in physics are theoretically reversible in time . However, the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which states that entropy always increases with time, in any closed system) can be regarded as providing a direction for the \\"arrow of time\\" and thus entropy may be related to the physically mysterious notion of causality. (See Causality (physics).) Unlike causality, the concept of meaning is purely subjective except in symbol systems such as language/grammar and mathematics ‚Äì both systems which depend on prior agreement on the arbitrary assignment of specific meanings to specific symbols or symbol groups.. The outlier effect can be used to explain events that are unlikely to occur by chance. Littlewood's LawLittlewoods's Miscellany, edited by B. Bollob√°s, Cambridge University Press; states that individuals can statistically expect a significant event to happen for them at a frequency of about once per month. Littlewood assumes a significant event frequency at one in a million with a duration of one second, and that an individual is alert to significant events for eight hours per day.  In popular culture  The 1993 book The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield encouraged its readers to seek meaning from grouped events. From the book's First Insight: \\"In each of our lives occurs mysterious coincidences ‚Äì sudden, synchronistic events that, once interpreted, lead us into our true destiny'.The Celestine Prophecy, by James Redfield; The book was a 1996 best seller, spent 165 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller list, and has now sold over 20 million copies.

It is the first neo realistic movie in the language. The film narrates the life of the common man on the street. The film is noteworthy in that the entire production programme from script-writing to direction was controlled and executed by students. The group of students were from the school Adarsh Kalamandir and the film was written and directed by P. Ramdas. The screenplay was based on a short story written by Ramadas himself. Though the film had a shoestring budget of , featured mostly amateur actors, and was made by an inexperienced crew, Newspaper Boy was a critical success. Influenced by Italian neorealism, the film is also remembered for being the world's first commercial film made by students.  Plot  Set in Kerala of the 1950s, Newspaper Boy focuses on the lives of Appu (Master Moni), the young protagonist of the film, and the members of his impoverished family. Appu's father Sankaran Nair (Nagavally R. S. Kurup) earns a meagre living as a worker in a printing press. He is easily exploited in his work ‚Äì he cannot even muster the courage to ask his employer for overdue wages. Nair's wife, Kalyani Amma (Neyyattinkara Komalam), takes care of their three children, Leela (Kumari Madhuri), Appu and Balan (Master Narendran). Kalyani Amma helps her husband by taking up the job of a housemaid in rich Madhava Menon's (G. R. Nair) house. She is treated like a slave by Menon's wife Lakshmi Amma (Adoor Pankajam). Extreme poverty forces Leela to stop her education. However Nair manages to provide education to Appu, his only hope. Adding oil to the fire, one day, Nair injures his hand during his work in the press. He could not go to work for two-three weeks. The employer fires Nair from the job during this period. He offers Nair the payment for those days, but Nair refuses it, although his family is in dire need of money. Nair tries to find another job but in vain. He cannot even pay the house-rent. House owner Kesavan Pillai (Veeran) asks Nair either to pay the rent or to leave the house. Soon Nair dies of extreme poverty and illness. After his demise, the family sinks even deeper into poverty. The whole family is now on Appu's shoulders. Appu finds no way to save his family from this situation. Kittummavan (Kuriyathi), a kind-hearted neighbour, is his only help. Kittummavan asks his son Raghavan (P. Ganga) to take Appu to Madras and find him a job. Appu leaves to Madras, where he gets the job as a servant in rich Sreedhara Menon's (Madhavan) house. Menon's wife Kamalamma (Omana Madhavan) behaves brutally to Appu, even worse than Lakshmi Amma behaved to his mother, and he had to leave the job soon. Appu desperately wants to return to his home. He wanders in the street searching for a job to arrange money for his return. He befriends with Pappan (Master Venkiteswaran), and both of them take small jobs to earn money for Appu's return. Meanwhile, Kalyani Amma, who is suffering from tuberculosis, is thrown out of the house by Kesavan Pillai. Leela and Balan begs for help from Madhavan Nair. He gives them ten rupees and asks them not to come again. Raghavan informs Appu his mother's condition and arranges money for his return. Kalyani Amma dies of illness before Appu reaches. The film ends with Appu taking up the job of a newspaper boy to look after his brother and sister.

Ramdas once read in Filmfare magazine that Raj Kapoor was India's youngest film director. Ramdas, who was 18 then, dreamed of making a film and told his friends that he would soon take this honour. One of his friends, S. Parameswaran, who studied with him at University College in Thiruvananthapuram, was also passionate about movies. The idea to make the film was born out of Ramadas's and Parameswaran's desire to make a movie \\"of the beaten track.\\" They were heavily inspired by the themes of Italian neorealism, which had already created waves in the Malayalam literary circles. The two young minds wanted to bring this new wave to cinema too. Ramadas was sure his own short story \\"Compositor\\" would be the best option to start with. The story was first published in Mahatma Malayala Masika, the world's first magazine run by students. It was later included in the book Thalirukal, published by Mahatma Publishing House. Movies of V. Shantaram also inspired Ramadas and Parameswaran to make such a \\"different\\" movie. As they had little knowledge about the technical aspects of cinema, they became regular visitors to the erstwhile American Information Library in Thrivananthapuram and read as much books available on cinema. Ramadas travelled to Madras, the then centre of South Indian filmmaking, and collected an 8 mm Kodak Baby Browny Movie Camera using which he later filmed two short films, Footpath (which was filmed from Thrissur) and Life for Film (which was filmed from Kanyakumari), which all helped him to gain some knowledge in professional movie-making. Ramadas wrote a \\"film treatment\\", by making certain changes in his short story, and developed it into a complete script by 1953 September‚ÄìOctober. The story is retold from the perspective of a twelve-year- old boy in the screenplay. The story's central character is Lonappan, who was renamed as Sankaran Nair in the screenplay. Nair's son Appu is the central character of the film while this character has little importance in the story. Ramadas approached popular writer Nagavally R. S. Kurup to write dialogues, who agreed on a payment of 1000. Kurup submitted his work soon, but was rejected by Ramadas, stating that it was written in a typical Travancore accent but the story is taking place in Thrissur. Ramadas himself rewrote the dialogues in the Thrissur-slang of Malayalam. He planned to film the movie in May 1954, after his exams, and booked a floor of the erstwhile Merryland Studio in Thiruvananthapuram for indoor shooting. The film was produced by Adarsh Kalamandir, a subdivision of Mahatma Memorial Association, founded by Ramadas and his friends in 1945 as Balasangham. The ever-growing enthusiasm of the students found the Association venturing into a field hitherto undreamt of by the student population of the world. = Casting = P. Ramdas wanted to cast amateurs and new-faces in all the departments of his film. K. C. Ponkunnam (K. C.

Balakrishnan, who played woman characters in all of Ramadas's plays, was given the job of costume designing. Krishnan Elaman, Balakrishnan and K. D. George, all of them from Merryland Studios, were chosen for sound recording, makeup and editing respectively. Ramadas's and Parameswaran's relatives were also given some jobs, like production control, lighting etc. P. K. Madhavan Nair, who was an assistant cinematographer in Malayalam films till then was chosen as the director of photography. The lead character Appu was inspired by a twelve-year-old newspaper boy Ramadas had met somewhere in a journey to Ernakulam. Ramadas and Parameswaran visited almost all schools and orphanages to find a suitable face but failed. Appu's role was at last given to Master Moni, who was introduced to Ramadas by Nagavally R. S. Kurup. His original name was Narayanan Pillai and was a relative of Kurup. Appu's brother Balan's role was given to a four-year-old boy named Narendran. Another major character, Sankaran Nair, Appu's father, was inspired by a press worker named Cheekutty. Ramadas approached Cheekutty to play this role who instantly rejected, which was later taken by Kurup himself, who had previously acted small roles in movies like Sasidharan and Navalokam. A theatre actor named Jagadamma was originally cast in the role of Kalyani Amma, Appu's mother, but was later replaced by Neyyattinkara Komalam. Other major roles were played by the members of the association or by their friends. = Filming = Ramadas knew that his Kodak Baby Browny would not be useful to film a feature-length movie. So he imported an Avery camera and a Ferrograph tape-recorder from England. The camera was found useless for professional movie making and was not used for the film. The tape-recorder was used to mix sound in the film, a too pre-mature way which would later be criticised by various mainstream critics. As planned earlier, Ramadas was able to commence shooting in May 1954 itself. The camera-switch-on ceremony was conducted by Colonel G. V. Raja on 5 May 1954 in Merryland Studios. Indoor sequences were completely filmed from Merryland using a Michelle camera while outdoor sequences were mainly filmed from Thrissur and Madras. The realism-influenced train sequence, inspired by a scene from Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, was filmed from Ernakulam South railway station. Ramadas was ready to go for any number of retakes to get the right output from the cast. For instance, he wanted to shoot the scene in which Kittummavan explains his son about Sankaran Nair's condition in a single shot. To get what he had in mind, Ramadas needed seven takes. Dialogue-dubbing was not common then and live sound recording was to be used. The Ferrograph tape- recorder was used for mixing much of the background sound. Shooting was finished in early 1955.  Release  P. Ramdas was approached by various distribution companies while filming itself, but he rejected all the offers since he was sure that they would interfere in the making of his dream film. Ramadas could not find a distributor after the production for a long time. Later, Ernakulam-based R. S .Pictures and Kottayam-based Variety Pictures agreed to distribute the film in Kochi-Malabar and Travancore respectively. The distributors gave them 50,000 on the condition that if the film did not fetch the amount within a year Ramdas had to pay back the difference. The total production cost of the film was 1,25,000, which along with the amount charged by the distribution companies for print and publicity, will make the total budget of the film . The film was screened in New Delhi on the special request of the Government of India for various Central Government institutions. The film released on 13 May 1955 in eight theatres in Travancore-Cochin and Malabar states. In Thrissur, it was screened at the Jose theatre. The film, made at a budget of , was panned by audiences who were not interested in seeing \\"their own lives onscreen\\", and ultimately became a big box office failure. Ramadas as well as his colleagues were bankrupt after the film's failure.  Critical reception  The movie opened to good reviews from various critics with many of them appreciating Ramadas for taking up such a risky and experimental film. However the film received criticism as well, mainly for its editing, sound mixing and music. A reviewer from The Bombay Chronicle said that it was pleasant to find a film that was not \\"only 'progressive' in abandoning set formulae, but progressive\\" in how it did realism. The intent was said to be serious, but without bitterness underneath. The reviewer also complimented Newspaper Boy for its universality. Sunday Standards reviewer said the film is praiseworthy, and lacking amateur quality despite being made by students; the reviewer also commented on the film's emotional nature. A critic from Blitz said that the film's title is picturesque, and the film itself was \\"wonderful\\". The critic also said the film was thought-provoking, not only about its heartwarming but \\"disturbing\\" theme, but from its being produced by students. Reel-News said that the direction was excellent and the acting was livened by its young stars. A review by Screen India stated that the unusual part of the film was its lack of usage of \\"the usual box-office devices.\\" Reviewers from the South also praised the film. Jayakeralam weekly said that the film was excellent and well-directed. A review byDeenabandhu said that the film presented the everyday life of a middle-class family with complete realism. A reviewer from Kerala Kaumudi compared the direction to that of the best non-Indian pictures. A review by Sakhavu said that those who \\"forget art and culture to make money\\" were hit hard by the film. A review by Deepam said that the producers of this film, Adarsa Kala Mandir (Temple of Art), have justified their name by this film. The beauty of Kerala, according to the reviewer, came through with no disruption of the plot. Writer-producer Rajinder Singh Bedi said that it was well-presented, well-directed and well-photographed, and wished that it would open \\"the eyes of our producers, in Bombay.\\" Film Divisions director V. R. Sharma stated that it marked a refreshingly new approach in Southern Indian film-making due to its realistic nature. He praised the acting, and said that the film's makers \\"can justifiably be proud of their achievement and deserve every encouragement.\\" I. K. Menon, Secretary of the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association, said that the realism of the film was unbelievable, with a correct portrayal of everyday life in \\"Kerala without any exaggeration or colour merely to entertain, as is usual in films.\\"  Songs  The songs are composed by Vijayan and his brother A. Ramachandran, both of them members of Mahatma Memorial Association. Background score was by Mahatma Sangeethamela, a subdivision of the Association. There are eleven songs in the film, and the playback singers include Kamukara Pusushothaman and Santha P. Nair. Ramachandran, one of the composers, says that all the songs were for a specific purpose, such as showing the passage of time. He adds his amazement about important singers agreeing to sing for them. The re-recording was done by Ramachandran alone, without his brother Vijayan, due to illness; he was not able to transfer the songs to better recording media due to inexperience. Lyrics were penned by K. C. Poonkunnam and P. Gangadharan Nair. Three traditional poems were also used. Nine songs were recorded from Merryland Studios, while the songs \\"Chirichukondeevazhikku\\" and \\"Pazhaya Yugangal\\" were recorded from Udaya Studios and from a studio in Madras respectively. Malayalam film music was copied from Hindi and Tamil film songs in those times. Ramadas wanted to change this system and in Newspaper Boy, all the tunes are original and follows the folk traditions of the State. Different from the films of that time, majority of songs were used as montage songs that appeared in the background of the film. Audio rights were bought by a newly formed Bombay-based company named Bulbil. But the company closed down before the film's release and no records were released. #\\"Kallilum Mullilum\\" ‚Äî T. A.

It was brought to the U.S. by Celso Al Carunungan, author of To Die A Thousand Deaths, a book on the life and martyrdom of Ruiz, accompanied by Father Ramon Salinas, the national director of the Movement for the Cause of San Lorenzo Ruiz and Companion Martyrs. Carunungan and Salinas, together with Filipino youth leaders Antonio Santiago and Paul John Durano Gorre, were delegated by Cardinal Sin to establish a movement for San Lorenzo Ruiz in the United States. The statue of San Lorenzo Ruiz was displayed every September at Saint Patrick's Cathedral during the mass for the saint's feast day. It was originally displayed at the Holy Family Church at the United Nations until it was transferred to the Philippine Pastoral Center in 1998. =Filipino Apostolate= The Filipino Apostolate was established by Archbishop John Cardinal O'Connor on April 11, 1995 to address the pastoral needs of Filipino Catholics in New York. It is in charge of the Chapel of San Lorenzo Ruiz and the Philippine Pastoral Center. Father Erno Diaz was appointed as the first archdiocesan coordinator and director of the Filipino Apostolate. Rev. Dr. Jose Marabe is the present Director of San Lorenzo Ruiz Chapel. In 1998, a building was leased to the Filipino Apostolate at 248 East 62nd Street in Manhattan. The building was officially named as the Philippine Pastoral Center and became a venue for priests and cultural groups in New York, giving lectures, celebrating masses and performing cultural and religious activities. =Chapel= The Chapel of San Lorenzo Ruiz officially opened on September 1, 2005.

Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was the guest of honor. Weekly masses and novenas are held in the Chapel to honor the first Filipino saint and martyr. The statue is considered miraculous by devotees. Although not an official parish church, Cardinal Egan has authorized the Chapel of San Lorenzo Ruiz to offer weekday and weekend masses and all of the Sacraments of the Church, with the exception of the Sacrament of Confirmation, as only a bishop can confer the Sacrament of Confirmation. Sunday Masses, Filipino-style weddings, baptisms, and funerals are held in the Chapel. Although it has been designated as a church for the Filipino community and was authorized to perform Filipino liturgies, it welcomes all peoples regardless of ethnicity and background to attend its services and to participate in the events held in it and the Philippine Pastoral Center. The Filipino Apostolate's aim is to elevate the designation of the Chapel of San Lorenzo Ruiz into a parish church status.

The structure was a five-bay three-storey Beaux-arts brick school house with a stone-quoined breakfront occupying the central three bays that contained a temporary church and rectory. The new church, school, and rectory cornerstone was laid on November 11, 1906 and the structure was dedicated June 30, 1907 by Archbishop John Farley. These buildings were replaced in 1930 with a new church and rectory built 1930 to the designs by Thomas Dunn and Frederick E. Gibson.

In total, there are an estimated 80,000 to 120,000 political prisoners. Durations of imprisonment are variable, however, many are condemned to labour for life. Forced labour duties within kwalliso typically include forced labour in mines (known examples including coal, gold and iron ore), tree felling, timber cutting or agricultural duties. Furthermore, camps contain state run prison farms, furniture manufacturing etc. Estimates suggest that at the start of 2007, a total of six kwalliso camps were operating within the country. Despite fourteen kwalliso camps originally operating within North Korea, these later merged or were closed following reallocation of prisoners.  Origins and development  Second only to its developing nuclear program, the violation of human rights that occurs in North Korea dominates the negative international perception of the nation. Tracing the development of these prisons, the ultimate symbol of North Korean state oppression, in a way traces the trajectory of the nation itself. Furthermore, the advent and development of the prisons can be directly linked to the severing of ties with the rest of the world and to the radicalization of the state. = Historical emergence and conceptualization = In January 1979, a report was released by Amnesty International detailing the harrowing story of Ali Lameda, a Venezuelan poet imprisoned in North Korea. He had been arrested in 1967, held for a year without trial, placed on house arrest, then incarcerated again for six years, a portion of his twenty-year sentence. It was the first ever report on human rights in North Korea. Yet this international awareness did not indicate something new, for long before this report was compiled, individuals had been systematically imprisoned for political crimes in North Korea for decades. Incarceration of political prisoners is not a uniquely North Korean or Stalinist practice. Yet the system of prisons in North Korea developed under the half-century rule of Kim Il-sung (1945‚Äì94) and currently overseen by his grandson is widely regarded as a distinctive abomination in the modern world, described as ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù, a ‚Äúmodern holocaust‚Äù, and occasionally, a ‚Äúgulag‚Äù. Therefore, contemporary use of the word ‚Äúgulag‚Äù in discussing North Korea's intricate system of prisons is a deliberate reminder of North Korea's former Soviet ties. It suggests that, along with totalitarian ideology, centralized economic planning and forced collectivization, among other practices, the systemic imprisonment of a country's citizens and purging of political enemies are inherited practices from Stalin's USSR, passed along to North Korea's ruling system. = Stalinist and Maoist influences = From its inception, North Korea has maintained a complex relationship with Russia and China. Immediately after the end of the Korean War (1953), North Korea and Kim Il- sung looked to the Soviet Union and China for both economic and military support. Prior to the great split between the Soviet Union and China in the early 1960s, Kim visited both capitals often, but the split created enormous problems for Kim, who struggled to keep on good terms with both of them. To a large extent, he owed his career as well as his country's well-being to the Soviet Union and China, yet he was always wary of their dominant power. But the Sino-Soviet dispute also gave Kim Il-sung ample space to maneuver between the two great powers of communism, each of which was forced to tolerate his independence for fear of pushing him decisively to the opposite camp. While according to North Korean mythology, Kim is the sole originator of all policy, the original leader was not original in all of his ideas. Even Juche, hailed as the fundamental original Korean ideology, has been attributed to earlier Korean philosophers. In sum, the model for the prison camp system may have come from the gulags established by Stalin in the 1930s, which ironically might have come into North Korea as a reaction against a wave of de- Stalinization, led by the Soviet Union, in the 1950s. Another possibility is that Kim's departure from Soviet doctrine indicated a shift closer to Maoist China. = Development of the prison camp system = Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK, under the United Nations Human Rights Council. North Korean history produced an endless wave after wave of persecuted individuals, yet there is no coherent trail showing when the political and penal mechanisms developed to systematically accommodate them. The story of persecuted groups in North Korea begins with the country's origin following Japan's defeat in WWII and the liberation of the Korean peninsula. In the North, Kim Il Sung systematically purged his political opponents, creating a highly centralized system that accorded him unlimited power and generated a formidable cult of personality. North Korea instituted a revolution that included genuinely popular reforms such as establishing an eight-hour work day, promoting literacy, and positing the formal equality of the sexes. However, it also included a purge of Koreans in the police and government bureaucracies who had collaborated with the Japanese colonization of Korea and a sweeping land reform program that expropriated the landholdings of absentee Japanese landlords and the native Korean landed aristocracy. Numerous purged police officials and disposed Korean landlords fled to the south, but their family members who remained in the north remained under suspicion, and many would end up imprisoned in the North Korean prison system. While Kim attempted to fuse returning Korean exiles (mostly members of the Chinese, Japanese or Soviet Russian communist parties) into the Korean Workers Party, his plans for northern Korea were challenged by other Korean political parties affiliated with two religions: Protestant Christianity and an indigenous syncretic faith known as ‚ÄúEastern Learning‚Äù (Donghak), later called ‚ÄúChurch of the Heavenly Way‚Äù (Cheondogyo). These religiously-based social movements had led the internal opposition to Japanese colonial rule in Korea and were very well organized in the northern areas of the Korean peninsula. One of these leaders was actually a first choice by the Soviets (over Kim Il Sung) to lead the newly minted North Korean state in 1945, but he turned down the invitation. Suppressing these non-communist parties led to numerous arrests and executions. And again, family members who remained in the north remained under suspicion. Another round of purges occurred during the fallout after the attempt to overthrow Kim Il Sung in 1956. Here, the practice of ‚Äúself- criticism‚Äù was introduced. People at all levels of the party, including Politburo members and government ministers, were forced to undergo these purposefully humiliating displays of dedication to the Party. These were uniquely cruel, as some victims were ousted from their jobs while a smaller number of individuals even lost their lives. This 1950s wave of persecution finally left the only faction Kim Il Sung desired: his loyal band of Manchuria-based, communist, anti-Japanese partisans who became the enduring foundation of the present North Korean regime. Yet, there are no references in the documentation to a collectivization process or a systemic means of imprisoning accused ‚Äútraitors‚Äù in dedicated camps. Today, the internment camps for people accused of political offenses or denounced as politically unreliable are reportedly run by the State Security Department. Yet in practice, the distribution of roles between the respective security agencies has apparently varied over time and between provinces, influenced by political priorities, available capacity, the relative power of senior officials, and the extent to which a particular agency enjoyed the trust of the supreme leader. In many cases, the three main security agencies‚ÄîState Security Department, Ministry of People's Security, and Military Security Command‚Äîcompeted to show their efficiency in identifying ideological opponents to gain favour with the leader. In relation to incidents or issues seen as major political threats, the leader or central-level decision-making organs required security agencies to coordinate their investigations. There are reports, for example, that semi-permanent structures were set up by secret order of Kim Jong-il and maintained under Kim Jong-un. Such a huge prison camp system ‚Äì operating in secret and completely outside the law and the reach of the law, such as is the case in North Korea ‚Äì risks becoming a dumping ground for all sorts of persons. It is widely suspected that the North Korean camps, then, became the sites for un-repatriated South Korean prisoners of war from the Korean War, or for other South Korean and Japanese citizens who have been abducted by North Korean security and police operatives over the course of the last thirty to forty years of the 20th century, and into the 21st century. In sum, there seems to have been no linear path in the evolution of the North Korean political prison camp system. It appears to have been, at once, a counteraction to de-Stalinization, a doubling down on Stalinist practices to maintain tight control, and a distancing from Stalin and Soviet practices via a gravitation to Maoist policies and influences. But whether it was a pragmatic, and clandestine, work of bureaucracy that absorbed decades of persecution, or more the work of a singular evil actor, remains unclear. Population In 2013 there were between 80,000 and 120,000 political prisoners in kwalliso. The number is down from 150,000-200,000 during the 1990s and early 2000s, due to releases, deaths, and also the near-abandonment of the family responsibility principle, where immediate family members of a convicted political criminal were also regarded as political criminals and imprisoned. The earliest estimates were from 1982, when the number was thought to be 105,000. Camp locations North Korea's kwalliso consist of a series of sprawling encampments measuring kilometers long and kilometers wide. The number of these encampments has varied over time. They are located, mostly, in the valleys between high mountains, mostly, in the northern provinces of North Korea. There are between 5,000 and 50,000 prisoners per kwalliso. The kwalliso are usually surrounded at their outer perimeters by barbed-wire fences punctuated with guard towers and patrolled by heavily armed guards. The encampments include self-contained, closed \\"village\\" compounds for single persons, usually the alleged wrongdoers, and other closed, fenced-in \\"villages\\" for the extended families of the wrongdoers. The following lists the operating kwalliso camps: * Prison camp No. 14: Kaech'≈èn, South Pyongan province * Prison camp No. 16: Hwas≈èng, North Hamgyong province. * Prison camp No. 18: Pukch'ang, South Pyongan province. * Prison camp No. 25: Ch'≈èngjin, North Hamgyong province. Camp closures Notable kwalliso closures are listed below: * In 1989, Camp No. 11 in Ky≈èngs≈èng County, North Hamgyong Province was closed in order to convert the area into a villa for Kim Il-sung. Approximately 20,000 family prisoners were transferred to other political penal-labour camps. * Prison camp No. 12 in Ch'angp'y≈èng, Ons≈èng County, North Hamgyong Province was also closed in 1989 because the camp was deemed too close to the Chinese border. * At the end of 1990, Camp No. 13 in Chongs≈èng, also Ons≈èng County, was closed. Approximately 30,000 prisoners were relocated after fears that the camp was located too close to the Chinese border. * Camp No. 26 in S≈≠ngho's Hwach≈èn-dong was closed in January 1991. * Camp No. 27 at Ch'≈ènma, North Pyong-an Province was closed in 1990 for unknown reasons. * Between 2003 and 2007 it is thought that an additional three camps were closed. Legislative structure The kwalliso are run by the State Security Department, North Korea's secret police agency and are therefore not specifically tied to the laws and courts of the North Korean government. However, each camp is expected to operate in strict accordance with state Juche ideology. =Operating principles= Detainees are regularly told that they are traitors to the nation who have betrayed their Leader and thus deserve execution, but whom the Workers' Party has decided, in its mercy, not to kill, but to keep alive in order to repay the nation for their treachery, through forced labour for the rest of their lives. The emphasis of these camps is very much placed upon collective responsibility where individuals ultimately take responsibility for their own class's \\"wrong doing\\". Kwalliso guards emphasize this point by reportedly carving excerpts from Kim Il-sung's speeches into wood signs and door entrances. Work teams are given stringent work quotas, and the failure to meet them means even further reduced food rations. =Working conditions= Below-subsistence level food rations coupled with hard, forced labour results in a high level of deaths in detention not only as a result of working to death but also by rife disease caused by poor hygiene conditions. Corn rations are the usual staple diet of any prisoner but these may be supplemented by other foods found during labour such as weeds and animals. Each five-person work group has an informant, as does every prison camp \\"village\\". Survivors and commentators have compared the conditions of these camps to those operated in Central and Eastern Europe by Nazi Germany during World War II in the Holocaust calling the DPRK's network of political prison camps the North Korean Holocaust. There have also been comparisons between the North Korean network of political prison camps to the penal labor colonies of the USSR under Joseph Stalin, with many Western media outlets describing \\"Kwalliso\\" as \\"North Korea's Gulag\\" Internment of prisoners Defector statements suggest prisoners come to the camps in two ways: * Individuals are likely taken and escorted by the State Security Department, detained in small cells and subjected to intense and prolonged interrogation, involving beatings and severe torture, after which they are dispatched to one of the prison labour camps. * Family members: The primary suspect in the family is firstly escorted to the prison camp, and the Bowibu officers later escort family members from their home to the encampment. Family members are usually allowed to bring their own goods with them into the camp; however, these are usually only used by prisoners as bribing commodities later on. Encampment outlay Guard towers and barbed wire fences usually demark camp boundaries apart from where terrain is impassable. Prisoners are housed within scattered villages usually at the base of valleys and mountains. Single inhabitants are sub grouped accordingly into an assigned communal cafeterias and dormitories and families are usually placed into shack rooms and are required to feed themselves. =Zoning of prison camps= Areas of the encampments are zoned or designated accordingly for individuals or families of the wrong-doers or wrong-thinkers. Both individuals and families are further sub divided accordingly into either a \\"revolutionary processing zone\\" or \\"total control zone\\": * The \\"revolutionary processing zone\\" () accommodates prisoners having the opportunity of future release from the camp back into society. Thus these prisoners are likely ideologically re-educated in so called \\"revolutionizing\\" areas of the camp ‚Äì tasks include forced memorization of speeches by Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il with specific emphasis placed on re-education of children. A revolutionary processing zone is thought to be operating in Pukch'ang concentration camp and also at Yod≈èk concentration camp in South Hamgyong Province. * There is no reported re-education of prisoners in \\"total control zones\\" () presumably because these prisoners are not seen fit to be released and are deemed counter-revolutionary. Awareness According to North Korean defectors ordinary North Korean citizens are aware that the camps exist, if not the exact locations. Political prisoners are referred to as the \\"people who are sent to the mountains\\".  Demand for closure  Amnesty International summarises the human rights situation North Korea's kwalliso camps: \\"Men, women and children in the camp face forced hard labour, inadequate food, beatings, totally inadequate medical care and unhygienic living conditions. Many fall ill while in prison, and a large number die in custody or soon after release.\\" The organization demands the immediate closure of all other political prison camps in North Korea. The demand is supported by the International Coalition to Stop Crimes against Humanity in North Korea, a coalition of over 40 human rights organizations.

She is known as the author of the Riddle homophobia scale and published work on women's studies, homophobia, services and metaphysics. Biography =Early life= Dorothy Irene Riddle was born on January 12, 1944 in Chicago, United States.Distinguished alumni: Dorothy Irene Riddle Woodstock School, Accessed Dec 17, 2010. With the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, foreigners were forced to leave the country and the family moved to India as refugees. The early experience of poverty and social issues in China and India came to influence much of Riddle's studies and professional career in later years.About the founder Service Growth, Accessed Dec. 17, 2010. =Education= Riddle started school in 1950 at Woodstock School, a boarding school in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, India, where her grandfather, Allen Parker, had been principal. She graduated it as the valedictorian of her class in 1960 and moved back to United States to attend college. Riddle studied psychology and philosophy at the University of Colorado and graduated with B.A., summa cum laude. She received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, with a minor in statistics and research methodology, from Duke University in 1968 and an M.B.A. specializing in service industries from the University of Arizona in 1981. =Professional life= Dorothy Riddle's professional career has concentrated on the issues of feminism and women's studies, homosexuality and homophobia, and on services and economic development, focusing on the initiatives that empower disadvantaged groups and economies. She has also written extensively on metaphysics and spirituality. Women's studies After receiving her doctorate in 1968, Riddle had difficulty finding work in academia, as many universities at the time were not used to hiring women professors. Witnessing the injustice, Riddle became passionate about women's issues. She became a founding member of the Association for Women in Psychology, and introduced feminist analysis in the seminar 'Psychology of Social Issues' at the College of William and Mary where she was hired as an Assistant Professor of Psychology. She traveled frequently to Washington, DC to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment against discrimination based on person's sex or gender, and pressured the American Psychological Association to address women's issues fully by acting as the spokesperson of the Association of Women in Psychology.Davis, S. F., and Buskist, W. (ed), (2008). 21st century psychology: A reference handbook, Thousand Oaks; SAGE Publications, 29 In 1969, after an Association for Women in Psychology group had worked on a series of demands, Riddle and Phyllis Chesler presented the demands at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association. Chesler prepared a statement on the APA's obligations to women and demanded one million dollars in reparation for the damage psychology had perpetrated against allegedly mentally ill and traumatized women.Robert Reinhold, \\"Women Criticize Psychology Unit; $1-Million in Reparations Is Demanded at Convention\\", The New York Times, September 6, 1970. In the early 1970s, Riddle spoke and wrote on women's health, sexuality and sex roles and taught courses on these topics. In 1971, she launched the first BA-granting women's studies program at Richmond College (now the College of Staten Island, City University of New York (CUNY)) and was appointed to the first CUNY affirmative action committee. She co-founded a feminist counseling service (Alternatives for Women) in 1973 in Tucson, Arizona where she conceptualized the empowerment model used in feminist therapy, and introduced the use of political analysis in psychotherapy.Hill, M. (ed), (1998) Feminist therapy as political act, 21 (2), Binghamton, New York: Haworth Press In the 1990s, Riddle started to advocate for women business owners and helped to organize the first trade missions between Canada and the U.S. for women business owners. She is currently a Research Associate with the University of British Columbia Centre for Women‚Äôs and Gender Studies where she continues to focus on women services business entrepreneurs.Research Associates UBC Centre for Women‚Äôs and Gender Studies, Accessed Dec. 23, 2010. Homophobia In 1974, Dorothy Riddle was appointed to the American Psychological Association Task Force on the Status of Lesbian and Gay Male Psychologists, leading to APA's official statement in 1975 that homosexuality is not a mental disorder, and their condemnation of the conversion therapy to change a person's sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. The APA's position paved the way for the official change in status of homosexuality from a psychiatric disorder to a lifestyle.Kimble, G. A. and Wertheimer, M., (2000). Portraits of Pioneers in Psychology, Vol. 4.Washington, D.C: American Psychological Association. In parallel with her work on the APA Task Force on the Status of Lesbian and Gay Male Psychologists, Riddle developed a scale for measuring homophobia while a professor in the Psychology Department of the University of Arizona.Staten Island LGBT history Staten Island LGBT Community Center, Accessed Dec. 19, 2010. The tool became known as the Riddle homophobia scale and was adopted by many organizations in anti-discriminatory training and for measuring changes in a range of other social attitudes as well.Wall, V., (1995). Beyond tolerance: Gays, lesbians and bisexuals on campus. A handbook of structured experiences and exercises for training and development. American College Personnel Association. Riddle showed in her studies that lesbians, gays and bisexuals have the potential to be positive role models of nontraditional gender roles, individual relationships and individual diversity,Garnets, L., and Kimmel, D. S. (eds), (2003) Psychological perspectives on lesbian, gay and bisexual experiences, 2nd ed.

Illinois: The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. and argued that lesbian patients need lesbian psychotherapists free from heterosexual bias to better understand their problems.Falco, K. L., (1991). Psychotherapy with lesbian clients: theory into practice. New York: Brunner/Mazel. Services In 1981, Riddle joined the faculty of the American Graduate School of International Management in Glendale, Arizona where she developed the first courses on international services trade and international services management. In 1986, she published Service-Led Growth: The Role of the Service Sector in World Development, an analysis of the service sectors of 81 countries at four levels of development. It was the first major study to focus on the critical role of the service sector in economic development and has been widely credited for that.Boddewyn, J. J., Halbrich, M. B., and Perry, A.

She was known for portraits and genre scenes of rural Mexican farmers, formal portraits of prominent Mexican-Americans and pastel paintings of Native American subjects. As a precocious young artist, Martinez studied with the famous Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. She moved to the Los Angeles area in 1963 and lived with her family in Hacienda Heights. Martinez died from cancer in 1998.The Los Angeles Times Obituary dated January 16, 1998, references her cause of death. Childhood and artistic training Esperanza Martinez was born as Esperanza Perez was in Mexico City in 1934. She was a precocious talent who began drawing at the age of three at her grandfather's urging. She began painting under the supervision of an art teacher at seven and then, as she matured, she began to study more formally and sold her first painting at the age of twelve. In later interviews she stated that she received little encouragement from her family as they felt that female artists like Frida Kahlo were less than virtuous women.This comment came in an interview a few years before her untimely death. Martinez credited Frida Kahlo's husband, Diego Rivera, with giving her the confidence to become a professional artist.All this information is referenced in the Los Angeles Times obituary on January 16, 1998 and also in Shifra Goldman's biographical essay. Artistic maturity and the United States Martinez and her family emigrated to the United States in 1963. Her brother Alvaro Perez, followed her to the United States a few years later and began working for her Los Angeles dealer. In Los Angeles she began to develop a reputation for her detailed and lifelike portraits of Mexican-American sitters. While she had been influenced early in her life by Diego Rivera and she credited him with helping start her career, she chose a much more detailed, even academic style that River's for her mature work.See Shifra Goldman's essay in Yesterday and Tomorrow: California Women Artists, Pages 202-229. In Los Angeles Martinez painted the authentic farm people of rural Mexico, dignified paintings of elderly male and female farmers and she did many paintings of Mexican children. Martinez worked mainly in pastel on toned paper and also in oils. Some of her work was done on black velvet, a technique that while associated with inexpensive tourist paintings, actually has a long tradition in the former Spanish Colonies of Mexico and the Philippines. Her paintings were simply signed with her first name \\"Esperanza.\\".Ask Art web site biography. By the 1970s, she was painting many Native American subjects, sometimes contemporary, living Indians from the Southwest, but also portraits of well known historical figures such as Chief Joseph and Sitting Bull.

Woodcut, c. 1590. The Doctrina Christiana () was an early book on the Catholic Catechism, written in 1590 by Fray Juan de Plasencia, and is believed to be one of the earliest printed books in the Philippines. Title Spanish title: In English: In Tagalog (Filipino): History First page of Doctrina Christiana en letra y lengua china, by Juan Cobo, in Classical Chinese based on Hokkien used by Sangleys in Spanish Colonial Philippines There is some controversy about which of the versions is the first printed book in Spanish Philippines, with some scholars believing that the Chinese-language version titled Doctrina Christiana en letra y lengua China, compuesta por los padres ministros de los Sangleyes, de la Orden de Sancto Domingo. Con licencia, por Keng yong, China, en el parian de Manila () by Fray Miguel de Benavides, OP, was printed between 1590 and 1592 by the Chinese printer Keng Yong in Manila before the Spanish and Tagalog versions. One of the earliest references to both versions comes from G√≥mez P√©rez Dasmari√±as, the seventh Spanish Governor- General of the Philippines, who wrote a letter to Philip II of Spain on 20 June 1593, that read: Missionary fathers placed the Doctrina among the books necessary to have in print in foreign lands. As such, the Filipino book is similar to one printed in Mexico in 1539 in Spanish and local Mexican vernacular, followed by Saint Francis Xavier‚Äôs Doutrina Christ√£o in Malay printed by the Jesuit press at Goa in 1557. Another Doctrina was printed in Spanish and the native languages at Lima in 1584. =Extant print copies= Apart from the copy in the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, there are no other known copies in existence today. Both the quality of the paper, age, natural agents and disasters such as earthquakes and fires all contributed to the disappearance of most printed copies. The only known existing copies of early Philippine books are those sent to Europe during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, which may lie uncatalogued in some library. Such was the case for the copy sent to Philip II of Spain by the Governor-General Dasmari√±as in 1593. This is believed to be the same copy that reappeared in 1946 in the possession of a Parisian bookseller and collector who specialised in Pacific imprints. William H. Schab, a New York City dealer, purchased the book and took it to the United States, where he resold it to Lessing J. Rosenwald, who in turn presented it to the Library of Congress where it remains today. The only known surviving copy of the Chinese version is stored at the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid. Contents The title literally means ‚ÄúThe Teachings of Christianity‚Äù, and thus the primary goal of the book was to propagate Christian teaching across the Philippine archipelago. The book consists of 38 leaves and 74 pages of text in Spanish, Tagalog transliterated into roman letters, and Tagalog in its original Tagalog Baybayin (Sulat Tagalog) script, under a woodcut of Saint Dominic, with the verso originally blank, although in contemporary versions bears the manuscript inscription, \\"Tassada en dos reales\\", signed Juan de Cuellar. After a syllabary comes the basic prayers: the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary, Credo, and the Salve Regina. Following these are Articles of Faith, the Ten Commandments, Commandments of the Holy Church, Sacraments of the Holy Church, Seven Mortal Sins, Fourteen Works of Charity, the Confiteor and a brief Catechism. Characteristics The book was printed on paper made from mulberry. The size of the volume, which is unbound, is 9‚Öõ by 7 inches, although individual leaves vary somewhat due to chipping. Some of the leaves have become separated from their complements, but enough remain in the original stitching to indicate that the book was originally made up in four gatherings, the first of twelve leaves, the second of ten, the third of ten, and the fourth of six. Although the book is of the size called quarto, the method of printing must have been page by page, so it is doubtful that each sheet was folded twice in the usual quarto manner, but more probable that it was printed four pages to a sheet of paper approximately 9‚Öõ by 14 inches, which was folded once. The volume was printed using the xylographic technique, printing each page of text from one hand carved woodblock. Vertical lines long the inner margins of some pages were made by the inked edge of the block, and the grain of the wood appears as striations throughout the printed areas.

He played largely in the shadow of all-time Michigan football legends Benny Friedman and Bennie Oosterbaan during the 1925 and 1926 seasons, but blossomed into a nationally known football star in 1927. Gilbert and Oosterbaan were the offensive stars for the 1927 Michigan Wolverines football team, the first team to play in Michigan Stadium. Gilbert helped lead Michigan to a 4-0 start early in the 1927 season, outscoring opponents 89 to 0. On October 1, 1927, in the first game played at Michigan Stadium, Gilbert had a hand in every point scored in a 33-0 win over Ohio Wesleyan. Gilbert scored two touchdowns, kicked three extra points, and threw three touchdown passes in the game. In its account of the game, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote, \\"Louis Gilbert, the back field ace who has borne the brunt of the Wolverine kicking for the last two years, was the outstanding performer of today's play.\\" In the official dedication game for the new stadium, played three weeks later, Gilbert scored the only points of the game on three touchdown receptions and three extra points as the Wolverines defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes, 21-0. Gilbert drew particular praise for his kicking. A Chicago Daily Tribune profile on the Wolverines in late October 1927 noted: > \\"Long punts and place kicks by Louis Gilbert and short, accurate passes by > Benny Oosterbaan were the features of the Wolverines' workout today ... > Standing on or behind the 30 yard line Gilbert consistently launched his > place kicks squarely between the posts, the longest effort being 47 yards. > Standing in midfield he then vied with Coach Kipke in placing his punts > offside within the five yard line.\\" An injury to Gilbert's arm kept him out of the Illinois game, which Michigan lost, 14-0. When it was announced that Gilbert would be back in time for the game against the Chicago Maroons, newspapers across the country touted the return of Michigan's star halfback. A United Press story published prior to the Chicago game noted: > \\"The 'kick' is once more in Michigan's lineup. Louis Gilbert is back. The > Kalamazoo flash, a punter probably without a peer in the Big Ten, and a > forward passer without compunction for enemy defenses, rejoined the Maize > and Blue today after an absence since Saturday morning when a sudden arm > injury jerked him from the Illinois-Michigan game which subsequently ruined > Michigan's chances to again cop the prized Big Ten gonfalon for 1927. His > return served as a tonic for his teammates, as he is expected to boot the > oval with usual accuracy and distance against Coach Stagg's Maroons > Saturday. Gilbert practiced kicking while his mates polished up its > offensive and his uncanny forward pass receiver, Bennie Ooslerbaan, limbered > up for his notorious end sneaks.\\" The Chicago Daily Tribune called him \\"the kickingest young man in the Big Ten\\" and \\"the best advertised player at Stagg field Saturday.\\" The Tribune noted that, although he had not received public acclaim in his sophomore and junior years because of the spotlight on Benny Friedman, he had become the focus of attention in Ann Arbor and \\"one of the leading ladies' men in the Big Ten.\\"Chicago Tribune, October 1927 In his return to the lineup against Chicago, Gilbert and Oosterbaan led Michigan to a 14-0 victory. Oosterbaan threw a touchdown pass to Gilbert for the first score, and Gilbert threw a touchdown pass to Oosterbaan for the final score. The Chicago Daily Tribune again focused its coverage on Gilbert's status as a ladies' man, referring to him as \\"the campus sheik from the neighborhood of Kalamazoo,\\" and noting that he \\"wears bear grease on his hair and dances a mean black bottom.\\" After the Chicago game, Gilbert ranked second in scoring in the Big Ten with eight touchdowns and 12 extra point conversions.(\\"Louis Gilbert of Kalamazoo, Michigan's great all-around football star, is edging toward the top of the list of leading scorers of the Western Conference.\\") Interviewed in November 1927, Michigan's first-year head coach Tad Wieman told reporters he \\"never knew two men in his life more unconcerned in the heat of battle than Gilbert and Benny Friedman, last year's Michigan all-American quarterback whom Gilbert succeeded as a forward-passing partner of Beanie Oosterbaan.\\" At the end of the 1927 season, and although he did not start any games at quarterback, he was selected by the Big Ten Conference coaches as the first-team quarterback for the International News Service (later merged with the United Press into UPI) All-Big Ten team. He was also selected as a first-team All-Big Ten halfback by both Billy Evans and Walter Eckersall. In selecting Gilbert, Eckersall wrote: \\"Gilbert of Michigan is selected for left halfback. This player was one of the best punters in the country. His kicks were well placed and put Michigan in scoring positions many times. He was also an accurate place-kicker. He carried the ball well on end runs and off tackle slants, did his share of the blocking and played a strong defensive game.\\" He was also selected as a second-team All-American by the Central Press Association, billed as the \\"Real\\" All-American team with selections based on fan input with cooperation from \\"hundreds of newspapers throughout the country.\\" The United Press and Billy Evans both selected Gilbert as a third-team All-American. At the time of his retirement in 1941, Fielding H. Yost named Gilbert as the greatest punter of all time. Later years Gilbert graduated from Michigan in 1928. He worked as a national sales executive for James River Corporation, a paper mill in Parchment, Michigan, for 45 years. He was also a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, a county commissioner in Barry County, Michigan, for two years and the Barry County road commissioner for five years. After retiring, Gilbert moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. In May 1987, he died in St. Petersburg at age 80. He was survived by his wife, Harriett C. Gilbert, two sons, Bartlett and Bradley, two daughters, Nancy Boersma and Eleanor Holiday, nine grandchildren, and three great- granddaughters.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Santo Isidoro e Livra√ß√£o. In 2001 there were 1495 inhabitants in a region fronting the Douro. History Near the locality of Bou√ßas, exists Penedo da Moura, a large collection of stones that were likely a dismantled dolmen, and in its surroundings are the vestages of castros and small human settlements, such as in Toutosa and Canaveses (the lateral a Roman village). During the medieval period, Santo Isidoro acted as a stopping point for wayfarers and pilgrims transiting the region, but obtained local administrative privileges owing to its master, Egas Moniz. Celebrated nobleman in service to Afonso Henriques, Moniz was master of Canaveses and the Tu√≠as, he was responsible for installing the legal magistrates in these territories, and his signeurial holdings lead to the annex of Canaveses. A regal charter by Manuel I, dated July 1497, clearly affirmed, \\"...the town of Canaveses, and the localities and the annexes\\" were registered to Egas Moniz. But, any illusions of privileges ended in 1550, by order of John III, following the death of his nephew Manuel. Administratively, the parish was integrated into the municipality of Santa Cruz de Riba T√¢mega, and only joined Marco de Canaveses in the 19th century. In 1809, Santo Isidoro de Riba-T√¢mega suffered from the French invasions: it was near the centre that a bloody battle ensued between the French and Portuguese. A cross was erected near this site to mark the event. Geography A view of the T√¢mega River flowing on the south margin of Santo Isidoro The local areas name, in homage to Saint Isidore of Seville, provides an understanding of the regions link to religious activities. In fact, the name provides an indication of the age, since the parish seat occupies the summit of a large mountaintop, with a slope that followed the T√¢mega and its effluents. Lying on the bank of the T√¢mega, also known as the Riba T√¢mega, the parish occupies the flanks of the hills of Santa Cruz, delimited by Toutosa, Sobret√¢mega, Vila Ca√≠z (Amarante) and the river. It is from the municipal seat. The important point in the parish is the Centro Cultural, Recreativo e Folcl√≥rico de Santo Isidoro, the only local association that originates in Santo Isidoro. Economy The rural area is primarily responsible for agriculture, with other activities in the textile and forest industry occupying a secondary role in the communities. Industry is the important activity, responsible for employing 57% of the working population. Architecture The historical architecture of Santo Isidoro is simple, with the ostentatious Casa da Boavista, being the exception. Home to a traditional family, the interior is marked by a coat-of-arms and panels of azulejos; it was restored in order to introduce and promote rural tourism. In addition, the following architectural buildings have been classified by national patrimonial institutions: * Bridge of Bairro (), the medieval Romanesque bridge of a single archway, is located in the locality of Bairro, some from the community centre; * Church of Santo Isidoro (), dating from the Romanesque period, the small temple included three altars, with an image of the patron (a sculpture by Teixeira Lopes, offered in 1898 to Azevedo Maia, parish priest) and grande frescoes likely authored by Moraes.

In it, Hawthorne parodies the seventeenth-century book The Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan, which portrays a Christian's spiritual \\"journey\\" through life. In this story, the pilgrim journeys by iron horse rather than by foot, the burden of sin that Bunyan portrays is pulled by the same train, and Bunyan's figure Evangelist, preaching a message of conversion, is replaced by a figure known as \\"Mr. Smooth-it-away.\\" Hawthorne mostly wrote against his own religious belief,http://pinkmonkey.com/dl/library1/haw15.pdf popular at the time, Unitarianism or Transcendentalism,https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ but according to some educators, several of his comments also indicate his dissatisfaction with Bunyan's religiously exclusive theology.Wood, Clifford A. \\"Teaching Hawthorne's \\"The Celestial Railroad.\\" The English Journal 54.7 (1965): 601-605: 601. In addition to this underlying view, however, he states \\"we were rushing by the place where Christian's burden fell from his shoulders at the sight of the Cross...for our burdens were rich in many things esteemed precious throughout the world.\\" The story ends with the traveler's relief that what he'd seen was just a dream and an element of hope that is rare in Hawthorne's romantic era literature. The American composer Charles Ives based the second movement of his Fourth Symphony on Hawthorne's story, expanding on his earlier piece for solo piano, also entitled The Celestial Railroad.

The battle was fought between the Maratha army under Shivaji and General Kartalab Khan of the Mughal Empire. The Marathas decisively defeated the Mughal forces. This battle was a great example of guerrilla warfare. On the orders of Aurangzeb, Shahista Khan sent Kartalab Khan to attack Rajgad. Shivaji's men encountered them in a midway, that is The Umberkhind. Battle Shivaji wanted Kartalab and the famous Rai Bagan (Royal Tigress), the wife of Deshmukh of Mahur Sarkar of Berar Subah Raje Udaram, to enter Umberkhind, so that they become easy prey to his guerilla technique. When the Mughals entred Umberkhind, a 15 miles passage, Shivaji's men started blowing horns. The whole Mughal army got stunned. Then Marathas attacked the Mughal army with arrows. The Kartalab khan and Rai Bagan with other Mughal soldiers tried to retaliate, but the forest was so dense and the Maratha army was so quick that the Mughals could not even see the enemy. The situation was such that Mughal soldiers were getting killed without seeing where the enemy is and without knowing where to shoot. A number of mughal soldiers died this way. Rai Bagan then advised Kartalab khan, that he should surrender himself to Shivaji and ask for mercy. She said, \\"You have made a mistake by putting the whole army in the lion's jaw. Shivaji is the lion. You should not have chosen this path to attack Shivaji. Now, to save these dying soldiers, you should surrender yourself to Shivaji. Unlike Mughals, Shivaji shows amnesty for those who surrender.\\" Battle lasted for an hour or two. And then Kartalab khan on advise of Rai Bagan, sent the soldiers with white flag for truce. They shouted ‚Äú truce, truce!‚Äù and within a minute got encircled by Shivaji's men. Then on the condition of paying huge ransom and surrendering all the arms, the Kartalab Khan was allowed to go back. Shivaji then stationed Netaji Palkar in Umberkhind to keep a check on the mughals, if they come back.

The habitat is in or at the margins of coastal rainforests, up to 300 metres above sea level. In Western Australia it grows in drier areas; such as rocky sites, gorges, cliffs, floodplains and creek beds. The leaves may be drawn into a blunt tip, a prickle or a sharp tip. They are variable in shape, usually 4 to 15 cm long, 2 to 6 cm wide. The young leaves are not as hairy as with the related downy chance. The generic term Clerodendrum is from the Greek, meaning \\"lottery tree\\". The term \\"lottery\\" refers to an unsure possibility of a medicinal value from plants of this genus. The specific epithet floribundum refers to the abundance of flowers in showy heads. The fruit is a black drupe, growing on an enlarged red fleshy calyx. It appears glossy and succulent, giving rise to the common name \\"lolly bush\\". Usually a small tree, however it has been recorded at 30 metres tall with a stem diameter of 30 cm at Booyong Flora Reserve, in northern New South Wales. (other publication details, included in citation) White fragrant flowers form in cymes between September and December. There is some debate whether this plant is found in rainforests of the Illawarra. A.G.Floyd says it is found as far south as Batemans Bay and growing north to Cape York at the northernmost point of the continent. Then west through the Northern Territory and Western Australia. However, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney say records in the far south east may not be accurate.* The leaves are host to the caterpillar of the Fiery Jewel Butterfly. Regeneration is from fresh seeds or cuttings. It is an easy plant to grow, requiring plenty of water. In 1810, this species first appeared in scientific literature, in the Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae, authored by the prolific Scottish botanist, Robert Brown. Originally collected on the voyage of Captain Cook's ship, the Endeavour. Several varieties appear in publications, such as: * Clerodendrum floribundum var. floribundum * Clerodendrum floribundum var. attenuatum * Clerodendrum floribundum var. latifolium * Clerodendrum floribundum var. coriaceum * Clerodendrum floribundum var. angustifolium File:Clerodendrum Mount Keira.JPGleaves, Mount Keira, Australia File:Clerodendrum floribundum flowers.jpgFlowers File:Clerodendrum floribundum fruits.jpgFruit References Ornamental trees Flora of New South Wales Flora of Queensland Flora of the Northern Territory Flora of Western Australia Flora of New Guinea floribundum Trees of Australia Plants described in 1810 Taxa named by Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773) ","title":"Clerodendrum floribundum"},{"id":"30220369","text":"Amin Shokrollahi (born 1964) is an Iranian mathematician who has worked on a variety of topics including coding theory and algebraic complexity theory.

He collaborated with legendary director Fritz Lang on multiple occasions.Gottfried Huppertz Biography Life Huppertz studied at the Conservatory of Music in Cologne and worked during World War I in Coburg, where he debuted in 1910 as a singer and actor. In 1920 he went to Berlin as an opera singer at the Nollendorfplatz theatre. His first composition, \\"Rankende Rosen\\", was dedicated to the actor Rudolf Klein-Rogge, who introduced him in the early 1920s to director Fritz Lang and to Thea von Harbou (who later married Lang, but was at the time still married to Klein-Rogge). In the film, Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler (1922), Huppertz worked as an extra in the role of a hotel manager. Huppertz composed his first film score for Lang's film Die Nibelungen (1924). While working on his 1925 score for the film Chronicles of the Gray House, Huppertz began working on the score of another film for Lang, Metropolis (1927). This became his best-known film score. Besides scoring, Huppertz also wrote songs. Only some of his music has been recorded.

Turkey Dance, Caddo Tribal Complex, Binger, Oklahoma, 2000 The dance takes place in the afternoon and finished by sunset, when turkeys return to their roosts.Carter 359 Caddos traditionally founded their villages and camps near turkey roosts, because the turkeys served as sentinels ‚Äî creating noises when people approached. History The turkey dances are ancient, and several stories of their origin exist. One explanation is that a Caddo man, hunting in the forest, heard singing. The source was a rafter of turkey hens dancing in a circle around a tom turkey. The hunter carefully observed and memorized the dance to share with his tribe.\\"Caddo Nation Today.\\" Texas Beyond History. (retrieved 27 Dec 2010) 18th-century Spanish missionaries wrote descriptions of Hasinai women dancing the turkey dance when warriors returned to their village. In the 21st century, Caddo women still dance with a ceremonial cane presented to the tribe by the Spanish before 1809. The Caddo have continuously maintained the turkey dance, but it particularly enjoyed a revival after World War II.Carter 46 Dance In a day of Caddo dances, the turkey dance is the first one performed. The dance has several phases. In the past, women danced around a pole.Parsons, Elsie Clews. \\"Notes on the Caddo.\\" Memories of the American Anthropological Association. 1921 on Access Genealogy. (retrieved 27 Dec 2010) During the third phase the women cluster around the men drumming in the center of the dance area. During the final phase, the women dancers get to choose male dance partners. The dance is concluded with a flag song and the lowering of the US flag in honor of Caddo veterans. The dance movements of the women may have been inspired by turkey movements.Carter 41 Today turkey dances are usually held at the Caddo National Tribal Complex dance grounds in Binger, Oklahoma. The Hasinay Society and Caddo Cultural Club both perform turkey dances. Regalia Caddo women's dance regalia include handmade dresses, broadcloth blankets, beadwork, and dush-tohs, that is a plaque adorned with brass or mirrors and flowing ribbons. Dresses are ankle-length with ribbons sewn around the skirt. Blouses match the skirts in color and have flared yokes. Over their skirts, women wear full- length aprons.Carter 358 Songs 52 Caddo turkey dance songs are still sung today. They recount Caddo historical events in the many dialects that comprise the Caddo language.Cross, Phil. \\"Caddo Songs and Dances.\\" Caddo Legacy for Caddo People. (retrieved 27 Dec 2010) Many recount military exploits, but they begin with oral history of the creation of the Caddo people. One song tells about the overnight creation of Caddo Lake.

Paris Psalter, 10th century. Byzantine silk is silk woven in the Byzantine Empire (Byzantium) from about the fourth century until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Byzantine capital of Constantinople was the first significant silk-weaving center in Europe. Silk was one of the most important commodities in the Byzantine economy, used by the state both as a means of payment and of diplomacy.Laiou, Angeliki. \\"Exchange and Trade \\". In Laiou (2002), p. 703 Raw silk was bought from China and made up into fine fabrics that commanded high prices throughout the world. Later, silkworms were smuggled into the Empire and the overland silk trade gradually became less important. After the reign of Justinian I, the manufacture and sale of silk became an imperial monopoly, only processed in imperial factories, and sold to authorized buyers. Byzantine silks are significant for their brilliant colours, use of gold thread, and intricate designs that approach the pictorial complexity of embroidery in loom-woven fabric.Schoeser (2007), p. 27 Byzantium dominated silk production in Europe throughout the Early Middle Ages, until the establishment of the Italian silk- weaving industry in the 12th century and the conquest and break-up of the Byzantine Empire in the Fourth Crusade (1204). Development Byzantine silk with a pattern of birds and griffins in roundels. In the time of the Roman Empire, silk textiles reached the West overland via the Silk Road across Asia from Han China, passing through the Parthian Empire and later Sassanid Empire to trading centers in Syria. Imports of raw silk, silk yarn, and finished fabrics are all recorded, but the techniques of producing these textiles from the silkworm bombyx mori remained a closely guarded secret of the Chinese until the Emperor of the East Justinian I (482‚Äì565) arranged to have silkworm eggs smuggled out of Central Asia in 553-54,Wild, John Peter. \\"The eastern Mediterranean 323 BC‚ÄìAD 350.\\" In Jenkins (2003), p. 108. setting the stage for the flowering of the Byzantine silk-weaving industry. Shortly after the smuggling of silkworm eggs from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th- century Byzantine historian Menander Protector writes of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Ist√§mi, the G√∂kt√ºrk ruler of the Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sassanid king of kings for the privilege of traveling through Persian territories in order to trade with the Byzantines.Howard, Michael C., Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies, the Role of Cross Border Trade and Travel, McFarland & Company, 2012, p. 133. Ist√§mi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sassanid king, the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned to death. Maniah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Ist√§mi to send an embassy directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.Liu, Xinru, \\"The Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Interactions in Eurasia\\", in Michael Adas (ed), Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History, ed. Michael Adas, American Historical Association, Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001, p. 168.Mark J. Dresden (1981), \\"Introductory Note,\\" in Guitty Azarpay (ed), Sogdian Painting: the Pictorial Epic in Oriental Art, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, p. 9, . However, even with the Byzantine production of silk starting in the 6th century, Chinese varieties were still considered of better quality, a fact that is perhaps underscored by the discovery of a Byzantine solidus coin minted during the reign of Justin II found in a Sui dynasty (581-618 AD) Chinese tomb of Shaanxi province in 1953, among other Byzantine coins found at various sites.Luttwak, Edward N. (2009). The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire. Cambridge and London: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. , pp 168-169. According to Chinese histories, the Byzantines (i.e. \\"Fu-lin\\"), maintaining an earlier Roman diplomatic tradition in China, also sent several embassies to the court of the Chinese Tang dynasty (618-907 AD) and on one occasion to that of the Song dynasty (960-1279), offering exotic gifts such as glasswares while demonstrating a continual interest in the Chinese silk trade. The 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta provided a fairly accurate depiction of China, its geography, its reunification by the Sui dynasty (581-618), and even named its ruler Taisson as meaning \\"Son of God\\", perhaps also derived from the name Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626-649).Yule, Henry (1915). Henri Cordier (ed.), Cathay and the Way Thither: Being a Collection of Medieval Notices of China, Vol I: Preliminary Essay on the Intercourse Between China and the Western Nations Previous to the Discovery of the Cape Route. London: Hakluyt Society. Accessed 22 September 2016, pp 29-31; see also footnote #4 on p. 29; footnote #2 on p. 30; and footnote #3 on page 31. Contemporary Chinese sources, namely the Old and New Book of Tang, also depicted the city of Constantinople and how it was besieged by Muawiyah I (founder of the Umayyad Caliphate), who exacted tribute afterwards.Henry Yule expressed some amazement that even the name of the Byzantine negotiator \\"Yenyo\\" (i.e. the patrician Ioannes Petzigaudias) was mentioned in Chinese sources, an envoy who was unnamed in Edward Gibbon's account of the man sent to Damascus to hold a parley with the Umayyads, followed a few years later by the increase of tributary demands on the Byzantines; see Yule, Henry (1915).

London: Hakluyt Society. Accessed 22 September 2016, pp 48‚Äì49; and for the brief summary of Edward Gibbon's account, see also footnote #1 on p. 49. New types of looms and weaving techniques also played a part. Plain-woven or tabby silks had circulated in the Roman world, and patterned damask silks in increasingly complex geometric designs appear from the mid-3rd century. Weft- faced compound twills were developed not later than 600, and polychrome (multicoloured) compound twills became the standard weave for Byzantine silks for the next several centuries.Wild, John Peter. \\"The later Roman and early Byzantine East, AD 300‚Äì1000.\\" In Jenkins (2003), pp. 148‚Äì149Muthesius, Anna. \\"Essential Processes, Looms, and Technical Aspects of the Production of Silk Textiles \\". In Laiou (2002), pp. 152‚Äì154. Monochrome lampas weaves became fashionable around 1000 in both Byzantine and Islamic weaving centres; these fabrics rely on contrasting textures rather than colour to render patterns. A small number of tapestry-woven Byzantine silks also survive. Regulations governing the use of expensive Tyrian purple dyestuffs varied over the years, but cloth dyed in these colours was generally restricted to specific classes and was used in diplomatic gifts. Other dyes used in Byzantine silk workshops were madder, kermes, indigo, weld, and sappanwood.Muthesius, \\"Essential Processes, Looms, and Technical Aspects...\\", pp. 158‚Äì160. Gold thread was made with silver-gilt strips wrapped around a silk core.Muthesius, Anna, \\"Silk in the Medieval World\\". In Jenkins (2003), p. 344. Figured (patterned) Byzantine silks of the 6th (and possibly 5th) centuries show overall designs of small motifs such as hearts, swastikas, palmettes and leaves worked in two weft colours. Later, recognizable plant motifs (such as lotus leaves and flowers) and human figures appear. Surviving textiles document a rich exchange of techniques and iconographic themes between Constantinople and the newly- Islamic textile centres of the Mediterranean and Central Asia in the years after the Muslim conquests of the 7th century. Designs of the 8th and 9th centuries show rows of roundels or medallions populated with pairs of human or animal figures reversed in mirror-image on a vertical axis.Wild, John Peter. \\"The later Roman and early Byzantine East, AD 300‚Äì1000.\\" In Jenkins (2003), p. 151 Many motifs echo Sassanian designs including the tree of life, winged horses, lions, and imaginary beasts, and there are numbers of surviving pieces where specialists cannot agree between a Byzantine or Islamic origin.Hoffman, p. 318 Fashionable patterns evoked the activities and interests of the royal court, such as hunting scenes or the quadriga (four-horse chariot). Woven textiles The Shroud of Charlemagne, a polychrome Byzantine silk with a pattern showing a quadriga, 9th century. Paris, mus√©e national du Moyen √Çge. Of the five basic weaves used in Byzantium and the Islamic weaving centers of the Mediterranean ‚Äì tabby, twill, damask, lampas and tapestry ‚Äì the most important product was the weft-faced compound twill called samite. The word is derived from Old French samit, from medieval Latin samitum, examitum deriving from the Byzantine Greek ·ºëŒæŒ¨ŒºŒπœÑŒøŒΩ hexamiton \\"six threads\\", usually interpreted as indicating the use of six yarns in the warp.Oxford English Dictionary Online \\"samite\\" (subscription required), accessed 30 December 2010Monnas (2008), p. 297. In samite, the main warp threads are hidden on both sides of the fabric by the ground and patterning wefts, with only the binding warps that hold the wefts in place visible.Muthesius, \\"Silk in the Medieval World\\", p. 343.Burnham (1980), p. 180. These rich silks ‚Äì literally worth their weight in gold ‚Äì were powerful political weapons of the Byzantine Empire between the 4th and 12th centuries. Diplomatic gifts of Byzantine silks cemented alliances with the Franks. Byzantium granted silk-trading concessions to the sea powers of Venice, Pisa, Genoa and Amalfi to secure naval and military aid for Byzantine territories.Muthesius, \\"Silk in the Medieval World\\", p. 326. > The influence exerted by Byzantine silk weaving was profound. Byzantine silk > court ritual and ecclesiastical practices were adopted by the Franks, just > as Byzantine court furnishing styles and dress codes were echoed across the > Islamic world. Byzantium developed elaborate silk court attire and set the > style for use of silk in civil and military uniforms and for rich religious > vestments.... These silks served as a form of portable wealth that could be > profitably disposed of in times of need.Muthesius, \\"Silk in the Medieval > World\\", p. 327. Silks survive in Western Europe from the graves of important figures, used in book bindings, and also reliquaries. But it is clear they had a number of uses as hangings and drapes in churches and the houses of the wealthy, as well as for clothing and vestments. The sources rarely mention the specific origin of silks, but sometimes describe the designs in enough detail to allow an identification as Byzantine.Dodwell, 130 Anglo-Saxon England had silks from at least the late 7th century, brought back from Rome by Benedict Biscop and others.Dodwell, 129-130 They were an essential, and easily carried, purchase for well-off pilgrims to Rome or the Holy Land (where Syrian or Egyptian silk might also be bought), and were available in England from English traders who certainly had bases in Rome and Pavia, and probably also bought from Scandinavian traders using the Baltic route. A unique special arrangement had to be made whereby the English crown paid directly a sum to Pavia in lieu of the customs duty on silk, which the Pavians found too difficult or dangerous to collect from English merchants. Diplomatic gifts also cascaded down from the Imperial court in Constantinople, with the rulers who received them passing many on to other rulers, and churches both in and outside their territory. Charlemagne gave not only King Offa of Mercia silks, but also the dioceses of Mercia and Northumbria.Dodwell, 150-157 Tapestry and embroidery The \\"Bamberger Gunthertuch\\", an embroidered imperial hanging depicting the return of John Tzimiskes from a successful campaign of about 970. In addition to woven dress and furnishing fabrics, Byzantine workshops were also known for woven tapestries and richly embroidered textiles with decoration that often included figurative scenes. The most impressive example to survive is the 10th century \\"Bamberger Gunthertuch\\", a woven tapestryMuthesius, \\"Silk in the Medieval World\\", pp. 350-351. piece over two metres square, with a mounted emperor between two female personifications. Nearly a century after it was made it was acquired by the Bishop of Bamberg in Germany, on a pilgrimage to Constantinople. He died during the journey and it was used for his shroud. Embroidered religious scenes were also used for vestments and hangings, and the famous English Opus Anglicanum seems to have been heavily influenced by Byzantine embroidery.Dodwell, 166-169 This continued Late Antique trends, which among other evidence are known from finds in Egyptian cemeteries, and the complaint by Saint Asterius of Amasia in around 410 about his flock in northeastern Turkey, where he says the laity decorated their clothes with religious images: > ... they artfully produce, both for themselves and for their wives and > children, clothing beflowered and wrought with ten thousand objects....When, > therefore, they dress themselves and appear in public, they look like > pictured walls in the eyes of those that meet them. And perhaps even the > children surround them, smiling to one another and pointing out with the > finger the picture on the garment; and walk along after them, following them > for a long time. On these garments are lions and leopards; bears and bulls > and dogs; woods and rocks and hunters ... You may see the wedding of > Galilee, and the water-pots; the paralytic carrying his bed on his > shoulders; the blind man being healed with the clay; the woman with the > bloody issue, taking hold of the border of the garment; the sinful woman > falling at the feet of Jesus; Lazarus returning to life from the grave. In > doing this they consider that they are acting piously and are clad in > garments pleasing to God. But if they take my advice let them sell those > clothes and honour the living image of God. Do not picture Christ on your > garments. It is enough that he once suffered the humiliation of dwelling in > a human body which of his own accord he assumed for our sakes. So, not upon > your robes but upon your soul carry about his image.Oration I; Online > translation from earlychristianwritings.com. The Egyptian panels are > normally in wool, cotton or linen; they are embroidered, but some at least > of the Amasian examples seem to be woven tapestry, of which very few > examples survive from the 1st millennium. The Egyptian cemetery examples are usually in less fine textiles than silk, and are typically roundels or other simple shapes with a border and a scene inside. This style of design seems not dissimilar to mentions and the few survivals of religious embroidery from the West many centuries later. Some Western embroidery was imported, other pieces no doubt done locally on imported silk, though other materials were used. The only survival of such work on the largest scale, the enormous Bayeux Tapestry (incomplete at 0.5 by 68.38 metres or 1.6 by 224.3 ft) is wool embroidered on a plain linen background, and not technically a tapestry at all.

The 6th century wool and linen Hestia Tapestry is perhaps the only large Byzantine woven tapestry to survive from before 1000. Decline In 1147, during the Second Crusade, Roger II of Sicily (1095‚Äì1154) attacked Corinth and Thebes, two important centres of Byzantine silk production, capturing the weavers and their equipment and establishing his own silkworks in Palermo and Calabria.Muthesius, \\"Silk in the Medieval World\\", p. 331. After the capture of Constantinople in 1204 by the forces of the Fourth Crusade (1202‚Äì1204) and the establishment of the Latin Empire (1204‚Äì1261) and other \\"Latin\\" states in the Byzantine territories, the Byzantine silk industry contracted, supplying only the domestic luxury market, and leadership in European silk-weaving and design passed to Sicily and the emerging Italian centres of Lucca and Venice.

It is her debut novel and is about a woman who withdraws from society and has near-death experiences in which she enters a dark room where she is tormented by people she had previously slighted. It was first published as a paperback original and e-book in the United Kingdom and Australia in July 2009 by Angry Robot, an offshoot of HarperCollins, and in the United States by Angry Robot in September 2010. In general Slights was well received by critics, and went on to win the 2009 Australian Shadows Award for Best Long Fiction, and the 2010 Australian Ditmar Award for Best Novel. Plot Slights is a first-person narrative by a troubled woman, Stevie, who lost her father when she was nine, and her mother when she was 18. Her father, a police officer, was killed during a mysterious shooting incident on the job, and her mother died when Stevie crashed their car while driving recklessly. The accident left Stevie badly injured and she had a near-death experience in which she found herself in a dark room filled with angry people threatening her. Usually nothing frightened Stevie, but that room terrified her, and she was relieved when she was revived in hospital. From an early age Stevie was anti-social and soon earned herself a bad reputation. After her mother's death she had the house to herself and began digging in the backyard, an activity her father had often indulged in. She stopped cleaning the house, and herself, and berated and abused most people she encountered. Her indifference to herself and others led to a suicide attempt when she was 21. She returned to that dark room filled with angry people clawing and tearing at her, and she was very grateful when someone found her unconscious and took her to hospital. While the room frightened her, she was intrigued by it and realised that the people in it were those she had slighted at some point in her life. She wanted to find out what other people's rooms were like and took a job at a local hospice to be close to people near death, but was frustrated when she could not get the information she wanted. Then she resorted to picking up strangers and bringing them home. She would get them drunk or drug them, and start killing them, but revive them as they lost consciousness so she could interrogate them. She never got much out of them and they all died. She buried the bodies in the backyard amongst her father's secrets. Stevie's backyard excavations had uncovered toys and trinkets from her childhood, but also objects she had never seen before, and bones. Indifferent to life and her fascination with death led to several more suicide attempts and trips to her dark room. Each time Stevie was discovered and revived. But when she was 35 she hung herself and no one found her in time to save her. She had learnt that her father had been under investigation for the deaths of several people, and with the reported disappearances of those she had murdered, it was only a matter of time before the police arrived at her house. For a very long time she lay in her dark room and endured the biting and scratching of those she had slighted. Then suddenly her tormentors were finished with her and left the room, and after a while Stevie heard her mother and father's voices and she began to rise along a \\"golden path\\". Background Kaaron Warren, 2007 Kaaron Warren is an Australian born author currently living in Fiji. She began her literary career writing short stories, and won several awards, including the Australian Ditmar and Aurealis Awards. Her short story collection, The Grinding House won the 2006 ACT Writing and Publishing Awards. Her first published story, \\"White Bed\\" was later dramatised for the stage, and the short film, Patience was based on her story, \\"A Positive\\". Warren began Slights as a short story, but as the main character Stevie developed, she found herself writing a \\"far deeper story\\" than she had intended, and it grew into her first novel. Stevie was originally male (Steve) but Warren made him female when she realised she could make the character more believable as a woman. Warren said that she wanted to convey the possibility that each person creates their \\"own version of hell\\". As a child she had seen pictures of different hells, depending on your sin, in a Hare Krishna text book, and these images had remained with her ever since. While working on Slights, she also wrote \\"The Speaker of Heaven\\", a short story about different versions of heaven. Reception Martin Livings of the Australian Horror Writers Association wrote in his Long Fiction Report for the 2009 Australian Shadows Award that Slights is \\"an extraordinary achievement\\". He described the book as \\"an intimate portrait of an awful person\\", who after a broken childhood, never grows up and is unable to have meaningful relationships with others. Livings said it is \\"a punch in the face, a kick in the testicles\\" and will remain with you for a \\"long, long time\\". Publishers Weekly selected Slights as its \\"Pick of the Week\\" in August 2009, and said that Warren \\"manipulates Stevie‚Äôs voice to create a portrait of horror that in no way reads like a first novel\\". Ariel Berg wrote in the San Francisco Book Review that while Stevie is an \\"antisocial ... sociopath\\" who is \\"virtually impossible to like\\", Warren does instil some sympathy for her protagonist by suggesting that Stevie cannot control or understand her actions. Berg felt that the book's plot is a little thin and that Stevie‚Äôs misfortunes tend to become repetitive, but added her ramblings do \\"crawl under your skin\\". Slights won the 2009 Australian Shadows Award for Best Long Fiction, and the 2010 Australian Ditmar Award for Best Novel.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council between 1858 and 1880. He was also a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for four months in 1856. Early life Russell was the son of Bourn Russell senior, a merchant sea captain, and Hannah Chandler. His father was killed at sea when Bourn was a boy. He received an elementary education at the Rye Free Grammar School and was apprenticed to sea in the coal trade at age 15. He was 2nd mate on a vessel trading to the Mediterranean when he was pressed into service on a British naval warship during the Napoleonic Wars. On discharge from the navy he resumed his career as a merchant mariner and was soon a master of sailing vessels. On turning 21 years of age he inherited his father's estate, that included the family home. This he sold and used the money to become part owner of the ship Lady Rowena (352 tons) built at Montreal in 1825.. In Australia =Master mariner= Lady Rowena was serving as a convict transport under the command of Russell when she reached Sydney in May 1826. It was noted in the press the 100 female convicts aboard were landed in good health. Lady Rowena returned to Britain and again sailed to Australia, this time on a trading voyage, arriving Hobart in November 1828. Captain Russell came to Australia again on the same ship, arriving Sydney with a general cargo in August 1830, this time intending to stay. He commanded the Lady Rowena on two deep-sea whaling voyages from Sydney between 1830 and 1835. Among the crewmen aboard were two of his sons, William and Bourn junior, serving as apprentice seamen. During these voyages he surveyed the Solomon Islands and in 1835 he published the result in an early map of that group of islands. In March 1831, Captain Russell and his crew landed on the coast of Japan, possibly the first Australians to do so. =Businessman= Russell had established his family in New South Wales by 1834 and in the early 1840s he developed pastoral interests and settled in Maitland where he became a storekeeper. He was bankrupted in the recession of the late 1840s but restored his fortunes by establishing a boiling-down works near Maitland to produce tallow for export to Britain. By 1855 he was chairman of the Hunter River New Steam Navigation Company. He and his wife had 5 sons and 2 daughters. His fourth son, Henry Russell, became the New South Wales government astronomer. =Parliamentarian= Russell was elected as the member for Northumberland Boroughs at the first election held in New South Wales under responsible government. He was the second candidate, after George Nichols, to be elected for the two member seat and he defeated the next candidate, Elias Weekes, by 8 votes. However the election was contested on the grounds that more than 20 people who were unqualified to vote had voted for Russell. After investigating this claim, the Legislative Assembly's Committee of Elections and Qualifications overturned the result and awarded the seat to Weekes in a re- count. Russell was unsuccessful in an attempt to regain the seat at the 1857 by-election caused by the death of Nichols. Following this defeat he accepted an appointment to the Legislative Council initially for a fixed term expiring in 1861 and then as a life member. He did not hold a ministerial or parliamentary position. He died in Sydney on 4 July 1880 and is buried in Rookwood Cemetery.

While bi-Lipschitz maps shrink or expand the diameter of a set by no more than a multiplicative factor, quasisymmetric maps satisfy the weaker geometric property that they preserve the relative sizes of sets: if two sets A and B have diameters t and are no more than distance t apart, then the ratio of their sizes changes by no more than a multiplicative constant. These maps are also related to quasiconformal maps, since in many circumstances they are in fact equivalent. Definition Let (X, dX) and (Y, dY) be two metric spaces. A homeomorphism f:X ‚Üí Y is said to be Œ∑-quasisymmetric if there is an increasing function Œ∑ : [0, ‚àû) ‚Üí [0, ‚àû) such that for any triple x, y, z of distinct points in X, we have : frac{d_Y(f(x),f(y))}{d_{Y}(f(x),f(z))} leq etaleft(frac{d_X(x,y)}{d_X(x,z)}right). Basic properties ; Inverses are quasisymmetric : If f : X ‚Üí Y is an invertible Œ∑-quasisymmetric map as above, then its inverse map is eta'-quasisymmetric, where eta'(t) = 1/Œ∑‚àí1(1/t). ; Quasisymmetric maps preserve relative sizes of sets : If A and B are subsets of X and A is a subset of B, then :: frac{1}{2eta(frac{text{diam }A}{text{diam }B})}leq frac{text{diam }f(B)}{text{diam }f(A)}leq etaleft(frac{2text{diam }B}{text{diam }A}right). Examples =Weakly quasisymmetric maps= A map f:X‚ÜíY is said to be H-weakly-quasisymmetric for some H > 0 if for all triples of distinct points x,y,z in X, we have : f(x)-f(y)leq Hf(x)-f(z);;;text{ whenever };;; x-yleq x-z Not all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. However, if X is connected and X and Y are doubling, then all weakly quasisymmetric maps are quasisymmetric. The appeal of this result is that proving weak-quasisymmetry is much easier than proving quasisymmetry directly, and in many natural settings the two notions are equivalent. =Œ¥-monotone maps= A monotone map f:H ‚Üí H on a Hilbert space H is Œ¥-monotone if for all x and y in H, : langle f(x)-f(y),x-yranglegeq delta f(x)-f(y)cdotx-y. To grasp what this condition means geometrically, suppose f(0) = 0 and consider the above estimate when y = 0. Then it implies that the angle between the vector x and its image f(x) stays between 0 and arccos Œ¥ < œÄ/2. These maps are quasisymmetric, although they are a much narrower subclass of quasisymmetric maps. For example, while a general quasisymmetric map in the complex plane could map the real line to a set of Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than one, a Œ¥-monotone will always map the real line to a rotated graph of a Lipschitz function L:‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù. Doubling measures =The real line= Quasisymmetric homeomorphisms of the real line to itself can be characterized in terms of their derivatives. An increasing homeomorphism f:‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù is quasisymmetric if and only if there is a constant C > 0 and a doubling measure Œº on the real line such that : f(x)=C+int_0^x , dmu(t). =Euclidean space= An analogous result holds in Euclidean space. Suppose C = 0 and we rewrite the above equation for f as : f(x) = frac{1}{2}int_{mathbb{R}}left(frac{x-t}{x-t}+frac{t}{t}right)dmu(t). Writing it this way, we can attempt to define a map using this same integral, but instead integrate (what is now a vector valued integrand) over ‚Ñùn: if Œº is a doubling measure on ‚Ñùn and : int_{x>1}frac{1}{x},dmu(x)<infty then the map : f(x) = frac{1}{2}int_{mathbb{R}^{n}}left(frac{x-y}{x-y}+frac{y}{y}right),dmu(y) is quasisymmetric (in fact, it is Œ¥-monotone for some Œ¥ depending on the measure Œº). Quasisymmetry and quasiconformality in Euclidean space Let Œ© and Œ©¬¥ be open subsets of ‚Ñùn. If f : Œ© ‚Üí Œ©¬¥ is Œ∑-quasisymmetric, then it is also K-quasiconformal, where K > 0 is a constant depending on Œ∑. Conversely, if f : Œ© ‚Üí Œ©¬¥ is K-quasiconformal and B(x, 2r) is contained in Œ©, then f is Œ∑-quasisymmetric on B(x, r), where Œ∑ depends only on K.

The paper was edited by Felipe del Pan and published by Ram√≠rez y Compa√±√≠a, whose headquarters were in Intramuros, Manila, and its business and editorial offices in Binondo. History The first daily of Manila, La Esperanza, had been founded on December 1, 1846. Diario de Manila raised as a competitor just a couple of years later, during a time when a great number of native newspapers written in Spanish came into existence in the Philippines, Notable contributors Isabelo de los Reyes, a prominent Filipino politician, writer and labor activist in the 19th and 20th centuries, who was the founder of the Aglipayan Church, worked as a journalist and wrote several articles for the newspaper, such as the ‚ÄúInvasi√≥n de Limahong‚Äù, which appeared in the Diario de Manila in November 1882. He eventually became the associate editor of the Diario. Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau, a Spanish diplomat and writer, author of plays, operas and novels, wrote for the Diario de Manila while serving as consul in Hong Kong. Baltasar Giraudier, a famous French-Filipino artist and writer who published his work in both the Diario de Manila and in the Ilustraci√≥n Filipina, accompanied Governor-General Malcampo to Jolo during an organized military expedition that took place in February 1876 against Muslim pirates who had been receiving a substantial amount of arms and ammunition during the previous years. Governor-General Malcampo commissioned Giraudier to illustrate the landscape of the island together with its people, customs and architecture. The resulting drawings are considered to be among the best lithographic illustrations of the Islands. An article published in Diario de Manila by the Jesuit Father Jaime Nonell, which described observations of the typhoon of September 1865 done by Father Francisco Colina, prompted the establishment of the Observatorio Meteorol√≥gico del Ateneo Municipal de Manila. Camilo Mill√°n y Villanueva, former governor of several provinces in the Archipelago and government adviser, raised the issue of the reforms for the Philippines in an article published in 1897 titled \\"El gran problema de las reformas en Filipinas\\". Katipunan connection The facsimile Kalayaan. In 1894 Emilio Jacinto started editing Kalayaan (Freedom), the Katipunan's official publication, thanks to the printing press of the Diario de Manila, and using typefaces stolen from the printing room by Filipino employees who were also members of the Katipunan. They conducted their activities under the unsuspecting eyes of the Spanish management, who were mostly active members of the Spanish colonial reserve forces. Most of their secret activities took place during the two-and-a-half hour lunch breaks when the Spanish personnel took their meals and their siesta. On August 19, 1896, Teodoro Pati√±o, who was on strong disagreement with press foreman and Katipunan member, Apolonio de la Cruz, over a salary increase and claimed he was also being made responsible for the loss of the printing supplies that were used for the printing of Kalayaan, told the entire story to his sister Honoria, who was then living with nuns in a Mandaluyong orphanage. Honoria was deeply disturbed by her brother's revelation and decided to inform the orphanage‚Äôs Mother Superior, Sister Teresa de Jes√∫s, about the existence of the secret society. Sister Teresa in turn sought the advice of Father Mariano Gil, the parish priest of Tondo, who accompanied by several Guardia Civil immediately searched the premises of Diario de Manila and found evidence of the Katipunan‚Äôs existence. They quickly informed the Governor-General Blanco, who padlocked the printing press and arrested de la Cruz, who was found in possession of a dagger used in Katipunan initiation rites, and dozens of other suspected Katipunan members. De la Cruz was later executed on February 6, 1897 in Bagumbayan.

He lost to Justin I.  Sources  Theocritus is an obscure individual, primarily mentioned by two authors: John Malalas and Marcellinus Comes. The former mentions him as a domestikos (Greek: Œ¥ŒøŒºŒ≠œÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ; a civil, ecclesiastic or military officer). The latter mentions him as the satelles (Latin: \\"attendant\\" or \\"guard\\") of Amantius.Bury (1923), Chapter XV.1 and notesOnline Etymology Dictionary: Satellite: \\"Latin: satellitem (nom. satelles) attendant\\" He is also mentioned in the accounts of Zacharias Rhetor, Evagrius Scholasticus, Jordanes, the Chronicon Paschale, Theophanes the Confessor and Joannes Zonaras. Both Malalas and the Chronicon mention him by the title of comes, making it likely that his full title was \\"comes domesticorum\\". Procopius does not mention him by name, but a passage of his sheds some light on the circumstances of his death.Martindale (1980), p. 1065  Candidate for the throne  When Anastasius I (r. 491-518) died childless, without designating an heir, and without a reigning Augusta to supervise the election of a successor, the throne was up for grabs. According to Malalas, the powerful praepositus sacri cubiculi Amantius had intended to elect a comes domesticorum, commander of an elite guard unit of the late Roman Empire, by the name of Theocritus to the throne.Rodolphe Guilland, \\"Eunuchs in the Byzantine Empire\\" Amantius hoped to secure the election for Theocritus by bribing Justin, the comes excubitorum (head of the imperial guards). Justin was supposed to share the money with his troops. The events of the election were described in detail by Peter the Patrician, extracts of whose work survive in the 10th-century De Ceremoniis. On the morning of the election the Excubitors at first put forward the tribune John as a candidate. He was raised on the shield in the Hippodrome of Constantinople. But the Blues, an influential chariot racing faction, rioted against this candidate. The guardsmen of the Scholae Palatinae then attempted to proclaim their own candidate, but the Excubitors almost killed that unnamed man. The Excubitors then allegedly put forward Justinian, nephew of Justin, as their second candidate for the day, but he refused the crown. The Byzantine Senate supposedly settled the matter by electing Justin himself. Evagrius Scholasticus and Zacharias Rhetor imply that Justin was working in his own interest alone. John Bagnell Bury concludes that Justin used the money to buy support for himself. Bury believed that Justin also orchestrated many of the events of that day. Justin and his supporters knew \\"that he could not count on the support of the Scholarians, and, if he were proclaimed by his own troops alone, the success of his cause would be doubtful. The problem therefore was to manage that the initiation should proceed from the Senate, whose authority, supported by the excubitors, would rally general consent and overpower the resistance of the Scholarian guards. It was therefore arranged that the Excubitors should propose candidates who had no chance of being chosen, with the design of working on the fears of the Senate. Justin's friends in the Senate could argue with force: \\"Hasten to agree, or you will be forestalled, and some wholly unsuitable person will be thrust upon us. But you must choose one who will be acceptable to the Excubitors. Justin fulfills this condition. He may not be an ideal candidate for the throne, but he is old and moderate.\\" But, however the affair may have been managed by the wirepullers, Justin ascended the throne with the prestige of having been regularly nominated by the Senate, and he could announce to the Pope that \\"We have been elected to the Empire by the favour of the indivisible Trinity, by the choice of the highest ministers of the sacred Palace, and of the Senate, and finally by the election of the army.\\"  Death  Both Amantius and Theocritus were soon executed on a pretext. They were obviously eliminated by Justin for their role in the conspiracy. Procopius briefly mentions: \\"Indeed, his power [Justin's] was not ten days old, before he slew Amantius, chief of the palace eunuchs, and several others, on no graver charge than that Amantius had made some rash remark about John, Archbishop of the city. After this, he was the most feared of men.\\"Procopius of Caesarea, The Secret History, chapter 6. 1927 translation by Richard Atwater. Based on the account of Marcellinus, Amantius and his supporters were accused of being adherents of Manichaeism. A combination of sources imply that Amantius and Theocritus had attempted to overthrow Justin, following his election. If so, they were met with swift executions.

Although the desktop metaphor revolutionized user interfaces, there is evidence that a spatial layout alone does little to help in locating files and other data; distinguishable appearance is also required. Studies have shown that average users have considerable difficulty finding files on their personal computers, even ones that they created the same day. Search engines do not always help, since it has been found that users often know of the existence of a file without being able to specify relevant search terms. On the contrary, people appear to incrementally search for files using some form of context. Recently researchers and web developers have argued that the problem is the lack of distinguishable appearance: in the traditional computer interface most objects and locations appear identical. This problem rarely occurs in the real world, where both objects and locations generally have easily distinguishable appearance. Discriminability was one of the recommendations in the ISO 9241-12 recommendation on presentation of information on visual displays (part of the overall report on Ergonomics of Human System Interaction), however it was assumed in that report that this would be achieved by manual design of graphical symbols. VisualIDs, semanticons, and identicons The mass availability of computer graphics supported the introduction of approaches that make better use of the brain's \\"visual hardware\\", by providing individual files and other abstract data with distinguishable appearance. This idea initially appeared in strictly academic VisualIDs and Semanticons works, but the web community has explored and rapidly adopted similar ideas, such as the Identicon. The VisualIDs project automatically generated icons for files or other data based on a hash of the data identifier, so the icons had no relation to the content or meaning of the data. It was argued not only that generating meaningful icons is unnecessary (their user study showed rapid learning of the arbitrary icons), but also that basing icons on content is actually incorrect (\\"contrasting visualization with visual identifiers\\"). The Semanticons project developed by Setlur et al. demonstrated an algorithm to create icons that reflect the content of files. In this work the name, location and content of a file are parsed and used to retrieve related image(s) from an image database. These are then processed using a Non- photorealistic rendering technique in order to generate graphical icons. Developer Don Park introduced the identicon library for making a visual icon from a hash of a data identifier. This initial public implementation has spawned a large number of implementations for various environments. In particular, identicons are now being used as default visual user identifiers (avatars) for several widely used systems. They are also used as a complement to Gravatars, which are pre-existing avatar images created or chosen by users, instead of automatically generated images. (see #External links). Current research While current web practice has followed the semantics-free approach of VisualIDs, recent research has followed the semantics-based approach of Semanticons. Examples include using data mining principles to automatically create \\"intelligent icons\\" that reflect the contents of files and creating icons for music files that reflect audio characteristics or affective content.

In 1992 it provided low-quality piped water at very low pressure (0.2 bar) for only 10 hours per day to only 20% of the city's residents. Non-revenue water was extremely high at 72% due to illegal connections, manipulation of bills and physical leakage. Tariffs were extremely low, there was no metering and less than half of the amounts billed were collected. Staff were underpaid and demoralized. The utility then underwent a dramatic turnaround‚Äîstaff engaged in corrupt activities were fired, bill payment was enforced, illegal connections were regularized, metering was introduced and the utility gained autonomy from the municipality in financial and personnel matters. In the next fourteen years the customer base multiplied by nine reaching over 90% of residents, service quality improved from intermittent to continuous supply of safe drinking water at good pressure of 2 bar, and non-revenue water was cut to only 6%. Tariffs were increased and the utility went from being bankrupt to making a modest profit. It now has motivated, well-paid staff. According to one observer, in 2012 its \\"public image is excellent\\". The key to its success laid in \\"leadership, professionalism, integrity (and) commitment\\" as well as \\"community participation and information sharing (...), good governance, transparency and accountability\\". Significant financial support from external donors, initially through grants and then through soft loans, also was essential in making the turnaround possible. PPWSA's achievements were recognized through international awards, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service in 2006 and the Stockholm Industry Water Award in 2010.

Climate and water resources Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, is located on the Mekong River. The flow of the Mekong River during the dry season depends heavily on the Tonl√© Sap Lake located about 100 km to the northwest of the city. The lake stores water during the wet season and releases it during the dry season, acting as an important buffer. The Tonl√© Sap River between Phnom Penh and the lake reverses its flow twice a year, first filling and then draining the lake. Surface water is the main source of drinking water, complemented by groundwater. Surface water is abstracted from the Mekong River, the Tonle Sap and the Bassac River. It is treated in three treatment plants: Phum Prek with a capacity of 150,000 m3/day, Cham Car Morn (20,000 m3/day) and Chruoy Chang War (150,000 m3/day).Ek Sonn Chan, Michel Vermersch and Patrick Vaughan, \\"Water supply in Phnom Penh: from devastation to sector leadership\\", Water Utility Management International, Volume 7 Issue 3, September 2012.

Starved of investment, by 1990 the PPWSA was virtually dysfunctional.Biswas, Asit K. and Tortajada, Cecilia,\\"Water Supply of Phnom Penh: An Example of Good Governance\\", International Journal of Water Resources Development, June 2010, 26:2, pp. 163‚Äì168 The consequences were severe. Unaccounted for water (UFW) exceeded 80% in Phnom Penh. Almost a third of all hospitalizations were linked to water-related diseases, diarrheal diseases were endemic and Cambodia had one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. Only 20‚Äì25% of the population were served by piped water and even those received water only 10 hours per day; the workers were underpaid, demoralized and corrupt, helping customers get illegal connections and avoid paying bills; and, due to this state of affairs, combined with very low tariffs and overstaffing, not even a fraction of operating costs were recovered from water users making the utility effectively bankrupt.Asian Development Bank:\\"Country Water Action: Cambodia Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority: An Exemplary Water Utility in Asia\\", August 2007, [Accessed: 20/12/2010] = The turnaround 1993‚Äì2006 = A landmark election brought peace to Cambodia in 1993. External donors started to engage in the country, providing funding for public investments. The newly appointed General Director of the PPWSA, Ek Sonn Chan, began by firing corrupt and incompetent staff, apparently at great personal risk. He said about PPWSA when he took over that ‚ÄúIt was bureaucratic and it was full of incompetent staffers. I fired many staff and my friends told me that I would be assassinated‚Äù.Puy Kea, \\"Assassination Threats Couldn‚Äôt Stop Cambodian Official in Providing Safe Drinking Water To The Poor\\", MaximsNews Network, October 10, 2007. The remaining staff was encouraged to provide information about illegal connections and received incentive payments. Promotions were based on merit. This created a culture of loyalty and pride among water management employees. Then the utility began a campaign to convince customers that they had to pay their bills if they wanted quality service and slapped heavy fines on illegal connections. Ek Son Chan was even threatened with a gun by an army officer when he tried to cut off the water supply. PPSWA also introduced a computerized billing system and exclusive payment in the offices of the utility, which reduced the opportunities for small-scale corruption under the previous systems had been issued manually and bills had been collected by bill collectors. Furthermore, meters were installed on all connections and a customer database and information system were developed, which became operational in 1994. Full metering was achieved in 1997 and tariffs were restructured and increased in the same year. In 1996 PPWSA was established by decree as an autonomous public utility with its own separate finances, as opposed to being a department of the municipality as it had been the case previously. The utility's seven-member board comprises the General Director, representatives of the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (chair), the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Interior, Phnom Penh‚Äôs municipal government and PPWSA employees.Asian Development Bank, \\"Country Water Action: Cambodia Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority. Internal Reforms Fuel Performance Upgrade\\", September 2008 Its newly gained autonomy allowed the utility to retain any revenues in excess of operating costs to improve services. It also allowed it to recruit its own staff, which had not been possible previously when it had been part of the municipality. One observers called this \\"perhaps the most important factor in PPWSA's turnaround\\". After old pipes had been replaced in the city center, the network was expanded to increase access. Pipes were laid following state-of-the-art techniques in order to ensure that leakage from the new pipes would be low. The utility also provided house connections to slum residents, which previously paid about five times more than the water tariff because they depended on \\"community representatives\\" who actually abused their power and resold water at higher than authorized prices. Initially, even slum residents had to pay full connections fees, but in 1999 payment in installments was allowed and in 2004‚Äì2006 subsidized connection fees were gradually introduced. By 2006 all performance indicators had been substantially improved, in essence completing the turnaround of the utility. = Initial Public Offering (2012) = On April 18, 2012, PPWSA became the first domestically listed company on the Cambodia Securities Exchange.

Shortly afterwards Ek Sonn Chan was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Water at the Cambodian Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy.  Results  Landscape of Phnom Penh. The share of the population with access to piped water supply increased from 25% in 1993 to 92% in 2010. =Increased access= The number of customers increased more than fivefold, leading to an increase in the served population from 25% (1993) to 92% (2010). The capacity of the distribution network was increased from 65,000 m3/day to 320,000 m3/day in 2012. Water vendors which charged up to five times more for water than what consumers pay to the utility now have all but disappeared from the PPWSA service area. =Improved water quality= Drinking water quality has improved and the director says he is drinking the tap water without boiling and challenged his customers: ‚ÄúIf you get stomachache after drinking the tap water, I will pay you compensation‚Äù. =Reaching the poorest= PPWSA established a revolving fund to finance domestic connections to help the poorest connect to the network. The utility serves more than 27,000 families (14% of all customers) in more than 123 urban poor communities at subsidized tariffs and connection fees, which can be paid in installments. Poor households are entitled to receive subsidies of 30%, 50%, 70% or 100% of the connection fee, depending upon their financial conditions. These conditions are jointly evaluated by a committee of the utility and local communities, with results being published. This approach to reach the poor was found after several years of experimentation with unsuccessful approaches. For example, the reselling of water to the poor through \\"community representatives\\", an approach that works well in Manila, Philippines, had failed in Phnom Penh because the \\"community representatives\\" resold water at much higher prices than agreed. =Engaging with communities= The utility developed a close relationship with its customers. For example, it provided incentives to members of the public who reported illegal connections and it has set up an effective system to register and resolve complaints. This, together with the fight against small-scale corruption and improvements in service quality, helped to gain public acceptance for tariff increases. =Improved finances= Meters were installed for all water connections, the billing system was computerized and non-payment penalties were introduced. As a result, collection efficiency for residential customers increased from 48% to 99.9%. Tariffs were increased in 1994, 1997 and 2001, every time with the required approval of the Prime Minister. In 1995 the utility began to make small profits, which increased substantially after 2000. Is operating revenue for the 2008 financial year was $21.9 million, out of which it made a profit of $7.3 million on which it paid corporate income tax.Binayak Das, Ek Sonn Chan, Chea Visoth, Ganesh Pangare, and Robin Simpson:\\"Sharing the Reform Process: Learning from the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA)\\", International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority, 2010, pp. 18-20, retrieved on April 10, 2011 In 1996 the utility had proposed a three-step tariff increase over seven years to reach the government's policy goal of full cost recovery. The third step proved to be unnecessary given the substantial efficiency improvements achieved by PPWSA. =Affordability= In 2013 the lowest block of the residential water tariff up to a consumption of 7m3 per month was 550 Cambodian riel ($0.13) per m3, followed by a second block up to 15m3 at 770 Riel ($0.19) per m3. A typical residential water bill is US$ 3-5 per month, around 1 percent of the average income. Tariffs in Phnom Penh are much lower than in some other Southeast Asian cities such as East Manila ($0.33/m3 in 2008), Kuala Lumpur ($0.45/m3 in 2007) or Jakarta ($0.70/m3 in 2005). This can in part be explained by the proximity of Phnom Penh to the abundant water resource of the Mekong River, but mainly by the efficiency of the utility's operations. =Improved efficiency= Non-revenue water, an indicator of operational efficiency, was reduced from 72% in 1996 to 6% in 2010. The number of staff per 1,000 connections was reduced from 22 to 3 in 2010, indicating substantially increased labor productivity. Since the number of connections increased more than fivefold, the actual number of staff remained about the same, while they were much more productively employed. =Motivated and qualified staff= Staff salaries increased substantially during the reform process. For example, a staff member at a managerial position who was paid $20 in 1993 received $200 in 2008. Profits are shared with employees. The utility has created a retirement system for its employees which is the first of its kind in Cambodia. It evaluates its employees four times a year and can provide financial incentives as well as disciplinary actions such as delays in salary increases or even salary deductions. The utility also provides substantial training, followed by exams.Binayak Das, Ek Sonn Chan, Chea Visoth, Ganesh Pangare, and Robin Simpson:\\"Sharing the Reform Process ‚Äì Learning from the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA)\\", International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority, 2010, pp. 26‚Äì28, retrieved on April 10, 2011 External cooperation External cooperation played a major role in bringing about the turnaround of the Phnom Penh water utility. During the first years the utility relied on grants, while after its financial situation improved and it became an administratively and financially separate entity it also took up loans. Japan ($85 million in grants), France ($21 million in grants and $14 million in loans), the World Bank ($29 million in loans), the Asian Development Bank ($13 million in loans) and UNEP provided financial and technical assistance to PPWSA. The external financial assistance totalled approximately $165 million between 1993 and 2009.French Development Agency:\\"Le Secteur de l‚Äôeau au Cambodge: Enjeux et Enseignements\\", retrieved on April 10, 2011 PPWSA also established twinning arrangements between two Australian water utilities and PPWSA.World Bank:Cambodia:Rehabilitating the Urban Water Sector, ca. 2006 Finally, PPWSA has worked continuously with the French engineering company SAFEGE for more than twenty years.

In 2010 Cambodia was ranked 154th out of 178 countries in the world in terms of corruption perception in a ranking published by Transparency International, indicating a very high level of perceived corruption (see Corruption Perceptions Index). Hun Sen, the current Prime Minister and strong man of Cambodia since 1985, and other senior officials in the Cambodian government have been accused by Global Witness and others of being involved in large-scale corruption.\\"Cambodia, a country for sale\\", The Guardian, 26 April 2008Global Witness, \\"Country for Sale ‚Äì Welcome to Cambodia\\" , February 2009 At the same time, PPWSA's efforts to combat small-scale corruption have been well recognized. It thus seems that large- scale corruption at the highest political level and eradicating small-scale corruption at the utility level can coexist. Ek Son Chan, General Director of PPWSA, has thanked Prime Minister Hun Sen for his support in achieving the turnaround of the utility by calling on customers to pay their bills, approving tariff increases and not interfering in managerial decisions.Asian Development Bank, \\"Water Champion: Ek Sonn Chan: Pulling the Plug on Nonrevenue Water\\", October 2006 Role of public and private sector.
